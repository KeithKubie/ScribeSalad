00:00:03.416 --> 00:00:06.070
- Hi, I'd like to welcome
you to the Radcliffe

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.930
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.030
My name is Alyssa
Goodman, and I am

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.520
both a professor in the
astronomy department

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.490
and also one of the
co-directors here for science.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.360
And I have had the
privilege of inviting

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.030
a number of young scholars
to come here to Harvard.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.780
Young researchers to
come here to Harvard

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.350
to talk about a field that
I think many of you know

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.750
is extremely popular these days.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.630
And that field has come to
be known as data science.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.750
And I want to tell you that the
change in the world's attitudes

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.660
toward this kind of
work has changed so much

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.650
that about seven years
ago some friends of mine

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.050
and I were on the inaugural
version of something

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.100
at the National Academies that's
called the Board on Research

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.050
Data and Information.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.000
And in that board where we were
talking amongst librarians-- so

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.600
information scientists, computer
scientists, other scientists.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.010
And these are-- put it this way.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.410
I was the youngest person
on the committee, OK?

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.470
So just-- you got that picture?

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.510
So anyway.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.300
So among this group
of people, the words

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.940
data scientists came up
when people said, well,

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.640
what should we call
people who are dealing

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.490
with these mountains of
data and diverse data sets

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.740
and trying to learn new
things about the world,

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.210
but they're not exactly just
your usual straightforward

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.600
academic whose values are only
publishing tons of papers,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.260
but they really want to
share code and share data,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.330
and make it possible for other
people to learn from a data?

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.330
And somebody said, well, what
about just data scientist?

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.120
And most of the
people in the room

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.790
said, what's a data scientist?

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.640
That's not a thing.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.757
What is that?

00:01:50.757 --> 00:01:52.840
And I was sitting there
going, well, I don't know.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.800
I think that's a thing.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.290
I think that's-- I know a
lot of people who do that,

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.910
and I think maybe I do that.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.370
And you know, we
should have that.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.170
And that was literally
seven years ago,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.800
and now most members
of the public

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.320
have some idea what
a data scientist is.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.200
And that's because we
have so much information

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.380
available online and
through also private means,

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.385
but largely online.

00:02:19.385 --> 00:02:21.760
Whether you can get to it or
not is a different question.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.310
But anyway, the
kinds of questions

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.500
that people can ask
and legitimately answer

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.850
have completely changed
in just the lifetimes

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.636
of the young people
sitting in the front row.

00:02:33.636 --> 00:02:35.260
And so to just explain
a tiny bit more,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.610
the next in science program--

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.920
I believe was started
by John Hughes, right?

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.500
My predecessor in this role.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.870
And it used to become
the next in science,

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.040
and we added the next in
parentheses, data science just

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.912
for this year.

00:02:48.912 --> 00:02:50.620
And then we had this
tremendous challenge

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.540
because the idea
was to find people

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.525
who are early in their
careers, but who are already--

00:02:55.525 --> 00:02:58.640
I'm sorry to embarrass
you all, but superstars--

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.630
and bring them here to
Harvard and Radcliffe

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.550
so that you can hear
what they're doing

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.420
and learn about the future.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.610
And there are a lot
of these people.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.180
And so we had a
hard time choosing,

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.489
and so I hope that you very
much enjoy the four people who

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:14.530
we've brought here today.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.600
And so just to give
you a little preview.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.959
We're going to
have Jen Pan who's

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.500
coming to us from
Stanford, and she's

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.530
going to talk about
uncovering online censorship

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.510
and propaganda in China.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.570
And then we're going to
have Nathan Sanders who

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.420
once upon a time started out
his world here at Harvard

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.260
in astrophysics, but is now
at Legendary Entertainment

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.580
as a data scientist.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.850
And he'll talk about Hollywood
data science, the role

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.200
of inference and prediction.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.360
Those are words you haven't
heard before too often,

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.820
Hollywood influence prediction.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.049
And then after we
have a short break--

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.590
and I hope everybody will enjoy
that and then come right back

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.030
in--

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.500
we're going to have a talk from
Saki Takahashi who will take us

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.570
into the realm of epidemiology.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.220
And she's now a graduate
student at Princeton University.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.450
And then last, but
certainly not least,

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.230
we will explore
the wider universe

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.070
with my astrophysics
colleague, Rene [? Logic ?] who

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.940
will talk among other things
about how data are being

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.950
anticipated, and
then will be used

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.380
with projects that
are truly gigantic,

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.297
like the large synoptic
[INAUDIBLE] telescope.

00:04:22.297 --> 00:04:23.671
And if you ask
her nicely, she is

00:04:23.671 --> 00:04:26.200
going to show you an amazing
movie at the end of the day.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.610
So just remember that.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.250
Somebody ask her that
in the questions.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.920
So then, we're going to get
started with our first speaker,

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.330
and the format is that we're
going to ask each speaker--

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.455
they're going to talk about
15, 20 minutes and then

00:04:37.455 --> 00:04:39.490
you'll have 5, 10
at the outside,

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.710
minutes to ask questions
of just that person.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.504
So in the order that
I just mentioned.

00:04:43.504 --> 00:04:44.920
And then at the
end, there will be

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.470
a joint 20 minute
or so conversation

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.110
with of all four people.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.340
So the first person is
going to be Jen Pan,

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.200
and she currently
holds the title

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.180
of assistant professor
of communication

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.890
at Stanford University.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.860
She went to Stanford
from Harvard

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.200
where she got her PhD
here in the government

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.700
department working with
Gary King and other people.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.460
And before that she did get
her undergraduate degree

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.895
from Princeton, but then she
had an interesting time--

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:15.150
or maybe it was interesting, I
don't know, you can tell us--

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.080
as a consultant at McKinsey
in New York and Beijing.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.150
And so, I personally,
am very curious how

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.690
that ties into graduate
school and now professorship.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.760
And she's also worked
for the Chinese Center

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.140
for Diabetes Control and the
Clinton Foundation HIV/AIDS

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.190
Initiative.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.330
And she knows about how
authoritarian regimes

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.750
manipulate the techniques
of data science

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.680
to manipulate people, I
guess is what we could say.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.390
And I'm not going to
say more about what

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.030
she does because she's going
to say plenty more about what

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.476
she does [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:50.476 --> 00:05:56.624
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:56.624 --> 00:05:58.040
- Thank you so
much for having me.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.662
It's great to be here.

00:05:59.662 --> 00:06:01.120
Can everyone here
me from the back?

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.870
It's all good?

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.156
OK, awesome.

00:06:03.156 --> 00:06:05.530
So today I'm going to talk to
you about online censorship

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:06.670
and propaganda in China.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.830
When we think about
the Chinese government

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.750
and what it does to
control information,

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.870
this is a program that's
obviously designed to suppress,

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.350
to distort, to manipulate,
and to control information,

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.220
but paradoxically it could
actually reveal something to us

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.310
about the intentions and
goals of this opaque regime.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.740
When we collect
this data at scale,

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.710
and when we observe
this data at scale.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.574
And so this is where
data science comes in.

00:06:33.574 --> 00:06:35.740
And I feel like the term
data science-- sometimes we

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:36.430
use science.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.830
Sometimes they use computational
social science machine

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:39.730
learning.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.880
What we mean is using tools
that analyze large scale data,

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.090
or at least that's
what I'm talking about.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.460
The work I'm talking
to you about today

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.010
is a series from a
series of three papers.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.290
The first is the
observational study

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.330
of how the Chinese
government removes

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.170
content from social media.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.650
The second is an
experiment that establishes

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.550
a causal linkage between what
people post and what's removed.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:09.340
And the third is a paper that's
looking at online propaganda.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.850
And what I mean by that is
how the government fabricates

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.060
social media content as
if it were the opinions

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.880
of ordinary people.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.520
Starting with online
censorship, there

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.010
are rumors of as many as
200,000 workers in China working

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.250
for firms like Tencent,
Alibaba, [? Signa, ?]

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:35.470
whose whole jobs is to
censor and remove content.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.170
A lot of the work
is manual aided by--

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:39.470
aided by technology.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.650
But there is-- at least
the perception is--

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.920
or belief that there is a
human oversight into what

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.840
is or is not removed.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.180
And there are some
who think that maybe

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.210
China's efforts to censor
represents the largest

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.430
selective suppression of human
expression in recorded history.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.730
So that sounds really
big, but at the same time

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:01.360
we have more and more data
recorded about our lives

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.790
now than ever before.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.090
How we studied censorship
is we gathered millions

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.580
of social media posts the
instant they appeared,

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.770
so before the government
and the social media

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.350
sites could censor them, from
a lot of different social media

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:15.760
sites.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.160
And then we went back carefully
to each of these posts

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.960
later on to see if
it was censored,

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.210
and we did this in
an automated fashion.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.580
And censorship is very clear.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.470
You see these sorts
of messages that say,

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:27.970
sorry, the host you
were looking for

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.817
does not exist, has been deleted
or is being investigated.

00:08:30.817 --> 00:08:33.400
Or this is the good one, which
is like, the page you requested

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.770
is not here, but why don't
you go look at something else

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.780
instead.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.230
So we were clearly able
to detect censorship.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:45.370
And what we came across when we
looked at the previous research

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.890
on what we thought about
censorship in China

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:51.100
is that the belief was that
China would censor everything

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.250
that was bad for the
government, bad for the state,

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:55.090
bad for the regime.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:56.230
That could be criticism.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.200
That could be things about
protest or collective action.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.030
What we find is that
this is not the case.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:04.150
China censors something much
more narrow and specific,

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:07.990
which is just about censoring
to stop collective action.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:09.880
When I use the term
collective action,

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.670
I mean people getting
together in the real world

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.600
to do something.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.600
A lot of times
this is protesting

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.290
against the government, but
it doesn't always have to be.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.450
And at the same time,
while censorship

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.500
is focused on stopping
collective action,

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.050
there's a lot of criticism
that still flourishes online.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:31.700
When we talk about
social media in China,

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.470
as well as other places, we
usually talk about burstiness.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:40.360
So certain things will trend
at certain points in time.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.690
But what also is interesting
in the Chinese cases is

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.440
that censorship is also bursty.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.890
So in this plot, the x-axis
is a six-month time frame.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:51.610
The y-axis is a sample
of count of posts.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:54.220
So in the gray are
just number of posts

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.320
by day over the
six month period.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.277
And red are all the
posts that are deleted.

00:09:59.277 --> 00:10:01.110
And what you can see
is that everything here

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.070
is about a city
in southern China

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.870
called, [INAUDIBLE]
known for its lichees

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.460
and textile manufacturing.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:10.240
In June of this particular year,
there was a large scale migrant

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.740
worker protest.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:14.080
There was a corresponding
burst of discussion

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.080
online about this city
because of the protests,

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.550
and there's also this
burst of censorship.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.430
So the unit that
we're interested in

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:26.950
is not topics and not posts,
it's these bursts of discussion

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:30.500
because the censorship is
happening in these bursts.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.670
So some bursts are censored,
but not all bursts are censored.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:35.020
This is the same type of plot.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:38.360
Six-month time period,
count on the y-axis.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.430
But everyone here is
talking about power prices.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.380
In this particular frame,
there was a heat wave.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.292
At the same time, the government
increased power prices.

00:10:47.292 --> 00:10:49.750
So there are a lot of people
complaining online about this,

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.576
and that's the
burst you see here.

00:10:51.576 --> 00:10:53.200
But you don't see a
corresponding burst

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.130
in censorship.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:58.100
So our hypothesis going in is
that the Chinese government

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:02.090
is censoring all the posts in
these volume bursts associated

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.890
with events with collective
action potential.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:07.760
It doesn't really matter
what the post is saying.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.510
It matters what the overall
discussion is about.

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.580
And we test this in a
couple of different ways.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.460
So one test we do
is to look at what

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.920
are the events
precipitating these bursts,

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.910
and then to categorize these
events into news, policy,

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:24.680
collective action, and others.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.540
And we create a
measure, something

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.190
we call censorship magnitude.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:31.040
This is the intensity of
censorship in these bursts as

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.540
opposed to outside.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.340
And you can see that for the
most part, these births related

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.880
to policy and news, which are
purple and blue, in the darker

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:41.630
colors, have a censorship
magnitude around zero, which

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:44.662
means that there's really
no increase in censorship

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:45.620
when the bursts happen.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.161
Sometimes there's
actually a decrease

00:11:47.161 --> 00:11:50.460
because there's a burst that
maybe less content is removed.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.090
But when you look, there's
a big long right tail,

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:55.130
and a lot of these are in red.

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.800
So all the kind of
little segments in red

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.150
are events or bursts related
to collective action,

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.090
and that's where the censorship
magnitude is much higher.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.840
We also see that in the
yellow pornography a censored.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.540
That's less interesting
for our particular focus

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:12.490
because every country to some
extent censors pornography.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:14.660
But we go a step
further, not just looking

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.910
at the kind of discussion--
overall discussion

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.880
of the bursts, but what
each post is saying.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.450
And there we see that regardless
of the content or sentiment

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:26.240
of the posts, what really
matters as censorship

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.700
is the overall discussion.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.400
So into this plot, the y-axis
is the percent censored.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.640
On the left panel, these
are posts in bursts

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.440
related to collective action.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.080
And they're whether the post
is critical of the state in red

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.910
or support of the
state and green.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.080
It's highly censored
versus posts

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.690
that are happening in bursts not
related to collective action.

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.250
There, whether you're critical
or not doesn't really matter.

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.360
The censorship is very low.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.230
So censorship or this
removing of content

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:56.330
seems really focused
on collective action.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.710
What happens with
online propaganda?

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:01.290
We can think of propaganda as
kind of reverse censorship.

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:04.370
Instead of taking away
we're adding information.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:08.480
And here, I'm talking about
the specific form of propaganda

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.110
that's the fabrication of
content by the government

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:14.400
as if it was the opinions
of ordinary people.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.700
So sometimes this is called
government astro-turfing.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.720
It can be called misinformation
campaigns, disinformation,

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.450
trolling.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:22.460
There are lots of
different names and words

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.620
that people are using
for these phenomenon.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:28.430
In the Chinese context, the
people who do this type of work

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:32.390
are known officially as internet
commentators, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:34.350
So it's a very innocuous name.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.620
But more colloquially, they're
known as 50 cent party members.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.880
People who are paid piecemeal
$0.50 for each post that they

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.980
make online.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.055
And so what do they do?

00:13:44.055 --> 00:13:46.430
The prevailing view-- and this
is my view before all this

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:49.130
research-- is that these
50 cent party members--

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:52.110
I'm just going to call them
that for the rest of the talk--

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:55.220
that they are arguing with
and debating against those

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.780
who criticize China.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:00.680
So let's say, online someone
is criticizing Chinese leaders,

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.410
Chinese policies, or
being really favorable

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:06.170
of the US or democracy,
50 cent party members

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:08.480
will come in and argue
against those people.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.540
That was my belief of what
50 cent party members do.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.490
But with our research,
what we found

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.950
is that that's not at
all what's going on.

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.060
These 50 cent party
members do not argue.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.720
They don't even touch
these controversial issues.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.310
And instead,
they're distracting.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:25.400
They're putting out lots of
really positive, happy content

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.320
that's totally
irrelevant, does not

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.740
touch on any critical,
controversial, debatable

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.360
issues.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.140
And the way we study that is to
try to get ground-truth data.

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.820
So this is hidden--

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.950
this is fabricating
content and trying

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:41.580
to pretend it's real people.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:45.430
So this is not a public program.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.320
And ground truth data has
been difficult to come by,

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:52.100
but we were lucky that
a few years ago there

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.840
was a leaked email archive from
the jungle internet propaganda

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.340
office.

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:58.640
This is one county in
southern South Central China

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.070
where these e-mails
were leaked, and you

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.127
see lots of emails sent to
and from this jungle internet

00:15:04.127 --> 00:15:05.960
propaganda office, which
was in this network

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.460
plot in the middle.

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.490
And all around it
are lots of e-mails

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:14.540
coming in by internet
commentators claiming credit

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.580
for the posts they've made
on behalf of the government.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.910
So this is the
ground truth data,

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.410
and it's publicly available now.

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:24.230
But it has been
largely overlooked

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.410
because it's really messy.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:28.070
The e-mails are in
different formats.

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:31.140
Some of these credit
claiming as a screenshot.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.880
Some are attachments.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.810
And what we do is use a lot
of different machine learning

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:39.170
as well as large scale
hand annotating methods

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.870
to extract and make
this data systematic.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:46.370
And from this data we extracted
over 40,000 known 50 cent party

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:47.360
posts.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.720
Over 43,000 known posts.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.880
And so that's what I mean
by ground-truth data.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.270
We know that these are workers
making these fake posts

00:15:56.270 --> 00:16:00.060
at the behest of the government.

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.780
And then we build out
from this ground-truth

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.760
to extrapolate and
make predictions.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.790
So first we analyze the
content of the leaked

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:10.760
data, which is as I mentioned,
from one county in China.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:15.030
And then we extrapolate to
all 2,800 counties in China.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:16.910
And then we validate
that extrapolation,

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:18.650
and we also validate
our validation.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:25.200
What we're interested in is the
content of these 50 cent party

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:25.700
posts.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.920
We want to know what
are they saying.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.140
And so we estimate the
distribution of these posts

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.652
into five categories.

00:16:31.652 --> 00:16:33.110
The first category
is what we call,

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:34.470
taunting of foreign countries.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:36.470
So this is criticizing
people online

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.540
who are supporting the
US, supporting democracy,

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.070
supporting the west.

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.590
The second is what we
call argumentative praise

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:43.760
and criticism.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.920
So these are people who
are critical of those

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.140
who are critical of
China, China's policies,

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.820
and then praising those
who endorse China.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.520
The third category we call
non-argumentative praise

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.400
or suggestions.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:59.390
So this is statements like,
we should increase prosperity

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:01.760
or we should improve
the plight of the poor.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.750
Things at such a general level
that everyone can agree with.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.569
The third category
is just announcements

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:09.140
of policies and programs.

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.560
And the fourth is this
cheer leading category.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.599
So motivational, inspirational,
positive messages.

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:17.240
You get messages like,
I woke up this morning

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:21.079
feeling so thankful that
I'm a Chinese citizen.

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:23.390
I hope everyone else
has a wonderful day.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.180
So just being very,
very positive and happy.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.730
Not touching on any
sort of content.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.454
Prevailing view is that this
is what the 50 cent party

00:17:31.454 --> 00:17:32.120
member is doing.

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.880
This taunting, this
argumentation, debating.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.070
And what we find
is all the content

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:38.744
falls into these
three categories.

00:17:38.744 --> 00:17:40.160
And I'm going to
show you analysis

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.220
from five data sets that
move from the leaked data

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:46.040
out to other places in China.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.250
And so this plot on the
y-axis is just the proportion

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:51.410
of content in each of
these five categories

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:53.780
that I just showed you,
which our labeled here.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.795
The starting data set is these
posts from the leaked e-mails.

00:17:56.795 --> 00:17:59.000
This 43,000 posts from
the leaked e-mails.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.400
They're made to all sorts
of websites in China.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:06.080
And here, over 80% of the
content is in cheer leading.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.680
And that was really
surprising to us,

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.090
because we thought
the content would

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.920
be like down here in
taunting argumentation,

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.060
and that wasn't the case.

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.590
And we think this
is very unlikely

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.020
to be due to any sort
of sampling error.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.330
But we push really
hard and try to find

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:23.030
any content that would go into
the taunting argumentation

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:23.880
categories.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.110
And in the end, we found,
I think, 26 posts out

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:32.041
of 43,000 that could conceivably
be in those categories.

00:18:32.041 --> 00:18:34.040
So the next thing we do,
we want to extrapolate.

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.930
The next thing we do
to set up for that

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:38.390
is to look just at
posts made on Weibo,

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:41.530
which is the Chinese kind
of version of Twitter.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:43.622
And we're looking at posts
from all the accounts

00:18:43.622 --> 00:18:44.330
that were leaked.

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.120
So this is about
now 160,000 posts.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:53.180
And again, primarily the content
is focused on cheer leading.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.610
When we looked at
these Weibo accounts,

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:58.160
we found that there are
two types of accounts.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.966
One, where what we
call ordinary accounts.

00:19:00.966 --> 00:19:02.840
These are accounts that
you and I might have.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.570
They're posting on
food, travel, kids.

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:07.640
And the intersperse
are a few posts

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.650
made at the behest
of the government.

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:12.860
So it's incredibly difficult
to identify these accounts that

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.290
are making these posts
because there are actually

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:17.030
people's normal accounts.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:18.920
Oh, and I should say
that the people who

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.700
are making these posts, we found
in the process of systematizing

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.524
the data, were basically
all government employees who

00:19:25.524 --> 00:19:28.190
have other jobs, who are working
for the county, who are working

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:30.210
for the township,
villages, neighborhoods,

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:32.450
but who are making
these posts on the side.

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:34.910
And so some of them were using
their real Weibo accounts

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:36.200
and making these posts.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.940
Very difficult to identify.

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.100
But there are also accounts
that were what we call,

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:44.430
exclusive accounts made just
to make these 50 cent posts.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:46.370
These are much
easier to identify,

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.700
and reassuringly, ordinary
and exclusive accounts

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.180
do very similar things.

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.334
So is not the case
that ordinary accounts

00:19:53.334 --> 00:19:55.250
are doing the taunting
and argumentation while

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:57.200
exclusive accounts of
doing cheer leading.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.440
And we're going to extrapolate
and predict focusing just

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.530
on these exclusive accounts,
so that's important for us.

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.960
We first start within
county prediction

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.450
and then move to out
of county prediction.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.630
And the picture is
very, very consistent.

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:15.290
50 cent party content is
focused on cheer leading,

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:18.740
these positive
inspirational messages.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.840
The other thing to note
is that these posts

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.230
are not made uniformly over
time, but are very bursty.

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:25.800
This is from the leaked data.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.820
They're making posts
before certain holidays,

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.630
before sensitive political
meetings, web protests,

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.560
and collective action
might be more likely,

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.830
as well as after events,
collective action events, that

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.400
get a lot of national
attention like the [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.600
or [INAUDIBLE]
railway explosion.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.670
So it seems that these--

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:45.410
especially the cheer
leading content

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:49.870
is aimed or timed to distract
from collective action,

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.310
at least to a certain extent.

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:54.410
So how do we validate
our predictions?

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:56.820
We decided to ask the
people we predicted

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:58.240
to be 50 cent party members.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.000
You might think, how
is it going to work?

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.032
These people's jobs
are to mislead.

00:21:03.032 --> 00:21:04.240
They work for the government.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.530
Maybe their jobs are at stake.

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:08.790
They're not your optimal
survey respondents.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:11.930
But we decided to do it
anyway, and we administered

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:15.120
a double blind survey on
Weibo through direct messaging

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.954
where we said,
ask this question.

00:21:16.954 --> 00:21:18.870
I saw your comment, and
it's really inspiring.

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:21.119
I want to ask, do you have
any public opinion guidance

00:21:21.119 --> 00:21:23.790
management or online
commenting experience?

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:26.130
So we're not using the
terminology 50 cent,

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:28.981
we're using the government's
own terminology.

00:21:28.981 --> 00:21:31.230
So we asked this question
of the accounts we predicted

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:32.800
to be 50 cent accounts.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.770
We also asked the same
question of the accounts

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:36.590
we know to be 50 cent accounts.

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:38.910
And then we asked the
accounts the same question

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:41.370
that are unlikely to
be 50 cent accounts.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:43.200
And we find that in
the predicted accounts,

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.790
59% say, yes, they do have
this experience and training.

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:49.890
In the known accounts,
57% say, yes.

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:53.010
And in the accounts unlikely
to be 50 cent from our method,

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:54.872
only 19% say, yes.

00:21:54.872 --> 00:21:56.580
And the difference
between the first two,

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.320
the predicted and
the known, there's

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.620
no significant difference
between that response rate.

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.810
So asking the
predicted accounts,

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:06.150
that's our validation.

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:08.730
And then asking the known
and unlikely accounts

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:12.030
is our validation
of the validation.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:15.180
So altogether, China's strategy
in censorship and propaganda

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.920
can be reduced to
very simple rules.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.700
The first is do not engage
on controversial issues.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.150
Don't censor criticism.

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:23.430
Don't argue against critics.

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:27.660
Don't touch kind of people's
real opinions and thoughts

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:30.440
about policies, the
leaders, and the state.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.590
And the second is to
stop collective action.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:35.340
So censor discussions
of collective action

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:37.300
that are going
online, and then try

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.170
to distract with this cheer
leading positive content

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:43.410
after collective action
happens or before time periods

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:45.270
when collective
action might happen.

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:47.460
And I think altogether
for a social scientist

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:50.400
like me is the promise
of data science

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:54.005
is that when we study
these phenomena at scale,

00:22:54.005 --> 00:22:56.130
government information
control efforts leave really

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:57.104
big footprints.

00:22:57.104 --> 00:22:58.770
Before, we couldn't
see these footprints

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:00.600
so we couldn't really
understand what

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.350
these opaque, non-democratic
governments were doing.

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:05.974
But with data science and
computational data science

00:23:05.974 --> 00:23:07.890
machine learning, whatever
we want to call it,

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.290
these methods allow
us to see things that

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.289
were not visible to us before.

00:23:12.289 --> 00:23:13.080
So I'll stop there.

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.329
Thank you very much.

00:23:14.329 --> 00:23:21.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.720
- Yes, questions?

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.553
- Yes.

00:23:23.553 --> 00:23:24.427
- So, take questions.

00:23:24.427 --> 00:23:25.650
Go ahead.

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:30.876
- So I was wondering whether
you guys have thought about what

00:23:30.876 --> 00:23:35.260
Chinese government might be
doing [INAUDIBLE] data and how

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.635
they might have--

00:23:36.635 --> 00:23:39.010
because it looks like they
certainly proved to themselves

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:40.760
that the methods
that they were using

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:45.728
are the most effective ways
of dispensing propaganda.

00:23:45.728 --> 00:23:47.216
Right?

00:23:47.216 --> 00:23:51.157
So are there any known
tools that they're

00:23:51.157 --> 00:23:54.900
using to [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:58.636
- So we don't know for sure
what the government is doing,

00:23:58.636 --> 00:24:00.510
but we do know that the
government is putting

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:05.370
a lot of funding into
Chinese academic institutions

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:09.720
to improve technologies and
data science and computational

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:10.440
methods.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.380
A lot of the work on censorship,
at least, that's being done

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:17.250
is being done in the
internet content providers.

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:20.010
So they're the ones who
are developing technologies

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:22.270
and paying for censorship.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.270
But on the propaganda
side of things,

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:28.290
there are likely are studies
within the Chinese regime

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:30.420
of how effective
these strategies are.

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.000
But I think at the
same time, one thing

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.040
to keep in mind is that--

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.291
is not to forget the politics.

00:24:36.291 --> 00:24:38.331
So I'm coming from political
science background--

00:24:38.331 --> 00:24:40.710
not to forget the politics
within the government that

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:42.390
their bureaucracies--

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:45.450
the propaganda department has
been in charge of propaganda

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:47.020
for decades.

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:50.430
And so they have established
ways of doing things,

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:52.540
and they're encountering
these new technologies.

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:56.570
So it's not entirely clear that
even if there are effectiveness

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:58.445
studies, what that
means in terms

00:24:58.445 --> 00:24:59.570
of changing their behavior.

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.430
- Maybe this is too
basic a question,

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:12.050
but if these propaganda
cheer leading messages come

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:17.930
in bursts, it's effectively a
reactive coordination message.

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:20.960
So do these people get
little messages somehow

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.630
or code like, OK, go for it?

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:26.290
I mean, how is it such
a coordinated burst?

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:29.810
- Yeah, so you actually-- so in
the email archives you also see

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:32.810
outgoing messages
from that county,

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:36.530
propaganda department
saying, OK, now it's time.

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:42.890
So in one of the bursts, which
was after kind of protest

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:47.750
in Western China, you see
at 5:00 PM an email go out,

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:51.770
and then at 8:00 PM you see
hundreds of people reporting

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:53.660
back of the post they made.

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.760
So that's how the
coordination is happening.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:03.669
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:07.610
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:11.840
- So I wondered how you
defined which messages

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.940
had content about
collective action,

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.650
and do you think
your definition is

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:18.812
the same as the Chinese
government would have?

00:26:18.812 --> 00:26:20.270
- So on the censorship
side, right?

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:20.770
- Yes.

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:21.860
- Yeah.

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:25.050
So we have a pretty
narrow definition,

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:29.720
which is people talking about
real world collective action

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:30.800
events.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.920
So we're not including
online mobilization.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.760
It's people talking
about other people who

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.340
are in the real world
doing things together.

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:43.670
So it's a pretty
narrow definition.

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:46.730
And in the experiment,
our experimental study,

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:49.620
I didn't talk about as
much, but we actually--

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.460
there are made posts in these
collective action bursts,

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:56.030
and we also try to make posts
in kind of online mobilization

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:59.030
bursts, and there that
content is not censored.

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:02.930
So it seems that it's really
about offline people doing

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:05.720
things in the real
world together that

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.148
triggers the censorship online.

00:27:08.148 --> 00:27:09.705
Yeah.

00:27:09.705 --> 00:27:10.538
- One more question.

00:27:10.538 --> 00:27:11.016
In the back.

00:27:11.016 --> 00:27:11.494
- You.

00:27:11.494 --> 00:27:11.972
Sorry, in the very back, though.

00:27:11.972 --> 00:27:13.884
You had your hand
up for a long time.

00:27:13.884 --> 00:27:15.318
Sorry.

00:27:15.318 --> 00:27:17.040
- OK, thank you.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:24.570
I think this phenomenon can
be explained in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:26.310
It is very normal
in China , I think,

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:30.160
because China's government
want people, young people,

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:34.890
use people, most people to
do economy and technology,

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:36.689
but a lot of politics.

00:27:36.689 --> 00:27:38.105
This is a lot
related to democracy

00:27:38.105 --> 00:27:42.760
I think This is very
different from America.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:47.700
So in China, organizations
or collective actions

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.000
are designed by the government.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:50.610
Yeah.

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:53.780
There are many different
collective actions,

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:57.520
but all these actions are
designed by the government.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.270
So if you want to take
collective actions,

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:04.990
you can participate in the
designed organizations.

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:08.430
So if you do not want
to do collective--

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:12.060
do not want to participate in
these designed organizations,

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:15.660
you can participate
[INAUDIBLE] in technology.

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:16.680
So I think so.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.370
Thank you.

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:17.870
- Yeah.

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:20.340
No, I think that's right, and
there's folks here at Harvard

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.340
who are studying kind of
state led mobilization

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.452
as a way of diverting
people's attention.

00:28:25.452 --> 00:28:26.910
But I think at the
same time, there

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:29.786
are lots of collective action
events happening in China.

00:28:29.786 --> 00:28:31.410
So I have a new
project which is trying

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:34.110
to identify collective action
events through social media

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:38.700
data, and we are finding
dozens of protests every day

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.640
just through social media data,
which has it's own biases.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:45.000
So I think regardless of
the government's efforts

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.250
to try to divert
collective action,

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:49.319
people face grievances
and problems

00:28:49.319 --> 00:28:51.360
in their everyday lives
that they can't sometimes

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.430
solve on an individual
level basis,

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:56.490
and they get together with
others to face similar problems

00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:00.141
and they engage in collective
action and protest.

00:29:00.141 --> 00:29:01.632
- Thank you, Jen.

00:29:01.632 --> 00:29:07.110
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.180
- Again, and for those
of you who just came in,

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.506
we're going to have
another speaker now who

00:29:10.506 --> 00:29:12.839
I'll introduce in a second,
and then we'll have a break,

00:29:12.839 --> 00:29:15.120
and then we'll have our
two speakers afterwards,

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.250
and we're hoping everybody
comes back and joins us.

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:20.090
So that was terrific.

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:26.010
And we will now move from
online censorship to the movies.

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:29.100
But let me tell you a little
bit about Nathan Sanders who's

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.900
our next speaker.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:32.730
He's currently the
senior director

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:36.150
of quantitative analytics
at Legendary Pictures, which

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:40.890
I'm betting is a post that
did not exist a decade ago.

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:42.720
Before he did that,
I mentioned earlier

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.926
that he got his PhD from
this fine university.

00:29:45.926 --> 00:29:48.300
Don't worry, we do have people
on the program who did not

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.770
get their PhDs from Harvard.

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:52.790
Just these first two, and me.

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:59.610
Anyway, so he got his PhD in
Harvard and 2014 in astronomy.

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:01.260
But while he was
here it wasn't enough

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.300
for him to very quickly
get a PhD, which

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.550
he did where he studied
supernovae and learned

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:07.230
a lot about data
science by looking

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:09.030
at the so-called
light curves, the time

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:11.850
behavior of the
brightness of supernovae.

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:14.430
He also started two things that
some people in the audience

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:15.240
may have heard of.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.520
One is called,
Astral Bite's, which

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:20.730
is a service where graduate
students write summaries

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:23.040
and professional
articles for people.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.350
And building off
of that, there's

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:27.687
now a big conference
he might tell you

00:30:27.687 --> 00:30:29.520
something about called
Communicating Science

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:33.360
Conference or ComSciCon, which
is vastly oversubscribed,

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.834
and people attend it to learn
how to communicate science

00:30:36.834 --> 00:30:37.500
with the public.

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:38.910
And Nathan doesn't
like when people

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:41.493
know that about him in advance
because it puts pressure on him

00:30:41.493 --> 00:30:44.730
for giving an amazing talk,
which I'm sure he will.

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:48.270
But anyway, so you can see
that he has historically many

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:50.180
extra curricular interests.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.710
And so he's not going to
talk about new statistical

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:54.660
methodologies for
measuring the light curve

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:58.432
properties of hydrogen rich
type two supernovae today.

00:30:58.432 --> 00:31:00.390
But don't worry, we have
different astrophysics

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:02.160
talk for you later.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.740
So instead, he's going
to talk about his work

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:08.730
at Legendary Entertainment
and how that works in the data

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:10.390
science world today.

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:11.139
David.

00:31:11.139 --> 00:31:16.680
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:18.680
- While we're getting set
up, thank you so much,

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:20.638
Alyssa, and thank you to
everybody at Radcliffe

00:31:20.638 --> 00:31:22.370
for convening this
amazing forum.

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:24.161
It's such a pleasure
to be able to join you

00:31:24.161 --> 00:31:25.902
and to share some of
my own experiences.

00:31:25.902 --> 00:31:27.860
So as Alyssa said, I
really want to actually do

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:29.190
two things in my talk.

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:31.130
I want to give you a
little bit of information

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:33.040
about my own background
and research.

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.150
First in astronomy,
and now I'll focus

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:37.200
on what I do today at
Legendary Entertainment

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.450
and what our group does.

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:39.950
But importantly, I
also want to draw

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:41.360
connections between the two.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.020
I want to make it
really clear how

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.840
data science and
industry and academia

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:46.800
are really codependent.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.444
So that'll be my goal.

00:31:48.444 --> 00:31:50.610
So as Alyssa said, I have
a background in astronomy.

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:52.943
I started off-- I did my
undergraduate work in astronomy

00:31:52.943 --> 00:31:55.820
in Michigan State, my PhD here
at the Center for Astrophysics

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:56.756
at Harvard.

00:31:56.756 --> 00:31:58.630
And today, I work at
Legendary Entertainment.

00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:00.530
I'll tell you all about
Legendary Entertainment

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:02.196
in a moment, but I
thought I'd start off

00:32:02.196 --> 00:32:05.490
with a story about my
graduate work here at Harvard.

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:07.760
So I did my thesis research
with Alicia Soderberg

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.730
who's a phenomenal scientist
who studies supernovae here

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:14.240
at Harvard, and our work spanned
the full gamut from actually

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.879
detecting the supernovae.

00:32:15.879 --> 00:32:17.420
And I won't talk
about this in detail

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.628
because I think Renee might
tell us a little bit more

00:32:19.628 --> 00:32:22.249
about astronomical transient
discovery in a little bit.

00:32:22.249 --> 00:32:24.290
But suffice it to say,
it's a very hard challenge

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:27.920
because we're trying to detect
these incredibly minute changes

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:31.130
in brightness in the sky, which
correspond to these incredibly

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:34.550
energetic and violent
explosions of massive stars that

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:36.080
happen in the distant universe.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:39.050
Often literally, halfway
across the observable universe.

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:41.420
So my focus in this
work is on-- as Alyssa

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:44.090
said, the statistical
modeling of the light curves

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:47.550
of these stars, of
these star explosions.

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:49.090
So this is what that looks like.

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:50.760
A light curve is
very straightforward.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.843
It's actually just a plot
of the brightness of one

00:32:52.843 --> 00:32:54.380
of these explosions over time.

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:57.050
So the x-axis in this plot
is just the time and days.

00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:59.420
The y-axis is the
brightness of the event.

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:02.390
Don't worry about the crazy unit
systems that astronomers use.

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:04.940
Don't worry really about
the details of this plot.

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:06.940
What I wanted to show you
is how messy this data

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:08.480
is, to be very frank.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.000
So we're trying to observe
these incredibly faint objects

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.050
in the distant universe,
and as a result,

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:15.320
there's at least two big
challenges that we face.

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.900
One is that each individual
observation is noisy.

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:19.760
And two, we don't
get as complete

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.110
a data set as we'd like to have.

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:24.050
We only really get a few
observations of each exploding

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:26.930
star, and just the few weeks
that it's bright on the sky

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:29.210
before it fades into obscurity.

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:31.820
And that's a huge challenge from
a statistical point of view.

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:33.362
It means we really
need to treat each

00:33:33.362 --> 00:33:35.653
and every single one of these
observations as something

00:33:35.653 --> 00:33:36.290
truly precious.

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:37.956
There's an enormous
amount of investment

00:33:37.956 --> 00:33:40.250
to the scientific
community in dollars

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:41.770
and building these
telescopes to be

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:44.030
able to collect these
precious few data points.

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:45.980
So it is my mission, the
mission of our group,

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.956
to use statistical
modeling to extract

00:33:47.956 --> 00:33:49.580
every last piece of
information that we

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.730
can from these relatively
few precious data points.

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:54.920
And what we do with that
is understand the physics

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.400
of supernova explosions.

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.250
So we relate the
observational parameters

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:00.560
that we measure from
these limited observations

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.950
of these explosions.

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:03.440
So for example, on
the x-axis here,

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.950
the total duration of the event.

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:06.860
How long it stays
bright in the sky.

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:08.929
On the y-axis, how bright it is.

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:11.000
We relate those
observational parameters

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.520
to the theoretical parameters
of different types of stars

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.110
and the explosions they produce.

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:17.614
So other astronomers actually
explode stars and computers,

00:34:17.614 --> 00:34:19.280
and they figure out
what the light curve

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.408
properties would look like.

00:34:20.408 --> 00:34:22.199
And by comparing these
two things together,

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:23.810
we can make
inferences about what

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:25.980
the actual parameters in
the stars that we watch

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:28.159
explode or like how
massive they are

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:30.770
and what their chemical
composition was.

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:33.320
So that's a brief tour
of my work in astronomy.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.420
I'm going to try to tie
that back to the work

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:37.760
that we do today at
Legendary Entertainment.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.529
So most people that I
talk to don't actually

00:34:40.529 --> 00:34:43.070
know our brand name, Legendary,
but almost everyone I talk to

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:44.750
has seen at least
one of our movies.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:47.540
So Legendary is probably best
known for the Dark Knight

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:48.770
Trilogy of Batman films.

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:50.420
The Christopher Nolan trilogy.

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.503
We made a bunch of Christopher
Nolan's other films

00:34:52.503 --> 00:34:54.800
as well, like Interstellar
and Inception.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:58.040
More recently, we've made
the Godzilla reboot in 2014.

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.770
The Warcraft movie
based on the video game.

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:03.180
The recent Kong
Skull Island movie.

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:06.320
And right now, in
theaters today, you

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.600
can go see Pacific Rim Uprising.

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.190
So if anyone leaves
during my talk,

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:12.850
I'll know it's because you're
rushing out to see Pacific Rim

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:13.849
and I won't mind at all.

00:35:13.849 --> 00:35:15.800
That would be fine.

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.210
So Legendary is-- we are
best known as a film studio,

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:19.680
but we also produce TV shows.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.040
We make comic books.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.000
We produce digital
content and online media.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.670
Legendary is really an
entertainment conglomerate.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:27.320
And we are headquartered
in Hollywood,

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.210
and we're a little bit of an
unusual company by Hollywood

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:29.709
standards.

00:35:29.709 --> 00:35:30.760
We're quite young.

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.050
Legendary has been around
for less than two decades,

00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:34.883
and in that time we've
been very successful.

00:35:34.883 --> 00:35:37.430
We've had more than $12 billion
in total global box office

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:38.360
gross.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.350
We also have an
office in Beijing.

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:42.134
And we have an applied
analytics group,

00:35:42.134 --> 00:35:43.550
which is where I
and my colleagues

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:45.680
work, here in Boston.

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.450
So our applied analytics
group really has two missions.

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:50.240
The first is to
radically increase

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:53.180
the efficiency of
marketing in Hollywood

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.430
to make every
dollar that we spend

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:59.000
to entice people to go to
movies and to see our films,

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.090
to make that spend as effective
and as efficient as possible.

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:07.820
And secondly, to support and
inform the creative process.

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:10.460
The work that the incredible
creative talent that we have

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.290
in our office in
Hollywood, the work

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:15.140
that those people are doing
to put the amazing concepts

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:18.140
that they have in the
best possible position

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.600
to succeed in the marketplace.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.100
So for me, the most exciting
part about working at Legendary

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.380
is that we have just a
phenomenal team of scientists

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:25.830
working here in Boston.

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:27.440
So I just wanted
to flash up for you

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.654
the faces of the folks
in our quantitative team.

00:36:29.654 --> 00:36:31.070
And since we're
here at Radcliffe,

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:31.970
I wanted to highlight
that we have

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:33.136
lots of Harvard connections.

00:36:33.136 --> 00:36:35.630
So perhaps, many of you will
recognize some of the faces

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:36.282
here.

00:36:36.282 --> 00:36:38.240
And so I won't introduce
you to everybody here,

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.290
but I wanted to point
out a couple of examples.

00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:41.510
We have lots of
people, like myself,

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:43.301
that have physical or
computational science

00:36:43.301 --> 00:36:47.120
backgrounds including one
face, Jonathan Foster who

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.600
among many other things he's
notable for, including just

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.950
being a tremendous
researcher, is

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:54.890
a fellow alum of the
astronomy program here

00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:56.410
and one of Alyssa's
former students.

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:57.701
So thank you very much, Alyssa.

00:36:57.701 --> 00:36:58.841
- You're welcome.

00:36:58.841 --> 00:37:00.572
- And another
category of scientists

00:37:00.572 --> 00:37:03.030
that we have working with us
are amazing social scientists.

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:04.863
So I thought I'd point
out Phoebe Wong whose

00:37:04.863 --> 00:37:07.850
photo is on the bottom there and
is also in the audience today.

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:10.186
And Phoebe is an analyst on
our primary research team,

00:37:10.186 --> 00:37:12.310
doing human subjects research
at Legendary and also

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:15.585
a data scientist.

00:37:15.585 --> 00:37:16.960
So I want to make
this connection

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.470
now between the
type of data science

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:20.910
that we do at Legendary and
the type of data science

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:23.324
that's applied in
academic research

00:37:23.324 --> 00:37:24.740
throughout many
fields of science.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:25.850
And I want to do that
through this lens

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:27.410
that I think of
this through, which

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:29.474
is this duality between
inference and prediction.

00:37:29.474 --> 00:37:30.890
So the first thing
I'm going to do

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:33.710
is make very explicit what
I mean by those terms,

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:36.620
and I'll do that by introducing
this very generic concept

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:39.710
of what is a mathematical
model or statistical model.

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:42.930
So any statistical model is
a few fundamental components.

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:45.920
There's some set of input data
that is fed into the model.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:48.770
Indicators that can be used
to predict other things.

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:51.230
There are some outputs
from the model.

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:54.890
Outcome data that we want
to understand and model.

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:56.600
The way the model
goes from X to Y

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.730
is by making predictions
by taking the input data

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:01.592
and transforming it into an
estimate for the outcome Y.

00:38:01.592 --> 00:38:03.050
And the goal of
the model is really

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:06.170
to do as good a job as possible
in making the predictions match

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:08.597
the actual outcome data that's
used to train the model.

00:38:08.597 --> 00:38:11.180
And then importantly, there's a
set of parameters in the model

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:12.440
that we'll call beta.

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.030
And these parameters
are really how

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:15.796
the model makes
predictions, and it's

00:38:15.796 --> 00:38:17.420
learning the values
of these parameters

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:19.006
in the fitting
process that allows

00:38:19.006 --> 00:38:20.630
us to learn about
the actual mechanisms

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:22.430
that we're trying
to model and study.

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:24.860
And finally, there is
perception error in the model.

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:27.479
There is some uncertainty
associated with it as well.

00:38:27.479 --> 00:38:29.770
So the next thing I'm going
to say is entirely obvious,

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:31.250
but I'm going to
say it anyway, which

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:33.208
is that there's that an
aspect of this modeling

00:38:33.208 --> 00:38:35.900
process that is critical in
both science and industry,

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:37.110
and that's prediction.

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:40.310
So the predictive aspect of
statistical models of course,

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:43.010
is fundamental to
how data science is

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:44.277
integrated into business.

00:38:44.277 --> 00:38:45.860
So I'll give you a
few examples of how

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:47.780
this particular aspect
of the model prediction

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:49.680
is very important.

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.740
So in science for
example, if you're

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:53.210
very interested
in exploding stars

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:55.700
and you've observed supernovae
over the past few nights

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.590
and you want to know what it's
going to do in the future,

00:38:57.590 --> 00:38:59.464
you might make a prediction
of the brightness

00:38:59.464 --> 00:39:01.169
of that exploding star tonight.

00:39:01.169 --> 00:39:03.710
What's it going to look like if
I try and observe it tonight?

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:05.737
In an industry, particularly
in our industry,

00:39:05.737 --> 00:39:07.820
we're interested in people's
movie-going behaviors

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:10.200
and we want to know whether
or not we might buy a ticket.

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.240
So if there is
somebody that we have

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:12.740
some information
about like, Alyssa,

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:15.281
we might ask a question like,
is she going to go see a movie.

00:39:15.281 --> 00:39:17.930
- Not taking [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:20.150
- I predict with 100%
confidence that Alyssa

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:23.984
will see Pacific Rim Uprising
before it leaves theaters.

00:39:23.984 --> 00:39:27.331
[LAUGHTER] We'll
see if that's true.

00:39:27.331 --> 00:39:27.830
OK.

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:29.990
So of course, we apply
predictive modeling

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:31.940
all over the place in
our work at Legendary.

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:33.830
I don't want to give
you an exhaustive survey

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:35.930
of the broad set of research
that all the scientists that I

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:37.550
showed you on the
earlier slide are doing,

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:39.508
but I'll just give you
a scattering of examples

00:39:39.508 --> 00:39:40.800
in different categories.

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.820
So one big category of work that
we do is in network analysis.

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:46.580
Using social media graph data,
the connections between people

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:49.100
online to understand what
people's interests are,

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:51.290
to look at who people
are connected to, what

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:53.900
influencers or celebrities they
follow to get an understanding

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:56.540
of what type of content they'd
be interested in, what type

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:59.360
of movies they may want to see.

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.730
Secondly, we do a lot of
work in image recognition

00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:04.100
using exciting relatively
new deep learning

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:06.290
models, like convolutional
neural network models,

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:08.690
to take in images as data,
to actually work directly

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:11.060
on pixel data and
make predictions

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:13.580
about what those images mean
and what it means for someone

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.110
to have shared them.

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:16.640
So in particular,
in our industry,

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.390
we're very interested
in people's response

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:19.280
to visual media.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:22.800
If we send a creative message
out as an advertisement,

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.110
what will people respond
to and what types of people

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:27.230
will respond to each
type of message?

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:30.260
So for example, from working our
Kong movie, what type of person

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:32.880
is going to be interested
in seeing Kong himself,

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:35.840
the actual monster in the
film, versus other aspects

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:38.830
of the imagery in the film.

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:40.270
And one more
category of examples

00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:42.250
is a natural
language processing.

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:45.040
Building models that actually
understand text as people

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:48.190
write a text and share
messages with each other online

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:50.290
to understand what those
individuals are actually

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:53.390
trying to express to their
friends and to others.

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:55.979
So we use a variety of
approaches for this.

00:40:55.979 --> 00:40:57.520
The example I am
showing you is using

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.870
something called, a
hierarchical attention network.

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:01.536
This is a type of
model that understands

00:41:01.536 --> 00:41:03.610
not only what it means
to use a particular word,

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:05.818
but also the context in
which words are used together

00:41:05.818 --> 00:41:07.000
to form sentences.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.190
And very importantly,
what to pay attention to,

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:12.880
literally to attend
to, within a sentence.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.620
What words carry
the most meaning

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:16.390
when someone composes a message.

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:17.980
And among other things,
we use this type of model

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:19.438
to predict the
emotions that people

00:41:19.438 --> 00:41:23.710
are trying to express when
they share messages online.

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:26.809
So I'm sure none of this is a
huge surprise that companies

00:41:26.809 --> 00:41:28.600
are interested in using
predictive modeling

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:30.640
for purposes like
these, but actually

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:34.030
have a concern about how data
scientists often projected

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:35.715
and spoken about in
industry, which is I

00:41:35.715 --> 00:41:37.090
think sometimes,
there's actually

00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:39.370
an over interest
in or over reliance

00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:41.020
on this concept of prediction.

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:42.580
So I think sometimes
machine learning

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:45.980
is spoken of as synonymous
with prediction.

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:47.820
So what I mean is
I think sometimes

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:49.570
when people think of
the modeling process,

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:51.640
this is not actually the
picture they have in mind.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:52.630
What they have in
mind is something

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:55.420
more like this, where there
is one element of the modeling

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:56.862
process that sort of takes over.

00:41:56.862 --> 00:41:59.320
And I think there's at least
one other part of the modeling

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:02.020
process that's equally
interesting and important,

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:03.016
and that's inference.

00:42:03.016 --> 00:42:04.390
What I mean by
inference is being

00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:07.072
able to learn from the model
fitting process itself,

00:42:07.072 --> 00:42:09.280
to be able to learn from
the comparison between model

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:13.610
and data about the process
that we're trying to model.

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:15.970
So in my sort of definition
of statistical inference

00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:20.329
is the ability to learn from the
comparison of models and data.

00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:22.870
So to make this concrete, let
me give you those same examples

00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:24.800
again, but from an
inference perspective.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.160
So in science we might want
to ask not just how bright

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.990
is a supernova going
to be, but what

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:31.847
are the properties of the stars
that led to those explosions.

00:42:31.847 --> 00:42:34.180
And in industry, we want to
know not just whether or not

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:36.040
someone's going
to go see a movie,

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:38.167
but what led them to
make that decision.

00:42:38.167 --> 00:42:39.250
What is it about the film?

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:40.999
What is it about the
person that made them

00:42:40.999 --> 00:42:42.930
interested in that content?

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:45.900
So ultimately, for-- I think
scientists in both academia

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:47.890
and in industry,
ultimately, inference

00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:49.070
is a decision making tool.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:53.070
It's what allows us to use data
and use data science to inform

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:55.800
the decisions that we
make as movie producers,

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:57.600
as executives, and
as scientists trying

00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:59.700
to evaluate different theories.

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:02.730
So let me give you sort of
another scattering of examples

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:05.592
of how we apply statistical
inference at Legendary.

00:43:05.592 --> 00:43:07.050
And again, I'll
just kind of survey

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:08.912
a few different categories.

00:43:08.912 --> 00:43:10.370
So the first category
is inferences

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:12.690
that we use to understand
content, understand

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:14.294
the actual products
that we produce.

00:43:14.294 --> 00:43:16.710
And this is another area where
natural language processing

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:17.912
is very valuable to us.

00:43:17.912 --> 00:43:19.620
So we'll look at the
textual descriptions

00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:23.159
that we have for films that are
generated by users, consumers

00:43:23.159 --> 00:43:25.200
who are discussing them
online, or even generated

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.580
by our own creative team.

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:29.040
And among other things,
we use a type of model

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:32.410
called a partially labeled
[INAUDIBLE] allocation model.

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:35.700
This is a model that can
take a large stream of text

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.860
and decompose it into
fundamental elements.

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.360
And we use this
really to understand

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:40.980
what are the themes
that are present

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.210
within different movies.

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:44.850
This allows us to statistically
compare movies to each other.

00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:46.410
Understand how they're
similar and how they're

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:47.610
different from each other.

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:49.485
And also, it's useful
for making predictions.

00:43:49.485 --> 00:43:52.380
We can use that same inferences
about thematic content

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:54.960
to anticipate what types of
themes are going to be popular

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:58.050
and what types of people
they're going to appeal to.

00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:00.230
We also use inference to
understand market behaviors

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:01.110
at large.

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:03.910
So I'll tie this back
specifically to the problem

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:07.350
that I described of having this
messy and relatively sparse

00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:09.540
data and observing supernovae.

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:11.860
Actually, in a lot of ways,
Hollywood is very similar.

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:13.560
So if you look at
any particular genre,

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:15.570
there's typically only a
few major film releases

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:17.010
in that genre per year.

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:20.510
And just like those observations
of the supernova explosion,

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:22.860
every time another
studio releases a film,

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:25.110
that's a precious
opportunity for us

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:27.300
to learn about how the
market is responding

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:28.660
to that type of product.

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:31.110
So we invest a lot of time
in building models that

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:33.690
are sensitive enough and have
a detailed enough accounting

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:36.300
of uncertainty so that we
can learn as much as possible

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:39.910
from these relatively
infrequent events.

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:41.730
And finally, we-- sort
of another category

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:43.855
is doing inference on
individual consumer behavior.

00:44:43.855 --> 00:44:46.020
So this is our tie back
to Alyssa and her decision

00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:48.189
to go see Pacific Rim,
that's she's going to do.

00:44:48.189 --> 00:44:49.980
And the way we know
she is going to do that

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:52.740
is that we look at
data from consumers

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:54.132
that we have information about.

00:44:54.132 --> 00:44:55.590
We know some of
their interests and

00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:57.570
their demographic attributes.

00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:59.911
And we know what messages
that they've been exposed to,

00:44:59.911 --> 00:45:01.410
what advertisements
they've received

00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:03.064
for different films over time.

00:45:03.064 --> 00:45:04.980
And we compare that to
their eventual decision

00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:06.114
to go see a film or not.

00:45:06.114 --> 00:45:07.530
And we learn from
that comparison.

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:08.904
Where are the
attributes and what

00:45:08.904 --> 00:45:11.160
are the messaging techniques
that actually influence

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.950
people to change and be
persuaded in their opinion

00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:16.860
to go see a film.

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:18.864
The last aspect of this
I want to talk about

00:45:18.864 --> 00:45:20.280
is one more
fundamental difference

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:22.920
that I see between prediction
in general and inference

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.590
in general, which is
that a prediction can

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:28.429
be automated directly
into business processes.

00:45:28.429 --> 00:45:29.970
So of course, we
can build algorithms

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:32.700
that directly operate on the
output of a predictive model

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:34.920
without necessarily having
any human involvement,

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.810
without having a
person actually looking

00:45:36.810 --> 00:45:38.220
at the output of that model.

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:40.110
But in my view, inference
is fundamentally

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:40.969
different from that.

00:45:40.969 --> 00:45:43.260
So in my view, to actually
extract value from inference

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:45.660
to benefit from
statistical inference

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:47.120
we need to have
people in the loop.

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:48.870
People who are actually
looking at models,

00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:51.064
interpreting them, and
communicating those results

00:45:51.064 --> 00:45:53.730
to other people who are going to
be involved in making decisions

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:55.420
based on that data.

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:59.880
So for me this has
profound implications

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.460
for how we prepare scientists
to do this type of work.

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:04.410
Frankly, whether it's
in academic research

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:05.580
or in industry.

00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:07.200
So for me, the two
big implications

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:10.300
are one, what we need to
prepare scientists to do.

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:13.380
And in my mind, the
critical aspect of this

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:15.090
is the communication part.

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:17.579
So this is the way I always
make the argument for why

00:46:17.579 --> 00:46:19.620
communication is a critical
and fundamental skill

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:20.710
for scientists.

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:23.070
And it's that you can do
the most amazing research

00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:23.830
imaginable.

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:25.524
It can be absolutely
groundbreaking.

00:46:25.524 --> 00:46:26.940
It can be rigorous,
sophisticated.

00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:28.050
It can be perfect.

00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:30.457
But if you can't
successfully persuade someone

00:46:30.457 --> 00:46:33.040
to pay attention to what you're
doing, to be interested in it,

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:34.890
and to have faith that what
we are doing is correct,

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:36.473
then it may as well
not have happened.

00:46:36.473 --> 00:46:38.470
Your work will have no
impact in the world.

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:41.070
That's why I think
communication is critical.

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:43.980
The next question is what a
step in a scientist lifecycle

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:46.292
should we focus on
building these skills?

00:46:46.292 --> 00:46:48.000
And in my mind, there's
an obvious answer

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.470
to that too, which
is that I think

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:51.630
it has to be at the
graduate student level.

00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:53.650
I think there's two
reasons for this.

00:46:53.650 --> 00:46:55.984
One is that if you ask the
question of who does science,

00:46:55.984 --> 00:46:58.566
if you look at academia and say,
who's the one doing the work?

00:46:58.566 --> 00:46:59.630
It's graduate students.

00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:02.129
The graduate students in general
in the US in different STEM

00:47:02.129 --> 00:47:04.110
fields outnumber,
postdocs outnumber faculty

00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:05.319
by nearly 10 to 1.

00:47:05.319 --> 00:47:07.110
Graduate students are
really the broad base

00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:09.720
of our enterprise of
scientific research.

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:11.550
And secondly, graduates
since of course

00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:12.924
have made different
career paths.

00:47:12.924 --> 00:47:14.880
Some of them go on into
research and academia.

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.335
Some of them go on into
industry, and many other paths.

00:47:17.335 --> 00:47:18.960
So if we want all
scientists, no matter

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.251
where they're working, to
have this kind of preparation

00:47:21.251 --> 00:47:24.210
and be equipped to communicate
the results of their work,

00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:26.325
I think we have to
target graduate students.

00:47:26.325 --> 00:47:28.200
So the last thing I'll
say is that I'm really

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:30.491
proud to have been part of
a group of graduate students

00:47:30.491 --> 00:47:31.740
here at Harvard in 2012.

00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:33.240
We founded a program
that's designed

00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:35.940
to equip graduate
students with these skills

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:37.650
and empower them to
take leadership roles

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:39.710
and how scientists
communicate to the public.

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:41.340
And that's an organization
called ComSciCon,

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:42.840
the Communicating
Science Conference

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.970
here that Alyssa kindly
alluded to earlier.

00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:48.109
We also are fortunate to have
one of the leaders of ComSciCon

00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:50.400
in the audience, Ben Cook,
who is an astronomy graduate

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:52.524
student here and leads
ComSciCon's local organizing

00:47:52.524 --> 00:47:53.439
committee.

00:47:53.439 --> 00:47:55.230
And ComSciCon really
does two things today.

00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:57.438
We have a national workshop
on leadership and science

00:47:57.438 --> 00:47:59.170
communication for
graduate students,

00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:01.710
and we have a network of
ComSciCon franchises operated

00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:03.960
by our student alums
throughout the country who

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:06.050
are spreading the work
that we do even further.

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:07.500
And if you're
interested, like me,

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:10.280
in how scientists are prepared
to communicate with the public,

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:12.613
and if you're interested in
supporting graduate students

00:48:12.613 --> 00:48:14.760
in doing this work, please
check out ComSciCon.com,

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:17.330
and please feel free to ask
me questions about it as well.

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:17.968
Thank you.

00:48:17.968 --> 00:48:25.776
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:25.776 --> 00:48:27.788
- I learned that I have
to go see Pacific Rim.

00:48:27.788 --> 00:48:28.644
- That's true.

00:48:28.644 --> 00:48:29.810
- And a lot of other things.

00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:31.200
Thank you, Nathan.

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.150
So we can take some
questions for Nathan.

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:35.270
Go ahead.

00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:38.330
- What do you think
are the differences--

00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:40.610
what do you think are the
differences between being

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:43.730
a data scientist at a non-tech
company like Legendary

00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:46.400
versus being a data
scientist at a tech company

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.932
like Facebook and Google, and
why did you choose the former?

00:48:48.932 --> 00:48:50.640
- Oh, that's a very
interesting question.

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:53.180
You know, I'll tell you what
made me really excited to join

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:55.310
the team at Legendary,
and that's the opportunity

00:48:55.310 --> 00:48:57.530
to work in a domain that
traditionally hasn't

00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:59.900
hired people with
backgrounds like mine

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:02.060
and maybe yours to
work in a space that's

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:04.550
sort of a green field
for data science

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:07.435
and for scientific
research in general.

00:49:07.435 --> 00:49:09.560
I think that's what all
scientists are looking for,

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:11.030
no matter what
domain they're in.

00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:13.580
A lot of sciences by
necessity, incremental, it's

00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:15.510
building upon something
someone else has done.

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:18.120
And that's critical to the
field, and so exciting to do,

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.060
but I think scientists
are most excited when

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:22.059
they get the opportunity
to build something new,

00:49:22.059 --> 00:49:23.435
create new
capabilities, identify

00:49:23.435 --> 00:49:24.934
and think about
problems that people

00:49:24.934 --> 00:49:26.150
haven't thought about before.

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:27.560
And for our team
at Legendary, we

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:29.268
have the opportunity
to do that every day

00:49:29.268 --> 00:49:31.081
just because
there's not a legacy

00:49:31.081 --> 00:49:33.080
of quantitative scientists
working in our field.

00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:45.010
- Not to pick on Alyssa
again, but in your example

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:48.250
about the movie ticket,
when I think of inference,

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:50.000
there's always some
error bar in the data.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.930
So how do you determine that
Alyssa has bought the ticket

00:49:52.930 --> 00:49:55.461
and what is your error bar
on her ticket buying-ness?

00:49:55.461 --> 00:49:57.460
- You come from much the
same perspective as us,

00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:00.280
which is that the uncertainly
analysis aspect of that problem

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:01.661
is absolutely critical.

00:50:01.661 --> 00:50:03.160
And so I want to
highlight some work

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:05.659
that one of our colleagues, a
Legendary Victor Lee has done.

00:50:05.659 --> 00:50:07.870
He's actually a Harvard
alum from the ICS program.

00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:09.855
He's built this
fantastic [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:09.855 --> 00:50:12.040
probalistic model to
relate the ticket sale

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:16.250
data that we have to individual
consumers' preferences,

00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:18.990
interests, and the past as
they've been exposed to.

00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:20.890
And in this
problematic framework,

00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:22.600
I think among many
reasons why it's

00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:24.610
really valuable, is that
it allows us to account

00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:26.590
in great detail for the
uncertainty associated

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:29.800
with varying channels that
people get exposed to,

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.330
advertisements from.

00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:33.460
And also the-- again, the
relatively sparse data

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:35.480
that we have available
for this type of study,

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:38.021
I would actually draw a contrast
between the type of modeling

00:50:38.021 --> 00:50:40.840
that we do in this domain, which
is called attribution modeling.

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:43.090
And the work that's done at
some of the tech companies

00:50:43.090 --> 00:50:44.650
for example, where
they are operating

00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:47.770
on the sales of digital
products that you can

00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:49.127
track very easily with a click.

00:50:49.127 --> 00:50:51.460
And in that domain, you often
have millions and millions

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:53.580
of cases, millions and
millions of data points

00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:54.550
to do this analysis on.

00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:56.410
And that scale,
perhaps uncertainty

00:50:56.410 --> 00:50:58.600
is not critical to
understand because you

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:00.769
can beat down those error
bars by sheer number.

00:51:00.769 --> 00:51:03.310
But in our domain, where tickets
are sold at brick and mortar

00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:06.310
stores, there's not a digital
tracking system for them,

00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:08.980
but instead we have to use
primary research mechanisms

00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:12.057
to collect that data, and we end
up with smaller sample sizes,

00:51:12.057 --> 00:51:13.890
understanding of it's
certainty is critical.

00:51:13.890 --> 00:51:15.400
And so this is one of the few
areas where we've actually

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:17.290
published our work
so its publicly

00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:18.940
available, and
actually and GitHub if

00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:21.160
anyone wants to download it and
build their next better version

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:21.820
of it.

00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:24.340
So if you search for my
colleague's name, Victor Lee

00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:26.110
and attribution
modeling, you can see

00:51:26.110 --> 00:51:27.590
exactly how we do that work.

00:51:34.282 --> 00:51:37.160
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:39.820
- Thank you very much
for a fascinating talk.

00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:41.121
What kind of measures--

00:51:41.121 --> 00:51:42.229
[INAUDIBLE]

00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:48.144
- Effectiveness, sure.

00:51:48.144 --> 00:51:49.810
Yeah, one of the
challenges that we face

00:51:49.810 --> 00:51:51.970
is that-- again, Hollywood
is an industry where

00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:54.719
there's relatively few
product releases per year.

00:51:54.719 --> 00:51:56.260
And of course,
everyone is absolutely

00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:58.439
critical to each
production studio.

00:51:58.439 --> 00:51:59.980
So we don't have
the ability that you

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:01.840
do in some other
industrial domains

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:03.797
to what's often called
AB tests to release

00:52:03.797 --> 00:52:05.380
the product in
different circumstances

00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:07.660
and measure which one the
performance is higher in.

00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:09.730
So we actually have to use
predictive inferential methods

00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:11.230
even to understand
the effectiveness

00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:13.174
of our other predictive
inferential methods.

00:52:13.174 --> 00:52:14.590
So a lot of the
work that we do is

00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:16.090
in building models
that predict what

00:52:16.090 --> 00:52:18.670
the outcome of film
releases in general

00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:21.730
will be so we can understand
first of all, what

00:52:21.730 --> 00:52:24.340
is the optimal strategy for us
when we're releasing our film,

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:26.320
and second of all, what would
the performance of our release

00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:28.240
had been had we made
different decisions

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:29.590
before it actually came out.

00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:31.120
And by measuring the difference
between that prediction

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:33.036
and the actual outcome,
that's one of the ways

00:52:33.036 --> 00:52:34.800
that we can determine
our efficacy.

00:52:37.315 --> 00:52:39.640
- One more question.

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:41.500
Sorry.

00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:43.360
Anybody who didn't get
to ask your question,

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:45.151
don't forget that
there's a larger question

00:52:45.151 --> 00:52:47.390
session at the end [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:48.890
- Hi.

00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:53.420
I just wanted to ask
you about kind of where

00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:55.670
you get your social data from.

00:52:55.670 --> 00:53:00.980
So you know, now we're living
in the post Cambridge Analytical

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:01.580
world.

00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:04.610
I feel like it's good
that we understand

00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:07.880
how firms like you are
collecting that kind of data.

00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:10.630
I understand how you
get your other data,

00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:14.090
but in regard to the network
relationships between people

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:16.840
and the messages their
sending between each other.

00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:19.160
- A very astute question,
and did not escape my notice.

00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:21.530
I'm sure none of yours as
well that Mark Zuckerberg is

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:23.750
actually testifying
right now in congress

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:25.170
about some of these issues.

00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:27.090
And I want to say two
things about that.

00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:28.465
One is that I'm
personally, and I

00:53:28.465 --> 00:53:30.510
think everyone who is an
advertiser is actually

00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:32.779
really glad that this
conversation is happening,

00:53:32.779 --> 00:53:34.820
and that there's going to
be a public examination

00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:37.760
of the processes by which
targeted marketing happens

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:39.050
today.

00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:42.050
Because especially for consumer
oriented brands like ours,

00:53:42.050 --> 00:53:44.147
like for movie producers,
the relationship

00:53:44.147 --> 00:53:46.730
that we have with consumers and
the trust in that relationship

00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:47.630
is critical.

00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:50.840
If we have a brand name that's
tarnished by advertising

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:53.040
practices that people
are uncomfortable with,

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:55.123
then people aren't going
to want to see our movies

00:53:55.123 --> 00:53:56.999
or buy other products
from other advertisers.

00:53:56.999 --> 00:53:58.456
And so it's really
critical that we

00:53:58.456 --> 00:54:00.314
identify where the
right boundaries are

00:54:00.314 --> 00:54:01.730
in protecting
privacy and offering

00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:03.024
services like Facebook.

00:54:03.024 --> 00:54:05.190
So I hope that this
conversation that's happening it

00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:06.680
was really productive.

00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:08.480
The second thing
I'll say is that when

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.605
I look at the capabilities
that are being developed

00:54:10.605 --> 00:54:13.400
by my colleagues right
now at Legendary,

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:15.510
and I don't want to get
into specific examples.

00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:17.750
But the ones that are most
exciting to me, actually

00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:20.300
do not rely on any individual
consumers' data at all.

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:22.550
So I'll give you an analogy
as an example for the type

00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:24.159
of thing I'm talking about.

00:54:24.159 --> 00:54:25.700
I showed you that
we do a lot of work

00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:28.370
to understand the efficacy of
different advertising channels.

00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:30.190
Maybe not a surprise
that in our industry

00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:31.940
one of the most important
ones is actually

00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:33.898
theatrical marketing,
actually showing trailers

00:54:33.898 --> 00:54:35.890
before films in cinema.

00:54:35.890 --> 00:54:37.890
And of course, that's
been done for a long time.

00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:38.780
And of course in
doing that, you don't

00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:40.520
need to know anything about
who's walking in the door.

00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:41.978
You don't need to
know the identity

00:54:41.978 --> 00:54:43.880
of any individual
showing up to see

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:45.590
your trailer in the theater.

00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:47.440
But it can still have
a big impact on them.

00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:49.100
It's also a very targeted
approach in the sense

00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:50.780
that it's being
shown only to those

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:53.870
who are obviously moviegoers,
and you can sort of

00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:56.580
choose the films that you're
showing them on as well.

00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:59.480
So with that-- by that analogy,
by using that type of strategy

00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:01.470
that operates on sort
of an aggregate level,

00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:03.678
I think we can be really
effective targeted marketers

00:55:03.678 --> 00:55:08.450
without being exposed as
having privacy concerns that

00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:10.130

00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:11.930
- Thank you, so much.

00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:17.330
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:17.330 --> 00:55:20.330
- I still think there's some
uncertainty on that Pacific Rim

00:55:20.330 --> 00:55:21.880
issue.
