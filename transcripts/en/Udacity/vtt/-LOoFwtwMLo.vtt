00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.090
So Martin suggests using an alternative approach to OOA is to

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.150
write out use cases.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.580
Recall that a use case is a simple story illustrating a single execution or

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.610
pointing out an important obstacle that the user might confront.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.465
For the case of the coffeemaker can you come up with a few use cases?

00:00:19.465 --> 00:00:22.757
What's brewin'?

00:00:22.757 --> 00:00:26.060
&gt;&gt; So if they did press the brew button, but that was,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.330
I guess, the first use case there's a couple of things that could happen.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.250
Everything could be right, because all of our pre-conditions are there,

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.400
or there could be no water for the brewing process to start, or

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.410
just the filter's not in place, or no coffee grounds.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.030
Those are some problems that could happen.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.840
&gt;&gt; So on, on that one notice that so far we haven't, we don't have an sensor for

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.020
the grounds.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.710
OK. So if there's no grounds in there you're going to get very,

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.380
very weak coffee.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.980
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.970
&gt;&gt; And if there's no filter, you're going to get your coffee pretty quickly.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.740
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.960
I guess I have a question that regards to that use case.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.230
Is the problem of them not having coffee grounds something that

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.730
the system should even worry about?

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.890
Because it seems like that would be hard to tell, like the filter being in

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.500
place I can imagine being something a sensor could tell.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.100
But how much coffee is in your, your filter could be,

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.420
maybe something that's not supported, I don't know.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.930
&gt;&gt; So this is an issue with designing software and hardware at the same time.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.400
So you could imagine, for example in the Mark 5 having a sensor for

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.680
the recep, receptacle actually clicking in.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.210
Okay.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.350
When you, when you push it in there.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.250
Trying to figure out how many grounds are in there or how, you know, how deep

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.160
the grounds are or something our hardware people haven't gotten that one yet.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.400
Okay, so we're, we're not going to be able to sense that very well.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.740
&gt;&gt; It sounds a little bit like trying to

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.950
count jelly beans in a jar or something.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.030
But anyways the other use cases I have involve remember moving or

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.970
placing the pot because we have an indicator for that.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.330
&gt;&gt; Right, right. &gt;&gt; So it's something that stood out.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.730
And then also when you fill the water receptacle.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.370
We have an indicator whether the water is there or not.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.210
So that seemed to be a, an interaction that had something the user could see.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.588
&gt;&gt; So let's consider four of those.

00:02:09.588 --> 00:02:14.460
The user press, press pushes the brew button, and that's our primary one.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.430
And then some contingent ones containment vessel is not ready.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.950
The coffee is all gone or

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.430
we could have that the, the brewing is actually complete.
