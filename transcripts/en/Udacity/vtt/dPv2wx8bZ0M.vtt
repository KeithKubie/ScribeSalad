00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.250
So in the last slide I kind of talked about that images basically have a lot of

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.540
numerical values that we can actually be traversing around on a matrix and

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.550
a regular grid.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.660
Now let's look at what we can do with that kind of stuff.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.490
One of the things I want us to think about is the whole concept of

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.000
an image histogram.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.150
An image histogram basically measures the statistics of the image.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.960
In terms of all of the gray values that exist in that image.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.040
So imagine if I could.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.600
As I have created a bin which has values of 0 to 255.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.150
And every time I will scan through this image.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.250
And every time I'll say, come down to the first one.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.390
I see the value of intensity is let's say 120, I will put one there.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.920
And then I will go find another one maybe 125.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.630
I might move around and, and

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.450
basically it starts mentioning how many pixels have a value of let's say 200?

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.050
How many pixels have a value of 100?

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.990
And that will start of kind of creating a histogram of that image and

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.480
kind of start giving you statics of that image.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.630
And this basically is what this image's histogram looks like.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.380
With a peak here, comes down, and closes this way.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.200
Now interesting thing to note is there're not a lot of full 100% white values

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.640
here, and if you look at this image, you might actually see that to be true.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.920
There's a few zeros, dark values here.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.580
But most of the information is right in the middle.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.072
Now of course, we don't have to do this for the entire image.

00:01:23.072 --> 00:01:26.880
Now the things to note is that we can actually do statistics on the whole image.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.150
We can compute the average for the entire image.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.290
You can compute the median, or

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.820
any other kind of statistical, statistical information for that image.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.220
The scope of this need not be the entire image.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.726
I could just say is I want to do it for this box.

00:01:41.726 --> 00:01:44.310
Or I want to actually, even if I could figure out how to come up with this,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.760
just this region, what would be the statistics of this, or just the,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.380
you know, pixels associated with that eye.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.220
Of course, I would have to find the scope,

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.880
the range of that region to be able to do those computations in.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.790
But that entirely depends on us.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.380
This histogram of course is for the entire image.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.020
But of course, in the, histograms could also be for specific ranges.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.560
I could do one for this region, this region, this region.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.420
And again it basically starts giving me information about what is the range of

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.670
information, of the pixel values, the intensities for that specific subpart.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.970
It could be region-based, and of course it could be channel-based.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.560
Now I haven't actually introduced concept of channels yet, but

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.290
that's coming soon.
