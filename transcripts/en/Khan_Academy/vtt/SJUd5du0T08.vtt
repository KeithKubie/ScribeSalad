00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.500
If you were to ask some
people why we have seasons,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.740
they might say that maybe
it's due to how far we

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.110
are from the sun at
different points in the year,

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.362
different points
in Earth's orbit.

00:00:13.362 --> 00:00:14.820
And what I want to
do in this video

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.440
is show you why
that isn't the case.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.810
So the line of reasoning
would go something like this.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.740
This is the sun at the center
of our solar system and roughly

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.710
at the center of Earth's orbit.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.771
And let me draw Earth's
orbit over here.

00:00:27.771 --> 00:00:29.520
And so the line of
reasoning is that there

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.900
are certain points
in Earth's orbit

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.900
where we are closer to
the sun and certain-- let

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.470
me draw a better job than that.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.886
So let's say this the point
where we're closer to the sun.

00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:37.890
We get a little further.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.973
Then we get a lot further.

00:00:38.973 --> 00:00:40.480
And then we get a
little bit closer.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.672
And then a little bit closer.

00:00:42.672 --> 00:00:44.130
And then this is
the closest point.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.090
So maybe Earth's orbit
looks something like this.

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:51.920
So the argument
would go, look, there

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.670
are points in
Earth's orbit where

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.180
we're closer to
the sun and points

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.680
where we are further
from the sun.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.200
And actually that part
of the argument is true.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.720
Earth's orbit is not
a perfect circle.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.360
And there are points
in Earth's orbit

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.100
where we are closer or
further away from the sun.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.300
And actually when we
are closest to the sun,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.870
so if Earth is right over
here, there's a word for that.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:12.860
It's called perihelion.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.110
It just means the closest
point in orbit, perihelion.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.070
Closest point in
orbit to the sun.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.040
And there is a furthest
point from the sun,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.320
and this is called aphelion.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.250
Or aphelion.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.260
I've sometimes seen it called
aphelion, pronounced ap-helion.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.210
So it is true that
Earth's orbit is not

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.650
a perfect circle around the sun.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.330
Although it's pretty close,
but it's not a perfect circle.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.420
It has a slightly
elliptical shape.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.210
And because of that,
there are times

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.169
in the year where we
are closest to the sun,

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:49.710
and there are times
of the year where

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.980
we are furthest to the sun.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.980
And the difference is about 3%.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.880
So it's not a huge
difference in distance.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.760
I've really exaggerated
the difference

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.260
in this diagram right over here.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.820
But based on this reasoning,
people would say--

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.640
and this is the flawed
part-- that when

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.900
we're closer to the sun,
this must be the summer.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.430
And when we are furthest
away from the sun,

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.580
this must be the winter.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.080
And the most obvious point
of evidence why this is not

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.037
the case is that
when it is summer

00:02:23.037 --> 00:02:24.870
at one point on the
planet, it is not summer

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.530
throughout the
planet at that time.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.200
So let me draw our planet.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:39.290
In particular, when it is summer
in the Northern Hemisphere--

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.740
actually, let me do summer
in a more warm color.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.680
When it is summer in the
Northern Hemisphere-- so here,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.155
it is summer-- it is winter
in the Southern Hemisphere.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.020
And when it is summer in
the Southern Hemisphere,

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.720
it is winter in the
Northern Hemisphere.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.740
So the entire planet does
not experience the seasons

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.360
at the same time.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.610
So that's probably, I
guess you could say,

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.850
the biggest point of data that
we observe on our planet why

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.920
this by itself cannot explain
the change in seasons.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.670
And in particular,
it really goes

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.200
against what we experience
in the Northern Hemisphere,

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.620
because our perihelion right
now is occurring in January.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.770
It is occurring during the
winter, the Northern Hemisphere

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.730
winter.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:41.510
Perihelion in right now is
during the Northern Hemisphere

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.360
winter.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.350
And when we are furthest
away from the sun,

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.370
this is actually the
Northern Hemisphere summer.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.677
So although it might seem like
a fairly intuitive idea, hey,

00:03:54.677 --> 00:03:57.260
if we're closer to the sun, the
whole planet's getting warmer,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.320
maybe that's summer.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.220
When we're further
away, the whole planet's

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.630
getting a little less
energy, that's winter.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.120
The evidence we see on Earth
goes directly against that.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.322
In particular, we don't
have the same seasons

00:04:07.322 --> 00:04:09.155
in both the Northern
and Southern Hemisphere

00:04:09.155 --> 00:04:10.580
at the same time.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.620
And in particular, in
the Northern Hemisphere,

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.530
when we're closest to the
sun, it's actually in January.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.730
It's actually in the
middle of winter.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.329
So I'll leave you
there in this video,

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.600
I've left you just saying, OK,
so the closeness to the sun

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.920
does not dictate what
season we are in.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.750
And so you're saying,
what is the reason?

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.850
And what we'll see
in the next video,

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.750
the reason is the
tilt of the axis

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.800
of the earth, the rotational
axis of the earth.
