00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.110
ERIC LANDER: My name's Eric Lander,
and I'm going to be teaching MIT's

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.540
7.00x, Introduction to Biology,
the Secret of Life.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.840
25 years ago, we began to think about
sequencing the human genome.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.800
At the time, it seemed possible.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.500
BILL CLINTON: We're here to celebrate
the completion of the first survey of

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.340
the entire human genome.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.010
Without a doubt, this is the most
important, most wondrous map ever

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.080
produced by humankind.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.210
ERIC LANDER: When we the Human Genome
Project we thought it was remarkable.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.070
But we didn't know the half of it.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.410
What's happened since then
is just mind-blowing.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.070
It's become possible to sequence DNA a
1 million times faster and cheaper

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.080
than we could before.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.020
We can now read out the secrets of
cancer, of diabetes, of heart disease,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.400
of Alzheimer's disease.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.930
This is one of the most important
revolutions in science.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:50.775
It's about our health.

00:00:50.775 --> 00:00:52.360
It's about our world.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.400
Everybody needs to know about biology.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.060
In 7.00x we're going to teach you the
basics of biology, going all the way

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.070
back to Mendel and all the way up to
techniques invented just last week.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.000
The course is going to be an opportunity
to use cutting-edge tools

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.020
from the forefront of genomics in
a introductory biology course.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.980
Science is about asking deep fundamental
questions and teasing the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.220
answers out of nature.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.420
This course is designed for anyone.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.800
The prerequisites are none.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.850
You just need an interest and a
curiosity in learning about one of the

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.080
greatest scientific stories ever told.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.810
I have never been more excited about the
opportunity for all of us around

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.910
the world to talk together about this.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.780
Everybody should know
the secret of life.
