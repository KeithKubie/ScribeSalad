Now that we are done discussing XP Extreme Programming, I

00:00:02.776 --> 00:00:04.612
would like to have a quiz, in which I make

00:00:04.612 --> 00:00:06.772
sure that some of the concepts behind XP are well

00:00:06.772 --> 00:00:10.040
understood. So, I'm going to ask you which of the following statements

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.390
about Extreme Programming are true, and here are the statements.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.700
Because of pair programming, XP requires twice the number of developers.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.260
In XP, code is rarely changed after being written. XP

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.200
follows the test driven development, or TDD, paradigm. The customer does

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.560
not need to provide any requirements in XP.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.120
XP is an iterative software development process. So I

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.700
would like for you to mark all of

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.020
the statements that you think are true about XP.
