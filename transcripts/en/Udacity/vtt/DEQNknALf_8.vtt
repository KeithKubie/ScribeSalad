00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.410
Hi, welcome to the introduction to Hadoop

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.220
and MapReduce. I'm Sarah Sproehnle. I'm the vice

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.029
president of educational services at Cloudera, the company

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.340
that helps develop, support, and manage Apache Hadoop.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.200
&gt;&gt; And I'm Ian Wrigley, I'm Cloudera's senior curriculum manager. Between us,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.650
Sarah and I have been responsible for bringing Hadoop training to well

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.310
over 20,000 people. And we're excited to bring it to a much

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.150
larger audience with Udacity. So during

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.530
this course, we're going to talk about what

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.230
Big Data is? What Hadoop is? Why Hadoop's useful? And

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.390
we're going to teach you how to write map reduce code.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.110
&gt;&gt; In fact, by the end of the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.280
course, you'll write a MapReduce program that efficiently processes

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.120
a very large web server log. And by

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.090
the end of lesson two, you'll already be running

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.810
a MapReduce job in Apache Hadoop. So let's

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.800
start. In this lesson we'll talk about what is

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.558
Big Data. We'll talk about the problems that it

00:00:48.558 --> 00:00:51.310
creates, and then how Apache Hadoop addresses those problems.
