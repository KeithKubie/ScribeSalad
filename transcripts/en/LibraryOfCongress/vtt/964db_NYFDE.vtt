00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.060
&gt;&gt; Teresa Sierra: Hi everybody.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.360
Thank you for coming.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.660
My name is Terry Sierra.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.110
I'm the Chief of the Serial and
Government Publications Divisions,

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.020
which is our sponsoring
division for this program today.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.420
We have with us local
historians, W. Douglas and Fisher

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.320
and Joann H. Buckley, who
will be discussing their book

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.600
"African American Doctors
of World War I:

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.690
The Lives of a 104 Volunteers."

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.220
I bought, can you all hear me okay?

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.520
Yeah. Okay.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.820
All right.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.060
I thought I would tell you a little
bit about how this came about,

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.060
this program came about,
and here's the story.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.410
I hope you find it interesting
because programs at the Library

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.810
of Congress start differently,
come from different places.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.460
But in this case, it started
when we received comments

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.870
on the National Digital
Newspaper program contact page

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.810
from some fellow.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.960
And he said, and I'm going
to read what he said.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.380
"My co-author, Joann H.
Buckley and I spent hours at LOC

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.570 position:56%
and online working with ProQuest
and other digital newspaper archives

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.170
to develop these biographies, and
we are most grateful for them.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.470
Without them we would not have
been able to complete our work."

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.570
So, that got our attention.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.340
We had to know what was this
book and who wrote this book?

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.070
So, at the same time that
this came to our attention,

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.430
one of our librarians, Arlene
Balkowski, was, had the assignment

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.690
of pulling and getting
things together

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.090
for her World War I exhibit.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.840
Which if you haven't seen
it, I recommend it highly.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.260
It's in the Jefferson
Building; it's fantastic.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.950
So, she was in the process
of doing that and it seemed

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.670
like a natural thing to
hand her this information.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.790
Well, Arlene ran with it and
within two months she had,

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.280
she was in touch with our authors.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.830
She had it all set up.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.020
So basically, it took
us over a year to get

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.010
to this point, but here we are.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.950
So, anyway I thought you
might want to know about that.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.440
I also wanted to tell you that one
of the things that has touched me

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.820
about knowing about these
folks and their book is

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.450
that they were both inspired
by their grandparents.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:09.660
Both grandfathers served during
the war and Joann's grandmother,

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.340
whose picture is over there,
was a nurse in New York tending

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.540
to the wounded as they came back.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.120
I was touched by that.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.570
And before I turn over the
program to them, there are a couple

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.580
of people that I need to
acknowledge who are with us today,

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.510
and we're very thrilled
to have them.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.460
They're over there in that corner.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:38.250
We have Dr., I don't if you're a
doctor, but Urbane Bass' grandson.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.550
&gt;&gt; Urbane Bass Grandson: Yes.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.850
&gt;&gt; Teresa Sierra: Okay.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.780
And Dr. Richard Sterling
grandson as well.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.900
And we're very pleased that
you could make the trip.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.390
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.690
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:53.990
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.040
&gt;&gt; Teresa Sierra: So, one
more thing, and I'll move on.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.180
Joann and Doug brought a number
of artifacts that are part

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.280
of their collections
that are on display.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.660
So, after our program, after
their presentation, please,

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.690
you can take a couple of
minutes to go and look,

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.780
ask questions and so forth.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.600
They will also be around
to sign books.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.600
I see that they are being sold in
the back if you didn't have them.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.770
But you may have it already.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:32.740
So, without any more
delays here, I give to you,

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.830 position:56%
Douglas Fisher and Joann H. Buckley.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.410
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher: Okay.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.810
&gt;&gt; Joann H. Buckley: Thank you.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.860
Terry hold on a minute.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.180
I'm giving back to Terry.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.240
We're giving back to
the Library of Congress.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.760 position:56%
We did a tremen-- , we were doing
research and writing for five years.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.300
And we spent a lot of
time in this building.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.130
And we gathered all of our
material and some of the women

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.880
in my building sat around my
dining room table for a long time

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.390
and we reviewed all this material.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.740
And then another one
had some connections

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.300
with a scanning company
and we had it scanned.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.040 position:56%
And then we had it made searchable
with some wonderful little software.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.400
This is 8000 pages of
material that we gathered he

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.170
at the Library of Congress.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:29.800
And now it's all digitized on
one subject, the World War I,

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.240
the African American Doctors,
and we're getting it back

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.160
to the Library of Congress.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.580
So here you are Terry.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.840
&gt;&gt; Teresa Sierra: Thank
you very much.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.140
We're delighted to receive it.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.090
&gt;&gt; Joann H. Buckley: We want
some new young writer in on this.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.320
Doug's grandfather,
John North Douglas,

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:53.160
commanded the 317th Motor Supply
Train of the 92nd Division,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.730
an African American combat unit.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.090
He, Doug was fascinated by his
grandfather's letters and diaries,

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.860
another book, and began
his research on the war.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.640
Jonathan Rucker was a
black doctor who take

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.510
of the 500 troops in
the supply train.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.040
Doug got to know five
of Rucker's 10 children,

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.680
even setting up a Rucker family
reunion in Natchez, Mississippi.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.700
In 2009 I entered Doug's life.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.000
I met his family.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.080
Then I met the Rucker family.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.540
I knew something of World War I.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.150
I'd been a history teacher and two

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.520
of my grandparents had
been involved in the war.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.730
My grandfather was a sergeant
with the 77th Division,

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.540
a teamster with the artillery unit.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.500
My grandmother was a nurse at
Saint Vincent's in New York,

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.850
and she took care of
the returning wounded.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.920
She didn't want any of us to
go into nursing after that.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.620
Doug wanted to write
Rucker's biography.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.700
But it was a good story,
but I could not believe

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.700
that Rucker was the only doctor.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.600
The Army just doesn't do ones.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.920 position:56%
So, we went to Fort Des Moines where
Rucker trained to find out more.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.330
No one, including the curator
at Fort Des Moines Museum,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.340
where the physicians received their
basic training knew their names

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.620 position:56%
or even how many of them there were.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.600
We spent months combing
through the files here

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.330
at National Archives
before the eureka moment

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.480
and the discovery of the list.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:41.530 position:56%
It was in an ancient folder of the
U.S. Army Surgeon General's records;

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.890
so old that the identification
tab had disintegrated.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:51.340
It as typed by some clerk 100
years ago on many sheets of paper

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.440
with columns of information;
hometowns, medical schools,

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.490
graduation years and ages.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.550
The sheets were then glued together

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:06.300
and the resulting document was
four feet long and 18 inches wide.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.110
And then it had been
folded in and in,

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.930
until it fit into a standard file.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:17.630
One hundred years ago, the United
States was largely a country

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:21.430
of racial segregation,
discrimination,

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.180
lynching and Jim Crow laws.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:30.090
These 104 men were among the
nations estimated 1500 African

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.100
American doctors.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:36.230
They had succeeded in gaining
advanced education and training

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.440
at a time when it was problematic

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.400
for any African American
to achieve such success.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.650
Yet they answered their country's
call and left their practices

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.520
to provide medical care
for the fighting men

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:54.290
of the 92nd and the 93rd Divisions.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.510
Sixty percent of these doctors came

00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:00.240
from just three African
American medical schools.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.360
The largest contingent
were graduates

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.340
of two Tennessee medical schools.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:10.830
Thirty four from Meharry Medical
School in Nashville and eight

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.630
from the University of
West Tennessee in Memphis.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:20.310 position:56%
But 16 came from Howard in D.C.
Thirteen from Leonard Medical School

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:25.240
at Shaw University in
Raleigh, two went to Harvard,

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.950
three from the University of
Illinois, two from the University

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:34.170
of Michigan, and two from
Northwestern Medical School.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.480
Why would they enlist?

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.150
They expected times
would be different.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:43.550
After the war, they thought they'd
be recognized for their service.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.260
They thought all men of
their race would benefit.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.200
But nothing changed after the war.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.890
But some of, many of these
men would become the leaders

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:58.440
of their communities and
organizations like the NAACP

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.760
that would make racial
equality possible.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.330
So we had to tell their stories.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:09.120
We spent the next five years
at the Library of Congress,

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.250
the National Archives,
numerous state

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.710
and city historical
associations, libraries,

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.540
and with a variety
of newspaper sources.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.520
We met the children
and the grandchildren

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.050
of these extraordinary men.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:30.640
Initially we wrote four historical
journals and spoke to small groups.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:36.070
Then, after a chance meeting with
Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr.,

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:40.480
in the elevator of Hay-Adams
Hotel in Washington, well,

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:45.210
actually what happened was we had
gone to a wedding the night before.

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.440
And we were coming down
to go to breakfast.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:52.100
We got out of the elevator and we
saw Henry Louis Gates checking in.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.250
So we stepped over to
the side and we waited

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.010
until he got in the elevator.

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.010
And then we jumped in with him.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:02.160
And we started talking as
fast as we possibly could.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.220
And so, he said, "What
is this, a hustle?"

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.790
And we said, Doug said,
"Absolutely."

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:11.350
So, we told him about the
project and so he had us, he said,

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:15.770
I don't have a card, but here,
I'll repeat my email address.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:17.600
I want you to send me one.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.900
And so, we did.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.520
And in the subject line
we put, Hay-Adams Hustle.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.280
It was a Sunday we sent it.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.580
Monday, we heard from him.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.690
He hired us to write 15 of them.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:31.100
So, he wanted shorter ones.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.730
We're still writing for him.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:35.180
We're still doing shorter
biographies

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:40.010
for his African American
National biography.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:43.650
We did this and then
the book came next.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:49.560 position:56%
And now Doug will talk about the
Army in 1917, as we entered the war.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:55.300
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher: There's your
arrow there for your advancing.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.600
&gt;&gt; Joann H. Buckley: Okay.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.590
This one.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:00.890
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher: Yes.

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.610
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher:
Thank you for coming.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:11.360
Now prior to World War I
the U.S. Army was tiny.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.920 position:56%
I mean, 200,000 people spread around
the world and around this country.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.400
And it was totally segregated.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.830
Black officers were
virtually non-existent.

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:29.570 position:56%
Nevertheless, between 1917 and 1919,
400,000 African American men served.

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:32.720
Most of them were in
labor and support units.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.980
But 10 thous-- , 10 percent, or
40,000 of these troops served

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.940
in the combat units that
we've talked about, the 92nd

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.540
and the 93rd divisions in France.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:46.160
The black officers were
trained at Fort Des Moines Iowa,

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.740
with 639 line officers completing
a special officers' training camp,

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.400
only done once.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.000
And 104 doctors, who
we're writing about,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.620
completed the medical officers'
training camp that was there.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.820
Things had been written about
the officers' training camp,

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:04.270
but not the medical officers,
and we uncovered that.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:07.490
Training for the doctors was
rigorous, with a 10-mile march

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:10.630
and a three-day outdoor encampment.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.840
In this picture that you can see
here, this is a picture of the guys

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.380
out in their tents at the
encampment on the state fairgrounds

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.260
and you can see the
rollercoaster in the background.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:24.270
I don't think they were
having a lot of fun, though.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:28.100
These doctors were also given
command of the medical detachments

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:33.640 position:56%
with 10 enlisted men in each of the
detachments, saving some leadership.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.300
After the MOTC training, the
doctors were assigned to the 92nd

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.990
or 93rd Divisions and spread

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:45.070
across eight different U.S.
encampments across the country.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:50.950
Then in 1918, the combat
units were sent to France.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:55.410
The 93rd Division, which
consisted of 12,000 soldiers

00:13:55.410 --> 00:14:00.290
and four national guard
regiments arrived overseas first.

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:04.670
The French wanted American troops
to fill its decimated ranks.

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:08.890
So General Pershing gave him the
93rd Division, the four regiments

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:12.080
of that, and the French loved it.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.010
They were terrific.

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:17.490
They fought more time, one of
the units there fought longer

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:21.230
than any other American
unit in combat.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:25.330
The 92nd Buffalo Division,
consisting of 27,000 men,

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:30.730
arrived in mid-1918 and fought with
the American 1st and 2nd armies.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.900
That's the unit that my
grandfather served in.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:38.790
The 104 doctors were assigned to
frontline medical detachments,

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:44.630
ambulance companies, and field
hospitals, right up front.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:49.640
They endured combat and suffered
aerial and artillery attacks.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.940
Many were wounded from the
effects of exploding gas shells.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:56.010
Gas was a terrible
problem in World War I.

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:58.080
One doctor was killed in field.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.680
His grandsons are with
us here today.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.620 position:56%
Interesting, almost as many American
soldiers died of disease as died

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:10.920
in combat in World War I.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.000
Army doctors such as
ours faced both the enemy

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.150
and killer diseases including the
horrendous Spanish flu epidemic

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:22.920
of 1918 that killed tens of
millions of people worldwide.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.860
Today we're going to
share a glimpse of three

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.330
of these extraordinary doctors
with you and Joann's going

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:29.720
to lead off introducing you

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.670
to Dr. Thomas E. Jones,
who is from this area.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:52.040
&gt;&gt; Joann H. Buckley: Dr. Thomas E.
Jones served with great distinction

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.770
for more than five years
in the National Guard

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:59.160
and the Army earning a
Distinguished Service Cross,

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:03.060
the highest Army declaration
for heroism.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.560
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher:
Second highest.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.740
&gt;&gt; Joann H. Buckley:
The second highest.

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.130
A military expert.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:10.860
No, he is really.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.380
He also earned the
French Croix de Guerre

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.880
for his courage under
fire in France.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:22.000
Born in Lynchburg, Virginia,
where his father was a merchant,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.190
Jones attended public
schools and graduated

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:28.200
from Lynchburg High School in 1896.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:33.080
He went on to Howard University in
Washington, D.C. During college,

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:37.900
Jones worked at different
time as a newsboy, waiter,

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.200
messenger, laborer, and watchman.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.980
It was hard work, but
he was cheerful

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:47.950
and determined, and he succeeded.

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:53.410 position:56%
He entered Howard University's
Medical School in 1908 and graduated

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:56.830
with his MD degree in 1912.

00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:01.410
He interned at D.C.'s Freedman
Hospital for a year, and then,

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:04.880
was then appointed
anesthetist at the hospital;

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:11.210
a position he actually held after
the war and through until 1917.

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:17.890
Nineteen 14 he served in the D.C.
National Guard as a Lieutenant

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:22.850
in Company C of the
1st Separate Battalion;

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:27.350
an African American component
of the National Guard.

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:31.820
Nineteen 17, when America
entered the first World War,

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:36.420
Jones volunteered for the
Army Medical Reserve Corp

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:40.720
and entered the Medical Officers'
Training Camp at Fort Des Moines.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:44.400
After 60 days of training
he was sent to Camp Meade

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:49.090
to join the 368th Infantry
Regiment of the 92nd Division.

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:53.370
And he served with them
throughout the war.

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:56.730
Lieutenant Jones received his
Distinguished Service Cross

00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:01.550
and French Croix de Guerre in
the Argonne Forest in France.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:03.470
He was also promoted to Captain

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:09.330
for displaying extraordinary
heroism while attending the wounded

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:13.280
in an open area under
machine gun fire.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:18.920
The Army citation says quote,
"While dressing a wounded runner,

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:23.000
a machine gun bullet passed
between his arms and his chest.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.350
And the man was killed
within a few yards of him."

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:32.240
Another account of the incident
says that "Under falling shell

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:37.970
and machine gun fire the boys say
he walked out and got wounded men

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:41.410
with same coolness that was his
when he was putting a patient

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:43.730
to sleep for an operation."

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:48.430
Following the war, Dr. Jones
returned to Freedman's Hospital

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:52.930
in Washington, D.C. as
resident assistant surgeon.

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:59.040
In 1936, he was promoted to the
top job, becoming Surgeon in Chief,

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:05.440
until he retired in 1942,
after 27 years of service.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:10.230
He also taught at Howard
University's Medical School.

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:13.960
The Smithsonian has a
photograph of Dr. Jones

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.590
with Eleanor Roosevelt
in its collection.

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:19.760
He was clearly recognized
as a leader

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.000
in the African American community.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.500
His commitment to his
community is remarkable.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.990
He was an active member
of at least 10 national

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:33.460
and local benevolent associations.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:39.950 position:56%
Militarily he belonged to the League
of Valor whose members are medal

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:42.160
of honor winners and recipients

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.990
of the Army Distinguished
Service Cross.

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:53.050
In 1934, his American Legion Post
adopted a resolution deploring

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:55.350
segregation and civil service

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:59.100
and urging the passing
of anti-lynch bill.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:04.380
In 1941, as Surgeon and
Chief of Freedman's Hospital,

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:10.270 position:56%
he represented the medical world in
the second selective service drawing

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:14.030
in Washington, D.C.
for World War II.

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:19.160
By 1950, at the age of
70, he was semi-retired,

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:24.110
still maintained an office
downstairs in his four-story house

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:31.860
that we found in Washington,
D.C. It's a handsome townhouse.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:38.970 position:56%
He died of a coronary thrombosis
1958, just before his 78th birthday.

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:42.940
He was buried with full
medical, military honors

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:48.100
in Arlington National Cemetery,
next to his first wife.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.790
Dr. Jones believed
that the best interest

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:55.820
of his race would be promoted by
acting for the good of the masses,

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:59.590
rather than by the
accumulation of property

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:04.780
and by investing financially
in local community projects.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:09.740
He as an extraordinary, patriotic,
courageous, well-respected,

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:13.420
and hardworking physician
and community leader.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:17.350
And now Doug with talk about
another of our doctors.

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:20.960
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher: Thanks Joann.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:32.080
Our next distinguished MOTC
graduate is a Dr. William Holmes,

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.620
also known as Billy Dyer.

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:38.740
He's featured in a book by Clif
Cleaveland entitled "Healers

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:43.420
and Heroes", published back in
2004 by the American College

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:47.020
of Physicians in Philadelphia.

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:48.320
You can see the picture there.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.620
The arrow's pointing to him.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.990
It's one of the six that
they featured there.

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:56.720
He was also the subject of a 1992
book by an author, William Maxwell,

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.290
entitled "Billy Dyer
and Other Stories."

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:02.860
Billy was a personal
friend of William Maxwell's.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.600
Uh, Dr. Dyer also served in
the Buffalo Division along

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.210
with my grandfather,
Captain Douglas.

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:12.640
Dyer's written accounts and
descriptions which we found

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:17.050
in Schomburg, up in New York in the
library up there, his descriptions

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:20.340
of France helped us paint
really vivid mental images

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.660
of what they experienced.

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:25.110
His hometown of Lincoln,
Illinois halfway

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:27.590
between St. Louis and Chicago.

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:31.500
After graduation from Lincoln
College and the University

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:37.120
of Illinois Medical School in
1916, he interned in Kansas City.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.130
Internships were very
dear, very hard to find

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:43.370 position:56%
for black physicians in those years.

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:47.070
After Dyer volunteered for
Army service he received orders

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:48.900
to proceed to Fort Des Moines.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:53.340
When he left Lincoln,
300 people saw him off

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:56.370
at the train station; amazing.

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:59.060
His diary recorded his
disappointment with his quarters

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.610
when he reached the fort at Fort
Des Moines, which he described

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:03.620
as a cold room in a stable.

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.510
A lot of people weren't
very happy with that.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:16.040
[ Audio cuts off ]

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.750
And harrowing war-time
experience clearly shows

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:22.160
that in combat he gained
an appreciation

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.930
for the value of the drills.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:27.000
After completely his
training, he was assigned to,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.180
as the Medical Officer to the 92nd
Division's 317th Ammunition Train.

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:37.020
He was assigned to Camp Funston,
Kansas out in the Midwest.

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:42.070
In route from Hoboken, New Jersey,
New York basically to Brest France,

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:44.020
Lieutenant Dyer's assignment
at sea was

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:49.430
to give physical examinations
to 600 men.

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:54.420
He said the only excitement during
the voyage was on June 21, 1918,

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:58.330
when shots were fired from all the
surrounding ships at what proved

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:00.630
to be a floating beer keg.

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:07.350
Dyer wrote that once in France,
the 317th was marked to a barracks

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:10.580
that had been a prison camp
during the time of Napoleon.

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:13.730
He said it was a terrible
and dirty old place.

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:16.750
In a letter home, my grandfather
described these same barracks

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:21.180
as being badly crowded with
no beds or cots and wrote

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:24.730
that they were supplied with
French beds, which consisted

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:29.750 position:56%
of three one inch by 12 inch planks,
pine planks, fastened together

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.290
with two cleats at the
bottom to keep them

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:33.850
from lying flat on the floor.

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:36.890
There was no straw and they
were very uncomfortable.

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:41.030
It was called a rest camp, where
troops regained their land legs

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.640
and rest after the
three-week ocean voyage.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:48.590
My grandfather wrote that the term
rest was a gross misnomer, saying,

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:52.100
"I defy anyone to rest there."

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.400
The officers were assigned
to small room downstairs.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:25:00.170
It was damp, musty, and smelled
of urine and fecal matter.

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:03.280
There was a stone floor and
there were no lights available,

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.790
but they had a few candles.

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:09.850
It was summer and the weather
was drizzly and disagreeable.

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:13.580
The flies were thick and ravenous
and the windows were not screened.

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:17.300
My grandfather's letter
reported, "The men were touchy

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.150
for want of sleep and food.

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:23.450 position:56%
They were not fed from early
morning until late in the afternoon.

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:26.280
He said, finally, got
a few bedding rolls.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.080
Mine is missing.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:31.850
Got four used blankets
from a guardhouse.

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:33.750
They smelled awful.

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:38.350
The atmosphere seems thoroughly
saturated with a fecal odor.

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:41.680
Fortunately, after several days
they boarded trains going eastward

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:45.210
to the division's training
area Bourbonne-les-Baines.

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:49.650 position:56%
Then at the end of August, they
were on the move again to the front.

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:52.710
Dyer recalled the convoy
drove without lights

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:56.440
and they kept passing broken down
Army vehicles and infantry men,

00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:00.460
who because of fatigue, had
fallen out of line to rest.

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.470
They always traveled at night.

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:05.230
The convoy destination
was Raon-l'Etape

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:08.750
in the eastern Vosges
mountains, which was described

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:12.210
as a desperate place full of
graves, where Dyer said he gave

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:16.590
up counting the houses
with the roofs gone.

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:18.210
After nearly a month
in the mountains,

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:20.920 position:56%
they moved up to the Argonne Forest.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:24.260
Dyer wrote quote, "No
accommodations here.

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.940
Not even water to drink
or cook with.

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:30.720
Mud everywhere over shoe tops.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:34.100
While camped in this wet filthy
woods, many of our boys became ill

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:36.350
from the dampness,
cold, and exposure,

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:42.020
thereby causing me much work
and worry caring for them.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:46.570
On September 25, at the outset of
the great Meuse-Argonne Campaign,

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:50.570
the 47-day campaign where more
lives were lost than ever before

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:53.220
in any battle of American troops.

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:57.890
Dyer said quote, "The old woods
trembled as if by earthquake.

00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:01.060
The flashes of the cannon
lighted up the inside of our tents

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:03.090
and our ears were deafened.

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:06.120
At the hospital, Dyer
saw a steady stream

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.080
of ambulances bring
wounded soldiers.

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.380
The dead were also being
brought back on trucks piled

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:14.990
like cord wood and dripping blood."

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:19.480
In early October, the 92nd
Division was transferred

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:23.870
to the AEF's second Army
and Dyer was sent southeast,

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:27.630
through a wasteland, which he
described, which he said, in which,

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:29.720
even the grass was burned.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:33.780
And they were sent to the village
of Belleville on the Moselle River.

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:38.120
He set up an infirmary in a
small electrical plant there.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.440
Because of the constant
cold and rainy weather,

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:44.390
there was a great deal of sickness
among the African American troops.

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:47.060
The division's artillery had
been in training in the south

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:49.960
of France, separated, since July.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:53.130
And Dyer wrote that, "Major
Howard, my commanding officer

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:57.160
from whom I'd been separated about
four months, called to see me

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.990
and complimented me
on my good work."

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:01.720
He was very pleased with that.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:06.180
All through October and early
November the 317th Ammunition Train

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:07.480
labored on.

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.310
Everyone was hearing
much talk of peace

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:11.410 position:56%
and preparing for the final drawing.

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:16.260
The 92nd was part of a large
attack on the city of Metz,

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:19.420
the German stronghold
throughout the war.

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:24.670
The attack began in
earnest on November 9, 1918.

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:28.800
And in it the division
suffered many casualties.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:32.500
The fighting, the war,
essentially ended two days later

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:36.230
with the November 11
armistice on the 11th hour

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:39.560
of the 11th day of the 11th month.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.580
Lieutenant Dyer wrote a month
later, in December 1918,

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.950
he was awakened by an orderly.

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:51.200
In a heavy fog, a passenger train
had plowed into a troop train full

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.430
of happy French soldiers
returning home from the front.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:59.330
The bodies of the dead and dying
were pinned under the wreckage.

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:02.680 position:56%
"He spent the night", he said,
"Dressing wounds and putting splints

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.200
on broken arms and broken legs."

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:10.740
Just three days later, on
December 18th, the 317th began

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:14.190
to leave Belleville on foot.

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:19.660
Six days later, after traveling
on foot, by truck, and train,

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:23.810
they finally reached the village of
[Inaudible] in Normandy in the rain

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:27.760
and the snow on Christmas
Eve, where even the people

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.560
of [Inaudible] took them in.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:35.580
Finally, two months later on the
morning of February 22, 1919,

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:38.810
the 317th marched to Brest
Harbor where they were ferried

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:42.800
out to the ship Aquitania,
for the trip home.

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:49.690 position:56%
Dyer said his cabin had quote,
"Mahogany fittings and private bath,

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:54.020
taps for fresh and
salt water and soap.

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.300
A far cry from anything
he'd experienced

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:59.040
or encountered during
his time in France.

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:05.220 position:56%
Then after the war, he established
his medical practice in Kansas city.

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:08.470
In addition to his private medical
practice, he served as a surgeon

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:12.870
for the Santa Fe railroad, an
enormous enterprise at the time.

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:15.310
He was invited to join
the American Association

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:18.090
of Railway Surgeons in 1946.

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:23.040
And in 1947 he was the lone legal
member present among 400 surgeons

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.070
who attended the 58th
annual convention

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:28.600
at the Palmer House in Chicago.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.920
He was quoted as saying, "I was
quite interested in the types

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.660
of operations for mangled
hands and feet.

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:38.080
For quite frequently, we railroad
physicians have to care for victims

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.810 position:56%
of railroad [inaudible] and wrecks."

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:45.030
He was also the surgeon
for the Kansas City,

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:47.120
Kansas Police Department.

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:50.260
A 1947 news article said he served

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.930
as the lone police surgeon
there for many years.

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:58.840
He was honored in 1953 by
his home city of Lincoln,

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:02.040
Illinois at its Centennial
celebration as one

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:06.750
of its 10 most distinguished
men and the only negro.

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:10.940
In January 1956, at 70 years
old, he wrote from Kansas City

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:14.140
to an old friend in California
saying, "In the last four months,

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:18.370 position:56%
I've been put on the staffs of three
of the major hospitals in our city.

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:21.470
I thought at first it was an honor,
but with the increase in activities

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:26.330
that such appointments entailed,
my work has increased twofold."

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:29.520 position:56%
Since it was the first time that one
of my race had such appointments,

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.630
I'd been working diligently
to make good,

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:34.660
thereby keeping those doors open.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:38.030
At age 70, he was still a
surgeon for the Santa Fe Railroad

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:41.250
and the Kansas City
Police Department.

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:45.630
He died in 1958, at
age 71, and was buried

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:48.850
in a mixed-race cemetery
in Lincoln, Illinois.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.970
And now Joann will talk
to you about Dr. Bass.

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:11.820
&gt;&gt; Joann H. Buckley: Dr.
Urbane Bass was the only one

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:15.540
of the 104 African
American doctors of the 92nd

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:20.510
and 93rd Divisions killed
in action in France.

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:25.620
About five years ago Doug and
I climbed into the choir loft

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:29.510
at the Fredericksburg Shiloh
Baptist Church to get pictures

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:33.570
of this extraordinary stained
glass window that was installed

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:37.600
by the congregation in his memory.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:43.000
Bass was born in Richmond, Virginia
to Rosa and Richard J. Bass.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.260
His father was a salesman,
shoes and clothing

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:50.580
in the 1880's, insurance
in the 1900's.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:53.880
His mother stayed home
with the six children.

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:57.910
The family live in Richmond
on East Duval Street.

00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:00.750
Urbane worked as a
clerk while in school.

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:06.780
He graduated from Virginia Union
University in Richmond in 1902

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:09.280
and then went on to
Leonard Medical School

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:14.100
of Shaw University
in Raleigh in 1906.

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:19.030
After graduating from
Leonard, he married Maude Vass,

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:23.960
the sister of his medical
school classmate, Rufus Vass.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:28.580
And then he opened a
medical practice and pharmacy

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:32.500
on Williams Street,
in Richmond, Virginia.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.500
By 1909 he'd moved his practice

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:38.660
and his pharmacy north
to Fredericksburg.

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:42.450
He was the city's first
African American physician

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:44.110
since reconstruction.

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:49.310
The practice located on Amelia
Street was well received

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:51.750
by the African American community,

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:57.320
in spite of the local hospital's
denial of privileges to Bass.

00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:02.830
By 1916 his practice and
his family were growing.

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:12.100
In 1917, this father of four
wrote to Secretary of War,

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:15.760 position:56%
Newton Baker, offering his services.

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:21.110
One of Bass' friends, J.B.
Morris told his family,

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:25.080
Dr. Bass was dedicated
to serving his country

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.800
in a time of critical need.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:32.590
He knew or men were going
to die in France and told me

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:37.500
that he would give his life
to save them, if he had to.

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:42.840
I could see the sincerity
in his eyes, Baker said,

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:45.460
I mean, excuse me, Morris said.

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:48.970
"He was committed to the end."

00:34:48.970 --> 00:34:51.930
Bass received his commission
as First Lieutenant

00:34:51.930 --> 00:34:56.490
in the Medical Reserve Corp and
was 37 years old when he reported

00:34:56.490 --> 00:35:03.600
to duty at Fort Des
Moines on August 14, 1917.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:07.790
After basic medical officer
training at Fort Des Moines he

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:13.920
and Rufus Vass were sent
to Camp Funston, Kansas.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:19.530
Bass went to France with
the 372nd infantry regiment

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:23.110
of the 93rd Division, which
was immediately turned

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:27.500
over to the French and
sent to the front lines.

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:33.790
On October 17, 1918, he
was frantically working

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:40.200 position:56%
on wounded soldiers at a forward
aid station under heavy German fire.

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:44.830
He was hit with shrapnel when
a shell exploded near him.

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:47.530
Both of his legs were severed.

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:52.710
While he was dying, he actually
continued to direct medics

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:55.350
on how to treat his wounds.

00:35:55.350 --> 00:36:00.190
He died before he could
be taken from the field.

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:06.320
Bass was awarded the Distinguished
Service Cross posthumously.

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:10.340
And that citation reads,
"For extraordinary heroism

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:19.530
in action near Mont Blanc, France
on October 1 through 5, 1918."

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:23.900
"Lieutenant Bass", it said,
"Administered first aid in the open

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:27.160
and under prolonged
and intense shell fire,

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:32.490
until he was severely wounded and
carried from the field", unquote.

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:38.060
It was the policy then
that if someone died

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:40.770
in the field they were buried,

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:43.570
until they could be returned
to the United States.

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:46.240
So, he died in 1918.

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:52.500
He was not returned for
reburial until July of 1921.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:57.660 position:56%
He became the first African American
commissioned officer to be buried

00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:00.220 position:56%
in Fredericksburg National Cemetery.

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:05.270
He lies in Officers' Row near
the entrance to the cemetery.

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:07.500
The Social Services building

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:13.640
in Fredericksburg is named
the Bass-Ellison building

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.780
in honoring him and
Richard C. Ellison,

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:21.480
another African American doctor
who served the community.

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:26.740
And back to the Shiloh Baptist
Church, you really have to go

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.270
to Fredericksburg and
see this to believe it.

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:33.110
But you can see the, from
the inscription there

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:40.670
that the community was very much
in his debt and very distraught

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:44.860
about losing him at
the, during the war.

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:50.450
Dr. Bass had a love worthy of
envy when he married Maude Vass.

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:55.920
The couple had four children,
three daughters, Ann, Frances-May,

00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:01.760
and Ruth and one sign,
son, Urbane F. Bass.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:08.180
After his death, Maude
was a widow at age 32.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:11.090
She had quite a difficult
time accepting his death.

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:15.150
In 1922 she was staying
with a family Washington,

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:19.630
D.C. when she was taken
to a Washington asylum

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:23.160
because of her violent,
nervous state.

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:27.360
A few weeks earlier she
had attempted suicide

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:30.790
by jumping from a two-story window.

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:35.240
It was her father, the
Reverend Samuel N. Vass,

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:40.690
who had her committed for
care for several months.

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:47.020
Early in 1923 she and four
children moved back to her hometown

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:49.610
of Raleigh, North Carolina.

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:54.310
There she raised her family
and taught music to the blind

00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:59.380
for 30 years at North Carolina
State School for the Blind.

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:01.820
Maude and her Vass family saw

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:07.530
that all four children were
well-educated for productive lives.

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:12.250
Daughter Frances Mae Bass
graduated from Shaw University.

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:16.400
She completed some graduate work at
Columbia University and then worked

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:20.730
for the Durham City School
System for nearly 30 years.

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:25.060
She married Charles Clinton
Spalding of Durham, General Counsel

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:29.360
of the North Carolina Mutual
Life Insurance Company.

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:33.780
Ruth graduated from Shaw University
and obtained a master's degree

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.890
from the University of Michigan.

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:40.500
She taught at Mary Ellen
Teacher's College in Crockett,

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:44.540
Texas before marrying
Moses Newsome [ph].

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.280 position:56%
The couple then moved to Charleston,

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.920
West Virginia where the
reverend was the pastor

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:51.890
of the First Baptist Church.

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:55.570
Ann married Richard Sterling
and moved to Washington,

00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:59.460
D.C. Urbane Bass, Jr. followed

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:05.590
in his father's footsteps
and became a physician.

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:08.400
And we are honored that we have two

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:13.180
of the Bass grandchildren
with us today.

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:15.510
Thank you.

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:21.540
[ Applause ]

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:22.840
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher:
Now in closing,

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.330
let me say we've enjoyed sharing
with you a glimpse of the lives

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:28.090
of these three really
extraordinary doctors.

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:32.460
Now doctors Jones, Dyer,
and Bass were only three

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:37.850
of the 104 African American doctors
who answered their country's call.

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:39.300
Excuse me.

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:44.170
But all of the 104 doctors endured
as black in a Jim Crow world

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:47.900
and what they accomplished
despite society's racial divide is

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:49.560
truly remarkable.

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:52.160
If you live to see the
Civil Rights legislation

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.680
of the mid 1960's enacted,
but their efforts

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:58.970
and accomplishments definitely
helped pave the way for it.

00:40:58.970 --> 00:41:03.380
The 18 months that these
doctors spent serving in the Army

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:08.630
between 1917 and 1919, provided
them with new medical skills

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:11.320
and life experiences well
beyond what they'd learned

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:13.830
in their medical school lessons.

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:15.130
Their new organization

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:19.150
and leadership skills were
unique for most physicians.

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:22.290
Most were able to use these skills
and continue to serve our nation

00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:26.100
in their African American
communities for decades.

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:30.650
The story of these patriotic men

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:35.330
in World War I was lost
history for 100 years.

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:38.360
We're just delighted and pleased we
rediscovered it so it can be shared

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:42.700
with you and future
scholars a century later.

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:44.690
Thank you very much for
you time and attention.

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:46.110
We'd be glad to answer questions

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:48.490
and we have some things
there you can look at.

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:50.290
Thank you.

00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:55.990
[ Applause ]

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:57.290
&gt;&gt;Questions.

00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:59.860
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just want to
thank you both so much.

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:04.360
And yeah, if you want to ask
questions, the one thing we ask is

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.510
that you have to repeat
the questions right?

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:10.730
You have to repeat the question
so it will be on the webcast.

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:14.660
And thank you so much Joann
and Doug for your presentation.

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:18.240
It was so eye-opening and I
just think it was terrific

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.630
and I hope people have
more questions.

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:21.930
Thank you.

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:30.870
&gt;&gt; By the time of World War II
the Army was still segregated.

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:33.000
Did they have separate
training camps

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.130 position:56%
for the doctors during World War II?

00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:38.630
Had they learned from the
World War I experience?

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:40.660
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher: They did
not have a special training camp.

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.770
This was the only one
in history was this one

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:45.240
at Fort Des Moines in
the First World War.

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:48.860
There were reserve units
that had been developed.

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:52.490
And so you still had National
Guard units and reserve units.

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:55.630
You had people slightly better
prepared for the Second World War

00:42:55.630 --> 00:43:00.510
than we were for the First,
but not terribly well.

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:01.810
Yeah.

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:07.760
&gt;&gt; I was just wondering
as I was listening to you,

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:12.160
and looking at all those pictures,

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:15.500
how did they get medications
out to the field?

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:19.520
Did they have a way to, did
they carry it with them?

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.670
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher: The question
was how did they get medications

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:24.020
and things to the field?

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:28.530
And actually, they med-,
they had a medical unit.

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:30.660
The called it a Sanitary Train.

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:34.990
There was 317th Sanitary Train
and that was all of the medics,

00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:38.900
the doctors, and it included
people that were doing logistics.

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:42.940
And so my grandfather's
supply train, for example,

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:47.320
would be carrying medicines
and things to the front.

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:53.880
The difficulty was that the Germans
by this time had decent aviation

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:57.460
and they also had artillery in
place and it was a static front.

00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:01.830
So people, it was very hard to move
things around during the daytime.

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:05.580
So it all had to be done in the
dark at night with blackouts.

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:07.940
I mean, it's hard to imagine, I
mean, thank goodness the moon came

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:10.860
out a few times to help
them get these things done.

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:14.230
But they would move things
up to a forward aid station

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:16.960
and take the bandages,
the basic bandages, so on.

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:20.410
And then they would come
back to an ambulance company

00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:22.740 position:56%
where there would be more logistics.

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:25.440
And then they would come back
to a field hospital where,

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:27.360
where they would be, and
then they would be triaged

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:30.310
and to base hospitals which
were even further back

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:33.330
if they were not able
to recover there.

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:36.000
But it's the logistics
and the organization

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.660
that it takes to run an Army.

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:40.040
I mean the division had 28,000 men.

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:41.550
That's a lot of people.

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:43.580
It took days to move them.

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:46.090
It took lots of trucks,
lots of trains,

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:49.100
and lots of people walking long
distances just to move them

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:51.330
from one location to the next.

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:55.060 position:56%
If you look at the, there's one map
over here that shows the disposition

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:58.920
of these forces at the end
of the war in December.

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:01.650
And you can im-- , I
mean, it's just miles.

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:04.140
It's miles in this direction,
miles in that direction

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:07.890
to get 28,000 people
disbursed and organizationally.

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:10.990
They learned a lot about
organization and how

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:14.760
to organize hospitals
in the process.

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.060
Yes.

00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:19.270
&gt;&gt; Were the base hospitals
also segregated?

00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:21.300
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher:
I don't believe so.

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:24.940
I think, no, I can't
imagine that they were.

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:31.180
Actually, the hospitals were
segregated within the hospital.

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:34.060
But the hos-- , they didn't
have a black-based hospital.

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:36.440
So, they had segregation
within it, but they didn't have

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:40.610
that many people that were moved
back to the base hospitals.

00:45:40.610 --> 00:45:47.060 position:56%
If you didn't die in the front,
then you would be disfigured perhaps

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.440
from the shrapnel and the gas.

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.800
But the numbers were much
more, were different.

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:57.740 position:56%
There were 200,000 African Americans
in the combat zone over there,

00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:01.770
but only 40,000 of them
were in actual combat.

00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:05.830
That's dwarfed by the size of
the American, the white officers

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:07.680
and the white soldiers
that were there.

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:10.170
So, there were many more of
them that had to be cared for.

00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:12.030
Yes. Yes.

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:23.410 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And how many families did you get
a chance to interview [inaudible]?

00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:25.160
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher:
A dozen, 15, 20.

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:26.470
&gt;&gt; Joann H. Buckley: Maybe 20.

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:28.200
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher:
Maybe 20, uh-huh.

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:32.580
Well we met two people today
that we'd never talked to before.

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:38.330
Urbane Bass and Mr. Sterling, the
grandsons of Dr. Urbane Bass here.

00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:41.090
And so, we continue
to have people reach

00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:43.640
out as they learn the
story and so on.

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:46.220
We had one very interesting
experience in Los Angeles.

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:49.330
One of the physicians is
named Claudius Ballard

00:46:49.330 --> 00:46:51.300
and he fought with the French.

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:52.600
Quite an interesting guy.

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.300
It's a good story in here too.

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:57.770
But his son is now in his 90's.

00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:59.490
We spent some time with his son.

00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:02.710
He's a retired fire
chief in Los Angeles.

00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:06.450
And we met, we spent time with
his grandson who's a minister

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:08.160
out in Los Angeles.

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:09.580 position:56%
We did this just a couple months ago

00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:13.170
when we were coming back
from a trip out west.

00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:17.940
The family people have learned
so much from us and we've learned

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:19.240
so much from the families.

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:22.490
It's been a wonderful
exchanging of information.

00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:26.710
And it's, a lot of these children,

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:29.990
grandchildren were
born after the war.

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:33.180
So, what did their dads or
grandads tell them about the war?

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:35.990
Usually not much.

00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:38.870
So, we've been able to give
them a lot of information

00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:41.400
that they had no idea about
and then they've been able

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.700
to give us a lot as well.

00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:46.540
&gt;&gt; Joann H. Buckley: When we were
at Ballard, the son, his unit,

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:51.480
when we were at his home, we were
telling him, because he had been,

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:57.180
he and his father never
could talk, never, you know,

00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:04.770
it was like he came back and he,
this was his reaction to battle.

00:48:04.770 --> 00:48:10.400
And so, the son, so anyway he
went off and he left the family.

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:14.420
And so, the son was
so angry about that,

00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:18.700
that the father had
received the Croix de Guerre,

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.290
and when we were sitting in his
living room and we were telling him

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:25.960
about what his father went through
at the 93rd and what a horrendous,

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:29.540
you know, time he had and
everything, finally then,

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:34.660
he says to his son, "Upstairs
under the bed, there's a picture.

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:36.360
Why don't you go and get it?"

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:43.510 position:56%
And it was his father's Croix de
Guerre, the beautiful picture of it.

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:48.910
So, he brought it down to share it
with his son for the first time.

00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:52.520
So, this is, you know,
not unusual though.

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:56.400
You know, there's so much
death and destruction there

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:59.270
that they would come
back with battle fatigue

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:01.440
or whatever they call it now.

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:04.080
You know, so we saw that.

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:08.550
We were there when this kind of
realization came to the family.

00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:10.290
That was very rewarding.

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:11.590
Yeah.

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:12.890
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher: It's
actually changed the way he feels

00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:14.190
about his father.

00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:15.490
&gt;&gt; Joann H. Buckley: Yeah.

00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:16.790
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher: Yeah.

00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:18.770
He was very moved by that.

00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:20.440
&gt;&gt; Joann H. Buckley: Yes, Richard.

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:30.290
&gt;&gt; I, I have one question and
something not very important, but,

00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:36.130
was my grandfather on the
front line when he was killed?

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:38.980
He treated soldiers
on the front line.

00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:40.280
&gt;&gt; Joann H. Buckley: Absolutely.

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.580
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher: Yes.

00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:42.880
&gt;&gt; Joann H. Buckley: Yes.

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:44.180
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher: The
question was, was his father

00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:45.480
in the front line when
he was killed?

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:46.780
&gt;&gt; Joann H. Buckley: Grandfather.

00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:48.080 position:56%
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher: Grandfather on
the front lines when he was killed?

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:49.380
And the answer is yes,
most definitely.

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:50.680
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:51.980
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher: Uh-huh.

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:53.280
He was at a forward aid station.

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:55.220
Forward aid stations are right
up there with the regiments.

00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:56.520
And he was with the regiment.

00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:59.380
They were right there, indeed.

00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:02.820
&gt;&gt; You said he received
Distinguished Service Cross,

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:04.120
I believe.

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:05.420
&gt;&gt; Joann H. Buckley: Yes.

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:07.170
&gt;&gt; Do you know when
he received that?

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:09.010
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher:
I don't know offhand.

00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:12.270
It was, he received it
posthumously, obviously.

00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:15.100
But I don't know the
actual date it was received.

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:16.620
But it was in that timeframe.

00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:19.520
It was not 50 years later
or something of that sort.

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.290
&gt;&gt; Joann H. Buckley: You can
probably find out from the Army.

00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:28.250
In fact, you could probably
get a copy of it or get a copy

00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:33.190
of the medal and the citation
from, by contacting the Army.

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:38.150
Even the Army Museum do
you think in Arlington.

00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:39.600
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher:
We probably can find it

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:41.850
for you in our research papers.

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:43.150
&gt;&gt; Joann H. Buckley: Yeah.

00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:45.590
Because we, we have done
that trying to, yes.

00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:46.890
We'll look.

00:50:46.890 --> 00:50:48.190
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:49.490
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher:
Sure, by all means.

00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:51.610
&gt;&gt; I have three very
short questions.

00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:54.570
Are Dr. Dyer's accounts
at the Schomburg

00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:56.900
in the form of diaries or letters?

00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:00.210
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher: What he
wrote was letters that were ty--

00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:02.020
, later typed, transcribed.

00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:06.460 position:56%
And so, there's about a 24-page
double spaced document that he wrote

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:08.980
about his experiences
at the Schomburg.

00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:12.080
And we have a copy,
we got a copy of that.

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:14.680
And it was fascinating reading
because I could blend it

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:18.020 position:56%
with my grandfather's comments about
the same place at the same time.

00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:19.320
The Ammunition Train was here.

00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:20.620
The Supply Train was here.

00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:21.920
They were all moving together.

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:23.220
It was very vivid.

00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:24.520
&gt;&gt; These are quick questions.

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:30.280
Can you repeat what you said
at the beginning of the program

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:33.360
about the beautiful music that
was playing to give credit for it?

00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:36.880
And can you say a word about your
collection that's on display?

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:38.180
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher: Certainly.

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:42.080
Could we comment about the music
that we were playing before.

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:44.920
There's an album, it's a DVD now
and it's obviously available online

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:49.670
about the James Reese Europe
band, which was the band

00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:53.220
for the 369th Infantry Regiment.

00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:58.440 position:56%
James Reese Europe was a famous
musician and he'd been recruited to,

00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:00.570
by the commanding officer

00:52:00.570 --> 00:52:05.210
of the Harlem Hillfighters they
called them to serve as a band.

00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:10.730
Every unit had a band for
marching and for parades and so on.

00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:13.610
He recruited some other
great musicians in New York.

00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:17.930
When the band got to France it
brought jazz to France, to Europe.

00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:22.280
And the French absolutely loved
it and you can imagine those tunes

00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:24.870
in the time of war how
they were embraced.

00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:26.860
I mean it was spirited music

00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:29.210
and then it gave you a
good sense of spirit--

00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:30.510
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:31.810
&gt;&gt; Uplifting.

00:52:31.810 --> 00:52:33.110
&gt;&gt; Clubs in Paris, you know,

00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:34.800
because jazz is a very
important part of Paris.

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:37.370
If you go to Paris, do
go to the jazz clubs,

00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:39.320
because this is where it came from.

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:42.690
&gt;&gt; Well, I downloaded the, I
had heard a lot of the music,

00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:45.240
but I downloaded it
onto my cell phone.

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:46.740 position:56%
So, I plugged the cell phone in here

00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:48.250
and that's what you
were hearing earlier.

00:52:48.250 --> 00:52:50.740
&gt;&gt; And then she had-

00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:52.310
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher: You had
a last question, oh what the,

00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:54.170
about the collection over here.

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:58.410 position:56%
The collection, a friend of mine
served on a board with me at a bank.

00:52:58.410 --> 00:53:01.670
And one of his uncles
had this collection

00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:04.630
and it actually is
much bigger than this.

00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:08.100
And he didn't know
what to do with it.

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:09.400
He was ill.

00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:13.510
So, he asked me if I could take
it over and share it with someone.

00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:17.080
So, we went to the National World
War I museum out in Kansas City,

00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:19.790
Missouri, showed them
all the stuff we had.

00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:22.630
I mean, 50, 60 pieces of
things and they loved it.

00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:24.820 position:56%
And they asked for about half of it.

00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:26.240
We donated about a half of it.

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:29.180
It's there at the museum
in Kansas City.

00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:31.470
And then we kept pieces of it.

00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:32.990
Some of it is still in our house,

00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:34.630
but they wouldn't let
us bring the bayonets

00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:36.500
into the Library of Congress.

00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:37.800
They were afraid we--

00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:39.100
&gt;&gt; Joann H. Buckley:
I don't know why.

00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:40.540
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher: Afraid
we might get killed, I guess.

00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:46.470
So, there is some, that's the
story there on the collection here.

00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:47.770
Yes.

00:53:47.770 --> 00:53:51.070
&gt;&gt; I was just curious, you
have these visitors, guests,

00:53:51.070 --> 00:53:53.200
how did they find out
about the program

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:57.690
and did they tell you what they
knew about their grandfather?

00:53:57.690 --> 00:53:59.910
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher: Well, we have
had some conversations with that.

00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:02.230
Joann reached out to Dr. Bass.

00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:05.470
&gt;&gt; Joann H. Buckley: I
found him on the internet.

00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:06.770
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:09.740
&gt;&gt; Joann H. Buckley: There was
an article about his fishing

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:13.360
and it said that he was living
in Washington, D.C. And so,

00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:14.970
I looked him up and called him.

00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:18.400
And so, we have been communicating
back and forth since then.

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.860
But he already purchased
seven of our books

00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:23.480
for his family and everything.

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:24.880
I wasn't aware he was here

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:27.760
and I guess you guys weren't
aware that we were here.

00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:29.440
So, we've all been in this area.

00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:30.740
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher:
So he's another hero

00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:33.040
for buying so many books.

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:37.530
&gt;&gt; Joann H. Buckley: Okay.

00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:40.260
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher: Yes, ma'am.

00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:45.230
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible audience question].

00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:47.770
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher: Well, Joann
can tell you all about that,

00:54:47.770 --> 00:54:49.870
because she's the lady that
really put it all together.

00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:52.810
But we have a batch
for each physician.

00:54:52.810 --> 00:54:54.650
We had files for each doctor.

00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:58.470 position:56%
So there, those were all scanned and
there are all sorts of those PDFs.

00:54:58.470 --> 00:55:02.100
So, there are 104 of
those plus there's a lot

00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:05.940
of background information that we
have, general information in there.

00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:07.490
It's really, it's all our research.

00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:13.850
And we, some of it as duplicated
because you could get it

00:55:13.850 --> 00:55:15.350
from so many different directions.

00:55:15.350 --> 00:55:18.320
So, we tried to eliminate
a lot of the duplication.

00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:19.620
But I think it's all there.

00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:21.340
Is there anything more you can add?

00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:22.640
&gt;&gt; Joann H. Buckley: No.

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:24.860 position:56%
We didn't do many of the photographs
because that wasn't working well.

00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:27.840
So, we will, they will
find their way, somewhere.

00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:30.200
Maybe the Army museum.

00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:31.660
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher: Yeah.

00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:34.270
The National Army Museum that
they're building down here

00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:39.380
in Fort Belvoir, it's going to
be a 250-million-dollar museum.

00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:41.990
The Army's never had a museum.

00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:45.060
I mean Marines got one
down the road on 95.

00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:46.360
The Army needs one too.

00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:47.660
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:48.960
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher: The
Air Force has one I guess

00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:52.320
out at Wright Patt
out in Dayton, Ohio.

00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:53.850
So, the Army's a little bit behind.

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:57.240
They have smaller ones at different
places, at Fort Benning and,

00:55:57.240 --> 00:56:00.290 position:56%
you know, at different bases, posts.

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:02.860
But there's never been a
national museum for the Army.

00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:04.560
So, they're hard at
work at building there

00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:07.740
and we've been supporting
that activity.

00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:10.890
And we will probably
donate whatever they would

00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:12.830
like to have to that one as well.

00:56:12.830 --> 00:56:18.780
&gt;&gt; I just want to thank you
both for your diligence in terms

00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:23.690
of your research, intending to look
for the names and discovering them

00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:27.000
as you did in [inaudible]
in the archives.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.270
Because if it wasn't for you,
this information would not be able

00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:32.870
to summated in the way that it has.

00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:35.420
And I really appreciate
you all's efforts

00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:37.010
and what you all have done with it.

00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:39.490
And I hope you all
continue to do your research

00:56:39.490 --> 00:56:41.860
for others in that particular book.

00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:43.160
&gt;&gt; Joann H. Buckley: Thank you.

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:44.460
&gt;&gt; W. Douglas Fisher: Thank you.

00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:45.760
We really appreciate that.

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:47.060
[Applause].

00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:50.070
&gt;&gt; Thank you all for coming.

00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:51.370
[Applause].

00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:54.580
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
