A lot of the time, you can't exclude zero. I'm writing a program that

00:00:04.083 --> 00:00:07.790
calculates the average altitude of an area. Since some parts are below sea

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.961
level, negative altitudes are allowed. And an altitude of zero would be allowed

00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:15.815
too. Can you modify the average method so that the sentinel is a letter Q

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:20.078
instead of a zero? It's possible to do this without a loop-and-a-half. If

00:00:20.078 --> 00:00:24.238
you're feeling adventurous, you can try Googling Java 7 Scanner, and finding

00:00:24.238 --> 00:00:29.514
the documentation about the hasNextDouble method. I'll talk about this in the

00:00:29.514 --> 00:00:30.629
answer video.
