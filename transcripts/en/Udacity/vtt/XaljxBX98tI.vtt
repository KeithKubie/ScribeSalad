00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.468
With spawning and updating entities taken care of, the last piece of the puzzle

00:00:03.468 --> 00:00:07.675
is figuring out how to remove entities that might be dead. For instance, if a

00:00:07.675 --> 00:00:11.996
rocket will hit a wall it should be removed from processing. To accomplish

00:00:11.996 --> 00:00:15.335
this, we add a flag to the entity class that defines whether or not it has been

00:00:15.335 --> 00:00:19.717
killed. Dead objects will not update or render while this flag is set, well of

00:00:19.717 --> 00:00:24.195
course unless their zombies. As an exercise, let's update the game engine

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:27.660
update function to check for this flag, and not call the update of any entity

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.529
that's been marked as killed.
