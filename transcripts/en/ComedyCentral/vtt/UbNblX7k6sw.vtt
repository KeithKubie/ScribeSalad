a bachelorette party bus
flipped over the Pines Bridge

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:10.310 line:0%
 
and landed
on top of a booze cruise

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.679 line:0%
 
carrying a separate bachelorette
party.

00:00:12.813 --> 00:00:16.984 line:0%
 
Now, our first responders were
on the scene almost immediately

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:18.752 line:0%
 
and, as it turns out,
the small penises we found

00:00:18.886 --> 00:00:23.323 line:0%
 
dotting the shoreline were not
the remains of young boys

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:26.260 line:0%
 
but were,
in fact, straw toppers,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.562 line:0%
 
or "dicky sippies," as
they're called.

00:00:28.662 --> 00:00:30.130 line:0%
 
These here.

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:32.766 line:0%
 
These are used for
drinking alcohol out of.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.337 line:0%
 
I'd like to turn this over
to the head of the ICU

00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:40.974 line:0%
 
at Mercy Medical,
Dr. Todd Mandible.

00:00:43.177 --> 00:00:45.145 line:0%
 
Good morning.

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:48.949 line:0%
 
As it stands, we are treating
11 women for hypothermia

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:52.085 line:0%
after spending several hours
in the water clinging

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:53.820
to inflatable sex dolls.

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:58.725 line:0%
 
Four women, uh, remain in
critical condition

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:03.130 line:0%
in what I can only describe as
a rat king situation

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:06.800 line:0%
 
in which
they are bound together

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:12.172 line:0%
 
in a wet tangle of hair
extensions and feather boas.

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:16.677 line:0%
 
Thank you, Dr. Mandible.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.312 line:0%
 
We've questioned
several witnesses.

00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:21.715 line:0%
 
One man recanted the following
conversation he overheard.

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:24.651 line:0%
 
"Help, my best friend
is drowning."

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.720 line:0%
 
"She's not your best friend."

00:01:26.854 --> 00:01:29.957 line:0%
 
"Really-- Then why
am I the maid of honor?"

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.793 line:0%
 
In every case, onlookers who
called 9-1-1

00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:35.996 line:0%
 
urged us to take our time.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:38.265 line:0%
 
Sadly, there were fatalities

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:41.301 line:0%
 
and for that I'm gonna turn it
over to our chief coroner.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.239 line:0%
 
Thank you, sheriff.

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:48.375 line:0%
 
Yes, there
were multiple fatalities,

00:01:48.442 --> 00:01:49.776 line:0%
 
including three alcohol
poisonings

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.778 line:0%
 
that were not
related to the crash.

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:53.380 line:0%
 
(reporters murmuring)

00:01:53.514 --> 00:01:54.515 line:0%
 
(man)
Can you give us some
more details?
(man)

00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:56.984 line:0%
 
Well, at least
one woman drowned

00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:00.921 line:0%
 
after being knocked unconscious
by a bitch goblet.

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:02.389 line:0%
 
(man)
What's a bitch goblet?

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:06.360 line:0%
 
To my knowledge, a bitch goblet
is a large drinking goblet

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:09.496 line:0%
 
with the word "bitch"
stenciled in puff paint

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.532 line:0%
 
across the back of it.

00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:16.236 line:0%
 
One woman who made a brave
effort to make it ashore,

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:17.437 line:0%
 
but her
hair was so messed up

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:21.175 line:0%
 
and her makeup was so
grotesquely running

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:24.344 line:0%
 
that some local farmers thought
she was one of the ghost girls

00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:28.515 line:0%
 
from "The Ring" and smashed
her head with a shovel.

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:33.353 line:0%
 
But probably the most tragic
loss was a woman named Beth

00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:35.422 line:0%
 
who was surprised that she was
even invited to the party,

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:38.192 line:0%
 
she was just
a friend of a friend.

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:42.829 line:0%
 
Thought about not going,
decided, (bleep) it, why not go?

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.532 line:0%
 
And she's dead.

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:48.335 line:0%
 
I'd like to turn it over
now to the fire chief.

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:52.773 line:0%
 
Oh.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.111 line:0%
 
I'm sorry, that's
a surviving stripper.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.114 line:0%
 
Nice, okay.

00:03:01.248 --> 00:03:02.516 line:0%
 
Thanks, Barnabas.

00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:03.517 line:0%
 
Yes.

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:05.519 line:0%
 
(man)
What happened
to the drivers?

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:06.920 line:0%
 
Both the driver of
the party bus

00:03:07.054 --> 00:03:10.190 line:0%
 
and the captain of
the booze cruise are deceased.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.160 line:0%
 
They committed suicide
prior to the accident,

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:14.628 line:0%
 
for obvious reasons.

00:03:14.728 --> 00:03:16.830 line:0%
 
The survivors are currently
with grief counselors

00:03:16.897 --> 00:03:18.899 line:0%
 
and we have made sure
that those grief counselors

00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:21.802 line:0%
 
have their own
grief counselors.

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:25.372 line:0%
 
Now, our... our thoughts and
prayers are with the families

00:03:25.506 --> 00:03:32.346 line:0%
 
of the surviving girls, as these
girls are the worst.

00:03:32.446 --> 00:03:33.413 line:0%
 
Please respect their privacy

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.414 line:0%
 
at this humiliating time,
thank you.

00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:35.349 line:0%
