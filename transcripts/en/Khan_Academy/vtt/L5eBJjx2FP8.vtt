00:00:00.477 --> 00:00:02.192
- [Voiceover] We've
already seen one definition

00:00:02.192 --> 00:00:04.268
of the definite integral, and many of them

00:00:04.268 --> 00:00:06.082
are closely related to this definition

00:00:06.082 --> 00:00:09.129
that we've already seen
is the definite integral

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:11.968
from a to b of f of x d
of x is this area shaded

00:00:11.968 --> 00:00:14.893
in blue, and we can approximate it

00:00:14.893 --> 00:00:19.893
by splitting it into n rectangles.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.139
So let's say that's the
first rectangle, one.

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:26.428
That's the second
rectangle, two, and you're

00:00:26.428 --> 00:00:28.773
going to go all the way
to the nth rectangle,

00:00:28.773 --> 00:00:31.406
so this would be the n
minus oneth rectangle.

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:33.147
For the sake of this
argument I'm going to make

00:00:33.147 --> 00:00:34.310
in this video, we're going to assume

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.717
that they're all the same width.

00:00:35.717 --> 00:00:38.088
So this is the nth rectangle.

00:00:38.088 --> 00:00:40.634
They all have the same
width, and we see they're

00:00:40.634 --> 00:00:42.081
definitions of integration
where you don't have

00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:44.066
to have the same width here, but let's say

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.371
that each of those widths are delta x,

00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:49.608
and the way that we
calculate delta x is we take

00:00:49.608 --> 00:00:54.608
b minus a and we divide it by n,

00:00:56.948 --> 00:00:58.560
which is common sense, or this is

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.781
what you learned in division.

00:00:59.781 --> 00:01:01.224
We're just taking this
length and dividing it

00:01:01.224 --> 00:01:06.224
by n to get n equals spacings of delta x.

00:01:07.738 --> 00:01:08.865
So if you do this, you'll say, okay,

00:01:08.865 --> 00:01:10.739
well we see this multiple times,

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:12.723
you can approximate it.

00:01:12.723 --> 00:01:15.773
You can approximate this
area using these rectangles

00:01:15.773 --> 00:01:19.936
as the sum from i equals one to n.

00:01:19.936 --> 00:01:24.831
So you're summing n of
these rectangle's areas

00:01:24.831 --> 00:01:28.614
where the height of
each of these rectangles

00:01:28.614 --> 00:01:33.388
are going to be f of
x sub i, where x sub i

00:01:33.388 --> 00:01:35.971
is the point at which
you're taking the function

00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:37.748
value to find out its height.

00:01:37.748 --> 00:01:41.041
So that could be x of
one, x of two, x of three,

00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:43.793
so on and so forth, and
you're multiplying that

00:01:43.793 --> 00:01:46.917
times your delta x.

00:01:46.917 --> 00:01:49.727
So you take x sub two, f of x sub two

00:01:49.727 --> 00:01:54.727
is that height right there.

00:01:55.455 --> 00:01:58.734
You multiply it times delta x.

00:01:58.734 --> 00:01:59.745
You get the area.

00:01:59.745 --> 00:02:02.347
We saw that when we looked at Riemann sums

00:02:02.347 --> 00:02:03.456
and using that to approximate.

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:07.728
We said, hey the one definition
of the definite integral

00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:09.658
is that since this is
the area this is going

00:02:09.658 --> 00:02:14.653
to be the limit as n approaches infinity

00:02:14.653 --> 00:02:19.653
of this where delta x is defined as that.

00:02:19.747 --> 00:02:22.035
So let me just copy and paste that.

00:02:25.286 --> 00:02:27.757
So that's one way to think about it.

00:02:27.757 --> 00:02:32.757
Now, given this definition,
what do you think

00:02:33.412 --> 00:02:35.428
this, or maybe another
way to think about it,

00:02:35.428 --> 00:02:38.175
how do you think this
expression that I'm writing

00:02:38.175 --> 00:02:41.714
right over here based on this definition

00:02:41.714 --> 00:02:44.207
should relate to this expression?

00:02:44.207 --> 00:02:47.967
So notice, all I've done
is I've segued from a to b.

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:52.086
I'm now going from b to a.

00:02:52.086 --> 00:02:54.127
How do you think these
two things should relate?

00:02:54.127 --> 00:02:56.023
I encourage you to look at all of this

00:02:56.023 --> 00:02:57.103
to come to that conclusion,

00:02:57.103 --> 00:02:59.772
and pause the video to do so.

00:02:59.772 --> 00:03:01.744
Well let's just think about
what's going to happen.

00:03:01.744 --> 00:03:05.395
This is going to be,
if I were to literally

00:03:05.395 --> 00:03:10.395
just take this and copy
and paste it, which is

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.057
exactly what I'm going to
do, if I just took this,

00:03:14.057 --> 00:03:17.308
by definition, since I
swapped these two bounds,

00:03:17.308 --> 00:03:19.903
I'm going to want to swap these two.

00:03:19.903 --> 00:03:23.028
Instead of b minus a it's
going to be a minus b now.

00:03:23.028 --> 00:03:28.028
It's going to be a minus b.

00:03:30.555 --> 00:03:32.549
This value right over here.

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.644
Let me make these color-coded maybe.

00:03:34.644 --> 00:03:39.644
So this orange delta x is
going to be the negative

00:03:40.992 --> 00:03:45.313
of this green delta x.

00:03:45.313 --> 00:03:48.584
This is the negative of
that right over there,

00:03:48.584 --> 00:03:50.936
and everything else is the same.

00:03:50.936 --> 00:03:52.817
So what am I going to end up doing?

00:03:52.817 --> 00:03:54.244
Well I'm essentially
going to end up having

00:03:54.244 --> 00:03:56.569
the negative value of this.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.080
So this is going to be
equal to the negative

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.080
of the integral from a to b of f of x dx.

00:04:05.842 --> 00:04:08.312
So this is the result
we get, which is another

00:04:08.312 --> 00:04:10.463
really important integration property,

00:04:10.463 --> 00:04:13.908
that if you swap the
bounds of integration,

00:04:13.908 --> 00:04:15.604
and it really just comes from this idea,

00:04:15.604 --> 00:04:18.070
instead of delta x being
b minus a, if you swap

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.316
the bounds of integration,
it's going to be a minus b.

00:04:20.316 --> 00:04:22.079
We're going to get the negative delta x,

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.753
or the negative of your original delta x,

00:04:23.753 --> 00:04:24.907
which is going to give you the negative

00:04:24.907 --> 00:04:27.555
of this original value right over here.

00:04:27.555 --> 00:04:29.836
Once again, this is a
really, really useful

00:04:29.836 --> 00:04:31.317
integration property where you're trying

00:04:31.317 --> 00:04:32.905
to make sense of some integrals and even

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:35.310
sometimes solve some of them.
