00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.000
Who Invented the Elevator?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.350
The history of the elevator, if you define
it as a platform that can move people and

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.219
objects up and down, is actually a rather
long one.

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:14.730
Rudimentary elevators are known to have been
in use in ancient Rome as far back as 336

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.320
B.C., with the first reference of one built
by the talented Archimedes.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.860
These early elevators were open cars rather
than enclosed ones, and consisted of a platform

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.450
with hoists that would enable the car to move
vertically.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.880
The hoists were typically worked manually,
either by people or animals, though sometimes

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.660
water wheels were used.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.071
Romans continued to use these simple elevators
for many years, usually to move water, building

00:00:37.071 --> 00:00:40.760
materials, or other heavy items from one place
to another.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.111
As for the dedicated passenger elevator, this
was created in the 18th century, with one

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:48.410
of the first used by King Louis XV in 1743.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.950
He had an elevator constructed at Versailles
that would carry him from his apartments on

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.290
the first floor to his mistress’ apartments
on the second floor.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.370
This elevator wasn’t much more technologically
advanced than those used in Rome.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.690
To make it work, men stationed in a chimney
pulled on the ropes.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.260
They called it a “flying chair.”

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.880
It wasn’t until the 1800s that elevator
technology really started to advance.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.210
For starters, elevators no longer needed to
be worked manually.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.970
In 1823, two British architects—Burton and
Hormer—built a steam-powered “ascending

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.750
room” to take tourists up to a platform
for a view of London.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.470
Several years later, their invention was expanded
upon by architects Frost and Stutt who added

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.250
a belt and counter-weight to the steam power.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.370
Soon enough, hydraulic systems began to be
created as well, using water pressure to raise

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.930
and lower the elevator car.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.530
However, this wasn’t practical in some cases—pits
had to be dug below the elevator shaft to

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.520
enable the piston to pull back.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.950
The higher the elevator went, the deeper the
pit had to be.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.759
Thus, this wasn’t a viable option for taller
buildings in big cities.

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.520
So despite the hydraulic systems being somewhat
safer than steam-powered/cabled elevators,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.040
the steam powered ones with cables and counterweights,
stuck around.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.400
They had just one major drawback: the cables
could snap, and sometimes did, which sent

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.490
the elevator plummeting to the bottom of the
shaft, killing passengers and damaging building

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.230
materials or other items being transported.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.480
Needless to say, no one was jumping to get
on these dangerous elevators and so passenger

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.270
elevators up to this point were largely a
novelty.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.599
The man who solved the elevator safety problem,
making skyscrapers possible, was Elisha Otis,

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.170
who is generally known as the inventor of
the modern elevator.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.420
In 1852, Otis came up with a design that had
a safety “brake.”

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.069
In the event that the cables broke, a wooden
frame at the top of the elevator car would

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.530
snap out and hit the walls of the shaft, stopping
the elevator in its tracks.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.720
Otis himself demonstrated the device, which
he called a “safety hoist,” at the New

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.890
York World’s Fair in 1854, when he went
up in a make-shift elevator himself and had

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.310
the ropes cut.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.670
Rather than plummeting to his death as the
audience thought might happen, his safety

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.000
hoist snapped out, catching the elevator within
seconds.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.360
Needless to say, the crowd was impressed.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.810
Otis went on to found his own elevator company,
which installed the first public elevator

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.370
in a New York building in 1874.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.360
The Otis Elevator Company is still known today
as the world’s largest elevator manufacturer.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.830
While the cable elevator design has remained,
many additional improvements have been made,

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.320
the most obvious of which is that elevators
now run on electricity rather than steam power,

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.480
a change that came about starting in the 1880s.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.700
The electric elevator was patented by Alexander
Miles in 1887, though one had been built by

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.860
the German inventor Werner von Siemens in
1880.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.220
Otis’ safety hoist wasn’t the end of safety
innovation, either.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.540
These days, it’s virtually impossible for
an elevator to plummet and kill passengers.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.360
There are now multiple steel cables to hold
the elevator’s weight, plus a number of

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.920
different braking systems to stop an elevator
from falling if the cables somehow snap.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.909
If, despite all these safety measures, the
elevator does fall, there are shock absorbers

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:52.470
at the bottom of the shaft, making it unlikely
death will occur and reducing the possibility

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.909
of serious injury.

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.200
Bonus Facts:
• Elisha Otis is not considered to be the

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.459
inventor of the modern elevator by everyone.

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.180
Another man, Otis Tufts, patented an elevator
design that had doors that opened and closed

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.260
automatically and benches inside.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.360
However, Tufts’ design did away with the
typical cable system because of the safety

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.310
issues, and instead used an impractical, expensive
system of threading the elevator car up a

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.470
giant screw.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.069
Obviously, this would be prohibitively expensive
in tall buildings.

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:24.719
Elisha Otis’ design was much simpler (and
closer to modern designs), easier to use,

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:28.659
and less expensive to make, which is why he
generally gets the credit and not Tufts.

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:33.270
That said, the “Vertical Screw Railway”
was installed in a few buildings in New York

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.270
and Philadelphia.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.930
• The first elevator shaft was put in a
building before Elisha Otis designed his safe,

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.119
steam powered elevator.

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:45.759
This was done in 1853 at the Cooper Union
Foundation building in New York.

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:49.969
Peter Cooper felt that elevators would be
perfected and made safe at some point in the

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:53.100
near future, so included it in the design
of the building.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.790
It took a couple decades, but an elevator
was eventually installed in the shaft by Elisha

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:11.639
Otis’ company.
