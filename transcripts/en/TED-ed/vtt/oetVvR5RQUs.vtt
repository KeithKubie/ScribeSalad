00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:11.071
Somewhere right now,
people are lining up to scare themselves,

00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:14.022
maybe with a thrill ride or horror movie.

00:00:14.022 --> 00:00:17.340
In fact, in October of 2015 alone,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.010
about 28 million people visited
a haunted house in the U.S.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.676
But many consider 
this behavior perplexing,

00:00:25.676 --> 00:00:26.878
asking the question,

00:00:26.878 --> 00:00:31.149
"What could possibly be fun 
about being scared?"

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:34.728
Fear has a bad rap, but it's not all bad.

00:00:34.728 --> 00:00:38.232
For starters, 
fear can actually feel pretty good.

00:00:38.232 --> 00:00:40.775
When a threat triggers 
our fight or flight response,

00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:43.152
our bodies prepare for danger

00:00:43.152 --> 00:00:48.212
by releasing chemicals that change
how our brains and bodies function.

00:00:48.212 --> 00:00:52.753
This automatic response jumpstarts
systems that can aid in survival.

00:00:52.753 --> 00:00:55.840
They do this by making sure
we have enough energy

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.992
and are protected from feeling pain,

00:00:57.992 --> 00:01:02.503
while shutting down nonessential systems,
like critical thought.

00:01:02.503 --> 00:01:04.525
Feeling pain-free and energized,

00:01:04.525 --> 00:01:09.238
while not getting caught up in worrisome 
thoughts that normally occupy our brains,

00:01:09.238 --> 00:01:11.112
that all sounds great,

00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:15.443
and it can be because this response
is similar, though not exactly the same

00:01:15.443 --> 00:01:19.799
to what we experience in positive,
high-arousal states,

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.656
like excitement, happiness,
and even during sex.

00:01:23.656 --> 00:01:26.707
The difference lays in the context.

00:01:26.707 --> 00:01:30.929
If we're in real danger, we're focused
on survival, not fun.

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:34.562
But when we trigger this high arousal 
response in a safe place,

00:01:34.562 --> 00:01:39.710
we can switch over to enjoying
the natural high of being scared.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:46.117
It's why people on roller coasters can go
from screaming to laughing within moments.

00:01:46.117 --> 00:01:48.757
Your body is already in a euphoric state.

00:01:48.757 --> 00:01:51.817
You're just relabeling the experience.

00:01:51.817 --> 00:01:54.297
And though the threat response 
is universal,

00:01:54.297 --> 00:01:57.485
research shows differences 
between individuals

00:01:57.485 --> 00:02:01.479
in how the chemicals associated
with the threat response work.

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.683
This explains why some are more prone
to thrill-seeking than others.

00:02:06.683 --> 00:02:08.711
Other normal physical differences explain

00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:12.611
why some may love the dizziness
associated with a loop-de-loop,

00:02:12.611 --> 00:02:17.185
while loathing the stomach-drop sensation
of a steep roller coaster,

00:02:17.185 --> 00:02:20.206
or why some squeal with delight
inside a haunted house,

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:25.100
but retreat in terror 
if taken to an actual cemetery.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.061
Fear brings more 
than just a fun, natural high.

00:02:28.061 --> 00:02:32.638
Doing things that we're afraid of
can give us a nice boost of self-esteem.

00:02:32.638 --> 00:02:34.177
Like any personal challenge,

00:02:34.177 --> 00:02:37.170
whether it's running a race
or finishing a long book,

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.875
when we make it through to the end,

00:02:38.875 --> 00:02:41.741
we feel a sense of accomplishment.

00:02:41.741 --> 00:02:45.090
This is true even if we know 
we're not really in any danger.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.954
Our thinking brains may know 
the zombies aren't real,

00:02:47.954 --> 00:02:50.588
but our bodies tell us otherwise.

00:02:50.588 --> 00:02:52.235
The fear feels real,

00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:54.167
so when we make it through alive,

00:02:54.167 --> 00:02:58.381
the satisfaction and sense 
of accomplishment also feel real.

00:02:58.381 --> 00:03:00.928
This is a great evolutionary adaptation.

00:03:00.928 --> 00:03:04.111
Those who had the right balance 
of bravery and wit

00:03:04.111 --> 00:03:07.366
to know when to push through the fear
and when to retreat

00:03:07.366 --> 00:03:09.331
were rewarded with survival,

00:03:09.331 --> 00:03:10.484
new food,

00:03:10.484 --> 00:03:12.260
and new lands.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.832
Finally, fear can bring people together.

00:03:14.832 --> 00:03:16.827
Emotions can be contagious,

00:03:16.827 --> 00:03:19.632
and when you see your friend
scream and laugh,

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:21.956
you feel compelled to do the same.

00:03:21.956 --> 00:03:25.073
This is because we make sense of what
our friends are experiencing

00:03:25.073 --> 00:03:28.552
by recreating the experience ourselves.

00:03:28.552 --> 00:03:32.314
In fact, the parts of the brain
that are active when our friend screams

00:03:32.314 --> 00:03:35.759
are active in us when we watch them.

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:38.907
This not only intensifies 
our own emotional experience,

00:03:38.907 --> 00:03:42.648
but makes us feel closer 
to those we're with.

00:03:42.648 --> 00:03:45.153
The feeling of closeness during
times of fear

00:03:45.153 --> 00:03:50.891
is aided by the hormone oxytocin
released during fight or flight.

00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:53.335
Fear is a powerful emotional experience,

00:03:53.335 --> 00:03:55.811
and anything 
that triggers a strong reaction

00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:59.549
is going to be stored in our memory
really well.

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.118
You don't want to forget 
what can hurt you.

00:04:02.118 --> 00:04:06.086
So if your memory of watching a horror
film with your friends is positive

00:04:06.086 --> 00:04:08.333
and left you with a sense of satisfaction,

00:04:08.333 --> 00:04:11.897
then you'll want to do it over
and over again.
