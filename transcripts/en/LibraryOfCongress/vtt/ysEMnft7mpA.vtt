00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.280
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:22.250
[silence]

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.150
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: Good evening.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.330
We are delighted tonight to
have the chance to both present

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.060
and talk with Richard Egarr.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.360
Welcome.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.660
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: Thank
you, nice to be here.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.860
Good to see you all, thank you.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.160
[applause]

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.460
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: Richard is
tremendously admired as many

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.330
of you already know,
for a career that takes

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.190
in virtuosic keyboard performances,
harpsichord, organ, forte piano,

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.870
modern piano, plus being the music
director of the superb Academy

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.980
of Ancient Music since 2006.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.280
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: Yeah.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.090
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: And he regularly
conducts major international

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.410
ensembles like the Concertgebouw,
Australia Chamber Orchestra,

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.870
Handel and Haydn Society,
fits in a few orchestra ...

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.980
Sorry, fits in a few
opera appearances

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.280
at Glyndebourne and so on.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.670
So definitely a star and
really kind of a constellation.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.970
I mean ...

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.790
And in this world ...

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.560
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: That's
why I look so tired.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.700
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: So I saw
that on your Facebook page

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.870
that you describe yourself
as a total music addict.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.290
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: Yeah, I
think I always have been,

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.590
ever since I can remember.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.070 position:56%
Neither of my parents are musicians.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.090
My father's always loved
music, but he would listen

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.510
to Perry Como and Rosemary Clooney.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.330
So I literally was brought
up listening to those

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.400
and Michael Holiday, all the
great crooners from the 50's.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.700
I mean, even ...

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.360
We didn't even have
any Sinatra records,

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.960
that was a bit too hardcore.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.830
So I was a little bit more ...

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.610
I mean, I, as long as I can
remember, apparently I would sit

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.690
in front of the radiogram and
draw notes when I was sort of 2,

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.220
because remember the old
Columbia label has the two note.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.470
And I would just sit there
drawing notes and listening

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.300
to Michael Holiday and Perry
Como and Rosemary Clooney.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.090
And I discovered, you probably
don't know Cliff Richard, do you?

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.050
Yes, well, I mean I discovered
Cliff Richard when I was 3 or 4,

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.360
so I was a little bit more
progressive than my parents were.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.440
And I'm still a great
fan of Cliff Richard's.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.080
So I mean all the music
I grew up listening

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.910
to was very sort of easy listening.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.500
But what was interesting, I
mean they're all great singers.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.020
And I think that was very, that
really struck a chord with me

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.010
and I sort of, basically
after I started school,

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.670
demanded to learn the piano.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.850
And I think my parents
must've thought I came

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.910
from the planet Orc or something.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.020
Because, I say, there was no
music in the family as such.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.300
So it was just something in me
that was very, very present.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.860
So I started having piano lessons
and joined the York Minstrel Choir

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.640
when I was, we moved
to York when I was 8.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.720
7-8. It would be 8, but my
father worked on the railways,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.850
he was in charge of the payroll for
the eastern district or something

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.440
like that, so we moved to a big
railway city, which York is.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.670
And my piano teacher in a
little village outside York

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.420
that we lived in, I
had the lessons ...

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.570
I was in school in the village
for a year and I had lessons

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.540
with this wonderful teacher
who suggested that I should go

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.820
and audition for York
Minstrel Choir.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.090
Having never sung a note in
anger, particularly, and I got in.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.330 position:56%
And that's the first time I really
sort of was exposed to, if you like,

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.680
classical music I've been
playing stuff on the piano,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.090
but that was kind of
when my gears shifted

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.600
to towards, really towards ...

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.640
But there was never a question
of doing anything else, really.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.970
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: And you said that
you performed 9 services a week,

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.660
but didn't repeat anything
in a year.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.680
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: No, within the
calendar year we would sing a

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.450
different anthem at every service.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.120
And that's amazing, if you have a
sort of musical spark, to process

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:15.960 position:56%
and take part in that much music per
week was absolutely extraordinary.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:22.300
Just by taking part with all
that music and everything

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.290
from Palestrina Tallis to
Stravinsky, we would do bits

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.820
of the Stravinsky mass
occasionally in the service.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.970
And the latest English
church music written

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.030
by Herbert Howells in the 70s.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.780
So, it was just incredible,
incredible training, it's a really,

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.390
really special training, that
whole cathedral choiristership

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.110 position:56%
and I'm incredibly grateful, 'cause
it provided an incredible foundation

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.160
for my musical ears, you know?

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.580
I understood how harmony worked
by the time I was 10 or 11,

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.600
just because I was involved with it
and it was around me all the time.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.490
So it seemed perfectly
natural to me.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.060
It was a fantastic way to start.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.910
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: A very
sophisticated education,

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.160
we have the, is it
the Temple Church?

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.780
In London?

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.080
The round one from when ...

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.380
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: Mm-hmm.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.680
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: And we
had their boy choir ...

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.980
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: Yeah, yeah.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.280
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: With
the men's choir here.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.480
And it was amazing how these young
guys were so, so very sophisticated

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.780
in their grasp of the music.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.440
They did [inaudible],
actually, that piece by him.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.740
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: Right, mm-hmm.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.140 position:56%
No, I mean it's interesting, you're
just thrown into it at the deep end.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.660
You go and then you just
start and you do it.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.290
Yes, it's a fabulous training.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.380
It's a very, very old tradition,
it's hundreds of years old.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.860
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: After I was going
to ask you, you always read in bios

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.160
and learn about what they did.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.740
What is an organ scholar?

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.040
At Cambridge, you were ...

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.290
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: So every,
the whole collegiate system

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.790
in Cambridge, is it
the same at Harvard?

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.570
I don't know what, I don't
know how it works over here.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.980
But Cambridge University is
made up of different colleges.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.930
So probably the most famous is
King's, King's College Cambridge,

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:02.030
and then you have Saint John's,
and most colleges have a chapel.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.990
And therefore, a choir
and an organ scholar,

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.520
either an organist choir master

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.750
or such it happens
at King's and John's.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.600
Steven Cleary is the organist and
choir master so he plays the organ.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.050
But most of the time he conducts
a choir and has, as his assistant,

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.300 position:56%
or assistants, one or two organ
scholars and it's usually staggered.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.720
The course is 3 years, so there
will be an organ scholar in year 1

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.450
and then year 3, so it's a
sort of overlapping cycle.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.000
Some colleges don't
have a music director,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.730
and the organ scholar is appointed

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.800
to run the whole music
here in the chapel.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.630
I was at Claire College,
which is next door to King's,

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.380
it was much better, by the way.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.710
No. And we had a music
director, call Tim Brown.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.890
When I went, I had a senior organ
scholar who is in the 3rd year

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.360
and I played the organ
for the services,

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.100
sometimes I conducted
if Tim was away.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.120
Either the senior organ scholar or
I would conduct the choir, so it's,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.360
again, it was just another step

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.650
on that whole musical
ladder in training.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.230
And the great thing about Cambridge
particularly, it happens at Oxnard

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.920
as well, but I think
more so at Cambridge,

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.010
that the student music making
was an exceptionally high level.

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.080
The instrumental standard
at Cambridge,

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.040
not just the music scholars,
but people studying the sciences

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.490
or whatever, the instrumental
level was incredibly high

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.510
and people were just
trying things and putting

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.430
on concerts all over the place.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.330
So you could guarantee
anywhere in Cambridge

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.680
on any given day there'd be 4, 5,

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.030
6 different concerts
put on by students.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.350
Usually at a pretty high level.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:45.230
So it was a fantastic place to
flex your muscles and try things.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.190
So by the time I was in my
2nd year I started putting

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.010
on baroque concerts.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:52.310
Because a certain ...

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.780
I'm sure you all remember
the last time I was here,

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.520
I came with a certain Andrew Manze.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.900
My great, violinist colleague.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.000
He came to Claire in my 2nd year

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.220
and he wasn't interested
in baroque music at all.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:08.310
We were playing piano
trios together with Fauré

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.360
and Beethoven and whatever.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.530 position:56%
And I said, "Well, we can work,"
'cause I had already started playing

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.370
with another colleague in my
1st year, playing harpsichord.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.040
And I said, "Play some
baroque violin,"

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.340
he said, "I'm not interested.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.640
Not interested.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.940
I'm not interested in that."

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:26.270
So I just put his name on a poster
playing Brandenburg 4 and told him

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:29.750
to go get a baroque bow from
the music faculty, which he did

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:31.490
and he dropped it in the
middle of the last movement

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.970
because he wasn't quite
used to it yet.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:38.270
But then he got the bug as well,
and the rest is history, so.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:42.120
But that was the kind of place
it was, it was very possible just

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.050
to try stuff and put concerts on,

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:47.740
especially if you were the organ
scholar and had sort of control

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.120
over the chapel, you could
just book it and put things on.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.720
It was really fantastic.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.640
Fantastic time.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.940
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: I saw a comment
he said that he described you

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.590
as a very bendy artist, that's
B E N D Y, because you talked

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:05.870
about the malleability
and flexibility of lines.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:09.680
In your performances you
work toward this and so on.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.000
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: I think
that's something I've come more

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.380
and more to believe in, I mean.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:18.240
The 20th century sort of started
by verticalizing everything.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.890
Stravinsky started that.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.190
You know, you think
of the Rite of Spring,

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:26.720
everything suddenly having been
that way for hundreds of years,

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.600
music started being concerned much
more with rigidity and verticality.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.430
And that reflects itself
in all sorts

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.160
of things to do with performance.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.420 position:56%
The more I read and the more I think
about music and music of the past

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:44.760
and performance practice,
the more clear to me it is

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.950
that that is something that
is absolutely a modern idea,

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:53.310
a modern concept, of
rigidity and stiffness.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.830
We were looking at all
these wonderful manuscripts

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.580
and things today and you just have

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.930
to compare a beautiful
old manuscript,

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:03.120
or even an old edition,
to a modern edition.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.950
And there's just no,
there's no comparison.

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:10.560
The old ones are so beautiful
and they contain so much gesture

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.100
and direction, and just the
way things are written out.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.220
Certainly, in manuscript
sources, that's true.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:21.910
And as a player of the harpsichord,
which is, and I always say this,

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:28.270
this is not just for you, it is the
most unmusical thing on the planet.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:29.570
It does nothing.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:36.970 position:56%
It is the ultimate machine that goes
"ping" if you're a Monty Python fan.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.670
That is literally all it does.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:42.770
You have no control
over its dynamic.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.860
You have a little control
over the attack of the note.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.940
Particularly if you're
playing with quill plectra,

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.240
which are a little
bit more flexible,

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.420
mostly these days people
use plastic.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.600
They claim it's more durable.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.370
That's a debatable point,
but plastic is, of course,

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:00.770
it's a manmade substance.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.670
If you can imagine a bit
of the spine of a feather,

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.350
there is much more animal
flexibility in that.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.260
Although it's very little,
and it's very subtle.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:13.970
So it really is the machine that
goes "ping" and all you have to ...

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.640
All I can do to try
and make you believe

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.730
that it's producing music is,

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:23.250
the two things I have are
how long I play a note,

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.680
and where I play that note in time.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.720
If I were to play a series of
16th notes the same length,

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:36.070
absolutely metronomically divided,
it's completely mechanical.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:40.650
So the only way to make a
shape is to bend rhythmically

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.460
and how you hold the notes down.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.290
So those are the only two things
you have to make the harpsichord

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.950
into a musical instrument,
so it's a big challenge.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:55.840
So, flexibility is a necessity
for playing the harpsichord

00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:00.470
and not making it sound like
the most irritating thing ever.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.780
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: Spontaneity
too, you talk a lot about that,

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:06.130 position:56%
and I got a kick out of your comment
that you, reading that you wanted

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:08.880
to bring back romantic excess.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.090
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: Well, we
have these labels for music.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.670
You know, you say that
music is romantic,

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:15.120
you talk about romantic music,

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.710
which I guess to most people
would mean something starting

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:21.120
around the 1820s, whatever.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.260
People describe Schubert a
little bit as the first romantic.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:28.670 position:56%
Quite frankly I think these labels
are really poisonous, because to me,

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:35.980
Monteverdi, and Bach, and Handel,
and Castello are just as romantic

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.360
as Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.880
And in fact, it's more direct.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.600
The earlier the music, certainly

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:48.020
in 1790s actually is a more
direct correlation to how we,

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:52.060
as human beings, express
ourselves with our emotions.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.890
I mean, the thing about
Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky,

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:59.160
you'll have a slow movement
which lasts for 15 or 20 minutes,

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.210
and that's really all it
does for 15 or 20 minutes.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.820
Now, I'm sure you've been,
you've driven on a motor way

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.450
and somebody's cut you up.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.610
You've probably been driving along
listening to some nice Tchaikovsky

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:12.890
or Rachmaninoff on the radio and
then somebody will cut you up

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:15.120
and you just, you get very annoyed.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.720
So our emotions change
very, very quickly.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.270
And baroque music does that,

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:25.010
it's very much a mirror
of our emotions ...

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:29.150
So that's why, I mean I love
baroque music, in a way,

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:30.450
the most, because it's ...

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:32.900
I find it very human in it's ...

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.090
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: So
that's something else

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:37.610
about the further back you
go the dirtier it gets?

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:38.910
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: Yes.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:40.210
Yes.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:41.510
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: Can
you explain this a bit?

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:43.650
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: Yeah,
again, there's a perception

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:47.520
that we gained romantic excess.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.010
And you go back to baroque music
and it's slightly squeaky clean,

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.250
and classical music is
a little bit dirtier,

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:57.820
and romantic music is a little bit
more romantic, and then suddenly,

00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.560
it all goes wrong with
Mahler and Schönberg

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.990
and then we start again
with neoclassicism.

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:07.560
But actually, historically
speaking, if you look at and listen

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.720
to old recordings, or look at
old sources for violin fingerings

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:19.160
for instance, the idea that
Porter meant of "sliding around",

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.340
is an early 20th century excess,
and it didn't happen before that.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.960
Is absolutely the wrong way around.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:30.510
In fact, vibrato comes in and
becomes a sort of normal thing

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:33.450
in the 20th century, but if you
think about portamento there,

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.060
the idea of sliding
around on a violin

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:40.610
or which comes from vocal art.

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:43.860
If you look at fingerings
going backwards,

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:49.540
there is more portamento going
backwards in history than less.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:54.020 position:56%
So for instance if you look at, take
a great romantic piece of music,

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.160
Mendelssohn's violin concerto.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:02.940
That was premiered by Ferdinand
David and we have both,

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:10.750
the great Joseph Joachim, who was
Brahms' violinist who knew David,

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:15.750 position:56%
is 10 years younger than Ferdinand
David and also played the Brahms ...

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:20.370
the Mendelssohnic concerto
very successfully.

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:24.210
If you compare the fingerings
of both of those two violinists,

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:29.240
the older violinist, Ferdinand
David, has more portamento in it

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.570
than the next generation,
Joseph Joachim.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.490
And it's the same if
you start looking

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:38.580
at piano recordings,
which we have ...

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.960
Of course we have recordings
of people like Paderewski,

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.920
but actually the earliest
recordings we have are piano rolls

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:51.200
and have a guess at when
the earliest pianist

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.910
to be recorded on piano
roll was born.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:57.820
Have a guess.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.820
Sir?

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.560
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: 1805.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:08.690
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: That's a very,
very wild guess, but actually 1824.

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:11.500
I wish there would be some
from 1805, I really do,

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.850
'cause that would be fascinating.

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:17.420
Carl Reinecke was born in 1824,

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.310
which was 3 years before
Beethoven died,

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:21.950
and he left a lot of piano rolls.

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:25.250
He was in the middle of recording
a whole set of Mozart sonatas.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:29.480
He was very much known for
his Mozart performances.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:35.490
And he left some pretty wild
and wacky recordings of Mozart.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:38.880
And again, if you take
someone like Carl Reinecke,

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.470
and the next generation,
Leschetitzky,

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:50.750
who was Schnabel's teacher, who
was born 6 years later in 1830.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:55.650
They both made piano
rolls of Mozart's big,

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:57.550
great fantasy in C minor.

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:00.530
The one that starts
with the octaves.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:08.810 position:56%
Pianist theater these days would not
dare to break any of those octaves.

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:14.200
Your teacher would send you out of
the room if you break any of those.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.870
[inaudible] break those octaves,
you have to find fingerings

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:19.460
and contortions which will
make it absolutely together,

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:22.140
and you must play it
rigidly in tempo.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.330 position:56%
You compare the two recordings of,
the piano rolls of both Leschetitzky

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:31.500
and Reinecke, out of the 7,
8 octaves at the beginning.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:36.520
I think Leschetitzky
breaks 5 of them.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.150
Reinecke breaks all but 1 of them.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:47.510
And he was known as a very
conservative performer of music.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:50.490
So the more I look
into this stuff ...

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.000
There's a fantastic book
if you're interested

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.270
by Neal Peres Da Costa who's
a great friend of mine,

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:56.960
he's in Australia at Sydney.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.880
He's done lots of research
into this.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.330
The book is called "Off the
Record" and he looks at all ...

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:07.730 position:56%
Very, very dispassionately takes all
this, these bits of information ...

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:11.550
So again, the trend
going backwards is

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:15.210
for more color, for
more expressivity.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:21.510 position:56%
If we listen to that today, teachers
would just walk out of the room.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:22.810
Who's right?

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:24.120
It's an interesting question.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.420
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: And
what about rubato?

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.470
We were talking a little
bit about this earlier too.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:32.020 position:56%
And especially since it's not
really notated in these early scores

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.350
like the ones we were looking at.

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:36.330
How do you develop your
sense of when to do these?

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.800
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: It's
by looking at the music

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.100
and just sort of trying ...

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.400
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: Instinct.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.700
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: Well, it's
instinct, but it's also ...

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.190
The thing about rubato is
it is, again if you ...

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:49.260
Taking an example of earlier
recordings, it's very deliberate,

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:54.170
very very deliberate use
of structural rubato.

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:58.100
And the thing that is, that
people generally mean these days

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:02.290
by "rubato" is usually getting
slower, or playing late.

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:06.000
If you listen to pianists
"doing rubato" in Chopin,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.610
everything is wobbling
all over the place,

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:10.820
but they're playing hands together.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:14.550
If you take Chopin knocked onto
something with a very expressive,

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:18.090
sort of cantabile right hand.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:23.520 position:56%
The rubato of a modern player is the
hands are very much linked together,

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.110
and they will do a
little bit of backwards,

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.280
usually backwards rather
than forwards.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.010
But if you listen,
again, to old pianists,

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:34.960
and they do much more what
both Chopin and Mozart describe

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.370
as "keeping the left hand ..."

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:40.530
Usually, the phrase is,
"playing in strict tempo",

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:45.230
whereas the right hand
goes around the left hand.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:50.270
Now, again, if you read Neal's
book, what a 17th, 18th,

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:53.530
and 19th century musician
meant by "playing

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:57.930
in strict tempo" is not what
we mean as post-Stravinskyian,

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.880
post-modern musicians as
playing in strict tempo,

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.610
which means basically metronomic.

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:05.870
So it's a fascinating area of
study, and I think this kind

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:08.680
of thing is coming
much more into the area

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:12.130
of performance practice these days.

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:13.430
Which is great.

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:19.150
The more I read and try and find
out about this stuff, the more ...

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:23.360
in a way, the more permission it
seems to give me to be expressive,

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.990
and to push the boundaries
of expressivity.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:30.860
Because, again, I don't find
Monteverdi any less passionate

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:32.500
or expressive than Rachmaninoff.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:36.010
It's just a different style of
music and there are different ways

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.180
of creating that expressivity.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:42.260
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: So we have this
quintessentially English program

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:43.890
that maybe you could talk
a little bit about some

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:45.190
of the pieces on the program ...

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:46.490
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: Yeah.

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:47.790
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: And the
Fitzwilliam Virginal Book.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.090
How that came into being.

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:50.390
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: It's very big.

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:56.960
It was collected by Tregian and
it's a massive, massive compendium

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.090
of very, very many composers.

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:02.950
A substantial amount of
William Byrd, who's perhaps one

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:06.720
of the great, great keyboard
players and composers

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:12.180
of the 16th and early 17th century.

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:14.240
Lots of Doctor John Bull, which is,

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.710
I don't know whether you
know John Bull's music,

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:18.540
it's a little bit strange.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.250
I'm not sure if I'm a great
fan of Doctor John Bull,

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.710
but everybody in the 16th and
17th century seemed to be,

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:27.980
and he has an incredibly
difficult music

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.460
in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.100
One of the sad things about today,

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.850
I've just been seeing all
these wonderful first-editions

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.520
and manuscripts that you
have here and I've been

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.640
like a schoolboy in
a candy shop today.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.670
It's been absolutely wonderful.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:51.100
There is still not
available a decent edition

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.170
of the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book,
though the one that was published

00:21:54.170 --> 00:22:00.380
at the turn of the 20th century,
the 1902, 1903, is full of errors

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.760
and there's been nothing since.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.700
You cannot buy a facsimile,
there's no facsimile online.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.460
So please, if anybody can do
anything about that, I'd be very,

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.720
very grateful, 'cause
it contains some

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.060
of the most incredible
music from that period.

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.940
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: Would this music
have been for small gatherings

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.330
at the court or just
private invitation?

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:21.830
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: The
different things, I mean,

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:25.060
they're different types
of music in the book.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:28.310
There are sets of variations
on pop tunes,

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:31.760
there are fantasies,
there are organ pieces.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:35.960
There's a whole variety, it's a
real compendium of what was going

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.870
on with the keyboard at that time

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:41.350
and not particularly designed
for any one instrument.

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:44.800
That's another thing that
people try and figure

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.750
out which pieces were
played on which.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:50.560
Now there are obviously some
of the pieces which are sacred

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:54.580
in nature are more at home on an
organ, but it doesn't mean to say

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:57.500
that you can't play them on
a harpsichord or a spinet

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.030
or any other instrument
that was around at the time.

00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:02.960 position:56%
And that's true, really,
throughout the 18th century as well.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.640
People were playing, Mozart was
still playing the harpsichord.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.650
Beethoven started playing, his
first job was as a harpsichordist.

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:13.180
So, the harpsichord was gasping
for breath still at the end

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.660
of the 18th century,
but it was still around.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.620
So it was still very much and ...

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:24.600
A good little fact to know is
even Beethoven's Moonlight sonata,

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:30.320
when it was first published,
was for piano or harpsichord.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.660
Now can you imagine the
Moonlight sonata on harpsichord?

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.740
It would sound revolting.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.790
But, yet, it was still a market.

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:42.280
It was still a market to sell
to people, to old fuddy duddies

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.010 position:56%
who still had a harpsichord at home,

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:45.510
and perhaps wanted
to play the music.

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:50.770 position:56%
So, lots of different keyboards were
around still in the 18th century.

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:52.350
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: So
the term, "virginal",

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:54.620
is that a variety of
plucked instruments?

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:57.040
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: It's
basically a ...

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.140
To be precise, it's
the English version

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:05.060
of what was known in
Belgium as a musilar.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:11.340 position:56%
It's sort of like a double briefcase
sized long, oblong instrument

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.690
which is plucked more
or less in the middle.

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:15.140
And it's a little bit like now,

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.760
'cause you drive on
the right, don't you?

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.480
Well, we drive on the left.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.500
I don't really know this, well we
drive on the right side, actually,

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.820 position:56%
but never mind, won't get into that.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:28.090
But we have the same thing
with the virginals from Belgium

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:31.790
and from England, they
just had the keyboards

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:34.260
on slightly different
sides of the middle.

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:41.460
But it's a very particular
kind of quite tubular sound.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:46.670
It's very pleasant
for about 5 minutes.

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:48.580
But then it's a little,
I find it a little,

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:54.630
it just sort of does one
thing, and the sound shape

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:58.570
of the note decays quite, even
more than the harpsichord.

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:02.920 position:56%
It's a little sort of drier and more
tubular than the harpsichord even.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:10.220
And the action is not as
reliable as a harpsichord

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.150
because of the nature
of where the ...

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:14.790
It's being plucked more in the
middle and that causes all sorts

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:16.470
of trouble with regulation.

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:20.440
There are many, many sources
from the time, the late 16th

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:23.870
and 17th century, that say
that the action was really bad

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:27.200
and it made it sound like
little pigs grunting.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:32.420
So I think the virginals, it
was certainly an instrument

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:35.710
which people had, but I think the
professionals would probably be

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:37.010
playing on a ...

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:38.660
On some kind of harpsichord.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:39.970
It's a very attractive sound.

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:41.650
But not for too long.

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:46.530
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: You know I heard
this Sweelinck toccata you're going

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:49.550
to be doing on a big
organ in Holland

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:51.700
and it was just mind
blowing, really.

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:55.220
But how did he get to be an
honorary Englishman in this volume?

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.770
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: I
find, I don't know,

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:58.070
there's something about Sweelinck.

00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:04.000
I mean I've lived in Amsterdam
for 27 years coming on now

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.140
and the Dutch are very, are there
any Dutch people here today?

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:11.520
The Dutch are very,
very interesting people

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:15.070
and they quite rightly
regard Sweelinck

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:19.280
as a great Dutch master, as he was.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:26.210
But they tend to play him in a
terribly, terribly sort of somber,

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:32.320
sober, strict, sort
of Calvinist way.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.930
And I don't think that's
the music at all.

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:39.150
It's an incredible, and
partly my take on it as well,

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:41.950
but when you figure
out where he worked.

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:45.050
He worked at the Old
Church in Amsterdam.

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:46.450
Have you ever been to
Amsterdam, any of you?

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:50.510
Do you know what happens
around the Old Church?

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:53.330
It's a rather red colored area.

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:56.700
And it always has been,
for centuries.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:00.210
It is the most colorful
area of Amsterdam,

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:04.130 position:56%
and that is where Sweelinck
worked, and not, as you might think,

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:06.430
playing for church services.

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:10.080
His basic job was to play at
the Old Church at lunch time

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.010
between about 12 and 2

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:16.170
when businessmen did
business in the church.

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.000
And what he was employed to do was

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.660
to play basically variations
on pop tunes.

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:28.280
So the sort of idea of him being
this very sober musician is not ...

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:32.230
And then the music is spectacularly
colorful in the same way

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:36.060
that the Byrd fantasy I'm
going to play, the toccata,

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.510
they're actually, they're
sort of ...

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:39.810
I hadn't realized that there was,

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:42.680
I sort of felt this cosmic
connection between the two of them.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.710
But when I put these two
pieces in the program,

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:49.860
I felt there was something then it
just suddenly struck me that one

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:54.530
of the themes is used
in both pieces.

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:59.890
I'll say that again later
in the hall, but it's ...

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:02.540
So there is definitely some
kind of cosmic connection.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:05.340
And it was just sort of a
chance to give Sweelinck a bit

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:08.210
of an outing 'cause he's a
really fabulous composer.

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:10.000
It's absolutely first rate music.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.280
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: And this Fantasia
Chromatica is virtuosic to me.

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:14.580
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: Oh yeah.

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:15.880
It's virtuosic in lots of ways.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.180
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: Yeah.

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:18.870 position:56%
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: It's virtuosic in
the sense of the composition itself.

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:20.700
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: The
composition, exactly.

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:22.970
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: It's on a
level with Frescobaldi and Byrd

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:26.750
and what he does with the
material is spectacular.

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:29.210
And it's very, very, very colorful.

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:34.250 position:56%
And I'll say a little bit more about
that when we're on stage as well.

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:35.550
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: Yeah, we're ...

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:36.850
I was amazed looking the score.

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:39.560
There are so many constant
entries of the tune ...

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.860
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: Yeah.

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:44.520
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: And so many
counter subjects, it's all ...

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:50.690
Regarding the Morali, I found this
thing that talks about fantasy.

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:54.290
"When a musician taketh the point
as its pleasure, and resteth

00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:56.580
and turneth it as he list."

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:57.980
We just got about a nice thing.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:01.970
Is there, how much freedom
in there for these is there?

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:03.270
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: In the fantasies?

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:04.630
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: For a player?

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:08.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: If you take
certainly the great Byrd fantasy I'm

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:12.940
going to play in A minor, the whole
point of the fantasy was to ...

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:16.400
Again, people have this idea that
a fantasy is this kind of strict,

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:20.480
slightly sober, delineation
of material.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.580
And that's exactly what it says
there, the idea of a fantasy was

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.660
that for a composer
to exert his fantasy

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:30.240 position:56%
on the material that he chose to do.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:36.440
So you'll have a point, a musical
point, which you can kind of do

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:39.280
as much or as little
with as you wish.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.930
And the Byrd changes very fast.

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:45.560
There are many, many different
ideas which come in the Byrd piece

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.950
from sort of more strict
counterpoints,

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:52.250
something which sounds a little
bit like dance bands, and lots,

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:53.700
lots of poly rhythms going on.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.420
It's not quite South
American, but it's ...

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.790
There's a lot of, lot of
fun to be had in this music.

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:02.150
It's incredibly varied.

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:08.940
So every bit of material has its
own gesture and its own tempo

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:13.170
and its own expressive devices.

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:14.960
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: Is the
Purcell pieces at the end,

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.280
I think they're vocal
transcriptions, are they?

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.580
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: Yeah.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:19.880
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: How does ...

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.180
Tell us about that.

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:22.480
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: Yeah, I'm playing
3 grounds in the second half,

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.860
one of which is actually,
probably by Croft.

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:29.160
But I think it's good enough to
be merited with a Purcell's name.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.490 position:56%
Yeah, Purcell made these
transcriptions and some vocal pieces

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:35.880
from odes so the New Grand
in E minor you might've heard

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.800
as "Here the Deities
Approve", a great counter tenor

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:44.320
or alto aria song in
the middle of an ode.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.880
And he made these amazing
little transcriptions

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.690
and they really are spectacular.

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:53.700
They don't look, if you were to
just look at them on the paper,

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.870
unless you had good imagination,
which I'm sure you all do.

00:30:56.870 --> 00:31:00.880
You wouldn't quite believe
how fantastic they are,

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.810
these transcriptions of these
grands and I'm finishing off

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:07.000
with another one of these,
the grand in E minor,

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.150
which I think is an absolute
little gem, a little masterpiece.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:14.370
So it leaves the concert
with a little bit

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:16.140
of wist in the air, if you like.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.470
A bit of wistfulness.

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:20.570
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: One of the
things that is on display,

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:22.740
and Ray White is going to
be showing it and talking

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:24.410
to you during the intermission.

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:27.250
We have a first edition of a
choice collection of lessons

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:31.210
for the harpsichord or spinet
from 1696 and it has a preface

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:33.530
where they go into some
detail about ornamentation.

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:34.830
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: Mm-hmm.

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:36.130
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: I wanted to
ask you, I saw this reference

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:37.970 position:56%
in the Ashgate guide to personal ...

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:41.310
it talks about indigenous
English ornamentation.

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:43.360
What does that mean?

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.660
What would you say?

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:45.960
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: Well
I think the English,

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.660
because you know, we are ...

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:51.350
I'm afraid we're an island, and
we are very much island people,

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:56.290
we've always had our own kind of
special take on imported stuff.

00:31:56.290 --> 00:32:02.120 position:56%
But the ornaments are basically
ornaments which come from lute music

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.920
from both Italy and France.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.970
From the end of the 16th,
beginning of the 17th century.

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:13.100
But, like most things in England,
they have their own take on it.

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.910
English humor is very English.

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:17.970
Monty Python is, you know, it
couldn't be from anywhere else.

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:20.330
Any of you know The Goons?

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:26.330 position:56%
Just go back and English humor's
always had this kinda slightly weird

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:32.020
take on things, and the ornaments,
both the personal and blow sweets,

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.420
they're basically the
French ornaments,

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:36.620
but the way that they're
used and ...

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:41.580
throughout the piece,
it's very English.

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:42.930
That's all I can say.

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:48.250
It's just a little bit English
and slightly kinky in that way.

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:51.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: Well this is a great
segway into a question about one

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:54.820
of your most recent projects,
which is definitely purely English.

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:58.380
And that is your new
recording of H.M.S. Pinafore.

00:32:58.380 --> 00:32:59.680
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: Yes.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:00.980
Well it's funny.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:04.630
I mean, I, like most
English prep school boys,

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:09.890
we were made to do all
boy, all male productions

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:11.830
of The Mikado and what
else did we do?

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:13.130
Pirates of Penzance.

00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:16.270 position:56%
I was a Japanese lady in The Mikado,
I'm sure you can imagine that.

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:17.570
It's perfectly natural.

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:21.350
So there's a sort of,
it's a bit like cricket.

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:26.970
We just understand cricket because
we're English and we love Gilbert

00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:28.890
and Sullivan because we're English.

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:31.230
I believe there's actually
a big Gilbert

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:33.710
and Sullivan following
in the states as well.

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:38.930
And it's very much of its time,
but it's also incredibly skillful.

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:43.570
I mean, Sullivan's music,
particularly in that score,

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:48.910
you can tell that, I mean he went
to study in Leipzig when he was 16.

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:52.100
So he was a seriously good musician

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:56.220
and had a thoroughly
proper training.

00:33:56.220 --> 00:34:02.140 position:56%
And when you look at the score, it's
just full of wonderful orchestration

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:06.900
which he's got directly from his
knowledge and love of Mozart.

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:12.210 position:56%
And it's just jolly good fun, and it
came about because we were sitting

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:15.820 position:56%
around during the recording, we made
the recording of the John Passion

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:17.660
with the Academy of Ancient Music.

00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:19.560
We were sitting around
after the recording

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:24.440
with a very large couple
of bottles of wine.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:28.020
And we just looked at the cast
that we'd had and someone said,

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:31.770
it wasn't me, it was either
the producer or cast manager,

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:34.820
"Isn't that a great
Gilbert and Sullivan cast?"

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:40.360
And 2 years later I was asked to do
H.M.S. Pinafore then for a festival

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.820
by that orchestra manager who now
works at the end of a festival,

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:46.740
he put that into practice
and I did the H.M.S. Pinafore

00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:48.240
with Scottish opera.

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:51.180
With most of the cast that
was on the John Passion

00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:53.090
and just had a great time.

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:57.430
And again, it was something that
I researched very thoroughly.

00:34:57.430 --> 00:35:00.010
There are some very,
very old recordings

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:03.960
of H.M.S. Pinafore,
there are 2 from 1907.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:07.060
Which is a lot closer to when
it was first on than we are now.

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:10.530
So it's a fascinating ...

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:12.620
I always try to apply ...

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:13.920
It's all early music.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.220
I mean the Beatles is
early music as well.

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:19.950
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: Did you run into
any performance practice challenges

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:21.250
or are ...

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:23.880
There's also a canon of theater
traditions around it, right?

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:26.990
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: Yeah,
certainly from the later ...

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:31.410
Well, again, there are 2
new schools or text schools,

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:37.150
with massive amounts of notes
about what comes from where.

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:40.090
So there are lots of decisions
to be made on that but.

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:44.240
No, I just went back to the ...

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.770
I got the orchestra to, again,
to start sliding around a lot,

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:51.740
and was quite flexible
in approach to tempo

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:56.030
and all those good things, really.

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:57.500
But it's fantastic music.

00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:00.140
It's just, it's absolutely
wonderful music.

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:01.440
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: What
plans for other ...

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.010
I mean, you have so many
blossoming projects.

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:05.820
What else is coming
up for you like this?

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.120
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: I can't ...

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.160
I know what I'm doing
next week, I think.

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.660 position:56%
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: This is a big tour
I should say, what you're doing now,

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:13.690
Montreal, New York, Washington.

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:15.520
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: It's an
intense week, this week, so ...

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:19.590 position:56%
I have another concert in Pittsburgh
tomorrow, then I stagger home

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:24.510
or onto a plane, or two
planes, which'll take me home.

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:26.160
No, I mean it's ...

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:30.610
What I love doing the
big variety of things.

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:37.700 position:56%
I'm not the kind of musician who has
ever wanted to be restricted to ...

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:39.090
People love to put you in a box.

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:42.690
They love to say, "He's an
early music specialist, so,"

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:46.680
but that's why I record
Stachofsky or Castro transcriptions

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:48.440
and make a recording
of H.M.S. Pinafore

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:51.530
because the people go, "Oh."

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:55.200
And I've always been like
that and Andrew was the same,

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.170
Andrew Manze was exactly the same.

00:36:57.170 --> 00:37:01.810 position:56%
We sort of grew up that way, we
weren't prepared to be put in a box.

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:04.850
And we've always done other
things, and Andrew is now,

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:07.110
as you probably know, having
a very successful career

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:11.110
as a modern conductor
conducting a modern orchestra,

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:14.760 position:56%
conducting Vaughan Williams, and
Bruckner, and Mahler 5, he just did.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:17.260
And he doesn't actually
doesn't do any early music

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:19.130
at all, at the moment.

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:22.860
And hasn't done since 2008
when he put his violin away.

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:27.880
But neither of us have ever wanted
to restrict ourselves to ...

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:30.600
Because music is music.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.030
And basically, there
are two types of music.

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:36.030
Good music and bad music.

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:38.180
And if it's good music,
I'm interested in it.

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:43.010
And I'm interested in some of
the bad music, actually, as well.

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:46.090
So I've always sort of
been fascinated by music.

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:48.080
That's why I say I
am a music addict.

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:51.230
And if something comes along
and grabs my attention,

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:54.350 position:56%
then I will grab it and run with it.

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:55.870
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: Well it's
really exciting for us

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:58.260
to have had this chance to
chat with you about all these,

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:00.310
sort of, passions of yours.

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:02.460
And I wondered if there's
some folks that would

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:05.700
like to ask a few questions before
Richard has to go back and warm up.

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.000
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: Please
do, it's always interesting

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.900
to see what questions I get asked.

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:23.280
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: I have a question on
the harpsichords that you play.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:28.360
Just because the plastic and
the quills that you put on tour,

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:33.190
you get different harpsichord
tall that you go to?

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:36.150
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: The question,
if you didn't hear it is,

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:41.820
do I get a different
harpsichord everywhere I go?

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:43.770
Simple answer is yes.

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:47.240
And actually, generally,
particularly in the states,

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:51.170
and I've never had bad instruments.

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:56.800
I've had some interestingly
tuned instruments.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:05.660
But no, there is a great level
of good instruments here.

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:09.130
That's not the case
all over the world,

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:14.690
it's been slightly challenging
getting some instruments

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:17.430
in the far east, occasionally,

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:20.440
'cause it's just it's
very new there.

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:24.010
So, I went to Bangkok for
the first time this year,

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:26.860
and there is one harpsichord
in Bangkok

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:31.510
which was bought not too long
ago in the last 4 or 5 years,

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:34.920
but whoever bought it, didn't
really know what they were getting

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.220
into when they bought it.

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:42.320
So rather than having bought
a very good modern copy

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.340
of a historical instrument,
they bought some sort

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.420
of slightly dodgy something which
was perhaps modeled on something

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:47.770
in Soviet Russia in about 1958.

00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:49.070
But that's fine, but they
didn't know any better.

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:50.590 position:56%
Generally, the harpsichords here are
really, really excellent, so I'm ...

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:51.890
But it's, but that's
part of the job,

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:53.190
and if you're an organist,
you have the same thing.

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:54.490
If you go to a church and
there's a different organ.

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:55.790
You just get used to
just getting on with it

00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:57.090
and dealing with what you're given.

00:39:57.090 --> 00:39:58.390
And that's also part of the fun.

00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:59.690 position:56%
It's not always fun, but mostly fun.

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:02.970
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: What do you consider
to be interesting bad music?

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:09.140
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: That's
a good question now.

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:15.970
Now that I said that ...

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:17.270
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Heavy metal?

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:19.500
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: Well
actually, I do like heavy metal,

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.060
I'm a great great fan of ...

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:24.050
I've even got a couple
of CDs of some sort

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:27.120
of really dark metal stuff as well.

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:32.650
And a friend of mine, a very, very
fine timpani player, brilliant,

00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:35.890
brilliant timpani player,
has a sort of ...

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:39.300
Not quite grunge, but a
really really dark band called

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:41.320
Plastic Noose.

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:46.180
Now, I will listen to anything.

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:48.650
I don't say I always
understand it, but ...

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:51.600
yeah. Good question, I'll think

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:55.500
about the bad music
that I'm interested in.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.720 position:56%
But I'm kind of interested in music,

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:00.540
I will listen to anything,
pretty much.

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:04.000
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: So I have another
question about ornamentation,

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.390
personal expression of
the performer, phrasing.

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:11.230
Could you speak a little bit more
about your approach verses others?

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:16.020
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: Well I think
we talked about this earlier.

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:17.980
Take Bach as an example.

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:20.780
There's certainly quite
a lot of people,

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:29.540
even in the historical world, who
frown on you if you ornament Bach.

00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:32.190
You know, cause Bach is, it's
all written down, you don't need

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:34.150
to do anymore, it's all perfect ...

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:38.670
Now, that is patently, for me at
least, my understanding of some,

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:41.830
that's just, that wouldn't happen.

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:43.810
If you look at all different
sources, if you're looking

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:48.370
at the French Swedes for instance,
today, there's no manuscript

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:54.830
from Bach himself, but they're
all copies made by pupils or sons

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:59.080
and all of these secondary
sources have variance.

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.900
Different ornaments,
different slurs.

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.870 position:56%
Now, that's a musicologist's
nightmare, 'cause it means they have

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:09.190 position:56%
to write pages and pages of critical
commentary trying to figure out

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:12.820
and make the decisions of which
one they take into an edition.

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:20.050
For me, it's another example of the
performer has a certain freedom,

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:22.780
responsibility of freedom,
given a text.

00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:25.480
So, and even Bach.

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:28.970
Bach was an inveterate tinkerer
looking at the something

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:30.670
like the Matthew Passion.

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:33.980
The first verse which I
recorded, is very, very different

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:36.170
from the version that most
of you have probably heard.

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:39.540
It's much more decorated,
it's much more ornamented.

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:42.640
So the idea of adding
stuff was something

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.560
that Bach was doing
for himself anyway.

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:50.850 position:56%
And any performer at that time would
naturally put their take on it,

00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:56.100
it's like any great jazz saxophone
player playing a standard will have

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:58.510
their own idea of how
to decorate a melody.

00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:02.160
And any violinist in the
baroque or even actually,

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:05.280
even the classical period, would
probably make his own decorations

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:09.310
through reports of opera woodwind
instruments, woodwind players

00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:11.390
at the beginning of
the 19th century.

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:14.290
Being criticized for
still doing ornaments.

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:19.950
So there's a Dussek sonata, the
great, great sonata by one of my,

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:22.260
again, another one of
my great, great heroes,

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:24.090
Dussek is a great composer.

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:30.450
Beginning of a sonata for the
death of Ferdinand of Prussia.

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:33.260
Where it just starts with
a left hand bunch of notes,

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:35.600
and he has to right at the
beginning, just very simple,

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.000
low notes in quarter notes.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.710
He had to write in the beginning
of the score, this is 1807,

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:46.740
senza ornamenti: "don't ornament."

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:51.880
So the whole practice of
music making was imbued

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.480
with personal ornamentation,

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:58.290
so to say that you shouldn't
ornament Bach is really,

00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:00.160
I think, nonsense.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:04.130
It was just expected in
part of being a performer.

00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:07.410 position:56%
And you wouldn't necessarily do that
if you're doing the B minor mass,

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:10.020
if you've got something
as complex as that,

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.500
and everybody started doing
their own ornamentation then,

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:14.780
of course, that's slightly bonkers.

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:18.510
But certainly, when you're playing
a keyboard piece or something

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:23.110
where a solo performer is
involved in bringing up a piece

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:25.120
like that then it would've
been expected

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:31.280
that you would add your own layer
of stuff on top of the foundation.

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.680
So that was a long
answer, wasn't it?

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.240
I'm sorry about that.

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:38.680
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: I had another Bach
question which is what do you feel

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:42.110
about playing Bach on the
piano verses the harpsichord?

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:45.690
And do you play him on the piano
as well as the harpsichord,

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:50.290
and which pieces sort of lend
themselves to which instrument?

00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:53.080 position:56%
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: I think it's sort
of a little bit what I said earlier.

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.410
Bach is great.

00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:56.890
The music for me doesn't change.

00:44:56.890 --> 00:45:00.020
I've played Bach on a synthesizer.

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:01.560
And it's great fun.

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:05.410
When I play Bach on a modern
piano, the music doesn't change,

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:08.760
but the tool has changed,
it does different things.

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:13.840
But I always, if I conduct a
modern orchestra doing old music,

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:18.440
what I do, and why I'm absolutely
committed to old instruments,

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:24.200
is if you play Bach using an
old harpsichord or an organ,

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:27.780
it shows you so much about the
color possibilities of the music.

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:30.910
And I use that knowledge, and I
take it with me when I play it

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:33.840
on the modern piano or on the
synthesizer or whatever it is.

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:38.730 position:56%
So, I'm certainly not one of those
purist early musicians who say, "Oh,

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:43.790
you mustn't play Bach on a piano."

00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:45.170
I won't say that.

00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:48.830
Because Bach can sound absolutely
gorgeous on a modern piano

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:51.920
if you have someone that's
sensitive to the music.

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.220
I've heard ...

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:56.020
So, for instance, I've
heard some really,

00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:59.260
really beautiful performances
of Bach on the modern piano.

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:01.580
And I've heard some
really hideous performances

00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:04.880
of Bach on the harpsichord.

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:08.130
It's not all about the instruments,
but it's about your understanding

00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:11.840
of music through using the
instruments to tell you something

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.840
about the music that
they were written for.

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:17.300
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: Maybe
one more question,

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:20.790
does anyone have a final one?

00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:23.360
No? Okay.

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:29.490
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Oh I just had a
question about if trend's good

00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:32.990
or bad for baroque opera, and the
example recently that I'm thinking

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:37.070
of is the Folketeatret doing the
reorchestration and translation

00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:39.300
of the Monteverdi operas
into German.

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:42.990
Is that a trend or the
sort of idea that you have

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:46.730
to change baroque opera to
sort of make it presentable,

00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:49.010 position:56%
or is it just one of the variations?

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:50.310
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: You
mean in terms of language,

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:52.230
or in terms of everything that
had to do with baroque opera?

00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:53.530
I mean ...

00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:56.120
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Well, that they
reorchestrated and translated it.

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:57.980
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: That's
a tricky one, because ...

00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:03.230
To go back and take part,
if you were, as an audience,

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:07.500
were transported back to
an opera house in London,

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.240
listening to a Handel opera.

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:11.530
It would be a very, very
different experience

00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:14.240
from sitting in an opera house now.

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:17.020
Because you wouldn't be
expected to sit there

00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:20.380
for 5 hours, concentrating.

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:23.440
You could be doing all
sorts of things in the boxes

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.030
at the back, and you know.

00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:26.980
It's just, it's a different
experience.

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:29.170
So you know, you would
have to go to a...

00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:32.440
If it was a successful opera,
you'd probably go and see it 4

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:34.760
or 5 times, just to get to know it.

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:36.820
And you'd go to listen
to your favorite aria

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.120
with your favorite singer.

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:41.650
And once the singer had gone off,
you'd be probably playing cards.

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:46.930
It's a very different, different
thing and translating an opera

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:51.190
into a native language
can be very helpful.

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:54.050
Reorchestration's a different,
that's a different thing.

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:58.520
I don't think that's
necessarily necessary.

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:01.510
It's not a necessity.

00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:03.760
But there again, you
know I love Stachofsky,

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:07.390
and I love Stachofsky's
arrangement of baroque music.

00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:10.220
I've recorded lots of it.

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:13.510
It would be good to know the
reason why they did that.

00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:15.180
Do you know the reason why they ...

00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:16.480
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: I do not.

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:17.780
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: No.

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:20.940
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: I was skeptical,
but I didn't hate it.

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:23.430
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: Well,
there you go.

00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:25.140
That's positive.

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:26.940
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: Well
that's a good note then.

00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:28.520
So thank you so much, Richard.

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:29.820
&gt;&gt; RICHARD EGARR: You're
welcome, you're welcome.

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:33.970
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: We were
delighted to have you.

00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:35.270
[applause]

00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:37.450
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
