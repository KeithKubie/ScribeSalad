00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.720
all right so let's say you have oriented

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730
all right so let's say you have oriented
 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.990
all right so let's say you have oriented
yourself but not perfectly because

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000
yourself but not perfectly because
 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.810
yourself but not perfectly because
you're full of mistakes and errors so

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820
you're full of mistakes and errors so
 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.940
you're full of mistakes and errors so
then what do you do because you have to

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950
then what do you do because you have to
 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.410
then what do you do because you have to
fix those errors but you still have to

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420
fix those errors but you still have to
 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.700
fix those errors but you still have to
be oriented and this is why I started

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710
be oriented and this is why I started
 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.140
be oriented and this is why I started
getting interest to get interested in

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150
getting interest to get interested in
 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.779
getting interest to get interested in
the phenomena of meaning as a

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789
the phenomena of meaning as a
 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.640
the phenomena of meaning as a
phenomenological experience to

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650
phenomenological experience to
 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.740
phenomenological experience to
experience something as meaningful it's

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750
experience something as meaningful it's
 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.599
experience something as meaningful it's
not exactly obvious what that means to

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609
not exactly obvious what that means to
 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.099
not exactly obvious what that means to
experience something is meaningful I

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109
experience something is meaningful I
 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.410
experience something is meaningful I
think that you can you can approach it

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420
think that you can you can approach it
 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.290
think that you can you can approach it
obliquely you know like if I said watch

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300
obliquely you know like if I said watch
 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.330
obliquely you know like if I said watch
yourself for two weeks and notice when

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340
yourself for two weeks and notice when
 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.620
yourself for two weeks and notice when
you're doing something that you regard

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630
you're doing something that you regard
 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.420
you're doing something that you regard
is meaningful I could say well here's

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430
is meaningful I could say well here's
 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.750
is meaningful I could say well here's
some here's some markers you lose a

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760
some here's some markers you lose a
 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.340
some here's some markers you lose a
sense of time you lose a sense of

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350
sense of time you lose a sense of
 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.020
sense of time you lose a sense of
vulnerability you're deeply engaged in

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030
vulnerability you're deeply engaged in
 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.170
vulnerability you're deeply engaged in
it it seems it seems worth the effort

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180
it it seems it seems worth the effort
 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.060
it it seems it seems worth the effort
right you forget yourself while you're

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070
right you forget yourself while you're
 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.260
right you forget yourself while you're
doing it

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270
doing it
 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.610
doing it
maybe you forget your existential

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620
maybe you forget your existential
 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.170
maybe you forget your existential
concerns while you're doing it you're

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180
concerns while you're doing it you're
 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.459
concerns while you're doing it you're
not ruminating or obsessing about the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469
not ruminating or obsessing about the
 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.950
not ruminating or obsessing about the
meaning of your life right so so there's

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960
meaning of your life right so so there's
 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.569
meaning of your life right so so there's
markers for it's like the flow states

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579
markers for it's like the flow states
 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.780
markers for it's like the flow states
that chick said my highly described and

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790
that chick said my highly described and
 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.980
that chick said my highly described and
then you can experience it you

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990
then you can experience it you
 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.600
then you can experience it you
experience it under certain sort of

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610
experience it under certain sort of
 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.070
experience it under certain sort of
ritualistic conditions you might

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080
ritualistic conditions you might
 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.450
ritualistic conditions you might
experience it when you go see a great

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460
experience it when you go see a great
 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.160
experience it when you go see a great
movie you might experience it when you

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
movie you might experience it when you
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.690
movie you might experience it when you
listen to music I think music is a very

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700
listen to music I think music is a very
 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.410
listen to music I think music is a very
very standard pathway for people to have

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420
very standard pathway for people to have
 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.580
very standard pathway for people to have
that kind of experience because

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590
that kind of experience because
 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.820
that kind of experience because
virtually everyone gets intimations of

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830
virtually everyone gets intimations of
 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.249
virtually everyone gets intimations of
mute of meaning from music and I think

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259
mute of meaning from music and I think
 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.700
mute of meaning from music and I think
music music is hierarchically structured

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710
music music is hierarchically structured
 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.370
music music is hierarchically structured
patterns that are representative of

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380
patterns that are representative of
 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.010
patterns that are representative of
being laying itself out properly it's

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020
being laying itself out properly it's
 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.690
being laying itself out properly it's
something like that so it's an abstract

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700
something like that so it's an abstract
 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.679
something like that so it's an abstract
representation of proper being and so we

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689
representation of proper being and so we
 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.929
representation of proper being and so we
can we can grapple with the phenomena of

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939
can we can grapple with the phenomena of
 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.550
can we can grapple with the phenomena of
music and we can we can Bach or

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560
music and we can we can Bach or
 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.109
music and we can we can Bach or
phenomena of meaning we can box it in a

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119
phenomena of meaning we can box it in a
 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.639
phenomena of meaning we can box it in a
little bit and start to conceptualize it

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649
little bit and start to conceptualize it
 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.260
little bit and start to conceptualize it
we can start to conceptualize it perhaps

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270
we can start to conceptualize it perhaps
 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.690
we can start to conceptualize it perhaps
as the manifestation of a deep instinct

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700
as the manifestation of a deep instinct
 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.289
as the manifestation of a deep instinct
and so I would say well meaning is what

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299
and so I would say well meaning is what
 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.630
and so I would say well meaning is what
manifests itself when you are when

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640
manifests itself when you are when
 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.779
manifests itself when you are when
you've oriented yourself properly and

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789
you've oriented yourself properly and
 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.920
you've oriented yourself properly and
when you've optimized the flow of

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930
when you've optimized the flow of
 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.699
when you've optimized the flow of
information between you and you between

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709
information between you and you between
 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.380
information between you and you between
you and chaos that might be the right

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390
you and chaos that might be the right
 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.059
you and chaos that might be the right
way of thinking about it because later

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069
way of thinking about it because later
 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.589
way of thinking about it because later
you think about a piece of music if you

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599
you think about a piece of music if you
 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.750
you think about a piece of music if you
want it to be predictable but you don't

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760
want it to be predictable but you don't
 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.400
want it to be predictable but you don't
want it to be perfectly predictable you

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410
want it to be perfectly predictable you
 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.809
want it to be perfectly predictable you
want to be it to be predictable with

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819
want to be it to be predictable with
 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.220
want to be it to be predictable with
some interesting variations and

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230
some interesting variations and
 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.960
some interesting variations and
predictable with some variations that

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970
predictable with some variations that
 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.550
predictable with some variations that
make sense maybe you can conceptualize

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560
make sense maybe you can conceptualize
 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.100
make sense maybe you can conceptualize
that as something like this it's like

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110
that as something like this it's like
 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.160
that as something like this it's like
it's predictable at this order of

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170
it's predictable at this order of
 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.500
it's predictable at this order of
stability but it's it's varying down

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510
stability but it's it's varying down
 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.720
stability but it's it's varying down
here from time to time and so you've got

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730
here from time to time and so you've got
 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.900
here from time to time and so you've got
stable stability there but variability

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910
stable stability there but variability
 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.160
stable stability there but variability
there and you can handle that

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170
there and you can handle that
 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.210
there and you can handle that
so you want an overarching structure of

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220
so you want an overarching structure of
 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.710
so you want an overarching structure of
stability with some internal variability

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720
stability with some internal variability
 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.259
stability with some internal variability
and maybe that's the way that you update

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269
and maybe that's the way that you update
 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.600
and maybe that's the way that you update
yourself without falling apart and then

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610
yourself without falling apart and then
 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.910
yourself without falling apart and then
I would say you can find the pathway to

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920
I would say you can find the pathway to
 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.949
I would say you can find the pathway to
the optimal rate of update by relying on

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959
the optimal rate of update by relying on
 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.170
the optimal rate of update by relying on
your sense of meaning that's what it's

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180
your sense of meaning that's what it's
 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.630
your sense of meaning that's what it's
for what it tells you is that you're

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640
for what it tells you is that you're
 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.220
for what it tells you is that you're
you're wandering your way through the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230
you're wandering your way through the
 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.119
you're wandering your way through the
world between the catastrophes of chaos

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129
world between the catastrophes of chaos
 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.160
world between the catastrophes of chaos
and the catastrophes of order and now

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170
and the catastrophes of order and now
 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.930
and the catastrophes of order and now
and then you swing into the proper

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940
and then you swing into the proper
 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.300
and then you swing into the proper
locale you're you're where you should be

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310
locale you're you're where you should be
 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.550
locale you're you're where you should be
and what happens is you get engaged by

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560
and what happens is you get engaged by
 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.140
and what happens is you get engaged by
that you get meaningfully engaged by

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150
that you get meaningfully engaged by
 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.300
that you get meaningfully engaged by
that and it's fragile it'll move on you

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310
that and it's fragile it'll move on you
 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.009
that and it's fragile it'll move on you
right because it's very difficult to

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019
right because it's very difficult to
 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.759
right because it's very difficult to
exist at that point constantly your bad

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769
exist at that point constantly your bad
 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.680
exist at that point constantly your bad
habits all sorts of things your

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690
habits all sorts of things your
 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.300
habits all sorts of things your
situation there's all sorts of things

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310
situation there's all sorts of things
 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.289
situation there's all sorts of things
that are going to interfere with that

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299
that are going to interfere with that
 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.899
that are going to interfere with that
but that doesn't mean that that isn't

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909
but that doesn't mean that that isn't
 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:40.820
but that doesn't mean that that isn't
where you should be and so then you

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830
where you should be and so then you
 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.289
where you should be and so then you
might say well that's where you should

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299
might say well that's where you should
 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.110
might say well that's where you should
strive to be all the time and then the

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120
strive to be all the time and then the
 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.670
strive to be all the time and then the
question might be well what would it be

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680
question might be well what would it be
 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.860
question might be well what would it be
like if you were there all the time and

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870
like if you were there all the time and
 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.320
like if you were there all the time and
I think that's where intimations of

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330
I think that's where intimations of
 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.550
I think that's where intimations of
paradise come from I mean when words

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560

intimations of immortality and childhood

00:03:59.179 --> 00:03:59.189
intimations of immortality and childhood
 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:00.800
intimations of immortality and childhood
people tend to romanticize their

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810
people tend to romanticize their
 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.710
people tend to romanticize their
childhood because of the sense of

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720
childhood because of the sense of
 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.509
childhood because of the sense of
intense engagement that goes along with

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519
intense engagement that goes along with
 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:06.830
intense engagement that goes along with
being a child and it's one of the

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840
being a child and it's one of the
 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.970
being a child and it's one of the
wonderful things about being around

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980
wonderful things about being around
 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.030
wonderful things about being around
children actually it's it's it's one of

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040
children actually it's it's it's one of
 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.699
children actually it's it's it's one of
they pay you for their care and the way

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709
they pay you for their care and the way
 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.830
they pay you for their care and the way
the children pay you for their care is

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840
the children pay you for their care is
 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.710
the children pay you for their care is
that they turn normal things into magic

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720
that they turn normal things into magic
 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.719
that they turn normal things into magic
again when you're around them because

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729
again when you're around them because
 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.310
again when you're around them because
you've seen it a hundred times before

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320
you've seen it a hundred times before
 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.710
you've seen it a hundred times before
and so when you see it you don't see it

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720
and so when you see it you don't see it
 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.500
and so when you see it you don't see it
you see what

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510
you see what
 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.780
you see what
you already know but when a child sees

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790
you already know but when a child sees
 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.370
you already know but when a child sees
that they don't because they don't know

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380
that they don't because they don't know
 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.530
that they don't because they don't know
they see it and then when you watch them

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540
they see it and then when you watch them
 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.840
they see it and then when you watch them
see it you see it too and so it's just

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850
see it you see it too and so it's just
 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.480
see it you see it too and so it's just
it's tremendous fun leading a small

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490
it's tremendous fun leading a small

it's tremendous fun leading a small
child around to do things that you've

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680
child around to do things that you've
 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.130
child around to do things that you've
done before because they're so you know

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140
done before because they're so you know
 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.470
done before because they're so you know
they're like this they're like all the

they're like this they're like all the
 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.850
they're like this they're like all the
time and you know maybe that's two

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860
time and you know maybe that's two
 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.200
time and you know maybe that's two
months and they cry and they get upset

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210
months and they cry and they get upset
 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.000
months and they cry and they get upset
and all of that but a good part of the

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010
and all of that but a good part of the
 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.100
and all of that but a good part of the
time it's just wild eyed Wonder and then

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110
time it's just wild eyed Wonder and then
 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.630
time it's just wild eyed Wonder and then
you can see the world through their eyes

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640
you can see the world through their eyes
 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.600
you can see the world through their eyes
and it's payment and so that's that

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610
and it's payment and so that's that
 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.550
and it's payment and so that's that
sense of being engaged like that is

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560
sense of being engaged like that is
 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.540
sense of being engaged like that is
something that people love about

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550
something that people love about
 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.060
something that people love about
children and rightly so but it's also a

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070
children and rightly so but it's also a
 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.180
children and rightly so but it's also a
marker to the proper way of being you

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190
marker to the proper way of being you
 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.720

of maturation is to return to the state

Peter Pan but to make the sacrifice is
 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.980
Peter Pan but to make the sacrifice is
necessary for maturation and then return

so well how do you do that well if you

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370
so well how do you do that well if you
 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.460
so well how do you do that well if you
do that in part by knowing what it is

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470
do that in part by knowing what it is
 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.530
do that in part by knowing what it is
that's meaningful you for you to engage

reporting to you right hemisphere and
left hemisphere balanced that the

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230
left hemisphere balanced that the
 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.350
left hemisphere balanced that the
balance between chaos and order produces

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360
balance between chaos and order produces
 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.880
balance between chaos and order produces
an output that says you are in the right

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:50.890
an output that says you are in the right
 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.310
an output that says you are in the right
place it's a perception the meaning is a

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320
place it's a perception the meaning is a
 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.530

perception of being in the right place
 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.010
perception of being in the right place
it's the genuine thing however because

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020
it's the genuine thing however because
 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.890
it's the genuine thing however because
it can be pathologized that's the thing

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900
it can be pathologized that's the thing
 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.120
it can be pathologized that's the thing
and that's why I think there's a call to

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130
and that's why I think there's a call to
 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.100
and that's why I think there's a call to

traditions if you're going to rely on
your sense of meaning to orient you you

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550
your sense of meaning to orient you you
 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.550
your sense of meaning to orient you you
have to play a straight game because

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560
have to play a straight game because
 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.220
have to play a straight game because
otherwise you warp and twist the inputs

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.230
otherwise you warp and twist the inputs
 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.260
otherwise you warp and twist the inputs
and then the mechanism won't function

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270

and then the mechanism won't function
properly you know it's like if you if

properly you know it's like if you if
 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.930
properly you know it's like if you if
you were only if you're if you've

blinded yourself to half the world you
can't use your perception story and your

can't use your perception story and your
 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.660
can't use your perception story and your
self properly because the half of the

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:27.670
self properly because the half of the
 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:28.830
self properly because the half of the
world that you're ignoring is going to

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840
world that you're ignoring is going to
 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.990
world that you're ignoring is going to
pop up at you unexpectedly and take you

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000
pop up at you unexpectedly and take you
 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.720
pop up at you unexpectedly and take you
down and so if your relationship with

down and so if your relationship with
 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.970

the world isn't pristine honest

the world isn't pristine honest
primarily then you can't rely on your

primarily then you can't rely on your
 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:39.060

orienting mechanisms and then you either

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990
orienting mechanisms and then you either
 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.990
orienting mechanisms and then you either
fall into chaos which is an absolute

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000
fall into chaos which is an absolute
 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.910
fall into chaos which is an absolute
catastrophe or you have to rely on some

catastrophe or you have to rely on some
 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.290
catastrophe or you have to rely on some
kind of external Authority and that

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300
kind of external Authority and that
 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.170
kind of external Authority and that
makes you prone to possession by

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180
makes you prone to possession by
 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.180
makes you prone to possession by
tyrannical ideologies for example which

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.190
tyrannical ideologies for example which
 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.950
tyrannical ideologies for example which
give you that sense of meaning that you
