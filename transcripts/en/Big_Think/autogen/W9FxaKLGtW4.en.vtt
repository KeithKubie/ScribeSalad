in helping us understand which patients

that is another opportunity that I think

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719
that is another opportunity that I think
 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:09.749
that is another opportunity that I think
will come to us from from human genomics

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759
will come to us from from human genomics
 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.120

so I see that as an area that is just

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130
so I see that as an area that is just
 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.190
so I see that as an area that is just
going to open up a whole host of

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200
going to open up a whole host of
 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.990
going to open up a whole host of

same not all patients develop of the
 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.010
same not all patients develop of the
same manifestations of cancer and that

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020
same manifestations of cancer and that

there are familial linkages you know

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010
there are familial linkages you know
 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.699
there are familial linkages you know
that are related to the propensity to

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709
that are related to the propensity to
 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.500
that are related to the propensity to
develop certain types of cancers versus

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510
develop certain types of cancers versus

translate into you know a situation that

translate into you know a situation that
 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.800
translate into you know a situation that
affects cancer I think there's a lot of
