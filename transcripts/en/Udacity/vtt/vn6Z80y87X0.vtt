00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's take a look again at our example.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We see that the condition in here not only handles double quotes but also single quotes.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Question is, is there a difference in how the condition handles double quotes and single quotes?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We still have this hypothesis characterizing the error.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Let's see whether it generalizes to arbitrary quotes, that is general quotes are stripped from the input,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
whether they'd be double or single.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
In order to check this hypothesis, we now use an input foo in single quote

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and we expect the output to have single quotes as well in the output as what's happening in here.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Here again we have our program.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We now need to remove these assertions in order to restore it to its original state.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And now, we're going to invoke this with foo and single quotes

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and again, we need to enclose this with quotes to make this a Python string.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
General rule of thumb, if you have single quotes in a Python string,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
we need to enclose it in double quotes.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If you have double quotes in a Python string, we need to enclose it in single quotes.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And if you have both, we need to come up with an additional multiple strings

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
enclosed in single quotes and double quotes.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So, here we go, we put in foo and single quotes into the program and now let's see what happens.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Surprise--what you see here, if you put in single quote, they are not stripped

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
whereas just to recheck, double quotes; however, are stripped from the input.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
That's and important end. Double quotes are stripped and single quotes are not.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So the output actually contains single quote which means that our hypothesis as up here

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
as up here is rejected--the single quotes are not stripped.
