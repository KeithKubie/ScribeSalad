00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.900
[LAUGH] Okay, let's pick one
more Boolean function to do.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.689
What function am I thinking of?

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:07.496
&gt;&gt; XOR is always good.

00:00:07.496 --> 00:00:08.170
&gt;&gt; Let's do XOR.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.550
So what does XOR mean?

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.100
Remind me.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.350
&gt;&gt; Okay.
XOR is exclusive or,

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.720
which means it's true if A is true or
B is true, but not if they're both true,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.350
so it has elements of both or
and and in it.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.120
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.690
&gt;&gt; And I think of XOR usually when I'm,

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.110
when I'm, like,
playing with light switches in my house.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.920
If I have a, a light that's activated
by two different light switches,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.140
it's usually an XOR function.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.470
If one is up, the light's on,
if the other one's up,

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.430
the lights on, but if they're both up,
the light goes back off.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.850
&gt;&gt; Right.
The other thing when I think of XOR is

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.230
when people say or most of the time when
people say or, when they're talking,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.280
they mean xor.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.620
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
So a lot of times when people say or

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.500
in English, they really mean xor.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.390
They say, well do you want to go to the
movies or do you want to go swimming?

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.180
Do want to eat chicken or
do you want to eat fish?

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.600
And really, they're saying either or.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.580
&gt;&gt; I see, you want one or

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.170
the other, but you can't have chicken
and fish or go swimming and the movies.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.989
&gt;&gt; No, those things are not
possible to do together.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:05.590
&gt;&gt; Got it.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.650
Okay.
&gt;&gt; All right, so how would you do XOR?

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.560
We got, we still have our-

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.522
&gt;&gt; Well, I would start with the-

00:01:10.522 --> 00:01:13.010
&gt;&gt; Or, because it's a lot like or.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.960
&gt;&gt; So, what would you want to do?

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.930
&gt;&gt; Okay, so to do XOR,
we can split on A.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.430
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.420
&gt;&gt; And there's a true branch and
a false branch.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.180
And what happened with and
and or at this point is,

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.350
there is at least one branch where
we actually knew the answer,

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.316
at this point, but
I don't think that's true here.

00:01:29.316 --> 00:01:31.850
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.060
&gt;&gt; So, so if A is true,
the output might be true or false.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.490
It depends on B.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.310
And if A is false,
the output might be False or True.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.910
It depends on B.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.960
So I-
&gt;&gt; This is exactly right.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.120
So I guess in both cases we
still have to split on B.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.850
&gt;&gt; Okay.
All right.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.810
So, now it should be relatively easy in

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.120
the sense that there's a separate
leaf for all possible inputs.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.320
And so we can just write
the XOR function on the bottom.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.270
So if A and B are both true, then the
output is false because it's exclusive.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.600
If A is true and B is false, then it
should be true, because A is true.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.650
If A is false and B is true, then it
should be true because B is true.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.090
And if A and B are both false
then it should be false.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.220
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.790
And by the way,
if you were to think about it for

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.480
a little while, it would probably
occur to you that's this tree is

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.919
just a another representation
of the full truth table.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.700
&gt;&gt; Very nice.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.032
&gt;&gt; And in fact, if we wanted to do or
again, we could say,

00:02:31.032 --> 00:02:36.403
well I was very smart last time, but
I could actually write or like this.

00:02:42.377 --> 00:02:44.570
And then just fill out
the values at the bottom.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.420
If A is true and B is true, then yes.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.790
If A is true and B is false, then yes.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.290
If A is false and B is true, then yes.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.870
If A is false and B is false, then no.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.020
And this is a perfectly legitimate a
decision tree to represent or because it

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.070
basically is just another simple
representation of the truth table,

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.650
but as we pointed out
when did last time,

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.680
it's more of a decision
tree than we actually need.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.500
&gt;&gt; I can see that.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.449
&gt;&gt; Because in particular,
we don't actually need this.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.690
All right.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.440
So this little difference here between
writing out the entire truth table on

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.930
the left, as we did for XOR, and not
having to write out the entire decision

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.690
tree on the right for o,r actually isn't
going to turn out to matter when we

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.880
try to do things either more complicated
or with more attributes that we did for

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.340
the simple and, or, and XOR.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.610
Would you like to see?

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:38.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that sounds really cool.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.380
&gt;&gt; Beautiful.
