00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.460
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.796
&gt;&gt; I first met David
Remnick 22 years ago

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.640
when he was just a wisp of a boy.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.040
I was something of a wisp
myself but I decided to call him

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.320
up when I heard that he had just
been made the Moscow correspondent

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.040
for the Washington Post.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:25.030
He had come into that
position out of nowhere.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.310
He had graduated from Princeton just
six years before and gone to work

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.090
for the Post as a night beat
police reporter, I think it was.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.650
In time he graduated to covering
the National Football League

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:42.870
for the paper.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.910
But now he was studying
Russian intently

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.030
and I being an enterprising
young editor

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.070
at a New York publishing
house decided to introduce him

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.973
to an author whose book I was about
to publish, the very talented,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.626
irrepressibly decedent,
devastatingly acute master

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.380
of Soviet Satire, Vladimir
Voinovich.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.006
I invited David to lunch.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.910
We met at-- I think
it was Galileo's.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.270
Voinovich who barely spoke
English took to David immediately.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.790
It was a chemical thing.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.676
David who didn't know much Russian
at the time returned the compliment.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.276
They liked each other.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.543
They later became friends.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.326
It was clear that this nascent
foreign correspondent was a bright

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.836
and curious young man, a
reporter who watched and listened.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.073
And even at that early point of his
career, it was clear he was a person

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.416
who could look past current events

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.400
to the deeper human
issues that drive them.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.606
It's been a pleasure to
watch David ever since.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.513
Obviously he mastered Russian
so expertly that he went

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:57.370
on to cover the historic events
of the crumbling Soviet Union

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.623
with great sensitivity and insight.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.080
When communism collapsed
and glasnost

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.693
and perestroika surprised us,

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.770
David Remnick was among the
few who could explain them.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.206
Eventually he wrote a very
good book called Lenin's Tomb

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.646
which won the 1994 Pulitzer
Prize for non fiction.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.836
He was only 36 years old.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.500
He had joined the New
Yorker by then.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.846
For a while he was a staff writer.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.596
Within six years he succeeded Tina
Brown as the editor of the magazine.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.570
In the interim, he has been
credited with increasing circulation

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.690
by 23 percent to more than a
million readers, and he is loved

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110
by his writers and editors and
the marketers on his staff,

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.890
all of whom feel he lives
only to please them.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.613
Writer, editor and publisher,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.780
David has written six
books and edited four more.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.246
How he does it is a mystery.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:02.310
Although Malcolm Gladwell,
a New Yorker staff writer

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.523
and a fellow book writer once said,

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.430
"He likes to pretend
that it's no sweat.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:11.126
He cruises around and chats
with people and then disappears

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.306
and writes thousands
of words in 15 minutes.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.120
It's all a part of that
make it look easy thing."

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:22.430
When asked how he could
possibly write a revealing book

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.590
about President Barack
Obama and still run one

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.450
of the most successful magazines
in the country, his wife,

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.176
a writer with the New
York Times said,

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.766
"He got up really early went back
to work after dinner with the kids

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.173
and took no weekends off and no
vacations for more than a year.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.960
The result has been a fascinating
book that describes our president

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.866
as a man for all seasons, a
flexible mutable chameleon."

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.406
As the Post's reviewer
for book world,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.840
Gwen Ifill of PBS described it,
"Remnick efficiently strips some

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.693
of the gloss off the
version Obama offered

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.600
in his best selling 1995 memoir
Dreams from my Father charitably

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.846
and accurately describing
that effort as a mixture

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.633
of verifiable fact,
recollection, recreation,

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.060
invention and artful shaping."

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.653
Here to talk about that book
and to illumine his theories

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.140
and observations about our man

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.206
in the White House is
the author of The Bridge.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.546
Please welcome one of our most
dynamic American journalists

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.600
David Remnick.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000


00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.100
[ Applause ]

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.283
&gt;&gt; I need to offer
two corrections as--

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.206
I guess if you're an editor you
edit everything I just I'm extremely

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.730
pleased by and flattered
by that introduction.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.110
Let me offer two corrections one,

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.516
I did not cover the
National Football League

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.916
that would have been the Redskins.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.783
That was way too exalted for me.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.450
I covered the United
States Football League

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.256
and the team was the
Washington Federals.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.066
A league that you now sadly forget

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.850
and the team went I
think two and fourteen.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.923
And it rained every Sunday and
that was-- that was my other thing.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.150
The other thing is the notion
of the no sweat business.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.460
I think we can all agree safely
that this is the Schmitz capital

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.503
of the world [laughter] and let's
give ourselves a little applause

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.030
for enduring it so [applause].

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.136
And I want to thank all the
organizers of this festival.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.396
I think you can't really imagine--

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.143
I think we can vaguely imagine why
readers would want to come here

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.273
and listen to Stacy Schiff or
Jon Franzen or Will Haygood

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.373
or whoever they happen to see in
the last hours with great enjoyment.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.210
But you have to know
what it does for writers,

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.386
to see people that actually read,
read you, have things to say

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.960
about these books-- critical
things to say about these books,

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.773
complimentary things
about these books.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.283
Reading is an extraordinary
activity done in quiet and solitude

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.086
as Jon Franzen has
said recently you--

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.986
reading is the one thing you
can't do seriously and multitask.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:26.036
Occasions like this
though, well not reading

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:27.360
and maybe secondary activities are
really important to writers once

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.540
in a while to get out of the
house and meet their readers.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.633
It does a lot for us, I know.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.500
So I thank you for that.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.403
I wanted-- I have just a few minutes
that I want to talk about this book

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.596
and maybe provoke a short
discussion with you and see

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.370
if I can manage to do that.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:47.333
I just-- I should say a little bit
about the origins of this book,

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.156
question that I get very often has
Barack Obama wrote an autobiography?

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:59.590
Yes I know that, and even an awfully
good autobiography and a second book

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.243
as well that has some
virtues and also some--

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.216
I think it was utility book.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.736
But the first book is
actually good book.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:07.850
It tells a lot about of his life.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:09.656
Why would you bother
writing a biography?

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.910
Well first of all,
autobiographies, memoirs are stories

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.713
that you tell about yourself.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:19.630
It has the point of view of
your-- your own point of view.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.963
You leave in and take
out what you want to do

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.600
and you would no more consider a
book on Ben Franklin authoritative

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:29.716
if it was called the
autobiography of Ben Franklin

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:32.423
as you would imagine it if it were
written by the man in the moon.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.810
Ben Franklin is a book
that requires all kinds

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.906
of biographical scholarship and
pressure from brands and shift

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:43.873
and all the many people
who have concentrated

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.866
on it from different angles.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.200
And an emerging political figure
like Barack Obama who makes use

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.336
of his own life, the
story o f his own life,

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.910
and makes it into a
political utility even,

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.756
bears biographical scholarly

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.920
and journalistic pressure
that is not his own.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.116
So the idea to do that
book is not something

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.226
that really required
a lot of thought.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.220
But I didn't know how much
room there was for maneuver.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.300
As an editor and as a friend
of John Updike's I went

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.603
to his funeral a couple
of winters ago.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.253
And on the way back from
the Massachusetts shore

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.500
where this funeral took
place, a very small service.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:29.846
I stopped in at Harvard Law School

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.013
and spent a few days interviewing
law professors and colleagues

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.213
of Obama's just to see
what there was to know

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:40.973
after all the campaign had been
going on for quite a long time.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:43.700
Many, many stories
had been written some

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:45.366
by some very talented journalists.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.966
What was left over, and that
little experiment proved to me

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.766
that there was a story to tell,
a story that hadn't been told,

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.500
a story that required some depth.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.430
Barack-- one of the
chapters in The Bridge,

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.720
the book obviously is a biography
and set against the background

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:11.763
and context of the racial drama of
the nation's politics and it takes

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:19.416
in quite a lot everything from
Harold Washington and the politics

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.346
of Chicago, the politics
of Harvard Law School,

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.373
the history of African-Americans
running for the presidency,

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.300
many different kind of subplots
in the course of the book.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.633
But I also spent a chapter looking
at Obama's own autobiography

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.060
as a specimen of probably
the richest genre

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:48.090
of African-American writing and
that is African-American memoir.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:52.713
In other words, I wanted to see
how this book which was written

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:53.666
in relative innocence, in other
words, before he became a candidate.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:57.913
Before that time when
politicians write nonsense books

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.913
about themselves and bland books
about their political policies

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:08.073
and biographies that try to
appeal to everybody all at once.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.746
&gt;&gt; This is a book written in
relative innocence and also

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.450
out of a sense of literary ambition.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.400
The origins of his
autobiography come

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:24.116
when a literary agent notices
an article on the press

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.960
that this guy has become the
first African-American president

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.073
of the Harvard Law Review.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.340
She asked him to write a book.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.006
He doesn't know what
he's going to write.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.806
He thinks about writing a
book about Civil Rights Law

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:35.993
and he happens upon his
own story and writes it.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:37.910
Just like Michelle Laurice or any
number of other African-Americans

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:44.063
who ventured into this genre.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:45.190
And I tried to look at
this book structurally,

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.496
what it sets out to do,
taking note of the fact

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:51.063
that there are three parts
to it, each of them ends

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:55.976
with the author in tears.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.870
And it's structured apolitically.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:00.780
It's in a political context but
it is not a candidate's book.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:04.533
It does not take into account
Obama's life in politics

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.080
as he enters the world
of Chicago politics.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:15.363
So, that was how I set
out writing this book.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:20.216
I had no interest in trying to
play a catch up game of writing

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.870
about the Obama presidency.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:23.236
The book ends at the
White House door.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:29.636
And it examines him in all regards
prior not only to the election

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:33.543
but even the campaign itself gets
fairly short tripped compared

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:36.193
to these episodes in
Obama's youth and childhood

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.066
in his parent's development.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.733
I just want to say one thing about
African-American autobiography,

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:46.836
something that it has very-- in
a very generalized way, in common

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:52.790
and in common with Obama's own book.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:58.220
If you look at African-American
autobiography, a genre,

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:03.096
that begins with 6000 slave
narratives, I mean the most famous

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:05.706
of which is Frederick Douglas but
there are thousands of other ones,

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.066
a genre that goes straight
through to the great books

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.813
of the 20th Century, we know whether
it's Richard Wright or Malcolm X

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:20.383
or Maya Angelou, so many of them,
they have certain things in common,

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:27.580
a struggle for freedom, a journey
from either incarceration or slavery

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:29.383
or oppression or stifling
depending on the period of time

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:36.710
and historical circumstances,
a journey that tends to be part

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:41.216
of this and a search for
community, a search for a self,

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:43.850
a search for a politics,

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:45.426
and a search for geography
and a sense of purpose.

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.873
All these things are present
in Obama's autobiography.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:56.043
The book of which-- some reviewers
have used the euphemism exhaustive

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.526
to describe this book.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.813
What they mean is it
is 600 pages long.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.313
And maybe occasionally
they got exhausted.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.610
But what the goal of the book is to
separate the wheat from the chaff,

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:12.616
the myth from-- realities
from myths, the nonsense

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:17.303
and the conspiracy theories
from the facts of the matter.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.960
It's an active journalism and
a journalism that took place

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:26.726
and I hope to get it out while Obama
was still in office, believe it

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:27.433
or not, not for commercial reasons
but as part of the project itself,

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:31.506
part of knowing a president
and a president's life

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.333
as best one can while
he was in office.

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.860
And here we are a year and a half

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:42.286
into the presidency
and what has sunk in?

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.946
Over 20 percent of the
American public believes

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:55.463
that Barack Obama is a Muslim as if
there were anything wrong with that,

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:56.003
but believes that he's a Muslim.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:01.403
We still-- any audience that
I go to were very often--

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.123
I'm still asked about birth
certificates, was he really born

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.983
in Hawaii, in other words the
very fact of his existence,

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:10.190
his national existence is brought

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:15.383
under serious question
despite all the necessary

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.520
and requisite proof otherwise.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.546
Haley Barbour, who distinguished
himself actually during Katrina one

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.366
of very few politicians who
did was interviewed recently

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:28.350
and it's maybe not by
mistake that he's mentioned

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:30.620
as a possible presidential
candidate in a couple of years.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:36.400
He said that Barack Obama was
somehow, remains mysterious,

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.053
that we don't know very
much about Barack Obama.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.383
Rush Limbaugh plays this
violin all the time,

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:43.783
Glenn Beck I need not
tell you plays this violin

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:48.650
and recently Dinesh D'Souza,
conservative intellectual,

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:49.270
you probably know has
come out with an article

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:55.883
in Fortune Magazine prefatory to
a book that's coming and proposes

00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:00.986
that Barack Obama sees the world
through a post colonial canon point

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.773
of view and this is a view
endorsed by as brilliant by

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:11.503
yet another possibility for
the presidency Newt Gingrich.

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.630
And I think it is too polite
to distinguish these theories

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:21.740
and these points of
view with anything more

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.146
than a most harsh answer.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:25.810
The fact of the matter
is Obama's born--

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:32.016
Barack Obama's life hides in
plain sight as does his ideology,

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.530
he is the man of the center left.

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.563
He is somebody born
where he says he is born,

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:38.626
very much had the life
he says he has.

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:44.446
Does he know people that
were way to the left of him?

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:45.516
Yes. Does he know people and learn
from people way to the right of him?

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:50.230
In law school he studied both with
Charles Fried and Roberto Unger.

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:56.403
That didn't make him
a Brazilian socialist

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.573
and that didn't make him
a right wing republican

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.673
in the mold of Charles Fried.

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:03.240
He is somebody that read
the books of Richard Posner

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.506
and was a research assistant

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.810
for a great liberal
constitutional scholar.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.270
This doesn't make him them.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.936
His associations do
not make him them.

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:20.070
And yet for political
reasons certain intellectuals,

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:25.443
certain politicians,
certain media outlets

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.106
and myriad websites
continue to play this tune.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:30.793
I referred earlier and I'll
make this a concluding point,

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:37.293
I referred earlier to the genre
of African-American autobiography.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.933
One of the distinguishing
features of slave narratives is

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:45.723
that slaves wrote to
prove their literacy,

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.900
their personhood, their
independence.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.133
And yet they had to have
very often the books endorsed

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:55.843
by white abolitionists.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.453
If you look at the title page

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.920
of Frederick Douglas'
autobiography it has a gesture

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:04.276
from William Lloyd Garrison saying
this book was actually written

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:09.943
by believe it or not
by Frederick Douglas.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:14.436
That's where we were
in the 19th Century.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:20.583
And yet on the internet, on Rush
Limbaugh and elsewhere there cropped

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:22.203
up the theory that Barack
Obama wasn't even capable

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:27.476
of writing the book that he wrote.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.493
We heard theories that Barack
Obama was not the author

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.186
of his own biography
but who was its author?

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.986
Wait for it-- Bill Ayers.

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:36.313
Well if this was just one
isolated website it wouldn't worth

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.076
distinguishing in an audience like
this but that is where we are,

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.083
and Barack Obama's life is still
in play as a political weapon.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:48.140
I'll stop there and why
don't we have some questions

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.840
from the audience.

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.140
[ Applause ]

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:56.690
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:17:58.690 --> 00:17:59.690


00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:03.180
Sure.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.180
&gt;&gt; Hi, thanks.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.246
Is this working?

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:09.246
Is this working?

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:11.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:13.553
&gt;&gt; Okay, I mean the scurrilous
smears that you've alluded

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:14.830
to here are shocking,
they're repelling,

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:18.916
they're disgusting its' a shame

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:19.290
that this is taking place
at the present time.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:21.783
However, it's not utterly unique

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:23.946
in American history
or American politics.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.020
&gt;&gt; No.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:28.830
&gt;&gt; Look at the election of
1800, the 1850's, 1930's,

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:34.410
you could pick almost any
decade and find if not identical

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:39.370
at least somewhat comparable
scurrilousness

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:41.896
in alleged political discourse.

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:43.590
So--

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:46.656
&gt;&gt; But what distinguishes it is

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.860
that he's an African-American
in the White House.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:53.816
This makes everything a
little bit more electrifying.

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:57.023
This makes everything a
little bit more pointed.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:57.710
So, when we hear rhetoric like
we want to take our country back,

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.733
when we hear rhetoric directed
at Obama and his otherness

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:09.286
and the mystery of his background
and the very purposeful fudging

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:14.270
at best of the facts of the matter,
it takes on an outsized importance

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:16.916
and an outsized danger I'd say.

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:19.850
Yes?

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:22.833
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to ask you, did
you get any input or any comments

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:23.946
from President Obama
himself from this book?

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:25.653
&gt;&gt; Yeah I interviewed Barack Obama.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.786
Both before he was president and
in the White House but I should say

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:33.250
that was great, that was nice, it
certainly didn't hurt but that's not

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:37.896
where the good stuff comes from as
a biographer and as a journalist.

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:44.776
The good stuff comes from spending
a couple of days with somebody

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.746
who spent a couple of years
going to McDonalds and being

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.366
in endless boring meetings and being
a community organizer with him.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.193
That's where the good
stuff tends to come.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:59.526
For example, you know at this
time, at this point an interview

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:03.550
with Obama is very slowed
down, purposeful, deliberate,

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.186
the goal of which is to
be somewhat informative

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:08.963
but also to make no false steps.

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:12.450
And there are-- for obvious
political reasons for that.

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:14.050
I don't blame him.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:15.700
Yup.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000


00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:19.503
&gt;&gt; Hi, the August 30th issue of the
New Yorker contains a puzzling piece

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:19.460
of commentary that I was hoping
you could help me understand.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.193
A man looks up at judge
who will decide his case

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.873
and the judge says small
potatoes is no defense.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.993
Could you explain this to me?

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:31.126
&gt;&gt; I can't hear.

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:32.460
&gt;&gt; It was the-- a cartoon in where--

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.393
&gt;&gt; Oh I don't want to get
into cartoon explanation.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.060
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:39.233
&gt;&gt; You know at the end of the
year we have a cartoon section

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:41.650
in the special cartoon issue
that comes out in November

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.656
and it's called I Don't Get It.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:48.310
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:50.310
[ Laughter ]

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:53.243
&gt;&gt; And we ourselves publish
cartoons a second time realizing

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:54.986
that maybe they didn't get it
in the first place and I want

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.326
to take full responsibility for
that because I'm the judge and jury.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:20:59.653
Look it is true I was
a foreign correspondent

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:01.826
in Moscow, I'm very proud of that.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.893
I'm also the judge and jury
on New Yorker cartoons.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:08.873
So I bear full responsibility

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:09.556
and whatever jail term
comes with that [laughter].

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:13.290


00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.680
Yes, sir.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.530
&gt;&gt; I'm really curious about this
Dinesh D'Souza piece that's gotten

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:20.963
so much attention and
what you make of it.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:21.996
And first of all of the irony that
this is someone who is developing

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:28.323
to give the intellectual
clause of or imprimatur

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:28.340
to these other scurrilous arguments,

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:35.053
an argument about post colonialism
when, you know, he is too a son

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:35.923
of immigrant parents from India.

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:38.530
&gt;&gt; This whole country
is post colonial--

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:40.996
&gt;&gt; Yeah and the whole
country is post colonial,

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:43.596
this is exactly my point.

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:44.400
&gt;&gt; Look I can't answer for
Dinesh D'Souza and I want

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:47.193
to read the full book but I, this--

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.393
&gt;&gt; What I'm asking is--

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.356
&gt;&gt; This notion that somehow Obama
inherited his father's ideology

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.740
could not be farther from the truth.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:56.070
Obama if anything, Obama's father
was a counter example for him.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:00.970
&gt;&gt; Uh hmm.

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:02.170
&gt;&gt; A counter example in the sense

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:04.033
that Obama's father was a highly
intelligent man but dissolute,

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.973
lacking discipline, in
fact blew his life up.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:16.140
A really difficult man at
best, violent at worst,

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:19.556
really not anything resembling
what you and I would call

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:23.810
as they say a "family man".

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:25.216
And ideologically if you're gonna
call somebody that's surrounded

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:30.536
by Larry Summers and Tim
Geitner and Christina Romer,

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.820
et cetera a post colonial socialist,

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:35.130
then you haven't studied
hard enough.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:37.730
Let's move on.

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:40.263
&gt;&gt; Well then why doesn't
someone call him out on that?

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:41.930
&gt;&gt; Okay thank you.

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:43.530
&gt;&gt; Yes, I was born and
raised in the South.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.463
I graduated from college as
classmate with Newt Gingrich.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:49.996
I've also lived in Hawaii
in a multiracial society

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:54.783
and I've often wondered if Obama who
grew up in this multiracial society

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:59.500
in Hawaii, had international
exposure can he possibly understand

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.720
the vitriol of southern
white anger toward him

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:08.243
as I can having come
from that culture.

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:10.610
&gt;&gt; You know I'm not a novelist
and when I say I'm not--

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:15.743
what I mean by that is a novelist
because here she is making it

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:19.143
up can go as deep as that
imagination can reach.

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:24.743
I think no biographer or journalist
can pretend to reach that deeply.

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:26.930
Certainly Obama has read widely in
the history of race, in the history

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:33.630
of civil rights, he knows
these things from a distance,

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.043
he is also a black man in America
and has felt the sting of prejudice

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:42.623
as well as any black man or
woman has sooner or later,

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.993
no one escapes uninjured
in some way or another.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:46.680
But if you read his own book and
my own reporting reflects this,

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.390
growing up in Hawaii in a so
called multicultural Hawaii even

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:58.543
at this very elite prep school
that he went to was no picnic, why?

00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.466
Because there is a very
prideful multiculturalism except

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.853
for one thing there are
hardly any black people there.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.480
Most of the African-Americans
in Oahu are on a military base.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:08.813
And if you read his book and my own
reporting bore this out and I talked

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:12.970
to all his black classmates
he felt the sting of prejudice

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:17.336
as a young guy very acutely.

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:22.100
Was it like being a black kid in
1954 in Philadelphia, Mississippi?

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:25.703
No, but it had its
own particularities.

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.100
Yes sir?

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:30.233
&gt;&gt; Yeah I have just a question of--

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.233
&gt;&gt; Well I think we don't have much
time so if-- quickly as we can.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.566
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah sure really quickly,
so I've tried to explain

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:37.360
for myself what I see is the
president is naive taint dealing

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.176
with the republicans and his
unwillingness to talk in terms

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:42.810
like Franklin Roosevelt
talked during the depression

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:48.396
and really characterizing as FDR did
very clearly the deceptions, the--

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:53.640
and building up very exquisitely
his own rejections of the right

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:56.730
and how the right was
criticizing his reaction and--

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:59.113
&gt;&gt; But the president can't do
everything no matter how exalted the

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:00.326
rhetoric and it is curious that
Obama's rhetorical capacity

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:04.666
as president have not been always
on the level of it as a campaigner

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:11.440
but as poetry prose dichotomy
there that you know well.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.410
In fact, this administration
took off

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:15.673
on a little mini attack
on Fox News for example.

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:20.926
It petered out very, very quickly.

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:25.966
There is this kind of division
of people talking to themselves

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:28.536
and riling each other up.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.706
I would argue that it's more
intense and more pernicious

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:34.990
on one side than the other.

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:40.100
It's too polite to me to say that
it's all evenhanded, it's not.

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:40.996
And it's very, very powerful thing

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:43.346
and it's not easily
defeated or overcome.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:45.233
&gt;&gt; I guess my question is more--

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:47.633
&gt;&gt; Wait this will be
the last question.

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.100
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.700
&gt;&gt; You've been a daily
journalist and you've gone along

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:54.693
for magazine journalism and
later a book and the research

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.040
and the writing behind
all those forms is--

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:57.900
could be quite different
although some similarities.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:00.023
I was wondering about
the process that you go

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:03.583
through with your writers
in the editing process

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:06.400
and how you recommend that
they do their research

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.446
and writing for the New Yorker.

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:10.206
It has a bit influence
by your daily--

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:12.540
&gt;&gt; But I want to make
one thing very clear.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:14.740
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.740
&gt;&gt; I'm the editor of the magazine
but I'm not the only editor

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:17.963
at the magazine and there are
extraordinary editors, Henry Finder,

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:22.550
Dorothy Wickenden and Daniel
Zalewski, people that you may

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:29.683
and more who you may not know or you
may, who are extraordinarily gifted

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:31.913
in doing what editors
do and what do they do?

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:38.026
They try to help a writer find
a way to maximize what it is

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.273
and make better what it is
that the writer set out to do.

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:47.486
Not what the editor is imposing but
try to get inside a piece enough

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:48.476
and it happens through a long
relationship with the writer,

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:56.236
to make that thing better, to find--
to help in whether it's structural

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:02.986
or intellectual or word by word
to make as beautiful and as clear

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.893
and as forceful a piece
of writing can be.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.486
So, and all people do it in
different ways and it has to do

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:14.180
with an extension of
their personalities

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:16.313
and the intellect they
bring to the table.

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:17.586
So, there is no one way of doing
this, just as there's no one way

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.640
of being a baseball manager
or a teacher or any one thing.

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.123
Listen, thank you all for coming

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:31.323
out here I know it's
extraordinarily hot [applause]

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:39.150


00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:51.590
and it does us all a lot of good.

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:54.830
Thank you.

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:57.330
[ Applause ]

00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.680
