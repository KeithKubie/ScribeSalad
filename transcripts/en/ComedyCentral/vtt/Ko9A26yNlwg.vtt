-Yes, the last show. -Oh, my

00:00:58.624 --> 00:01:00.693

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:04.530

Does revenge no know bounds?

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:07.200
-No, it knows no bounds, Jon.
-It knows no bounds.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.936
-No bounds. -Uh, I-I just-I just
decided to stop by...

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:12.138

-Sure. You... No, you may.

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:22.548
-Take the moment.
-Thank you. Uh...

00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:24.383
Jon Stewart, everyone.

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:26.185
-(cheering, applause)
-No, I just want to say...

00:01:26.218 --> 00:01:28.721
-No, very quickly...
-Mm-hmm? Yeah.

00:01:28.754 --> 00:01:32.024
Uh, I have been
in situations in, uh,

00:01:32.057 --> 00:01:34.127
what we call show business,
television, where they have,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.062
-uh, my name has been
on the show. -Yes.

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:37.763
And they've, uh,
what-what do you call their...

00:01:37.796 --> 00:01:39.365
-locked the door...
-Yes.

00:01:39.398 --> 00:01:41.868
and-and told me to, uh...

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:43.436
uh, this was
a Paramount executive:

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.805
"Get your (bleep) and get out."

00:01:45.838 --> 00:01:48.741
-Right. -And, uh,
a very wise man said to me...

00:01:48.774 --> 00:01:50.476
-Mm-hmm. -uh,

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.447
do not confuse
cancellation with failure.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.683
-And I took that to heart.
-(cheering, applause)

00:01:57.716 --> 00:01:59.452
Yeah.

00:01:59.485 --> 00:02:02.288
So, I will say this:

00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:05.525
what you, my friend,
were tasked to do,

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:08.828
you have done,
and done beautifully.

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:10.797
-You, uh...
-(cheering, applause)

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.569
You gave voice... you gave voice

00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:18.704
to-to underserved voices

00:02:18.737 --> 00:02:20.506
in the media arena,

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:23.509
and you did it...
It was a show that was raw

00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:26.445
and poignant and funny and smart

00:02:26.478 --> 00:02:29.048
-and all of those things. -Thank
you. -(cheering, applause)

00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:32.251
And... you did it from scratch.

00:02:32.284 --> 00:02:34.820
And what-what you
and Rory and Robin

00:02:34.853 --> 00:02:36.489
and your
tremendous collaborators

00:02:36.522 --> 00:02:39.125
and Dre in the booth and...

00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:41.460
You took something
and got better

00:02:41.493 --> 00:02:44.230
-every (bleep) day.
-Oh, man.

00:02:44.263 --> 00:02:46.566
-(cheering) -That's so nice.
Thanks, Jon. -Every one.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:47.900
Thank you.

00:02:47.933 --> 00:02:51.237
And I think that, uh...

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.973
Uh, we talked about
a little thing called...

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:56.509
uh, I guess the word
s-some would use is "resonance."

00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:59.712
Did you resonate
with-with an audience?

00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:02.648
I would say not-not only that

00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:04.250
but in an important way,
but in a way

00:03:04.283 --> 00:03:06.986
that you don't even realize yet
and won't reveal itself

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.323
-for years to come,
and it's this: -Mm-hmm.

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:12.525
you started a conversation

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:15.528
that was not on television
when you began.

00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:17.730
And you worked with a group
of people

00:03:17.763 --> 00:03:20.333
who you invited
to that conversation

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:23.536
to collaborate with you,
to sharpen that conversation.

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.539
And what you don't realize is,
you walk out of this room

00:03:26.572 --> 00:03:28.474
and that conversation
doesn't end.

00:03:28.507 --> 00:03:31.077
And all the people
that you work with

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.079
are gonna take
what they learned here

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:35.147
and what they learned from you

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.984
and the beautiful experience
that they had,

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:41.320
and you're gonna start
to see them doing things

00:03:41.353 --> 00:03:43.256
in the business as well

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:45.591
and taking that
and taking other experiences

00:03:45.624 --> 00:03:47.927
and you're gonna watch that
flourish.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.396
And that's gonna have you on it.

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:52.932
-Well, thank you so much, Jon.
That's very kind. -And your DNA.

00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:55.768
And-and that's
a beautiful thing.

00:03:55.801 --> 00:03:59.372
And so, in closing,

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:02.041
-Yes.
-I want to say to you this:

00:04:02.074 --> 00:04:04.043
you did it, my...

00:04:04.076 --> 00:04:06.178
-Jon. No, no.
-Wait. My...

00:04:06.211 --> 00:04:08.314
-No, Jon. No, you can't say...
-You did it, my...

00:04:08.347 --> 00:04:11.050
-No, you can't... you can't say
the... -my-my<i> mishpocha.</i>

00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:12.985
-What?
-Yeah. That's nice.

00:04:13.018 --> 00:04:15.054
That works. That works.

00:04:15.087 --> 00:04:17.189
-I love you, man. -Jon Stewart!
Thank you. I love you, too.

00:04:17.222 --> 00:04:18.591
-You did a great job.
-Thank you so much.

00:04:18.624 --> 00:04:20.059
-Really great job.
-Thank you.

00:04:20.092 --> 00:04:22.995
-Thank you so much, Jon.
-Great. Thank you.

00:04:23.028 --> 00:04:26.028
-Oh, man. -Thank you.
-(cheering and applause)
