00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.240
I now want to turn my attention
from all of the

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.310
craziness that's happening in
Europe and go halfway around

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.260
the world to one of France's
colonies in the Caribbean, and

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.980
that's Saint-Domingue.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.420
And I know I'm butchering all
of the pronunciations.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.150
But Saint-Domingue, and its
modern name is Haiti, is the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.360
western half of the island of
Hispaniola, which was the

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.720
island that Columbus first
stumbled upon when he

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.420
discovered the New World.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.550
The eastern half of the island,
that you don't see

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.390
here-- I've zoomed in
on the western half.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.130
The eastern half is now called
the Dominican Republic.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.400
At that time it was called Santo
Domingo and it was in

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.140
the control of Spain.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.060
Let me write that down.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.960
So Spain is here.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.050
You probably don't see
my yellow that well.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.810
And then on this side, France
has colonized-- let me write

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:52.990
Spain bolder.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.050
There you go.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.110
Spain had colonized the eastern
half of the island,

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.200
France had colonized
the western half.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.680
And just to get us up to speed
on the history, in 1492,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.650
Columbus showed up and it
was a Spanish colony.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.380
And I'm talking about just
the western side.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.850
The eastern side continued
to be a Spanish colony.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.460
But in 1697, it was officially
given over to the French, but

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.250
it was a Spanish colony
until then.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.120
And then 1697 until the period
that we're talking about right

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.540
now, which is the late 1700s,
the period of the French

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.150
Revolution, it was
a French colony.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.490
It's a French colony.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.760
Now you're probably saying, Sal,
all of this craziness is

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.790
happening in France.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.540
Kings are getting toppled,
people are getting

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.520
guillotined.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.400
There's wars with all
of the empires.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.530
Why are you going all the way to
this side of the world and

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.680
focusing on this small
little island?

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.350
Well, the big answer, or I
guess the main answer,

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.060
especially from the perspective
of the French--

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.840
there's other historical
reasons why

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.340
this, I think, is relevant.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.180
But the major reason is that
Saint-Domingue at this time

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.390
was the most-- let me write
that in-- profitable slave

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.987
colony in the world.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.890
Now these colonialists, they
cared about profit pretty much

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.780
all the time.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.320
To a large degree, at this point
in history, that's all

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.870
they cared about.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.900
But you have to think
about it.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.470
Remember, what precipitated
the French Revolution-- or

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.610
what I think was a major
factor-- was

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.860
that France was broke.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.770
So you have this little
island here.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.820
It's a slave colony.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.710
Their plantations produce tons
of sugarcane, hugely

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.850
profitable business.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.680
Anything that goes on in
Saint-Domingue will matter to

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.170
France because France
is broke.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.480
And not only are they broke,
but they have all of these

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.170
wars with pretty much
everybody in Europe.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.810
So let's go back and remind
ourselves what was actually

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.200
happening in France
at the time.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.480
We'll actually go
back to France.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.170
So 1789, you had your
Convocation of the

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.910
Estates-General.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.855
The Third Estate, they were a
little peeved, so they met at

00:03:10.855 --> 00:03:12.700
the tennis court, they declared
themselves the

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.740
National Assembly, they had
the Tennis Court Oath.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.890
Actually, they declared
themselves the National

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.980
Assembly, then they were
kicked out of the room.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.770
And then they had to do the
Tennis Court Oath, where they

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.640
promised that they would
create a constitution.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.110
And they started talking about
liberty and fraternity and

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.740
brotherhood and all men are
created equal, all of these

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.510
great ideas of the
Enlightenment.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.720
And while all that was
happening, you had this

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.280
businessman, Vincent Oge.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.150
I don't know if I'm pronouncing
it right.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.350
He was a wealthy, mixed-race--
so let me write that down.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:01.970
He was a mixed-race and he was
1/4 African descent and he was

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.520
3/4 European, or
French descent.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.080
And he was in Paris
on business.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.870
And while he was there, the
French Revolution and this

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.620
Convocation of the
Estates-General started

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.250
happening, and he said,
gee, you know what?

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.430
I'm a wealthy, educated guy.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.550
I own land in what is now Haiti,
but in Saint-Domingue

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.010
at the time.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.190
He actually owned slaves.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.910
I want to be very clear
about this.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.070
He owned slaves as well.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.730
And he's like, I am just as good
as all of these, I guess

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.320
you could say, purely European
guys all around me, but I

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.990
don't get equal rights now.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.830
But all of this great stuff is
happening, with talks of a new

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.840
constitution.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.080
Let me get in on this.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.800
And so he started lobbying with
several other, I guess

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.430
you could say, forward-thinking
individuals.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.545
He started lobbying
for equal rights.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.610
He lobbied for equal rights, the
rights to vote and not to

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.350
be treated like a second-class
citizen.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.830
Now at first, they were
kind of ignored.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.520
The National Assembly, they
wanted to do good things, but

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.160
they didn't want to do something
so extreme as

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.410
considering this wealthy,
educated, probably well-spoken

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.410
individual an equal, so they
were rebuffed a bit.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:34.960
But eventually, in March of
1790, the National Assembly

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:45.090
passed an amendment that had the
wording, all proprietors

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:51.520
ought to be-- and there's some
other stuff in between--

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.230
active citizens.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:01.050
Well, Mr. Vincent Oge and his
collaborators say, hey, this

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.740
is our victory.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.640
This is the wording that tells
us, look, anyone who is a

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.680
proprieter-- I own land, I'm a
proprieter-- it says we ought

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.910
to be active citizens.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.250
This gives us the
right to vote.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.660
So he declared that a victory
for his rights, or people like

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.370
his rights.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.470
And so he goes back to
Saint-Domingue and tells the

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.210
governor, look, all of this
craziness has been happening

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.160
in France, we have a National
Assembly, and they've

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.490
essentially given me
the right to vote.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:42.210
Unfortunately, the governor of
Saint-Domingue ignores him, or

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.310
essentially doesn't listen to
him-- ignores what he has to

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.360
say, and says, I don't care
what's going on in France.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.360
I'm not going to give you
and people like you

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.400
the right to vote.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.880
So this obviously did not make
him a happy individual.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.900
He seems like he has everything
going in his favor.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.500
Even the national assembly
seems to be going in his

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.100
favor, but the governor
ignores him.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:12.790
So he starts a revolt
when he returns, and

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.900
he's essentially rebuffed.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:21.510
He returned in October of 1790,
ignored by the governor,

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:22.950
so he starts a revolt.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.080
Unfortunately, his revolt
wasn't successful.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:25.970
And I want to be very clear.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.230
When he revolted, he wasn't
revolting to abolish slavery,

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.900
he wasn't revolting to give all
black men on the island

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:34.750
the right to vote.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:40.930
He was revolting to give freemen
of color who owned

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.380
land the right to vote, and that
was probably his mistake

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.630
in the revolt.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:49.270
I want to give you a little
sense of the demographics of

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.430
Saint-Domingue at that time.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:58.020
There were 500,000 slaves of
African descent, you had

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:10.110
40,000 white colonialists, and
you had 28,000 mixed-race,

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:13.720
freemen of color, or however
you want to describe them.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.710
If you're starting revolt to
defend only your rights,

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.140
you're going to get some subset
of this 28,000 against

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.660
a very well-armed,
in power, 40,000.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.180
Now, if he had thought maybe I
should speak in a little bit

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.070
broader terms-- he was
essentially trying to become a

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:36.010
part of this club, but if he had
spoken in slightly broader

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.460
terms, maybe he could have
tapped into some of the angst

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.850
of that 500,000.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:44.470
But he didn't, and so his revolt
was unsuccessful and he

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:45.550
was captured.

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:58.590
And then in February 1791,
he was executed.

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.400
So it seems like all
was for naught.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.850
He went through all this trouble
to get some freedom.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.980
He was ignored, tried
a revolt, his revolt

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.220
wasn't done that well.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:13.910
He was executed, but it started
to simmer within the

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:19.490
consciousness of the people of
African descent at that time.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:23.940
And whether or not his revolt
directly lead to what is going

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.590
to happen over the next few
years is unclear, but it did

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:30.880
happen and at least he was the
first one that really did try

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.140
to start a revolt
in a major way.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:38.570
But anyway, after he was
executed, there started to be

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.690
a little bit more murmurrings,
especially in the North.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:43.140
Most of the sugar plantations
were focused around the North,

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.910
and obviously, the more
plantations, the more profit.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:52.170
And there was actually a voodoo
ceremony that was run

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:57.720
by an individual whose name
was Dutty Boukman.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.810
And I looked for pictures
of him.

00:09:58.810 --> 00:09:59.680
I couldn't find any.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.940
Unfortunately, there aren't.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:04.360
He ran this voodoo ceremony
where he essentially

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:09.280
instigated a slave uprising in
Haiti, or what is now Haiti,

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.510
but in Saint-Domingue.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.120
Remember, look at those
demographics.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.650
As you could imagine, if the
slaves themselves were to rise

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.430
up against everyone else on
the island, you could

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:22.230
imagine-- even though they might
not be as well organized

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:25.580
or as well equipped as the other
members-- just by sheer

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.570
force, they should probably
do pretty good.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:40.060
And so in 1791, in August
1791, an all-out slave

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.310
rebellion begins.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.380
Now you can imagine,
this scares France.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.100
Putting aside all of the things
of the Revolution and

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:57.350
all these new notions from the
Enlightenment, here is your

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.930
most profitable colony in the
world, and all of a sudden

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:03.520
there's a revolt.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.550
People on both sides of the
equation are getting

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:08.020
slaughtered, plantations
are getting burned.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:11.430
From the new government in
France's point of view, that's

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:12.990
just going to hurt their
own profitability.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.690
This is at a time, remember,
France is broke.

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:18.180
They're at wars with
other countries.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:24.140
So France sends a delegation,
headed by

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.770
this guy right there.

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:28.310
His name was-- and I know
I'm butchering the

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.270
pronunciations-- Sonthonax.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:35.710
I don't know the best
way to pronounce it.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:42.540
And it was him plus 6,000
or 7,000 troops.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:46.090
And they essentially were sent
from France to put down the

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:48.670
slave rebellion, to kind
of get things back to

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.890
the way they were.

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:53.980
And in order to kind of
consolidate everyone on

00:11:53.980 --> 00:12:02.640
France's side right here, France
in April 1792-- so let

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.890
me write this down.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.810
The Legislative Assembly, you
might remember, a new

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:14.190
constitution was created at
the end of 1791, and that

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:16.120
entailed a new Legislative
Assembly.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.860
They essentially gave full
citizenship to all

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.110
free people of color.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.770
So unfortunately, Vincent
Oge was a little bit

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:36.710
ahead of his time.

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.080
If he had just waited a
couple of years, he

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:38.940
wouldn't have had to revolt.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.690
Or maybe he helped to
precipitate this.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:42.570
So it's not clear.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:46.160
Maybe his revolt, which maybe
helped precipitate the

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.590
eventual slave revolt, which
eventually might have helped

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:52.470
the Legislative Assembly come
to terms with this idea.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.690
Maybe he made it happen or maybe
it would have happened

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:59.760
on its own, but they made
full citizens out of

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.220
free people of color.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:12.940
And they probably did that-- you
could view it kind of in a

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.310
positive or a negative spin.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:18.120
The positive spin was this is
consistent with the ideas of

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.350
the Enlightenment and
the Revolution.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:23.615
Or if you want to kind of view
a more strategizing view on

00:13:23.615 --> 00:13:26.270
it, they probably said, hey,
there's all this craziness

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:30.280
going on in Haiti, if we can at
least get these people on

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.190
our side, we might be able
to properly suppress

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.090
these people over here.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:36.860
And let's be clear.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:41.140
Many of these mixed-race freemen
of color, they owned

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:42.280
slaves themselves.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.070
So from their own self-interest,
they were

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.657
actually very similar to the
white colonialists in

00:13:46.657 --> 00:13:49.340
Saint-Domingue at that time.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.480
If they were a little bit more
strategic about it, it might

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.850
have been just to kind of
consolidate the power on the

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:57.670
free people on the island, or
the landowners on the island.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:01.760
But they sent that message with
Sonthonax and 6,000 to

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.020
7,000 troops to get things
back in order.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:10.350
But you might remember-- and
even that-- this made many

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.390
people very unhappy,
even on the island.

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:16.640
As some of those white
colonialists at that time,

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.880
they weren't the most liberal
thinking people and they

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.610
probably didn't appreciate this
idea of freemen of color

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:24.520
being able to have all of the
same rights as they did.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:29.330
So there was obviously a lot
of antagonism against this

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.680
guy, against Sonthonax
right there.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.570
And then you might remember that
in February 1793-- we saw

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.740
that in the previous video,
or in several videos ago--

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:44.070
February 1793, you start having
war with Great Britain.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.280
And Great Britain had control
of this, right here.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.530
That is Jamaica.

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.090
Just to be clear, in green
right here, this is

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:05.340
Saint-Domingue.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.800
And right here, this
is Santo Domingo,

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.750
controlled by the Spanish.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:17.890
So you had a big problem.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:19.850
Here he is, Sonthonax
right there.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:22.600
He's antagonized some of the
whites, he's trying to put

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.140
down a slave rebellion,
or at least get

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.580
things back to normal.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.700
And then all of a sudden you
have the British over here,

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.290
and you have a lot of these
white colonialists that start

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:35.600
saying, hey, if France is going
to be like that, we're

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.440
going to side with
the British.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.280
We're going to side with the
British or we're going to get

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.590
help from the British and we're
going to use that help

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:46.210
from the British to essentially
get our way back

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:48.410
in Saint-Domingue.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:53.570
Now Sonthonax, as far as I can
tell, he was of a more liberal

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:56.440
persuasion in that he was
sympathetic to the plight

00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:00.800
definitely of people of
mixed-race, and even to the

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.230
plight possibly of slaves
themselves.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.850
But also, for strategic reasons,
he saw the writing on

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:06.350
the wall as well.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:11.280
He said, gee, I have 500,000
slaves and we need to fend off

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.530
the British.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.730
This is a pretty bold action.

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:19.510
In the history of slavery, this
is actually one of the

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:21.782
most significant declarations.

00:16:21.782 --> 00:16:29.830
In 1793, in August of 1793--
it might be a reflection of

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:33.520
his own ideas, or it might have
just been because of the

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:43.590
threat from Britain-- Sonthonax
declares freedom for

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:44.840
all the slaves.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:51.040
He wasn't saying that they would
have all of the same

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.970
rights as land owning
men, but he's

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:56.980
essentially abolishing slavery.

00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:02.880
Initially, he did it just in
the North, but in September

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.640
and October, he eventually
extended it to all of the

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.800
French possessions in
Saint-Domingue.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.569
Now you could imagine the slaves
that were revolting

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:14.119
this entire time, they're
a little bit

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:15.930
suspicious of this gentleman.

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:20.530
He was, it looks like, sent to
Saint-Domingue, or what is now

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:23.420
Haiti, to put down
the uprising.

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.410
He shows up with 6,000
or 7,000 troops.

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:30.650
He tries to side with
essentially the enemies of the

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.780
slaves to put down
the uprising.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.720
And now all of a sudden, when
the British look like a bit of

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:40.240
a threat, he's like, hey, I'm
ending slavery by myself.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.470
I am just declaring slavery
to be over.

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:45.200
And they've been tricked before
and they're saying,

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.640
this is probably some type of a
trick just to make us become

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:53.330
a little passive so that they
can get back at us.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:56.940
And so their leaders were a
little bit suspicious of it,

00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:06.030
but then in February of 1794,
this was ratified.

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:10.950
His declaration was ratified
by the French National

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:12.200
Convention.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:25.580
And by the time word got to
the freed slaves, or the

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:31.540
rebelling slaves on the island--
so we're now in May

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:37.040
1794-- the rebel slaves'
leader-- and this is a super

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:52.590
important name to know--
Toussaint L'Ouverture-- he was

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:59.620
the leader of the rebels, and he
was a self-educated former

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:00.980
slave himself.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.460
And actually he proves himself
over and over again to be one

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.730
of the best military
generals and

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:10.340
actually in much of history.

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:16.030
In May 1794, Toussaint
L'Ouverture-- I'll write his

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:25.550
name twice-- decides to
essentially join sides with

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:27.760
the French Republic, join
sides with Sonthonax.

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:40.460
Now once again, let's
look at the numbers.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.050
You have Toussaint
L'Ouverture.

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:45.060
He is essentially the
leader of these

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:50.080
500,000 newly freed slaves.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:54.340
This is essentially the military
of the island.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:57.670
He is now the leader
of the island.

00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:02.060
So now he is essentially, you
could almost view him as the

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:07.330
general or the governor of the
island, of this colony.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.450
Despite the fact that he had
very good leadership

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:16.620
qualities, he also
had a bit of a

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:20.690
megalomaniacal side for himself.

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:25.880
And so he actually declared
himself governor for life.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:34.320
In 1801, he issues a
constitution that declares

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:42.530
himself governor for life.

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:50.170
And in his defense, this wasn't
that unusual for this

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:50.850
time in the world.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:52.420
I mean, you look across
the Atlantic, look

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:53.640
with Napoleon's doing.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.590
He takes over the French
Republic, he essentially is

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:59.580
declaring himself emperor
and what not for life.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.310
And this guy says, hey, I have
the same right to do it.

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:05.650
I've led these people to
essentially their freedom.

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:06.430
They trust me.

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:09.390
I'll declare myself
governor for life.

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:13.570
And also in his defense-- and
this also speaks to him being

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:16.780
a step ahead of many of the
rulers at this time-- is that

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.560
he didn't have just plain old
slash and burn tactics.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.440
He actually did enforce
a lot of

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.670
discipline amongst his troops.

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:27.230
And we'll see one of his
right-hand men, Dessalines-- I

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:30.710
know I'm pronouncing it wrong--
he was much more

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:33.830
savage with the people that
he was fighting against.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:40.230
But Toussaint L'Ouverture was
very disciplined and when he

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:44.370
came to power, he actually did
not try to get revenge on the

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:46.780
mixed-race or on the white
plantation owners.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.130
He realized that, hey,
you know what?

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:52.240
We are a new people in charge
of what is essentially a new

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.420
country-- or in his mind it's a
new country-- but let's not

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.600
try to rock too many boats.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.410
Let's try to kind of keep our
society going in some

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:01.770
reasonable way so that
we don't just ruin

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:02.950
ourselves into oblivion.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:05.690
And he also did not declare
independence from France.

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:09.140
So that's an important
point too.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.410
He didn't want to completely
disjoint themselves from

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:12.830
France, so no independence.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.500
He was just happy essentially
being part of the French

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:23.110
empire, but he himself
will be the governor.

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:24.760
You could imagine
on two levels,

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.210
Napoleon was not happy.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:31.250
We we remember, in 1799, and
especially 1800, Napoleon

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:33.880
comes to power, calls himself
the First Council.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:44.150
And he's not happy on
essentially two grounds.

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:51.880
One, there's this upstart here
declaring himself governor for

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.120
life of this island.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.700
No one can do that
but Napoleon.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.870
The other problem that Napoleon
had is, all of a

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:01.600
sudden, once you lose 500,000
slaves and they are now

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:06.030
freemen and you now have to pay
them maybe slightly better

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.900
wages instead of just making
them do what you want and just

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:13.450
extracting all the profits, the
island, the colony becomes

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:15.200
much, much less profitable.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.830
So in the back of his mind, he
also wanted to reinstate

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:21.570
slavery and you'll see that he
does it explicitly later on.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.530
So he sends his brother-in-law.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:34.100
You need a dirty job to do, you
got to send someone you

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:42.730
trust. He sends his
brother-in-law Charles Leclerc

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:48.720
with 40,000 troops-- so Napoleon
is definitely taking

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:53.360
the situation seriously-- with
40,000 troops to essentially

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.550
take back the island from
Toussaint L'Ouverture.

00:23:56.550 --> 00:24:00.350
And so you imagine there's this
huge battle that goes on

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:03.210
on the island of Saint-Domingue,
or the western

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:04.860
half of the island,
or the part that's

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.770
controlled by the French.

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:10.540
And eventually, they start to
get the upper advantage.

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.170
It doesn't help, the fact that
Toussaint L'Ouverture's-- some

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:17.130
of his closest generals or his
closest aides, when they kind

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.050
of see the writing on the wall,
when they see that this

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:22.050
guy-- in the next video, I'll
talk about how barbaric some

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:24.230
of the things this
guy did was.

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:28.310
But once some of Toussaint
L'Ouverture's generals started

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:29.390
to see the writing
on the wall, they

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:31.270
actually turned on him.

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:34.700
And one of them was-- he
actually ends up completing

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.410
the revolution, but while he
was fighting for Toussaint

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:49.250
L'Ouverture-- this is
Jean-Jacques Dessalines-- him

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:51.790
and some of the other right-hand
men to Toussaint

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:54.100
L'Ouverture, he actually joins
the side of Leclerc.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:59.110
Leclerc is kind of making it
look like he's not trying to

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:01.860
reinstate slavery, he's not
trying to take citizenship

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.330
away from people of
African descent.

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:08.450
He makes it look like he's
only trying to take

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:10.310
L'Ouverture off of
his high horse.

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:14.830
So this guy says, OK, fine,
for the betterment of

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:16.560
Saint-Domingue, I'm with you.

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:20.530
And at that point, Toussaint
L'Ouverture is essentially in

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:22.210
a very tough situation.

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:26.500
So Leclerc says, hey, Toussaint,
let's have some

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:30.770
negotiations and maybe we can
figure out some way for you to

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:34.650
assimilate you and the people
you're leading into

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:37.570
essentially Napoleon's--
what is now turning

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:38.880
into Napoleon's empire.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.260
So Toussaint L'Ouverture-- being
a kind of upstanding

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:45.340
individual who trusts people and
a man of honor-- he says,

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.710
oh, this Charles Leclerc must
be a man of honor as well.

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:52.910
So he meets with him to
discuss the terms of

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:53.830
assimilation.

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:56.070
Well, it turns out Charles
Leclerc was

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:57.110
not a man of honor.

00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:00.440
Maybe I could draw some devil
horns on him right there.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.670
And he, when Toussaint
L'Ouverture shows up by

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:08.510
himself for a very civilized
meeting, he gets some people

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:12.480
to arrest him, capture him, and
then send him on a boat to

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.900
France, and essentially
Toussaint L'Ouverture dies in

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.920
France in a prison.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.670
So I'm going to leave
this video here.

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:27.230
It's kind of a very
sad moment.

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:30.140
You have freedom for the slaves
temporarily, you have

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:34.770
this major historic figure
Toussaint L'Ouverture leading

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:39.050
the slaves and trying to
establish a new government.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:42.900
But then it gets violently
suppressed by Napoleon's

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.810
henchman, by Charles Leclerc,
his brother-in-law.

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:48.380
And I'm going to finish this
video just with a quote from

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:51.340
Toussaint L'Ouverture because it
kind of foreshadows what's

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.180
going to happen in
the next video.

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.830
So this is actually something
that he said on the boat to

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:57.080
France after being captured.

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:02.310
Let me make the whole
quote here.

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:05.660
"In overthrowing me, you have
cut down in Saint-Domingue

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.450
only the trunk of the
tree of liberty.

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:12.080
It will spring up again from the
roots, for they are many

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.070
and they are deep."
