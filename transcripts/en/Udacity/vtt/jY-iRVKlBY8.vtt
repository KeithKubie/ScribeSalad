00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, let's see. Before I can make any error calculation,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm going to need to get 300,000 stadia into kilometers.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So, let's go through that process.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
To do this conversion, we write our original number, 300,000 stadia,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
multiply it by our first conversion factor in which the stadia cancel out,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
multiply by our second conversion factor in which the meters cancel out,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and then we're left with 55,500 km.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now, we can calculate the error by looking at the absolute error,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
which is how far off Archimedes was.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
That's 55,000 - 40,000 and dividing that by the true circumference,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
which we know is 40,000 km.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:56.000
When we do this, we get 15,000/40,000, which is 15/40, which is 3/8, which is 37.5%.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
He was still closer than Plato, but quite a ways off.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Then since both Plato and Archimedes were just guessing,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I don't know how either of them had any confidence that the numbers they made were correct.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Now, Plato and Archimedes were both really smart guys,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
but both of their guesses were quite far off from the true circumference of the earth.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Let's go back to Syracuse, the birthplace of Archimedes,

00:01:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to learn more about some of the accomplishments he made over the course of his life.
