1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,490
The Joe Rogan experience

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,220
with all this martial
arts skill Gwadar yeah,

3
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:12,060
but fatal is big fate or
might have like a gut,

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,600
but he's a thick motherfucker.
Okay.

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,140
Young fade or you ever see young
fade or when he was in his prime,

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,740
like back when he fought like
Fujita like back when, uh,

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,090
this is there's a picture
of fate or standing around
with a bunch of kettlebells

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,910
ever see that picture? Nope. I
was Fade Orleans lifting days,

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,160
I suspect. And this is
coming from, that's,

10
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,320
that's one when fader was fairly
young up there, but that's a,

11
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,370
that's not the one I'm talking about.

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,130
You know the one with the
kettlebells is that picture up?

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,930
See we found that picture never a six
pack in sight. No, no six pack. But um,

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,500
I suspect fade or might have been on
some performance enhancing substances

15
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:57,200
during his prime. You mean like hard
training? Lots of drilling technique. Uh,

16
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,920
set of steroids. Steroids. How dare
you sir. Dude, he was in pride.

17
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,660
Everybody was on steroids. Yeah, that's
him. Look at him. That's him in his prime.

18
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,340
That's a big mother fucker. Now, I
do not know if he was on anything,

19
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:13,860
but everybody else was, I
mean, literally everybody,

20
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,340
if they had it in their contract that you,

21
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,640
we will not test for steroids.
You know,

22
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:24,420
Ensign Nua told me that they
like essentially encouraged
people to take steroids.

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,050
Yeah. The pride days. That's right. Yeah.

24
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:31,320
And it's not like Russians don't have
a long history of using performance

25
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:35,760
enhancing substances. You,
I'm sure you saw that movie.
Um, ICARUS. Did you see it?

26
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,620
Yup. Fascinating. Right. It's, it's
a, it's fascinating. I mean, I don't,

27
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,790
uh, steroids often feel to me
like a bit of a witch hunt. Uh,

28
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,380
oftentimes you assume people
are on steroids. I'm a bit of a,

29
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,510
maybe I'm naive or an optimist,

30
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,380
but I tend to give people the benefit
of the doubt until proven otherwise.

31
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,210
But it, Chris obviously proves, yeah,

32
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,770
that everybody kind of throws a monkey
wrench of those gears. But you know,

33
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:06,510
with a, with fatal, the
technique and that technique,

34
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:10,850
the execution at the timing that brilliant
civil government, no doubt the heart.

35
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,780
Now he's phenomenal. Yeah. I just want to,

36
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:15,060
if not the greatest heavyweight of
all time, he certainly one of them.

37
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,380
And I don't think steroids would help
that. Yes, they do. To help. Okay. Yeah.

38
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,780
They held that guy particular yeah. They
help everything. They help your training,

39
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:25,290
they help you build your ability to
recover. They help your explosive power,

40
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,670
they help your speed, they help
everything that, but they also,

41
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:33,540
it's not just steroids, like
a lot of them on EPO, Epo,

42
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:36,650
radically in enhances your endurance.
Um,

43
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,260
and they're starting to catch people need
they just a stripped Tj Dillashaw the

44
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:44,850
UFC bantamweight champion for star
for a EPO or other, it's tragic.

45
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,200
Yes, it is tragic. Especially
Tj, you mean he's a,

46
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,270
just a phenomenal fighter.
If not,

47
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,700
I mean certainly top 10 pound for pound
and then this is one of those things

48
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:59,800
that comes up and you go,
Oh man,

49
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,690
so legacy killer and this world,

50
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:05,590
we have to kind of
reconsider what kind of a,

51
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,240
what should be allowed or not. Yeah,
no, I agree with that. That there,

52
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:14,170
there is an idea of where you should
make stair was legal right? Or not legal.

53
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:17,590
Sorry. Ah, a lot or some
kind of supplementation.

54
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,630
Like where's the line?
When you,

55
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,780
when you start to talk about the future
of martial arts, the future sport,

56
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,140
if you can control the levels
so that they're healthy. I mean,

57
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:31,141
isn't that the reason that they're
not allowed is because if abused,

58
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,410
they become unhealthy. Uh, they damaged
longterm wellbeing of the person.

59
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,870
There's, look, if that was the case,

60
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:42,220
we wouldn't allow fighting
because fighting is more
damaging than steroids for

61
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:43,420
sure.
For sure.

62
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:47,660
Getting punched and kicked and fucking
need in the face and elbowed into

63
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,040
consciousness that is way worse for
you than steroids. They're there.

64
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:54,600
The concern is not for the athlete,
the concerns for the opponent. Um,

65
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,810
the idea is that you will be able to
inflict punishment that you would not

66
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:03,490
ordinarily be able to inflict. You will
have more endurance. You have more power.

67
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,460
You will hurt someone potentially even.
Look,

68
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,390
there's going to be a time where someone
dies in a mixed martial arts in that,

69
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,770
and if that's someone who was
the victor who did not die,

70
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:15,760
it was on steroids.

71
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,970
It is going to be a huge national tragedy
and a massive disaster for the sport,

72
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:29,170
for everything. If that ever does
happen, we can only hope it never does,

73
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,020
but for sure you know,
it's a, it's a very,

74
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,690
very dangerous game you're
playing and when you are,

75
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,610
martial arts is a very dangerous game and
when you were enhancing your body with

76
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:42,520
chemicals that are illegal
while you're doing that game,

77
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,070
the real question is though,
here's my take on it and this is,

78
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,270
it's one of the most human
subjects and B being meaning,

79
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,660
meaning that it's messy.
Humans are messy,

80
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,820
like there's good and there's bad.
You know,

81
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,490
look like abortion is a messy
subject. It's messy. You
know, whether you have the,

82
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,910
whether you agree with someone's
right to have it or not, it is.

83
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:11,890
What you're doing is, especially as
the fetus gets older, it's messy.

84
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,580
You know, when it's a complicated
discussion, it's not a clear,

85
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,280
it's not like you should drink water.
You know what I mean? It's like,

86
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:23,140
it's a very complicated
discussion. Steroids are a
very complicated discussion.

87
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:27,070
You're not allowed to do them,
but they exist for a reason.

88
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:29,860
The reason why they exist
is there really effective,

89
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,080
they're really effective
at enhancing your body.

90
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,880
But how much of that will we allow?
We allow creatine,

91
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:39,730
we allow supplements in terms
of, you know, there's uh,

92
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,110
there's certain things that can slightly
elevate your testosterone slightly

93
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:45,190
elevate your growth hormone.

94
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:49,060
We allow sauna and ice baths and all
these things that have shown to enhance

95
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:53,500
recovery. But that's, that's too much.
It's too good there too effective.

96
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,950
But it's weird. It's weird that this
thing that we found that makes you better,

97
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,080
you can't use.
Yeah.

98
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:04,100
And so I have to go back a little bit
and disagree with you on something.

99
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:06,800
So in terms of fighting being dangerous,

100
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:10,520
and that's if we wanted to forbid things
that are dangerous for you would forbid

101
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:14,980
fighting. I think the main thing
you're doing can be dangerous, right?

102
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,880
The main thing that we're talking
about, the sport, the combat event,

103
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:25,180
that can be dangerous because that is
what we watch two people at the height of

104
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:30,110
their skill, ability, heart,
passion, putting their life at risk.

105
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,820
That can be dangerous, but
the supplementation around
it, the way to make it,

106
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,010
uh, to make their training better,
more effective, that can be dangerous.

107
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:43,010
And I thought that can't be named,
can't be dangerous.

108
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:47,000
So I thought steroids were
considered what sort of band?

109
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,080
Because abuses lead to
longterm damage to health.

110
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,420
Now we see steroids as cheating,

111
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,580
but it was banned initially
because it has detrimental effects.

112
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,423
Your that's true.

113
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,830
No, because there's no real
evidence that it's detrimental.

114
00:07:02,831 --> 00:07:05,520
It's not as detrimental as alcohol
when you allow people to drink bit,

115
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,340
even a bit even when abused
where the bodies, like there's,

116
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,580
there's not a lot of like there's a
great documentary on it called bigger,

117
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:16,090
stronger, faster. And uh,
it's by my friend Chris Bell.

118
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,900
And when you watched that
documentary and you realize like, oh,

119
00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:24,901
well the real negative consequences of
taking steroids or that it shuts down

120
00:07:25,961 --> 00:07:26,800
your endocrine system,

121
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,930
so it stops your body's natural production
of testosterone and growth hormone

122
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:34,810
and hormones.
That's the real problem.

123
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,040
And for young people that can be very
devastating and it can lead to depression

124
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,240
and suicidal thoughts and all,
all,

125
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:43,900
all sorts of really bad things
when your testosterone shuts down.

126
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,000
But as far as like death boy,
I mean there's,

127
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,770
people are prescribed pain pills every
day of the week and fighters that are on

128
00:07:53,771 --> 00:07:57,810
injuries, uh, that have been, you
know, that have gotten surgery, they,

129
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,660
they're prescribed pain pills everyday
of the week and those pain pills kill

130
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:03,790
people left and right.
That's just a fact.

131
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,930
People die of those things all the time,
much more so than die of steroids.

132
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,500
So I'm not advocating for the use of
steroids. Right? I'm just, um, I'm,

133
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,920
I'm being pretty objective
and neutral about this,

134
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:18,190
but I'm just looking at it like it is a,
it's a very messy

135
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,920
the subject. Yeah, that's
very eloquently put. But so,

136
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:25,750
so you're a problem in terms of damaging
the opponent is if one side takes Taro,

137
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:29,880
isn't that does exactly what happens
if both the problem you require

138
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,490
someone to do that maybe
someone's a holistic person.

139
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:37,491
They don't want to introduce any unnatural
exogenous steroids into their body.

140
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:40,590
And hormones in their body.
They want,

141
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,760
they want everything to be produced
by the human body. They want to,

142
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:49,490
they want to eat healthy food, train hard,
sleep well, and compete naturally. Yeah.

143
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:51,360
At CT Fletcher here yesterday, right? Yes.

144
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,300
Is natural bodybuilder or not bodybuilders
and power lifters. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

145
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,930
But that's not required, right? This
is, you're not requiring people,

146
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,260
you're giving them the
choice. So, you know,

147
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:07,540
it's an interesting possibility where
in moderation you'll be able to last

148
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:12,541
steroids and future of athletics because
with an argument that if him and done

149
00:09:13,061 --> 00:09:16,920
in moderation, you can actually create
healthier athletes. Yeah. That's,

150
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,890
I mean that's a real argument for the
Tour de France, the Tour de France,

151
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:24,010
they say that you actually are better
off in healthier taking steroids. Yeah.

152
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:28,350
And Epo. Then you are doing it without
it. Cause it's so unbelievable.

153
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,820
You're ruling on the body.
Yeah.

154
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,840
I mean those athletes are basically
some of the best people in the world at

155
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:38,580
suffering. Yeah. Longterm suffering. It's
incredible. Yeah. Ultra marathon runners,

156
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:43,350
all those guys. It's incredibly
different sort of thing. You know?

157
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:47,490
And you know the thing about ultra
marathon runners is didn't even test him

158
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,120
cause they're like, good luck.
Good luck. Those people have iron.

159
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:56,110
Will's like Courtney do. Walter's a
woman who, you know, she is. Yeah,

160
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,230
she's been in here. She eats candy.
Just drinks, beer, eat candy and pizza.

161
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,260
Makes Sense.
Yeah.

162
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:06,290
I mean she just got fucking iron will
or her will is indomitable and you could

163
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:09,900
take all the steroids you want
when you're running for three days.

164
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:15,090
That chick is going to beat you. She
just doesn't know how to quit. Yeah.

165
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,200
Just has no quit in.

166
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:19,230
Did you see the podcast with her
where she talked about how she fell?

167
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,120
She couldn't see. She
was in experiencing, uh,

168
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,950
I think it was inner ocular
hemorrhaging. Yeah. So her,

169
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,470
her eyeballs were bleeding internally,

170
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,770
something like that where it was
impeding her vision. She couldn't see,

171
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,930
I would stop. I would stop running.
No, she fell because you couldn't see,

172
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,220
busted her head open, bleeding all
down. Her face keeps running. Barely,

173
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,190
barely can see her feet as she's running,
keeps running.

174
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,320
I'm glad those people are out there.
