00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.240
 Let's say I have two different gas 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.593
 at two different temperatures, 

00:00:03.593 --> 00:00:06.252
 which are exactly in contact with one another. 

00:00:06.252 --> 00:00:08.922
 This is my cyclazed gas. 

00:00:08.922 --> 00:00:17.560
 Here, let me draw some of the molecules of cyclase gas. 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.480
 And this system here, 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.217
 as you call it, 

00:00:21.217 --> 00:00:24.474
 has just come into contact with this blue gas. 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.260
 This blue gas here. 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.920
 And let's say just when we start our simulation, our experiment, 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.840
 this cyclazed gas has a higher temperature. 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.140
 Higher temperature. 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.160
 And our blue gas has a lower temperature. 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.940
 Lower temperature. 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.880
 Let us recall what is the temperature, 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.517
 especially if we think of it on a molecular scale. 

00:00:52.517 --> 00:00:54.990
 Higher temperature, lower temperature. 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.193
 The temperature is proportional to the average kinetic energy. 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.660
 These molecules will vibrate, circle around. 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.660
 They will have - 

00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:06.356
 each of them will have kinetic energy 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.460
 and if you average them 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.540
 this will be proportional to the temperature. 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.340
 Let me depict the kinetic energy of each of these separate molecules. 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.080
 Perhaps this is what he is doing. 

00:01:15.087 --> 00:01:16.922
 Perhaps this is what he is doing. 

00:01:16.922 --> 00:01:18.617
 Maybe this goes in that direction. 

00:01:18.617 --> 00:01:20.288
 Maybe this goes in that direction. 

00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:22.617
 This goes in that direction. 

00:01:22.617 --> 00:01:24.570
 This goes in that direction. 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.221
 This goes in that direction. 

00:01:26.221 --> 00:01:27.540
 And so, 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.620
 note, they all have different directions. 

00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:32.421
 And the magnitude of their speed may be different. 

00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:34.480
 They all have different speeds. 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.500
 They can all have different speeds. 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.880
 They have different speeds. 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.140
 And they hit each other. 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.857
 They transfer their kinetic energy, 

00:01:43.857 --> 00:01:45.157
 transfer their impulse 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.120
 from one particle to another. 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.400
 But when we talk about temperature, 

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:49.987
 we are talking about the average kinetic energy 

00:01:49.987 --> 00:01:51.180
 or which is proportional to 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.980
 the average kinetic energy of the system. 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.200
 Each of these molecules will have some kinetic energy. 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.180
 But on average it will be lower. 

00:01:59.193 --> 00:02:01.156
 Perhaps this one is doing something like that. 

00:02:01.156 --> 00:02:03.222
 He does that. 

00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:05.161
 He does that. 

00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:07.360
 He does that. 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.957
 They are different, 

00:02:08.957 --> 00:02:11.111
 but on average they will have less energy. 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.080
 I hope you can see these cyclamen arrows 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.420
 are larger than these blue arrows, 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.860
 which I paint. 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.080
 And it does not have to be all - 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.600
 for example, this can have a lot of kinetic energy. 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.760
 But when you average everything, 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.309
 the average here will be lower than the average here. 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.860
 Like this. 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.760
 If this is our initial condition, 

00:02:30.761 --> 00:02:33.629
 what do we think will happen? 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.717
 Before our various gas groups 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.400
 struggled with themselves 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.454
 or the cyclamate molecules bumped with cyclamen. 

00:02:41.454 --> 00:02:42.684
 The blues hit the blue. 

00:02:42.684 --> 00:02:44.821
 But now they will start shuffling with each other. 

00:02:44.821 --> 00:02:48.140
 And you can imagine that when this molecule here 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.080
 collide with this molecule, 

00:02:50.092 --> 00:02:52.390
 it will transfer some kinetic energy to it. 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.200
 After the collision, this can move. 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.880
 After the collision - 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.960
 let's say that they just collided. 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.353
 It's just before 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.740
 and let's say they just stopped being pushed into each other. 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.520
 Just after they have finished hitting each other, 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.660
 this can ricochet. 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.520
 This will go this way. 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.260
 Let me do this in a different color. 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.060
 He can hit this, bounce 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.040
 and then transfer some of its kinetic energy 

00:03:18.048 --> 00:03:20.521
 and then jump in that direction. 

00:03:20.521 --> 00:03:26.960
 While this, after the collision, 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.560
 it may be moving much faster in that direction. 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.080
 And notice, you have a transfer of energy. 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.100
 Exactly with this collision you have a kinetic energy transfer 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.457
 of this molecule to this molecule. 

00:03:39.457 --> 00:03:41.791
 And it will happen in the system. 

00:03:41.791 --> 00:03:44.624
 Faster molecules, those with higher kinetic energy - 

00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:48.118
 while they collide, you will have an energy transfer. 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.140
 You will have a transfer of energy from a higher temperature 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.640
 to a lower temperature. 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.100
 Power transfer. 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.120
 This is a transfer of energy. 

00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:03.525
 And you can accept this for the transfer of heat - 

00:04:03.525 --> 00:04:04.880
 here we talk about temperature. 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.220
 Things that are related to temperature, 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.720
 we will call it "thermal". 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.960
 This is a heat transfer. 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.420
 Transfer of heat. 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.580
 If you start with higher energy here, 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.380
 you will have a higher average kinetic energy. 

00:04:20.382 --> 00:04:22.356
 Here you will have lower average kinetic energy. 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.600
 But it will transfer energy from the cyclamen to the blue. 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.180
 This will go from a higher temperature 

00:04:29.183 --> 00:04:30.692
 to a lower temperature. 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.120
 And this energy, which is transferred, 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.520
 we call - and this is a word you probably hear many times - 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.620
 this energy that is transferred is called "heat". 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:51.020
 Literally, this warmer gas here heats this cooler gas. 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.160
 And the way this heat transfer takes place, 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.627
 when it is through a collision of particles, 

00:04:57.627 --> 00:05:01.140
 the transfer of kinetic energy to the collision of particles, 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.720
 who transfer the impulse, 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.060
 we call conducting. 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.720
 We call this heat (heat). 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.780
 Or just conducting. 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.120
 Let me record a "thermal performance". 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.980
 I'll do it in a new color. 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.220
 What I describe is a thermal conduction. 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.400
 Which, in a certain way, you feel many times - 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.120
 transfer of heat. 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.080
 For example, you probably know the feeling, 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.240
 if you take, I do not know if you take a saucepan. 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.940
 Let's say you pick up such a saucepan. 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.180
 Let's say there is a cold pot in the beginning. 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.000
 That is, the particles in the pot have lower kinetic energy. 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.760
 I will not be able to draw all of them. 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.061
 And then put it on fire. 

00:05:48.061 --> 00:05:50.080
 Put it on fire. 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.440
 Let's see if I can draw this. 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.760
 Put it on fire. 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.880
 It's a fire. 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.040
 And we talk about heating the metal on the pan, 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.515
 I'm not dealing with what's inside the pan right now. 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.260
 This fire will first heat the bottom of this saucepan. 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.180
 And it will do so mainly by thermal conduction, 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.380
 because the fire is just super hot air particles 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.980
 and these super hot air particles 

00:06:15.983 --> 00:06:19.083
 will hit the metal particles of your pan. 

00:06:19.083 --> 00:06:21.428
 These metal particles of this saucepan - 

00:06:21.428 --> 00:06:25.085
 their kinetic energy will begin to rise. 

00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:27.361
 This part of the pot will start to heat up. 

00:06:27.361 --> 00:06:30.820
 Just when you turn on your stove, 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.351
 the top of this saucepan may still be cold, 

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:35.523
 but the bottom will quickly become very hot. 

00:06:35.523 --> 00:06:37.183
 But if you just wait a few minutes, 

00:06:37.183 --> 00:06:40.020
 these metal particles will continue to be pushed 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.840
 and vibrate to each other. 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.323
 And eventually, this upper part here 

00:06:44.323 --> 00:06:48.259
 it will be quite hot. 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.820
 It'll be pretty hot. 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.620
 And the way the top of this metal has become hot, 

00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:56.920
 is by heat conduction - 

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.160
 first the metal on the bottom has become hot, 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.786
 then these particles have collided with their neighbors 

00:07:00.786 --> 00:07:02.284
 or have vibrated to their neighbors 

00:07:02.284 --> 00:07:04.060
 and have transferred some of this kinetic energy. 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.451
 And you see this heat transfer again 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:10.420
 from a higher temperature area 

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.080
 to an area with a cooler or lower temperature.
