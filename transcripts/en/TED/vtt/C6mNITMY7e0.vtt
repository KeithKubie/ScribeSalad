00:00:12.952 --> 00:00:16.103
Let's put the care back into health care.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.511
I've been working in the healthcare sector
for the last 15 years,

00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:22.912
and one of the things
that drew me to this sector

00:00:22.936 --> 00:00:27.154
was my interest in the care component
of our healthcare systems --

00:00:27.178 --> 00:00:28.517
more specifically,

00:00:28.541 --> 00:00:31.154
to the invaluable role played by carers.

00:00:32.173 --> 00:00:35.838
Now, how many of you in this room
consider yourself a carer?

00:00:38.473 --> 00:00:41.072
By this, I mean how many of you
have cared for someone

00:00:41.096 --> 00:00:44.723
suffering from an illness,
injury or disability?

00:00:44.747 --> 00:00:46.873
Can you raise your hand
if this is the case?

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:50.531
About half of the room.

00:00:51.316 --> 00:00:53.626
I want to thank all of you
who raised your hands

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.814
for the time that you've spent as a carer.

00:00:55.838 --> 00:00:58.480
What you do is extremely precious.

00:00:59.813 --> 00:01:02.204
I am a former cared-for patient myself.

00:01:02.868 --> 00:01:05.961
When I was a teenager,
I suffered from Lyme disease

00:01:05.985 --> 00:01:09.066
and underwent 18 months
of antibiotic treatment.

00:01:10.025 --> 00:01:12.048
I was repeatedly misdiagnosed:

00:01:12.521 --> 00:01:16.964
bacterial meningitis,
fibromyalgia, you name it.

00:01:16.988 --> 00:01:18.554
They couldn't figure it out.

00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:22.606
And if I'm standing here
in front of you today,

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.259
it's because I owe my life

00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:27.200
to the stubbornness
and commitment of one carer.

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:30.155
He did everything he could for me --

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.651
driving long distances
from one treatment center to another,

00:01:33.675 --> 00:01:35.549
searching for the best option,

00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:39.008
and above all, never giving up,

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:41.016
despite the difficulties he encountered,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.208
including from a work
and quality-of-life perspective.

00:01:44.867 --> 00:01:46.605
That was my father.

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:50.798
I recovered, and this is largely
thanks to his dedication.

00:01:51.631 --> 00:01:54.811
This experience turned me
into a patient advocate.

00:01:55.478 --> 00:02:00.260
The closer I looked, the more I saw
carers providing the same kind of support

00:02:00.284 --> 00:02:02.594
that my father provided to me,

00:02:02.618 --> 00:02:05.993
and playing a crucial role
in the healthcare system.

00:02:06.686 --> 00:02:09.307
I don't think it's an exaggeration to say

00:02:09.331 --> 00:02:11.811
that without informal carers like him,

00:02:11.835 --> 00:02:14.027
our health and social systems

00:02:14.051 --> 00:02:15.373
would crumble.

00:02:16.148 --> 00:02:19.514
And yet, they're largely
going unrecognized.

00:02:20.828 --> 00:02:23.926
I am now a long-distance
carer for my mother,

00:02:24.687 --> 00:02:26.972
who suffers from multiple
chronic conditions.

00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:31.787
I understand, now more than ever,

00:02:31.811 --> 00:02:33.886
the demands that caregivers face.

00:02:34.942 --> 00:02:37.126
With aging populations,

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.975
economic instability,

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:40.971
healthcare system stress

00:02:40.995 --> 00:02:43.932
and increased incidents
of long-term chronic care needs,

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.408
the importance and demands
on family caregivers

00:02:47.432 --> 00:02:48.764
are greater than ever.

00:02:49.886 --> 00:02:53.777
Carers all over the world
are sacrificing their own physical,

00:02:53.801 --> 00:02:56.587
financial and psychosocial well-being

00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:58.443
to provide care for their loved ones.

00:02:59.556 --> 00:03:01.956
Carers have their own limits and needs,

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.374
and in absence of adequate support,

00:03:04.398 --> 00:03:06.752
many could be stretched
to the breaking point.

00:03:07.858 --> 00:03:11.451
Once seen as a personal
and private matter in family life,

00:03:12.132 --> 00:03:15.643
unpaid caregiving has formed
the invisible backbone

00:03:15.667 --> 00:03:18.988
of our health and social systems
all over the world.

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:22.863
Many of these carers
are even in this room,

00:03:22.887 --> 00:03:24.203
as we have just seen.

00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:27.639
Who are they, and how many are they?

00:03:28.217 --> 00:03:30.583
What are the challenges
that they are facing?

00:03:30.607 --> 00:03:34.406
And, above all, how can we make sure
that their value to patients,

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.748
our healthcare system and society

00:03:36.772 --> 00:03:37.930
is recognized?

00:03:39.067 --> 00:03:41.648
Anyone can be a carer, really:

00:03:42.357 --> 00:03:46.233
a 15-year-old girl caring
for a parent with multiple sclerosis;

00:03:47.074 --> 00:03:49.978
a 40-year-old man juggling full-time work

00:03:50.002 --> 00:03:52.945
while caring for his family
who lives far away;

00:03:53.623 --> 00:03:57.310
a 60-year-old man caring for his wife
who has terminal cancer;

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:01.414
or an 80-year-old woman
caring for her husband

00:04:01.438 --> 00:04:03.074
who has Alzheimer's disease.

00:04:03.997 --> 00:04:07.889
The things carers do
for their patients are varied.

00:04:07.913 --> 00:04:09.609
They provide personal care,

00:04:09.633 --> 00:04:11.641
like getting someone dressed,

00:04:11.665 --> 00:04:13.210
feeding them,

00:04:13.234 --> 00:04:14.661
helping them to the bathroom,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.679
helping them move about.

00:04:17.356 --> 00:04:20.967
They also provide a significant
level of medical care,

00:04:20.991 --> 00:04:25.938
because they often know a lot about
their loved one's condition and needs,

00:04:25.962 --> 00:04:28.851
sometimes better
than the patients themselves,

00:04:28.875 --> 00:04:32.453
who may be paralyzed
or confused by their diagnosis.

00:04:33.284 --> 00:04:34.834
In those situations,

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.031
carers are also advocates for the patient.

00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:42.966
Also of critical importance

00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:47.734
is the fact that carers
also provide emotional support.

00:04:48.338 --> 00:04:50.313
They organize doctor's appointments,

00:04:51.107 --> 00:04:52.831
they manage finances,

00:04:52.855 --> 00:04:56.108
and they also deal
with daily household tasks.

00:04:57.018 --> 00:04:59.834
These challenges are challenges
that we can't ignore.

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:04.079
There are currently
more than 100 million carers

00:05:04.103 --> 00:05:07.866
providing 80 percent
of care across Europe.

00:05:08.617 --> 00:05:10.930
And even if these numbers are impressive,

00:05:10.954 --> 00:05:15.388
they're most likely underestimated,
given the lack of recognition of carers.

00:05:15.412 --> 00:05:16.706
As we have just seen,

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.119
many of you in this room weren't sure
if you could be qualified

00:05:20.143 --> 00:05:22.222
or considered to be a carer.

00:05:22.246 --> 00:05:24.858
Many of you probably thought
I was referring to a nurse

00:05:24.882 --> 00:05:26.803
or some other healthcare professional.

00:05:27.602 --> 00:05:29.096
Also stunning

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.838
are the benefits that carers
bring to our societies.

00:05:32.862 --> 00:05:36.774
I want to give you just one example
from Australia in 2015.

00:05:37.607 --> 00:05:40.960
The annual value
provided by informal carers

00:05:40.984 --> 00:05:43.012
to those suffering from mental illness

00:05:43.036 --> 00:05:47.953
was evaluated at 13.2 billion
Australian dollars.

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:51.974
This is nearly two times
what the Australian government spends

00:05:51.998 --> 00:05:53.958
on mental health services annually.

00:05:53.982 --> 00:05:56.210
These numbers, among others,

00:05:56.234 --> 00:05:59.393
demonstrate that if carers
were to stop caring tomorrow,

00:05:59.417 --> 00:06:02.714
our health and social systems
would crumble.

00:06:04.168 --> 00:06:06.931
And while the importance
of these millions of silent carers

00:06:06.955 --> 00:06:08.300
cannot be denied,

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.938
they've largely been unnoticed

00:06:10.962 --> 00:06:13.918
by governments, healthcare systems

00:06:13.942 --> 00:06:15.381
and private entities.

00:06:17.042 --> 00:06:21.277
In addition, carers are facing
enormous personal challenges.

00:06:21.792 --> 00:06:25.791
Many carers face higher costs
and can face financial difficulties,

00:06:25.815 --> 00:06:28.901
given the fact that they may not
be able to work full time

00:06:28.925 --> 00:06:31.617
or they may not be able
to hold down a job altogether.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.530
Many studies have shown

00:06:33.554 --> 00:06:36.553
that often carers sacrifice
their own health and well-being

00:06:36.577 --> 00:06:38.580
in order to care for their loved ones.

00:06:39.395 --> 00:06:43.050
Many carers spend so much time
caring for their loved ones

00:06:43.074 --> 00:06:46.124
that often their family
and their relationships can suffer.

00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:48.629
Many carers report that often,

00:06:48.653 --> 00:06:51.355
their employers don't have
adequate policies in place

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:52.659
to support them.

00:06:53.157 --> 00:06:54.850
There has been improvement, though,

00:06:54.874 --> 00:06:57.180
in the recognition
of carers around the world.

00:06:57.718 --> 00:07:00.262
Just a few years ago,
an umbrella organization

00:07:00.286 --> 00:07:04.608
called the International Alliance
of Carer Organizations, or IACO,

00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:08.498
was formed to bring together
carer groups from all over the world,

00:07:08.522 --> 00:07:10.631
to provide strategic direction,

00:07:10.655 --> 00:07:12.677
facilitate information sharing,

00:07:12.701 --> 00:07:16.271
as well as actively advocate
for carers on an international level.

00:07:17.036 --> 00:07:21.350
Private entities are also starting
to recognize the situation of carers.

00:07:21.836 --> 00:07:24.101
I am proud that my personal engagement

00:07:24.125 --> 00:07:26.754
and enthusiasm towards
this topic of carers

00:07:26.778 --> 00:07:28.866
found an echo in my own workplace.

00:07:29.612 --> 00:07:32.106
My company is committed to this cause

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.884
and has developed
an unprecedented framework

00:07:34.908 --> 00:07:37.787
for its employees and society as a whole.

00:07:38.471 --> 00:07:40.900
The objective is to empower carers

00:07:40.924 --> 00:07:43.089
to improve their own health and well-being

00:07:43.113 --> 00:07:45.699
and bring about a greater
balance to their lives.

00:07:46.875 --> 00:07:50.180
Nevertheless, much more needs to be done

00:07:50.204 --> 00:07:53.098
to complement these relatively
isolated initiatives.

00:07:54.005 --> 00:07:56.914
Our societies are facing
increased health pressures,

00:07:56.938 --> 00:07:59.223
including aging populations,

00:07:59.247 --> 00:08:02.654
increased incidence of cancer
and chronic conditions,

00:08:02.678 --> 00:08:04.713
widespread inequality,

00:08:04.737 --> 00:08:06.201
amongst many others.

00:08:06.862 --> 00:08:08.726
To confront these challenges,

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:12.409
policymakers must look beyond
traditional healthcare pathways

00:08:12.433 --> 00:08:13.781
and employment policies

00:08:14.418 --> 00:08:16.771
and recognize that informal care

00:08:16.795 --> 00:08:19.861
will continue to form the bedrock of care.

00:08:21.456 --> 00:08:23.763
Caring for someone should be a choice

00:08:24.644 --> 00:08:28.757
and should be done without putting
one's own well-being in the balance.

00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:34.962
But to really put the care
back into health care,

00:08:35.671 --> 00:08:41.115
what's needed is a deep,
societal, structural change.

00:08:42.013 --> 00:08:44.675
And this can only happen
through a change in mindset.

00:08:45.371 --> 00:08:47.194
And this can start today.

00:08:48.182 --> 00:08:51.066
Today, we can plant the seed for a change

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:53.210
for millions of carers around the world.

00:08:53.927 --> 00:08:55.500
Here's what I want to suggest:

00:08:56.216 --> 00:08:57.616
when you go home today

00:08:58.318 --> 00:09:00.642
or to the office tomorrow morning,

00:09:00.666 --> 00:09:01.959
embrace a carer.

00:09:03.012 --> 00:09:04.216
Thank them,

00:09:04.756 --> 00:09:06.588
offer him or her a bit of help,

00:09:07.284 --> 00:09:11.243
maybe even volunteer as a carer yourself
for a couple hours a week.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.911
If carers around the world
felt better recognized,

00:09:14.935 --> 00:09:17.744
it would not only improve
their own health and well-being

00:09:17.768 --> 00:09:19.476
and sense of fulfillment,

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.890
but it would also improve the lives
of those that they're caring for.

00:09:23.531 --> 00:09:25.000
Let's care more.

00:09:25.484 --> 00:09:26.635
Thank you.

00:09:26.659 --> 00:09:29.682
(Applause)
