00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.830
It turns out the strongest material in the
universe isn’t steel, it isn’t graphene,

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.450
and it’s not even that ever-so fictional
vibranium.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.570
It’s….pasta?

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.780
Nuclear pasta to be exact.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.900
Ok it’s not actually pasta, but it is a
material so dense that it’s approximately

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.920
10 billion times stronger than steel.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.179
And yes, scientists have named it after their
favorite food.

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:26.859
It all has to do with neutron stars.

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:32.210
A neutron star is what’s left after a massive
star explodes into a supernova--it’s essentially

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.010
the small, leftover, burnt-out core of that
explosion--maybe 20 kilometers wide, extremely

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.660
dense, and collapsing in on itself.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.120
The inner part of the star actually collapses
so much that some of its electrons and protons

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.510
get squeezed together to form more neutrons...hence
the name ‘neutron star’.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.620
The density part is key here--neutron stars
are so dense that a single teaspoon of them

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.590
would weigh a billion tons.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.890
So if you were to dig about a kilometer below
the surface of a neutron star, what do you

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.200
think you’d find?

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.810
New scientific work has simulated just that.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.070
The pressure inside a neutron star is so extreme
that the material inside clumps together in

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.710
unique patterns, many of which are vaguely
reminiscent of pasta shapes...which is what

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.710
they’re named after.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.790
You’ve got your gnocchi, which looks like
little blobs, and its inverse, the anti gnocchi.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.590
Long string-like tubes are called spaghetti
and anti spaghetti, there’s the good old

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.040
sheet-like lasagna, and….waffles?

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.500
That’s a little outside the pasta family,
but I’ll take it.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.100
These shapes were unveiled via computer simulation,
since such high pressures and the resulting

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.380
high densities are very difficult to replicate
here on earth.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.650
Previous work had already demonstrated that
the surface of a neutron star is incredibly

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.470
strong, but these new simulations show that
the nuclear pasta that lies beneath is even

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.470
stronger.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.630
A 2013 publication had hypothesized that nuclear
pasta exists, but there were no simulations

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.140
at the time that could show us what it was
like.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.600
These new findings reveal a high level of
detail about the shape and nature of nuclear

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.910
pasta, and suggest that the shapes are actually
quite disorderly and complex.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.340
Why does this matter?

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.590
Well, neutron stars spin.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.679
The explosion of the massive star that will
eventually become the neutron star gives the

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.920
whole thing a rotation, and as the neutron
star collapses, that rotation gets even faster.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.849
This spinning means that neutron stars may
be emitting gravitational waves--ripples in

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.200
spacetime that we could potentially detect.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.629
Here’s where the nuclear pasta becomes important--neutron
stars would only generate gravitational waves

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.629
as they spin if their crusts have some kind
of irregularity.

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.510
The experts in this field call bumps on the
surface of a neutron star ‘mountains’,

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.250
even though they’re only a couple of centimeters
tall.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.739
These lumps would be caused by mounds of dense
materials inside the star.

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.439
Sounds like gnocchi to me!

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:49.090
So if nuclear pasta does indeed exist the
way scientists have now simulated it, that

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.610
would mean neutron stars are generating gravitational
all the time!

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.450
So, this is where real-world observation and
simulation come together.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.220
The various nuclear pasta types proposed by
this research could be the reason behind neutron

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.890
stars creating gravitational waves.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.890
Scientists think that these ‘mountains’
on the stars’ surface need to be pretty

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.780
big (by neutron star mountain standards) to
produce waves we can detect.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.030
These new details about nuclear pasta’s
nature reveal that the pasta could be causing

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.580
‘mountains’ tens of centimeters tall,
big enough that we could spot them with the

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.219
observational equipment we already have--like
LIGO.

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:29.579
And observing the gravitational waves of neutron
stars would, in turn, experimentally confirm

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:35.299
the existence of nuclear pasta--which is quite
probably the strongest known material in the

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:36.299
universe.

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.299
Sorry, vibranium.
