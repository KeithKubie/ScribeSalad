This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Audible.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.930
What's the difference between a MOVIE PIRATE
and a MUSIC PIRATE?

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:06.950
Booty.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.190
Lots and lots of booty.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.969
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.670
Until this week, I've kiiiind of lumped pirates
of all kinds into one category.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.890
Well, maybe with the exception of separating
pirates at sea from pirates at a computer....little

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.890
less violent, yaknow?

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.480
This week, a new study published in the Journal
of Behavioral and Experimental Economics found

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.859
that there ARE actually some significant differences
between the group of people that pirate mostly

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:37.359
movies and the people that pirate mostly music.

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:42.589
The biggest difference is that movie pirates
still spend a lot of cashola on the *legal*

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:43.820
enjoyment of movies.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.670
Not so much the case for music pirates.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.239
Those who pirate movies are also, on average:
wealthier, more likely to live in a city,

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.309
more willing to cut down the piracy if they
believe it's hurting the industry, AND are

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.109
also are less likely to believe they'll get
caught than music pirates.

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.649
Why the divide between the two groups?

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.329
The scientists believe it forms out of the
technological demand of illegally downloading

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:05.329
movies.

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:06.520
As in: it's a little harder to do.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.700
You have to figure out how to torrent, you
have to know how to play it back, and then

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.551
there's also the issue of storing lots of
large files.

00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:15.800
They believe this is why movie pirates tend
to be a little more technologically savvy

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.040
than music pirates.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.259
The fact that movie pirates spend more money
on legal content shouldn't come as a huuuuge

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:22.259
surprise.

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.560
Several studies have found that people who
pirate spend more money on media than people

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.329
who purchase everything legally -- about 30%
more in fact.

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.000
The idea is that pirates are just bigger consumers
of media, period.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.360
So, what could this meannnnn?

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.719
Well, for one it busts the myth that pirates
are just people who don't want to pay for

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:38.719
things.

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:41.520
They do pay for things, especially movie pirates,
just not EVERYTHING.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.929
A few other thoughts: the fact that movie
pirates still buy *so much legal content*

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:50.789
and *are willing to cut back* suggests that
CONVENIENCE might play a role in pirating.

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.030
It's there, readily available, while the legal
alternative isn't.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.429
Maybe it's not available legally online, maybe
it's only available in another country, maybe

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.439
you have to drive to go pick it up and rent
it -- and when you're there, sitting on your

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.280
couch, the hassle (or impossibility) of those
legal alternatives just aren't persuasive

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.280
enough.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.510
Another possible implication is that some
movie pirating happens when people feel ripped

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.510
off.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.870
Like that one time I tried to rent The Hobbit
when it first came out on iTunes and it cost

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.290
something like $15 for 1 play and 24 hours.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.110
Or, for instance, if the pirate believes there's
a good chance the movie will be terrible and

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.030
doesn't want to fork over 14 bucks to see
a crappy movie.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.629
It's not that they don't HAVE the money, it's
that they don't feel like it's WORTH the money.

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:30.629
SO!

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:31.629
What do YOU FOLKS make of this study?

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:32.629
Why might pirates buy more content?

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.379
And for those of you interested in legal content
AND helping out the show, you can get a free

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.239
audiobook at audiblepodcast.com/dnews.

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.230
Awwwww yeah, get your Hobbit fix thataway.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.930
Thanks for joining me, I'll cya next time.
