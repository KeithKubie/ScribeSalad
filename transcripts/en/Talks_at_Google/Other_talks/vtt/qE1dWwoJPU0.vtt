00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.990
&gt;&gt;Rich Fernandez: Hello everyone.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.990
&gt;&gt;audience: Hi.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.830
&gt;&gt;Rich Fernandez : Welcome. I'm Rich Fernandez
from the Learning and Development Team here

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:16.410
at Google. So about six months ago we wrote
a letter to Eckhart Tolle inviting him to

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.070
come here to Google. "Eckhart, dude, come
to Google," we said.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.070
[laughter]

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.020
Well, something along those lines. We make
some of the world's most valued and most used

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:35.110
technology. We aspire to do epic stuff and
to make a difference in the world. And yet

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.750
even as we create this dazzling technology,
we wanna be sure to pay attention to our own

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:48.860
inner technology. We wanna ask ourselves the
searching and far ranging questions about

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:56.150
how we're getting on in the world. As we optimize
our technology how can we also optimize our

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.430
lives so that we can be our best selves?

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.650
All of this is a lot easier said than done.
We operate in a hyper-connected world always

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:15.620
on and we go at it with great pace and intensity.
The urgent question of the day is how we can

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:23.070
take an intelligent approach to our work and
our lives with all of the demands of our time

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.810
and attention.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:33.130
Amidst this flood of information how can we
discern the signal from the noise in order

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:41.420
to access and act on what is most essential
to each of us?

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.530
Eckhart Tolle takes a refreshingly contemporary
approach to the question of what it means

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:54.870
to live a meaningful and inspired life and
with great intelligence. And in so being,

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:02.890
how we can each experience a great sense of
clarity, peace, and the joy of being alive.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.050
So we're very lucky that Eckhart accepted
our invitation and said yes to come here today.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.359
He knows our ethos that we have a profound
interest in being our best selves and doing

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:20.599
meaningful and inspired work. We seek to change
the world for the better and he understands

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:27.189
that we understand that in order to transform
the world we must first render the necessary

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:31.129
transformation within ourselves.

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:40.349
So Eckhart is here today to assist and suggest
with some things for us to consider.

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:48.139
Eckhart Tolle has written bestselling books
including The Power of Now and A New Earth

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:53.510
and they've sold millions of copies worldwide
and have been translated into 33 languages.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.370
He's widely regarded as one of the foremost
teachers on the subject of wisdom and conscious

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.510
living.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:06.169
Joining Eckhart in conversation today is our
Vice President of Product, Bradley Horowitz.

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:10.879
Now when we proposed to Bradley that he might
engage in a dialog with Eckhart as part of

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:17.879
this tech talk he was really excited which
makes sense because Bradley's cool like that.

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.069
[laughter]

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:27.169
Bradley also helped create Google+, Google
Apps, and Google+ which we all love.

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:32.730
So without further ado please join me in welcoming
Eckhart Tolle and Bradley Horowitz as they

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.480
discuss what it means to live with meaning,
purpose, and wisdom in the digital age.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.090
[applause]

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.510
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: Thank you.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.110
[applause]

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:56.430
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: So on behalf of Google
and all the many Googlers here and those tuning

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.879
in from our overflow rooms, welcome it's great
to have you here. And it's very special to

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:09.739
have you here. I understand that you don't
often visit corporations and so this has been

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.959
a journey we've taken together over the course
of the day.

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:19.320
Eckhart had a moment to meet with some of
us earlier and we found that really valuable.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:26.380
And one of the things we discussed this morning
was wisdom and the difference between information

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.710
and wisdom. Google has a mission to organize
the world's information and I think if you

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:38.030
think about the hierarchy there's signal and
data and information and knowledge and at

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.820
the very top of the pyramid is wisdom. And
I wondered if you could comment a little bit

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.750
on what you understand to be the difference
between information and wisdom.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.930
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: Good question. Let's kind
of set that aside for just one moment â€“

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:53.930
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: Let's do that.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:01.400
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: to say how happy I am to
be here, how impressed I am by what I have

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:09.790
seen, and by the people who work here, and
the general energy field in the company. And

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:17.750
if you have come, the many young people here,
if you've come straight from college then

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.200
I'm sure you don't know how lucky you are
until --

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.200
[laughter]

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.320
you start working for another company.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.320
[laughter]

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.720
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: [laughs]

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.000
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: Perhaps everybody who works
here one would, as they would say in India

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.070
"You must have very good Karma to be working
here."

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:51.100
openness of people that's reflected in the
structure of the company, the way things are

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:59.620
arranged, the little rooms that you have for
quietness, for meditation, the cafeterias

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:08.640
and all that is just beyond belief so --

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:17.500
I also experience an openness in the people
who work here and far less ego because many

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:26.390
companies are still predominately run by very
big egos. I'm not saying that everybody here's

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.140
entirely free of ego yet, but --

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.250
[laughter]

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:39.410
much less so than in many other places. So
it's wonderful to be here and if my book sales

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.240
ever decline and I need a job --

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.380
[laughter]

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.030
I hope you will, you probably won't but --

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.250
[laughter]

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.610
because first of all I have no computer skills
--

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:51.610
[laughter]

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:52.610
and secondly I'm too old --

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.610
[laughter]

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:59.090
since the average age here is probably about
30.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.800
So your question was important?

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.800
[laughter]

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.300
I remember it, I remember it.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.340
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: I don't. [laughs]

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.760
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: [laughs]

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.760
[laughter]

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:21.940
Knowledge, information, and wisdom, how do
they relate?

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:30.220
Of course with the technological revolution,
information revolution, digital revolution,

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:38.700
whatever you call it there's an enormous amount
of knowledge available to everybody. Almost

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:45.420
the whole of the world's knowledge and there's
the interconnectedness between people and

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:50.669
so on --

00:07:50.669 --> 00:08:00.650
that's all very good of course to have all
that accessible to you. There's a danger though

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:10.090
that you get drowned in too much information
and too much knowledge. And by drowned I mean

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:25.340
that the mind gets bombarded with an excess
of input and therefore you miss something

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:38.669
that is essential for a human life to be truly
fulfilled and that is the place of peace,

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:52.850
inner peace, or stillness; the place that
one could describe as the source of all intelligence

00:08:52.850 --> 00:09:00.759
that many people don't actually don't even
realize exists within them.

00:09:00.759 --> 00:09:07.889
So I'd like to just talk briefly about that,
that really we're talking about the core of

00:09:07.889 --> 00:09:17.709
what spirituality means. Spirituality is not
having a particular belief structure, is not

00:09:17.709 --> 00:09:27.720
subscribing to a particular set of thoughts.
Spirituality is discovering, a dimension within

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:38.490
yourself, that is we can either say deeper
or higher than the continuous movement of

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.040
thinking.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:50.509
And of course all this information and knowledge
is experienced in you as thought. So the thinking

00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:57.050
mind has always been active for many thousands
of years in humans but now it's even more

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:07.710
active than before because it get energized
by the incredible increase in input. Before

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:14.379
all you had was simple, the simple sensory
input in your immediate surroundings then

00:10:14.379 --> 00:10:21.569
later came books, so you have the added input
of that. And then gradually came the mass

00:10:21.569 --> 00:10:28.360
media, and now this incredible revolution
of information technology, computers, and

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.749
so on.

00:10:29.749 --> 00:10:40.699
So it energizes that movement of thought that's
taking place in every human which in itself

00:10:40.699 --> 00:10:47.740
is not necessarily a bad thing. It only becomes
a bad thing and self-destructive thing if

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:55.620
that is all you experience inside you in your
consciousness. If all you ever experience

00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:05.540
is that, I call it sometimes mental noise,
then you --

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:13.230
begin to derive your identity from the thoughts
in your head; what the thoughts tell you about

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:24.209
yourself, and you are trapped in that identity
that is based on identification with thinking.

00:11:24.209 --> 00:11:30.160
All spiritual teachings point to the possibility
of finding something in you that is deeper

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:37.870
than thinking; a space, a stillness that's
always there.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:48.869
And the informational, excess of information
you can only successfully deal with that if

00:11:48.869 --> 00:12:00.290
you have a balance in your consciousness between
using your mind to absorb information, to

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:09.870
put out new information, to work on the information
that you have taken in, input, if you have

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:18.990
a balance between that and something that
is deeper than thought in you.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:29.139
And really instead of giving you new knowledge
here I don't want to do that because I don't

00:12:29.139 --> 00:12:37.319
want to add to the knowledge that you're taking
in anyway, it's far more than you ever need.

00:12:37.319 --> 00:12:46.839
So instead of giving you knowledge here I'd
like to suggest that you experience at first

00:12:46.839 --> 00:12:59.519
hand in yourself that place of, I call it
sometimes a presence, where you are alert,

00:12:59.519 --> 00:13:01.350
conscious, but not

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:05.880
thinking.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:13.550
And every creative person has some access
to that realm. If you have a truly creative

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:20.410
insight you have to go to that place that
is deeper than analytical thinking. Analytic

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:29.220
thinking itself or processing information
is not creative. So even to find a creative,

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:36.980
a new solution to a problem in your life requires
some creative insight. So whether it's a problem

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:42.559
in your work situation or your personal life
or something that you need to build or do

00:13:42.559 --> 00:13:48.749
and you have come to a dead end or you want
to create something, whatever it is a work

00:13:48.749 --> 00:13:55.879
of art or a new system for the computer, I
don't the expressions for that, you need to

00:13:55.879 --> 00:14:03.689
go to the place where creativity arises. And
every human who brings, who is creative has

00:14:03.689 --> 00:14:08.309
some access to that even if they don't know
it.

00:14:08.309 --> 00:14:13.379
But it's not only the, it's not only the place
where creativity arises, it's also the place

00:14:13.379 --> 00:14:22.149
that gives sanity to your life to find a place
of stillness, peace, aliveness, where you're

00:14:22.149 --> 00:14:29.499
not burdened by most, a lot of the time, unnecessary
mental noise. So when you do start thinking

00:14:29.499 --> 00:14:33.410
again it actually can be more productive.

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:41.730
So where is that place? How do you find that
place? If it's there in everyone how do I

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:47.029
realize that within myself? That's really
the question.

00:14:47.029 --> 00:14:54.269
I can just suggest to you three or four entry
points into that state of consciousness and

00:14:54.269 --> 00:15:02.269
after I've done that we can carry on 
the conversation. [laughs]

00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:03.269
[laughter]

00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:11.129
A very simple entry point, and this is why
my first book is called The Power of Now,

00:15:11.129 --> 00:15:21.920
is the realization that your entire life consists
of the present moment and only the present

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.800
moment ever.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:31.149
Now most people perhaps they in some abstract
way they know that but they cannot sense or

00:15:31.149 --> 00:15:37.730
feel the truth of that and I'd like to invite
you to actually sense and feel the truth of

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:42.939
what I'm saying which not, even if there's
a great philosopher here he cannot possibly

00:15:42.939 --> 00:15:52.369
argue, he or she cannot argue with this statement
that whatever you experience ever is present

00:15:52.369 --> 00:15:59.290
moment. Your entire life unfolds in the present
moment; that's all you ever have.

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:04.620
Most people don't live as if this were true
they don't, they live as if the opposite almost

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:11.279
were true, as if the future moment were more
important always than the next one. And that,

00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:18.019
that happens because of excessive identification
with thinking because usually the thoughts

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:23.639
are about the next thing, the next and the
next or what could happen or might happen.

00:16:23.639 --> 00:16:31.829
So if you can just come to this realization,
"Well, this is all I ever have and ever experienced

00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:40.759
is this moment this is undoubtedly true, there
is nothing else ever," and at that moment

00:16:40.759 --> 00:16:52.449
when you fully realize that you can only realize
that an alertness arises in you. "Wow." You

00:16:52.449 --> 00:17:02.569
become alert to one could almost call it the
presence of the power of this moment, the

00:17:02.569 --> 00:17:11.000
power of life itself in this present moment
which consists of, yes it consists of sense

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.140
perceptions --

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:19.890
it also consists of, well, let's look what
is this present moment? This present moment

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:30.490
is this room, what we perceive here visually,
what we see, hear, , the lights, the totality

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:38.200
of the room. So let's become alert so that
we can really perceive that and be on to that

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:43.970
to which we perceive in this room. Is there
anything else about, that we could call the

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:45.210
present moment?

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:53.370
Well, if you look deeply enough, yes, there
is also the inner energy field in your body

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:58.400
that you can actually feel, that you're alive
in your legs, your arms, your feet. It's also

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:03.690
part of the present moment to sense the energy
field that pervades the physical body that's

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.810
also something you can feel.

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:13.241
So there's external sense perceptions and
there's the feeling the aliveness inside your

00:18:13.241 --> 00:18:18.310
body. And if you're totally in thinking you
can't feel that at all; you don't feel alive

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:24.820
you're only alive in the upper story of the
house, your head. The entire house you don't

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:31.890
inhabit then. [chuckles] So you inhabit, you
begin to inhabit the entire body. This becomes

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:37.130
part of your experience of the present moment
so sense perceptions yes.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:43.450
And there is an aliveness even to artificial
light 'cause you might say, "I prefer sunlight

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:51.850
okay, me too, but there's a beauty and aliveness
even to artificial light. And there's a beauty

00:18:51.850 --> 00:19:01.260
and aliveness that is usually overlooked that's
in the texture of this chair here or whatever

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.150
you're wearing and certainly the flowers.

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:09.890
And suddenly you become aware of that and
that's not all yet we're just going into the

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:18.690
present moment. So you have that externals
and you suddenly appreciate the aliveness

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:23.560
of all the things that surround you.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.590
Other people have to take acids to get there.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:29.750
[laughter]

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:32.710
So you don't need that.

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:33.710
[laughter]

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:40.300
You know with acid people sometimes they look
at a teapot and they say, "Wow --

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:41.300
[laughter]

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.080
oh my God."

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.080
[laughter]

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:48.700
But you don't need to do that just be present
and then you appreciate the beauty even of

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.510
a mass-produced teapot.

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:51.510
[laughter]

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:57.990
If it's handmade and hand painted even nicer,
but even a mass-produced teapot has a presence

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:04.240
there, it's there and it's an alive energy
field. Every physicist will tell you it's

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:10.650
not a dead teapot, its molecules and atoms
in continuous movement.

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:15.640
Everything is vitally alive and you miss that
if you're totally trapped in the mental noise

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:26.850
all the time, taking in information. Present
moment, sense perceptions. So the inner energy

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:30.770
field of the body and then what else is there
to the present moment?

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:38.490
Okay then you have to go become really alert
and the next thing that you notice about the

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:44.360
present moment is really the deeper level
of the present moment it's not something that

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:53.020
arises in your consciousness as does the table
and this room and even the inner energy field

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:59.490
of the body. These are all things, objects
that arise in your consciousness but if you

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:06.710
go deeper even into the present moment what
you encounter is the most incredible secret

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:13.270
of human life which is you encounter the fact
that --

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:20.320
at the bottom of it all you are conscious.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:28.040
There is the presence that you are without
which you couldn't perceive anything; you

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:33.710
couldn't perceive this room and you couldn't
feel the body without that consciousness that

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:41.490
you essentially are which Jesus by the way
called the light of the world. He said to

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:49.480
his Disciples, "You are the light of the world."
And these Disciples were not special people

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:54.650
they were fishermen so certainly He wasn't
telling them that they are VIPs.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:55.650
[laughter]

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:59.710
They were the opposite of VIPs. And yet he
said, "You are the light of the world." He

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:03.870
also said it about himself but he also said
it about others.

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:11.260
And so you suddenly discover that essentially
at the most essential level the essence of

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:19.160
who you are is consciousness but consciousness
isn't something you can say, "Ah, there it

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:25.320
is," because consciousness cannot become an
object to itself, it's the eternal subject,

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:33.700
the I am that I am of the Old Testament when
God is asked for His or Her name God says,

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:42.290
"I am that I am." That is the essential identity
of all beings.

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:47.400
So when we talk about the present moment we
talk about different levels of the present

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:56.170
moment from sense perceptions to the feeling
of aliveness in the inner body to the realization

00:22:56.170 --> 00:23:03.280
that ultimately what we call the present moment
and the light of consciousness are one and

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:07.280
the same because that's the thing that always
remains.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:16.770
That consciousness you can sense it as yourself
right now the presence that you are even beyond

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:27.380
physical presence and that is the alertness,
that is the realization that is sometimes

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:35.400
called awakening. And that is the place of
also of stillness where you get out of the

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:41.430
mental noise and that is the source place
of creativity, that is intelligence, that

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:47.080
is non-conceptual, its primordial intelligence.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:54.480
And if you touch that in yourself then at
first it's glimpses, it's brief realizations

00:23:54.480 --> 00:24:02.630
and then gradually integrated into your daily
life then you can live from that place, the

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:11.090
source, and be not only a more productive
human being but also a more peaceful human

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:16.860
being because then you no longer contribute
to the conflict in this world because the

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:25.130
conflict is only created by all those humans
who don't know that level in themselves; they

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:27.040
don't know who they are.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:31.570
And again, to quote Jesus again on the cross
He said, "Forgive them; they know not what

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:39.630
they do." And why do they know not what they
do? They don't know who they are essentially.

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:50.950
So this, I've talked about this in the hope
that as I'm speaking there is an experience

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:57.640
in you of really of the depths of the present
moment because the present moment, people

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:03.540
think it's present moment is what happens.
And of course because what happens changes

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:08.710
all the time people say there are many present
moments. If you look more deeply of course

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:12.220
there are not many present moments there's
only ever this present moment, there's only

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:17.350
this ever. [chuckles] So there're not many
present moments there's only the space of

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:19.470
this moment.

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:24.660
So there's what happens in it and there is
the space in which it happens and that space

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:30.400
is consciousness and that is who you are.
And when you realize that you become free

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:39.020
of the false sense of self that when your
mind tells you something about who you are

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:43.510
which has to do with your history and your
successes or your failures or what other people

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:48.530
tell you who you are, little present.

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:55.240
So that's really basically the essence of
spirituality which is very simple, but for

00:25:55.240 --> 00:26:03.200
some reason it's not taught at school. All
kinds of inessential things are taught at

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.200
school --

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.200
[laughter]

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:10.130
but what really matters, the very foundation
of human life, and it's not some belief structure.

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:15.990
I'm not saying indoctrinate, children must
believe, it's not believe at all it's an experience,

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:21.720
it's a realization. That's what needs to be
taught, that needs to be subject number one

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:28.530
at school: who am I? And everything else is
easy once you have that.

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:29.840
[laughter]

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:34.450
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: Well I'm not sure I have
any more questions.

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:36.110
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: [laughs]

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:37.110
[laughter]

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:38.110
[applause]

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:39.110
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: [laughs]

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:41.210
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: We'll press on. [laughs]

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:42.260
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: [laughs]

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:43.260
[laughter]

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:47.020
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: I wanna ask you about
the work that we do at Google. And if you

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:52.170
look at any given webpage it's almost a model
of the mind; there's all of these jumping

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:58.230
off points; you can jump to this story or
that story or Hawaii vacation or you can jump

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:04.000
around so easily. And in fact the product
I work on Google+ allows me not only to examine

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.750
the contents of my own mind but all of these
people's minds as well in a flood of a stream

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:14.260
coming at me. And I'm wondering if the real
reason you've chosen to come to Google today

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:17.300
is 'cause we're actively working against you
and [laughs] --

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.300
[laughter]

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.300
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: [laughs]

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.300
[laughter]

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:24.030
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: you've come to help us
get over that. But more seriously do you think

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:29.070
there's a place for technology and how do
you make sense of the work that we're doing

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:35.470
and how it impacts people's attention in relation
to what you just described, sort of transcending

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:37.690
the mind and going to a deeper place?

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:45.040
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: Well it's, the technology
is quite miraculous of course; in itself it's

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.711
neither good nor bad. The --

00:27:47.711 --> 00:27:59.150
I only recently, which means like two or three
years, started using it, I came to it very

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:04.660
late. I --

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:09.350
I still haven't developed an addiction to
it as many people have.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:18.050
There is incredible possibilities here with
that technology and there's also a great danger

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:27.090
with that technology. It could lead to contribute
to the awakening, and an example of that is

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:35.450
our gathering here which people can apparently
see on their screen. So this is just one example

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:47.680
of how this technology can contribute to spreading
a vital message. It goes far beyond any ideology

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:52.720
or anything like that. Same thing the work
I did with Oprah some years ago for the first

00:28:52.720 --> 00:29:00.950
time, the Webinar as they call it, went out
and the first time the whole system broke

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:06.350
down because so many people tuned in and then
second week it started to work.

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:08.640
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: We don't have that problem.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.160
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: [laughs]

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.160
[laughter]

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:19.100
So there are incredible possibilities also
for humans to connect with each other, well

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:24.940
that's another topic whether they're really
connecting as human beings. But also the fact

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:33.230
that the flow of information is no longer
monopolized by the powerful few corporations

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:40.230
but everybody can participate in that free
flow of information, having led already to

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:46.980
all these things the Arab Spring and all those
things that have been happening recently;

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:52.740
all that is potentially good.

00:29:52.740 --> 00:30:00.170
The danger of course is, and again that connects
with what I've been talking about earlier,

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:10.720
that you get more and more inundated with
information, with knowledge, with mind stuff

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:18.570
so that you more and more lose a deeper sense
of connectedness with being, with presence,

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:24.970
that deeper level that I talked about just
now. And that would then lead to increasing

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:35.730
confusion in your mind and an inability really
to create anything new anymore; you would

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:41.770
be just trapped in the mental, continuously
increasing mental noise.

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:50.100
And if you look at people in this field who
do come up with something really creative

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:56.780
that is new they all have some access to that
deeper level in themselves as I'm sure many

00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:03.650
of you have, and quite a few people don't
even know that they have access to that, it

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:12.250
just happens. They become still and they go
for a moment or a few, they go --

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:19.120
and you connect with a power inside you. You
can actually feel the power of consciousness

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:27.050
inside you as you become still. And there's
no mind movement in that it's a kind of listening

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:30.290
that opens up.

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:35.980
And then after while the mind starts working
again and it's very often then you have an

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:42.220
answer or then you have the creative solution
or some new insight. But if you don't go there

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:51.960
anymore, if you get continuously drawn only
into the noise, the mental noise, then you

00:31:51.960 --> 00:32:02.630
lose touch with your own power and you become
more and more confused. And it could easily

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:10.890
happen that what now looks like miraculous
technology could, within two generations,

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:17.300
could lead, I'm not saying that it will and
we are here now so there's hope, it could

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:22.120
lead to a complete breakdown of civilization.
[chuckles]

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:27.200
So here you have this miraculous technology
and two generations later all humans walk

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.250
around like zombies --

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:30.770
[laughter]

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:35.870
It could happen, it's an idea for a science
fiction novel perhaps, but it could happen

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:43.000
because it's neither good nor bad. If we are
not careful it could draw us in to such an

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:50.940
extent that we lose ourselves in our own creation;
that we have created something that's an old

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:58.350
mythological theme. We create a kind of entity
that becomes a monster and then our own creation

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:04.840
devours us; that could happen, it doesn't
have to happen.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:12.550
So this is I believe why I've come here as
a little warning: [laughs]

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:13.730
[laughter]

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:20.231
if you're not careful then what looks so wonderful
here could turn out to be a monster, but it

00:33:20.231 --> 00:33:28.540
doesn't have to be; it could turn into something
wonderful that contributes to the awakening

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:38.300
of humanity. We need to recognize its dangers;
the danger is that this screen that you look

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:45.100
at of course connects with your mind, it links
into your mind and then you link into the

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:53.280
collective mind on the screen and it grows
and grows, the noise grows and grows and you

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:59.250
become more and more confused and completely
uncentered.

00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:01.980
[laughter]

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:11.251
You walk around, I mean youngsters who are
so addicted to their screen, they can't give

00:34:11.251 --> 00:34:15.450
attention anymore to another human being:
to their parents or others. There's always

00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:18.060
something okay --

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:20.240
what?

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:22.429
[laughter]

00:34:22.429 --> 00:34:25.280
I have an iPhone I have to hide this here.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.560
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: [laughs]

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.660
[laughter]

00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:32.950
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: What?

00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:39.450
That's see why it's so vital for humans if
you work with your screen all the time then

00:34:39.450 --> 00:34:44.869
what do you do? You have to recognize the
danger and you have to give yourself some

00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:51.919
space many times during the day even if it's
just for one minute at a time. Give yourself

00:34:51.919 --> 00:34:59.930
space so that a balance arises between that
interaction with the screen, which is the

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:08.280
collective mind, and connectedness with being
is a way we could put it.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:16.230
So I suggest, I sometimes suggest to people
to put a flower or a potted flower next to

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:23.730
their computer screen so that from time to
time they look at that for half a minute,

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:33.330
even a few seconds, and really look or learn
to take a breath, a conscious in and out breath,

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:37.870
let's call that a mini meditation.

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:41.810
Meditation is very helpful for many people,
not for everybody. If you find it hard to

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:48.290
meditate use mini meditations; one mini meditation
is one conscious breath. What does that mean,

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:54.700
conscious breath? It means you look away from
the screen, if you can look at something natural,

00:35:54.700 --> 00:36:00.360
a plant or the sky, but if not that's fine,
look at a light, artificial light whatever

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:10.360
it is, and breathe in and follow the breath
with your attention into the body and then

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:16.760
follow it with your attention as it flows
out of the body. What does that do? It takes

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:24.030
attention away from thought and puts it into
the body. In other words, it creates a space

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:28.450
in your consciousness because while you are
following the breath with your attention you're

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:35.060
not thinking and when you're not thinking
but you haven't gone to sleep, you've created

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:42.740
a space in your consciousness and there, that's
it. So that's just one conscious breath occasionally,

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:46.590
two is even better or three, but that's fine
--

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:47.590
[laughter]

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:53.760
that's enough. And of course that's the oldest,
one of the oldest forms of meditation is conscious

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:59.850
breaths, probably already recommended by the
Buddha who is supposed to have said, "Just

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:06.140
be conscious of your breaths for one hour
and you'll be totally enlightened." But if

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:10.900
you miss just one you have to go back to the
beginning.

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:12.240
[laughter]

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:17.830
And feeling the inner body, if you don't have,
nature is very helpful to take you out of

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:23.280
your mind although many people walk around
nature and they're still in their minds, but

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:30.030
if you can interact with the natural world:
the trees, the park, the beach, the mountain,

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:37.280
the forest walking occasionally and pay attention,
truly pay attention to what you see without

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:42.640
interpreting, that can bring you into connectedness
with being and into the present moment.

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:48.311
Your dog, wonderful thing I noticed here is
people are allowed to bring their dogs. That

00:37:48.311 --> 00:37:54.240
makes an enormous difference to the energy
field, not to every home and to the company

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:59.040
when you interact with a dog there's a moment
when you're not actually thinking that's why

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:02.390
it feels so good because you know the dog
is not thinking about you.

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:04.110
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: [laughs]

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:05.110
[laughter]

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:06.400
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: [laughs]

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:10.360
Although you might have heard the saying,
"Please, God, make me into the person that

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.580
my dog thinks I am."

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:12.580
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: [laughs]

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:13.580
[laughter]

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:14.580
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: The fact is the dog isn't
thinking --

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:15.580
[laughter]

00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:20.991
that's why the dog relates to you with unconditional
love because a dog doesn't judge you and you

00:38:20.991 --> 00:38:26.770
know that the dog doesn't judge you and therefore
the dog does not stimulate your thinking mind,

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:30.330
it actually frees you for a moment from your
thinking mind.

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:36.410
That's why people love, many people unless
you have a phobia that's a different matter,

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:41.430
most people love interacting with a dog, cats
also, but let's talk about dogs because they're

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:43.550
here in the company.

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:49.800
So when you pet a dog or even just look at
a dog and their tail wags there's something

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:55.869
liberating there for a moment and that's why
humans respond to the dog and you go, "Ah."

00:38:55.869 --> 00:39:00.221
If you look very closely inside yourself at
that moment, there's a moment when you're

00:39:00.221 --> 00:39:07.100
not thinking when you're interacting with
a dog, unless you're so obsessed with your

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:08.770
mind that you immediately judge the dog.

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:09.960
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: [laughs]

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:10.960
[laughter]

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:11.960
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: That can happen too --

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:12.960
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: [laughs]

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:13.960
[laughter]

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:16.560
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: I've met people like that.
But for most people, it's a liberating thing

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:24.080
because the dog is nature; in its beauty and
aliveness has not arrived yet at the stage

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:33.200
of thought that humans have had to go through
so you experience that aliveness of nature

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.340
in the dog.

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:41.890
So okay you have that and if you don't have
a dog that's fine too, you can feel nature

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:48.670
as the inner energy field in your body, and
you can even practice on the computer screen.

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:54.530
While you're looking at something, see if
you can be in two dimensions at the same time:

00:39:54.530 --> 00:40:02.210
while you are looking, don't do it at first
with something extremely demanding, but just

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:07.700
when there's something kind of routine thing
you're checking on the screen, and see if

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:13.240
while you're looking you can feel the inner
energy field of your body as you do perhaps

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:17.400
now in the background so to speak.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:22.200
I recommend it as a kind of meditation; you
can practice it when the screen, nothing's

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:28.140
happening on the screen first or put a flower
on the screen [chuckles] and look at that

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:33.450
and see if you can at the same time feel the
aliveness in your energy field that keeps

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:39.960
you rooted in being and then you don't lose
yourself totally in the collective minds that

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:44.160
comes at your through the screen.

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:49.090
That's a beautiful, I highly recommend that;
put a little reminder on your computer screen,

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:55.020
a little thing that says, "Inner body," or
whatever else you want to call it so that

00:40:55.020 --> 00:41:03.130
you remember and you will find you're more
energized, it's extremely energizing to sense

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:10.200
that, to be connected with that. So one could
call that the balance between doing and being

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:16.900
in your life because thinking is part of doing;
doing is not just what you do physically,

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:25.700
doing, thinking is also a kind of doing but
the human needs the two dimensions being and

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:32.710
doing and if balance is lost you could lose
it in being but that's not the danger of our

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:35.780
civilization.

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:40.590
There may be some Indian yogis who get lost
in being and don't want to get up anymore

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:45.730
because they're so happy in being that there's
no need to get up anymore even put food in

00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:49.630
their mouths, that's fine. I'm not talking
to them, I would have to have a different

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:50.980
message for them.

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:51.980
[laughter]

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:59.290
But I'm talking to this civilization people
who are lost or who get too much doing, which

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:08.070
really is thinking, there the balance is between
being and doing, doesn't have to be 50/50,

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:13.300
20 percent [chuckles] it's hard put a figure
to it but --

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:14.420
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: We like to measure things.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:15.420
[laughter]

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:16.869
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: I know, yeah.

00:42:16.869 --> 00:42:17.869
[laughter]

00:42:17.869 --> 00:42:22.340
So 25 percent being, 75 percent doing and
you're doing very well.

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:23.690
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: [laughs]

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:32.210
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: Even 10 percent being would
make your life much easier and much more enjoyable.

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:39.120
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: I wanna remind the Googlers
this dual presence technique of being and

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:43.870
doing, please don't do that while coding on
the GFS, BigTable, or Megastore systems.

00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:44.870
[laughter]

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:47.250
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: I don't know what you're
talking about.

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:48.400
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: Inside joke.

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:49.400
[laughter]

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.400
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: [laughs]

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:53.480
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: I do have a question:
you've talked, I think most of us are engineers

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:58.130
and technologists and we live a lot in the
realm of thoughts and ideas and in our head

00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:03.869
and not necessarily in our being. My wife
has also described to me these things called

00:43:03.869 --> 00:43:04.869
feelings --

00:43:04.869 --> 00:43:05.869
[laughter]

00:43:05.869 --> 00:43:11.130
that some people have as well. [chuckles]
Could you speak about feelings of anger and

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:15.950
frustration and happiness and how they relate
to this experience of being?

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:22.930
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: Yes. Sometimes words are
used in a loose way and sometimes what I just

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:28.730
described, I sometimes call it feeling the
inner body, that word is a very vague word

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:33.930
so it can be used to describe what we were
just talking about, feeling the inner body.

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:38.240
But then there's a different kind of feeling
and that's feeling an emotion for example

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:46.300
that arises. So there's basically there's
thoughts, let's look at your entire life,

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:58.440
your entire life consists of basically sense
perceptions, thoughts, and emotions. I think

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:04.240
that's about it, right? Sense perceptions,
thoughts, emotions put them together and mix

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:08.100
them up, that's my life.

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:09.250
[laughter]

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:15.020
Okay. So that applies to everybody. Now the
particular mixture differs from person to

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:22.600
person. What exactly goes into the sense perceptions
and the thoughts and emotions varies slightly

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:26.480
from person to person, but basically that's
the mixture.

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:36.240
Now the question is you can't escape that
of course that's normal life. Is there anything

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:44.850
else? Sense perceptions, thoughts, emotions,
okay, let's see; there must be something else

00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:53.790
because how do I know that there's sense perceptions,
thoughts, and emotions? Is the ability to

00:44:53.790 --> 00:45:01.420
recognize, to have a sense perception based
on thinking? No, because to have a sense perception

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:07.570
you don't really need to think you can just
look and see.

00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:19.869
So what else is there and this is a key thing,
there is something else about sense perceptions,

00:45:19.869 --> 00:45:29.250
thoughts, and emotions which is we could call
it an awareness that there is a sense perception,

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:39.320
there is an emotion, there is a thought and
that is, we could call that pure consciousness.

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:43.119
Otherwise, how could you have a sense perception?

00:45:43.119 --> 00:45:48.200
So there is something there that enables sense
perceptions to be there, that enables a thought

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:55.700
to be there, that enables an emotion to be
there and that is the thing that in most humans

00:45:55.700 --> 00:46:03.450
is hidden, in order words, they don't know
it's there [chuckles] because that is presence

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:09.290
which we could also call consciousness, which
we could also call awareness.

00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:14.890
And that is the spiritual dimension and that
is the awakening once you realize that that

00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:22.440
is there, we could also describe that as the
space for all those other things.

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:29.119
So let's say, let's compare this room to your
consciousness and then we say, "Okay, there's

00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:35.980
the furniture in the room, there's the bodies
in the room, and there are the other lights

00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:42.990
in this room; those things are in this room.
So if I asked you to describe the room you

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:48.230
would probably describe it in terms of the
furniture in it, the walls, the ceiling, whatever

00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:52.390
you see. Yet, when you describe that room
you would miss the most essential thing about

00:46:52.390 --> 00:47:01.940
this room because it's so obvious that you
miss it which is the space that really is

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:06.290
the essence of this room isn't the walls or
the ceiling or the floor, the furniture or

00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:11.820
the bodies in this room; the essence of this
room is the space in this room. [chuckles]

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:17.600
But space is not something tangible that you
can say, "Ah there it is." Where?

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:23.220
And the same thing applies to inside. The
space of consciousness is the very thing that

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:31.450
enables everything else to be but it's very
much like the fish in water that says, "Why

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:37.990
are you always talking about water, you haven't
shown it to me yet," says one fish to the

00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:39.849
other. The other fish is a spiritual teacher.

00:47:39.849 --> 00:47:40.849
[laughter]

00:47:40.849 --> 00:47:47.119
"So what water are you talking about? Where?
What water?" And of course you can't, it's

00:47:47.119 --> 00:47:53.000
everywhere; it's inside you, it's outside
you. [chuckles] But the amazing thing is you

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:59.320
can be aware of it but not as an object but
as the awareness itself.

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:01.520
"Ah.

00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:10.500
I got it now, I got it." But you can't say
what it is. You can't say, "There it is."

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:15.920
That reminds me of something I read in the
New Testament where He said, "The Kingdom

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:27.471
of Heaven does not come with signs to be perceived.
You cannot say, 'It's over here,' or 'It's

00:48:27.471 --> 00:48:35.750
over there.' But truly I tell you the Kingdom
of heaven is within you." Somebody said that

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:44.280
2,000 years ago, but very few people in the
churches understand the depth of it. [chuckles]

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:54.280
It gets completely misinterpreted. [chuckles]
But that's the deepest spiritual teaching.

00:48:54.280 --> 00:49:01.940
Now that Kingdom of Heaven, that's spaciousness
that's in you, it cannot be observed as if

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:08.930
it were a chair because it is the observing
agent, it is that which makes all observation

00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:13.970
possible. So it cannot become an object to
itself because it is the eternal subject,

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:21.369
the I; consciousness itself, the light of
the source you could call it; the light of

00:49:21.369 --> 00:49:29.300
God, the light of the One. The ancient Greek
philosopher called it the One.

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:38.940
It's a beautiful term. And the Buddha didn't
call it anything because he said, "If I call

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:45.040
it something people will make it into some
idol, so better not call it anything." So

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:53.180
when they asked the Buddha, "What about God?"
What they say when he was asked that question

00:49:53.180 --> 00:50:00.940
he kept noble silence. And of course then
noble silence itself is the state of presence.

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:08.269
So they asked the Buddha, "Tell us about God."
And he went --

00:50:08.269 --> 00:50:11.119
And that's the answer. [laughs]

00:50:11.119 --> 00:50:12.330
[laughter]

00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:19.840
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: So you've given us some
clues on how to explore this within ourselves.

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:26.369
You mentioned changing the balance and things
we could do with the breath and a note on

00:50:26.369 --> 00:50:32.430
our computer monitor and looking at nature,
these are some very practical suggestions.

00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:38.820
I often find for myself that the time when
I would probably most benefit from connecting

00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:44.580
to that part of myself is the time when I'm
least able to. It's the time when I'm very

00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:51.790
activated and I'm either emotional about something
or lost in thought or in the heat of the moment.

00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:58.470
Do you have any suggestions for how to sort
of find that even in the midst of these sort

00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:02.130
of challenges that come along throughout life?

00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:08.160
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: First I recommend that you
practice when you're not being challenged

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:13.170
because if you can't do it then, then when
you're being challenged it's impossible. So

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:17.790
first you practice when you're relatively
undisturbed and there's a moment after getting

00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:24.280
up or you take a short break in your normal
daily routine or several short breaks, one

00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:27.520
minute breaks, half minute breaks.

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:32.340
So when you're not being challenged then you
bring in that awareness, you become the awareness,

00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:39.180
you go into the present moment perhaps as
I described just now starting with sense perceptions;

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:45.420
become alert. An alertness is required to
truly perceive things, and immediately things

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:51.810
become more alive and less problematic when
you go into sense perception because the problematic

00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:57.750
dimension is in the head. And you go into
sense perception suddenly you have into the

00:51:57.750 --> 00:52:06.210
present moment and in the present moment problems
disappear. Isn't that strange? The mind says,

00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:13.300
"Well, I still have them." Yeah, when you
start thinking about them you have them again.

00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:18.900
But when you're not thinking about them you
have no problems. Now some of you will argue

00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:23.270
with that but let me explain.

00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:28.140
You have situations in your life that can
be challenging and you have to deal with these

00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:33.450
situations but the only place where you can
deal the challenging situations is in the

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:40.540
present moment. And dealing with a challenging
situation in the present moment is not a problem,

00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:45.840
you're dealing with a challenging situation,
you're facing it, you're looking at it, and

00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:51.160
that looking is important what I call looking
really is putting your attention on it which

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:56.900
is the power of consciousness. And while you're
looking, you're not thinking.

00:52:56.900 --> 00:53:05.359
Every person who has achieved mastery in any
field knows what I mean by looking because

00:53:05.359 --> 00:53:13.440
there's an absolute presence and then that
person does what he or she does. It flows

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:20.390
from that presence. So you look, there's no
problem; problem is when you dwell mentally

00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:25.980
on something that will happen, could happen,
might happen; a problem is something I have

00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:32.600
to face next week but not now and you're totally
absorbed in that, that's problem.

00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:38.750
An interesting thing I may have even written
that in The Power of Now, if you think you

00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:44.930
have problems ask yourself, "What problem
do I have at this moment?" But this moment

00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:53.670
really means this moment. And then you have
to go, "Hum, well I've got my wife, my ex-wife

00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:59.020
is suing me, I'm about to lose my home, uh
--

00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:09.599
a person close to me is ill, I might lose
my job, I have to look for a new job." Okay

00:54:09.599 --> 00:54:13.610
what problem do you have at this moment?

00:54:13.610 --> 00:54:23.609
You're breathing, feeling the aliveness in
the body, looking around, well at this moment

00:54:23.609 --> 00:54:29.620
I don't actually have a problem. You have
to then admit, if you really go into the present

00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:36.820
moment the problem cannot survive in the present
moment. [chuckles] That's an amazing realization.

00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:41.140
Doesn't mean that you no longer deal with
what you need to deal with, you deal with

00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:48.369
it when the moment comes more effectively
when you don't waste your life energy in the

00:54:48.369 --> 00:54:53.490
mental realm of creating problems that you
cannot be dealt with at this moment.

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:57.570
And if you wake up in the middle of the might
thinking about your problems and what you

00:54:57.570 --> 00:55:03.170
can do about them it's extremely unlikely
that you find any solution by worrying at

00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:08.770
four o'clock in the morning about it. But
if you became still at four o'clock in the

00:55:08.770 --> 00:55:12.770
morning and wake up and go into the inner
energy field of the body rather than thinking

00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:18.020
about your problems, in other words, leave
the dimension of problems, come deeply into

00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:24.410
the present moment, then perhaps the next
morning when you wake up you suddenly say,

00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:29.710
"Oh I know what I have to do now. I know how
I can deal with it now." And the right course

00:55:29.710 --> 00:55:35.550
of action happens because you've gone there
but not through the problem making faculty

00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:38.080
in the human mind.

00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:46.230
So again coming back to your question when
things are, when you're not being challenged

00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:54.680
practice it and then when you are being challenged
by little things that goes wrong so to speak

00:55:54.680 --> 00:56:00.650
in daily life tends to happen, you might have
noticed things don't always go according to

00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:08.010
your expectations, sometimes you miss the
bus or something you miss the plane or something

00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:15.970
else goes wrong, it tends to happen actually
quite a lot; it seems to be part of life.

00:56:15.970 --> 00:56:21.890
By the way it's the reason why people go to
see movies because the substructure of every

00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:28.680
movie that you see we could call it, it applies
to virtually every movie you see if you can

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:34.180
examine any movie you see what actually happens
in the movie, in fact I can describe every

00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:40.380
movie to you in three words, "Something goes
wrong."

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:41.920
[laughter]

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:45.140
[chuckles] Because there wouldn't be a movie
otherwise,

00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:46.140
[laughter]

00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:51.420
nothing would happen. Nobody would evolve,
everything would be dead.

00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:56.910
But in your own life you complain so you see
movies to see something go wrong but when

00:56:56.910 --> 00:57:01.040
it happens in your own life you complain,
not you personally you've transcended it perhaps

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.040
already --

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:04.560
[laughter]

00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:12.380
but so the strange thing is things are not
meant not to go wrong; going wrong is part

00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:20.790
of the totality of how life experiences itself.
If things didn't go wrong it would be very

00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:26.170
uninteresting and nobody would evolve because
people only evolve through the challenges

00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:28.020
that they encounter.

00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:36.910
And in a good movie the protagonist or the
character changes as he or she faces that

00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:44.790
which goes wrong in the movie. In a bad movie
the character does not go through any changes,

00:57:44.790 --> 00:57:49.560
that which goes wrong is only solved on an
external level, in the end the bad guy is

00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:54.390
killed and that's the end of the movie but
nothing else happens. [chuckles]

00:57:54.390 --> 00:58:03.230
So something going wrong is part of how life
experiences itself. And again you can then

00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:11.280
bring awareness to that so that you don't
always fall into reactivity when something

00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:16.720
goes wrong, but you immediately align with
it.

00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:27.410
Or when people behave in a way that you find
offensive or they behave in a way that they

00:58:27.410 --> 00:58:32.330
create difficulties for you because you wanted
this and they want something else, you don't

00:58:32.330 --> 00:58:39.250
have to go into hostility or opposition. You
can immediately say, "Oh that seems to me,

00:58:39.250 --> 00:58:47.950
this is what is and then how can I approach
that without the negativity and just accept

00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:55.900
that something has gone wrong?" It's not wrong
at all, it's called life. [chuckles] So, something

00:58:55.900 --> 00:59:01.450
going wrong really what it means is it's called
life.

00:59:01.450 --> 00:59:08.820
So you welcome every little challenge so it's
a shift in attitude and then your practice

00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:15.589
becomes easier when you see you can almost,
almost welcome when things happen --

00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:16.589
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: [chuckles]

00:59:16.589 --> 00:59:22.790
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: that before you called things
going wrong; little things and later big things.

00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:29.010
"Oh okay." And then you evolve just as a character
in a good movie.

00:59:29.010 --> 00:59:33.740
I gave a talk, I'm talking about this now
because a week ago I was in L.A. and I gave

00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:40.349
a talk about transformational movies bringing
consciousness into the movie industry. I gave

00:59:40.349 --> 00:59:49.060
as an example two movies by Clint Eastwood:
an early one I think it was called Dirty Harry

00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:53.500
and that's the, oh that's a very entertaining
movie, it's quite satisfying to watch because

00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:58.980
the bad guy gets killed in the end, nevertheless
it's not a transformational movie. In the

00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:04.349
end you might remember the memorable lines,
"Make my day," --

01:00:04.349 --> 01:00:05.349
[laughter]

01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:11.560
when he is about to shoot the bad guy, "Make
my day, punk." And that's the most satisfying

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:14.790
moment in the movie for the viewer.

01:00:14.790 --> 01:00:15.790
[laughter]

01:00:15.790 --> 01:00:20.910
Not a transformational but entertaining movie.
And then many 30 years later Clint Eastwood

01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:27.690
made a movie again about bad guys and that
movie was called Gran Torino. If you haven't

01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:33.680
seen it I recommend that you see it. And that
perhaps shows a shift in his own evolution,

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:42.360
because again we are faced with bad guys but
how that is resolved in the end is very different

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:47.109
from the early movie. I'm not telling you
how here because if you haven't seen it, you

01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:54.950
want to experience it for yourself. So that's
transformational: Gran Torino. It's the same

01:00:54.950 --> 01:01:00.849
actor and I think Clint Eastwood directed
the Gran Torino one that probably shows his

01:01:00.849 --> 01:01:06.250
own evolution of his own consciousness from
the early stage to the later stage. But here

01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:12.130
this really is a reflection of life --

01:01:12.130 --> 01:01:22.190
you can resist continuously life or you can
internally align yourself with life so that

01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:27.200
your life becomes a good movie rather than
a bad movie. [chuckles]

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:33.490
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: So if there's hope for
the movie industry there's certainly hope

01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:34.490
for us I think.

01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:35.490
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: [laughs]

01:01:35.490 --> 01:01:36.490
[laughter]

01:01:36.490 --> 01:01:39.660
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: So we're gonna take the
time we have left and take questions both

01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:45.720
from the Google Moderator online system as
well as live in the room here. There is one

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:55.100
mic in the center and so if you have a question
you can approach that mic, and if the technicians

01:01:55.100 --> 01:02:01.700
could get the Google Moderator questions up
on the monitor here too that would be helpful.

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:06.380
And why don't you introduce yourself and maybe
what you do at Google and then ask the question.

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:11.540
&gt;&gt;Unika: Sure. My name is Unika and I do marketing
so I'm one of the, you mentioned there's lots

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:15.760
of engineers, I'm one of those people that
agrees with you and all those codes and terms

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.510
you mentioned I have no clue what you meant
earlier.

01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:18.510
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: [chuckles]

01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:22.079
&gt;&gt;Female #1: So I just wanted to know about
your journey. You had explained a little bit

01:02:22.079 --> 01:02:27.500
in The Power of Now about the nightmare waking
up when you were 29, 30 and I just would love

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:31.280
to hear about it. How you went from that state
of anxiety into where you are right now.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:40.870
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: Well as I, for most people
the shift is a gradual process from one state

01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:47.400
of consciousness to another and occasionally
it happens in some people as it happened to

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:55.290
me that it happened virtually overnight, the
shift from one state of consciousness to another.

01:02:55.290 --> 01:03:02.260
And I was deeply depressed for many years
and close to suicide several times and that

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:08.790
night as I describe in The Power of Now at
the beginning, I dis-identified from the thinking

01:03:08.790 --> 01:03:16.200
mind. I didn't know that that was what was
happening, it just happened. "I can't live

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:22.970
with myself any longer," I thought, "It's
so dreadful; I can't live with myself any

01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:29.119
longer." And then suddenly an awareness came
in, I didn't know it was called awareness,

01:03:29.119 --> 01:03:36.700
an awareness came in and looked at the thought
and the thought seemed suddenly looked very

01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:42.730
strange; the thought seemed to consist of
two people, I and myself. [chuckles] "I can't

01:03:42.730 --> 01:03:52.030
live with myself." So then another thought
came, "Am I one or two and who am I and who

01:03:52.030 --> 01:03:55.270
is that self that I can't live with?"

01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:58.910
That's almost a Zen-like question.

01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:59.910
[laughter]

01:03:59.910 --> 01:04:06.481
And like all Zen questions, it didn't really
have an answer on the conceptual level. So

01:04:06.481 --> 01:04:13.430
on the conceptual level, I didn't get an answer
but the answer was that the myself and the

01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:19.020
I suddenly separated. And I realized, although
I couldn't have explained it then, that the

01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:26.550
myself was a mind-created entity, the me,
the poor little unhappy me, it was consisted

01:04:26.550 --> 01:04:33.660
of mind movement, and identity, a mental identity
of an unhappy human being with an unhappy

01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:40.200
history and a very uncertain future. That
probably applies to many humans, not if you

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:42.550
work at Google, but --

01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:43.580
[laughter]

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:51.230
There was a separation and what was, there
was an I suddenly that saw that and that I

01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:57.150
years later I realized what that I was, it
was consciousness itself.

01:04:57.150 --> 01:05:04.930
So before there was consciousness and thinking
forming a unity; my consciousness was trapped

01:05:04.930 --> 01:05:11.950
in my thinking. Through the suffering at that
night and looking at that sentence the consciousness

01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:17.089
separated itself from the movement of thinking
and the self that I couldn't live with was

01:05:17.089 --> 01:05:24.400
not being sustained anymore by consciousness
and it kind of crumbled. That was a false

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:30.020
self that crumbled and what was left was simply
a space of awareness.

01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:34.829
And the next morning I felt very peaceful,
never felt that peaceful before, nothing had

01:05:34.829 --> 01:05:41.320
changed in my environment and I couldn't understand
it. It took probably at least three, four

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:46.440
years before I could begin to understand what
had happened. All I realized I'm suddenly

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:50.849
so peaceful, the whole world is peaceful,
what's happened? [chuckles]

01:05:50.849 --> 01:05:58.320
So the mind itself had dissolved and later
I talked to some Buddhist monks and others

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:04.350
and through listening to them I realized when
they talked about the teaching of the Buddha,

01:06:04.350 --> 01:06:10.550
later I also realized that Jesus was talking
about the same thing, but I realized the Buddha

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:18.349
talked about the delusional self, the unreality
of the self, that the self is not real as

01:06:18.349 --> 01:06:27.460
it's called, he taught there is no self really.
Anatta is the word in the Pali language in

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:33.040
the Buddhist teaching; it's an illusion that
self is an illusion. And so when I talked

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:39.130
to Buddhist monks I began to realize, it was
three years later, "Oh that must be what happened,

01:06:39.130 --> 01:06:43.890
this must be why I feel so peaceful." [chuckles]

01:06:43.890 --> 01:06:49.810
So understanding came much later, it kind
of just happened. And then it became a teaching.

01:06:49.810 --> 01:06:56.240
So I'm now showing to people this is something
that you can, that can happen in your life.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:02.940
But for most people it's a gradual process
of dis-identification from the thinking mind

01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:07.740
which doesn't mean you don't think anymore;
it just means your identity or your self is

01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:14.990
isn't trapped in it so the thinking is free
of self and it's very liberating. And you,

01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:22.480
essentially, who you feel yourself to be and
who I feel myself to be is not to do with

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:29.990
the physical form or my personal history or
what I have achieved in life, fortunately,

01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:35.220
because otherwise you get unhappy.

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:39.910
For many years, before I wrote The Power of
Now and it became successful, I was basically

01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:46.820
a failure [chuckles] in the eyes of the world.
So he's already almost 50 and what has he

01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:52.110
achieved? My Mom said, "You have thrown away
your life. You had so many possibilities in

01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:59.060
your life. You walked out of graduate school
in Cambridge. Why did you walk out of there?"

01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:04.620
My Mom and many other people said, "This person
has failed in life; he has no job, he has

01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:07.000
no insurance policies --

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
[laughter]

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.070
nothing; no pension plan --

01:08:10.070 --> 01:08:11.110
[laughter]

01:08:11.110 --> 01:08:15.740
just almost nothing in the bank. Failure"

01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:21.630
And then a few years later as people bought
The Power of Now and became a bestseller,

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:23.140
"Oh, a big success."

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:30.540
Okay, if I had derived my identity at that
time from what the world was telling me or

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:35.969
my mind would have told me if I had been listening
to my mind, I would have been very unhappy

01:08:35.969 --> 01:08:43.130
and I didn't so I was fine because my identity
wasn't derived from that anymore.

01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:49.640
And fortunately even when in the eyes of the
world I suddenly became a success I don't

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:57.549
want to derive my identity from that, it's
a cheap substitute for who I really am. So

01:08:57.549 --> 01:09:06.469
I don't see, I don't derive, the satisfaction
that comes is the satisfaction that the work

01:09:06.469 --> 01:09:12.330
that's happening, the teaching that's happening
is transforming people's lives; that's very

01:09:12.330 --> 01:09:18.410
satisfying. I don't get any personal satisfaction
though because I don't feel it as this separate

01:09:18.410 --> 01:09:19.920
me produced it.

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:21.819
&gt;&gt;female #1: Thank you.

01:09:21.819 --> 01:09:23.239
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: Thanks.

01:09:23.239 --> 01:09:26.920
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: I have a question about
that. You mentioned for you the transformation

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:32.469
came quite suddenly and for others it happens
more gradually. Do you have any sense of why

01:09:32.469 --> 01:09:37.130
that is? Is it because you had bottomed out
and were having these feelings or is it because

01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:39.690
of a certain ripeness that had brought you
to that moment or --

01:09:39.690 --> 01:09:40.690
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: Yes.

01:09:40.690 --> 01:09:41.690
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: is it just inexplicable?

01:09:41.690 --> 01:09:45.620
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: I don't have the answer to
that. I don't know why some people have said,

01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:52.460
"Well, it must have something to do with past
lifetimes," maybe, or whatever it is but I

01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:56.620
don't have, or maybe I suffered more deeply
than others, I don't know. I think there are

01:09:56.620 --> 01:10:00.980
many people who suffered deeply so I don't
have the answer to that.

01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:01.980
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: Thank you.

01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:06.910
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: I'm quoting the Dalai Lama
who loves saying, "I don't know."

01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:08.490
[laughter]

01:10:08.490 --> 01:10:15.510
But usually after he says that he starts talking
and then the answer's actually quite meaningful.

01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:16.510
[laughter]

01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:23.590
But the wonderful thing is, really what he's
starting with is a space, "I don't know."

01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:24.880
And then something comes.

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:25.880
[laughter]

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:29.380
But he doesn't say, "Yeah, I know."

01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:38.570
Probably Socrates, if you have read any Plato,
ancient Greek philosophy, Socrates also taught

01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:45.220
in that way. Although in Plato, perhaps I'm
only talking to a few people here, [chuckles]

01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:53.280
in Plato, Socrates, the way he teaches is,
he continuously when reported by Plato he

01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:58.989
teaches as if he didn't know. So he asks these
questions, people ask him a question then

01:10:58.989 --> 01:11:04.420
he asks, "Well, what do you think, how is
this?" In Plato, Socrates pretends not to

01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:10.610
know but I believe the real Socrates, who
never wrote anything, the real Socrates actually

01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:15.820
came from that place of not knowing but that
was misinterpreted by Plato as if Socrates

01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:21.540
were pretending not to know. But let's not
go into deeply into that.

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:22.540
[laughter]

01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:23.540
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Hello.

01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:24.920
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: Hello.

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:28.790
&gt;&gt;Mary: My name's Mary, I work in HR.

01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:32.590
So here at Google they have this really wonderful
class called Search Inside Yourself, created

01:11:32.590 --> 01:11:36.670
by Meng, whom I believe you met with. And
yesterday was our last class and we talked

01:11:36.670 --> 01:11:43.239
about compassion and having compassion for
the world. So I work in HR so all us HR people

01:11:43.239 --> 01:11:47.120
have lots of compassion for other people because
it's our job.

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.120
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: [chuckles]

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:52.180
&gt;&gt;Mary: [laughs] But we also work at Google
and Googlers are sort of a high achieving

01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:57.120
bunch. Not only high achieving in the eyes
of the world but high achieving to ourselves,

01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:01.350
meaning did I get up out of bed today and
what did I accomplish? If I didn't accomplish

01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:05.890
anything I'm a failure to myself. So I was
wondering if you had any advice for those

01:12:05.890 --> 01:12:09.750
of us who don't have as much compassion for
ourselves?

01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:13.270
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: Okay, thanks.

01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:21.610
Well, yes, compassion for yourself of course
is as important as compassion for others.

01:12:21.610 --> 01:12:28.130
Often I get asked questions like people who
did something that they now realize was deeply

01:12:28.130 --> 01:12:33.980
wrong in the past, sometimes people ask questions
about they brought up their children in a

01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:41.180
way that they now realize was not very conscious,
and so they may have caused suffering to their

01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:46.660
children or other people find they have caused
suffering to loved ones and they now realize

01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:52.469
that what they did was wrong. And again, I
say, this is an example where you need to

01:12:52.469 --> 01:12:58.920
be compassionate with yourself because no
human being can act beyond their level of

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:06.640
consciousness; so that was your level of consciousness
at the time and you could not go beyond that.

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:15.300
And again here to make demands upon yourself
up to a point it might be a good thing as

01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:21.830
long as you enjoy it, it's a wonderful thing.
When the enjoyment of what you're doing is

01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:28.010
lost then you have to be careful because there
you have to come to a stop and say, "Okay

01:13:28.010 --> 01:13:35.000
there's something here that's not right because
I'm no longer enjoying what I'm doing." That

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:44.400
really, that's the danger and so as long as
you enjoy you don't even need compassion.

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:56.230
Some people have a very active mind, maybe
that's what Freud called the super ego or

01:13:56.230 --> 01:14:03.030
some other entity that criticizes you. Some
people have a particular function in their

01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:11.730
minds that's very critical of themselves.
[chuckles] Perhaps everybody has it to some

01:14:11.730 --> 01:14:18.880
degree but some people have it to a high degree
and that's a dreadful thing to live with;

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:25.800
living with a voice in your head that continually
criticizes you and tells you, "You haven't

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:31.480
done well enough, you're not good enough,
you should have done better." I mean if you

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:34.330
had to live with a person like that you would
leave.

01:14:34.330 --> 01:14:35.330
[laughter]

01:14:35.330 --> 01:14:41.180
I mean it would be horrible to live with a
person who continuously tells you these things

01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:45.160
but if that thing is stuck in your head what
can you do?

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:46.210
[laughter]

01:14:46.210 --> 01:14:53.500
Now what you can do is to become aware that
all that it is it's a particular pattern in

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:59.460
your mind, it's a particular way in which
your mind works. And so you could call it

01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:07.380
a sub personality but what it really is it's
a mind pattern that operates in you and when

01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:14.390
you bring awareness to it you can recognize
it as a mind pattern in you. In other words

01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:21.710
you no longer believe every thought that arises
that it says; you recognize it's an old pattern

01:15:21.710 --> 01:15:28.140
that says the same thing that it said five
years ago or ten years ago and it says that

01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:30.880
all the time and you recognize it.

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:36.250
In order words, you're not trapped in the
thoughts anymore, this is again the whole

01:15:36.250 --> 01:15:42.560
thing we are talking about, you don't believe
in every thought that comes into your head.

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:48.040
What that really means is there's an awareness
beyond the thought and you realize there's

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:54.430
the voice in my head saying this again, that's
all it is. And when you don't energize it

01:15:54.430 --> 01:16:02.980
with your identification it begins to subside.
In this way you become free of this dreadful

01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:09.030
burden of having that thing in your head talking
to you and making your life miserable.

01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:15.500
But what matters is the awareness needs to
be there that frees you because then you become

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:21.260
the awareness rather than being the thought
or being trapped in the thought or possessed

01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:23.360
by the thought.

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:28.670
Again there's a movie that many of you have
probably seen called A Beautiful Mind; it's

01:16:28.670 --> 01:16:34.469
about the scientist, it's actually based on
a real person what happened to him, quite

01:16:34.469 --> 01:16:42.710
a genius in his field but he developed delusions,
he saw people that weren't there, whatever

01:16:42.710 --> 01:16:46.320
it's called clinically schizophrenia whatever.

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:53.510
And the great thing about the movie is the
viewer up to the point where the protagonists

01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:58.670
realizes that these things are illusions the
viewer of the movie doesn't know it either;

01:16:58.670 --> 01:17:04.510
the viewer participates in the illusions of
the protagonist, he believes these people

01:17:04.510 --> 01:17:12.110
are real too until suddenly the protagonist
realizes, "Oh my God, I'm seeing things that

01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:19.489
are not there," and then he continues to see
these things but suddenly there's an awareness

01:17:19.489 --> 01:17:21.180
in him.

01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:27.450
And so although these people still appear
to him that are not really there there's an

01:17:27.450 --> 01:17:32.870
awareness in him there that he's no longer
totally reactive to them, he doesn't feed

01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:39.280
them with his reaction and gradually they
subside over years, it takes years for them

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:45.320
to subside. But the decisive point is, although
the word is never mentioned, the decisive

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:48.060
point is the awareness, "Wow."

01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:56.180
And that's the same thing that applies to
any pattern in the human mind not just a totally

01:17:56.180 --> 01:18:05.800
insane pattern; bring awareness to it so that
you're not tortured by that. And real compassion

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:09.410
always arises out of awareness anyway. Yeah.

01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:15.860
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: My childhood violin teacher
used to shake his finger at me and say, "You

01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:16.950
hear but you don't listen."

01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:17.950
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: [chuckles]

01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:21.840
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: And he didn't mean it
as a compliment but it seems like this may

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:23.400
be the technique for --

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:24.400
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: Yes.

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:25.400
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: dealing with the inner
critic.

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:28.920
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: Ah, yes, very good, yes.

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:29.920
[laughter]

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:31.000
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: [laughs]

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Yes.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.350
&gt;&gt;male #1: Hi, thank you first Eckhart for
coming.

01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:37.190
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: Tip the microphone.

01:18:37.190 --> 01:18:38.190
&gt;&gt;male #1: Oh.

01:18:38.190 --> 01:18:39.270
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: Yeah, thank you.

01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:47.900
&gt;&gt;male #1: I wanted to ask you it seems like
the state that you're talking about of being

01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:57.230
at peace and being in the moment is, it's
a very appealing state that you feel more

01:18:57.230 --> 01:19:07.110
in touch, and I'm wondering why society or
people, why is there this attraction to distraction?

01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:17.489
And what is it about us that leads us to develop
these systems that take us away from that?

01:19:17.489 --> 01:19:29.750
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: Distractions, excitement,
stimulus are kinds of drugs or substitutes

01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:39.230
for the true feeling of aliveness within yourself.
So in the absence of that true feeling of

01:19:39.230 --> 01:19:44.170
aliveness within yourself which we could call
connectedness with being, connectedness with

01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:50.830
source, you have to look, you look to the
outside for something to make you feel more

01:19:50.830 --> 01:19:56.690
alive because when you're totally trapped
in your thinking mind there's a lack of aliveness,

01:19:56.690 --> 01:20:01.690
there's a sense that something fundamental
is missing in my life; it's an unconscious

01:20:01.690 --> 01:20:03.820
sense for many people.

01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:10.150
But that is the basis for many people's lives
is actually a sense of lack and that's an

01:20:10.150 --> 01:20:17.050
amazing thing if you really look at that,
that the basis for your life is there's something

01:20:17.050 --> 01:20:24.530
missing. And there are millions of people
on the planet who live their lives on that

01:20:24.530 --> 01:20:33.420
basis without even fully recognizing it as
if continuously they were telling themselves

01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:40.860
and certainly feeling, "Something missing
here." [chuckles] So they always, "How can

01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:49.050
I fill that thing that's missing," they don't
know what's missing but there's, it may sound

01:20:49.050 --> 01:20:55.190
familiar to some of you because it's such
a prevalent mind pattern, "Something missing,

01:20:55.190 --> 01:20:57.590
I need something."

01:20:57.590 --> 01:21:05.770
And of course what's missing is the true senses
of connectedness with being, with aliveness.

01:21:05.770 --> 01:21:12.090
And then of course you look for, "Okay what's
the next fix that I can get?" And then you're

01:21:12.090 --> 01:21:19.040
kind of you become a little bit greedy and
addictive for stimulus, that's why the bad

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:26.530
movies they produce more and more things that
stimulated more and more into violence because

01:21:26.530 --> 01:21:31.980
at least you get to substitute feeling of
aliveness and then you look for the next fix;

01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:35.050
some people get it in drugs or alcohol.

01:21:35.050 --> 01:21:42.501
It's almost like needing to suck up something
to fill that thing that's missing or you're

01:21:42.501 --> 01:21:56.469
looking to another human being to fill it,
sex, where is the next, or even the next affair,

01:21:56.469 --> 01:22:03.880
the excitement that comes from you just starting
into a love affair, "Wow now it's really happening."

01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:08.540
Of course and then you start living together
and then it goes downhill from there.

01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:10.000
[laughter]

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:18.690
So that doesn't work and so always looking
for something and not knowing that what you've

01:22:18.690 --> 01:22:29.030
been looking for is actually already within,
it's in you. It's taking attention instead

01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:32.940
of out there looking for it, go in there.

01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:39.640
This is why I start in The Power of Now giving
the parable about a beggar sitting on an old

01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:47.949
box holding his baseball cap, "Can you spare
a dime, can you spare," and for years he sits

01:22:47.949 --> 01:22:54.330
on this box, "Can you spare a dime," until
finally somebody comes along and he doesn't

01:22:54.330 --> 01:22:59.890
give him a dime and says, "What's in that
box you're sitting on?" I'm telling that parable

01:22:59.890 --> 01:23:03.980
in the book and he said, "Nothing I've been
sitting on it for years, it's just an old

01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:10.690
box." And the man says, "Well, look inside."
And finally he gets, "Okay," and it's full

01:23:10.690 --> 01:23:16.841
of gold, he's been sitting on it for years
begging [chuckles]. It's just a little parable.

01:23:16.841 --> 01:23:24.600
Of course the real thing is not even close
to you it's essentially part of who you are

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:29.700
so that's the reason why people, people also
look, they even look for stimulus in drama

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:37.200
in relationships because it makes them feel,
"well at least we're still alive, we're fighting

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:39.270
we must be alive." [laughs]

01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:40.270
Thanks.

01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:42.040
&gt;&gt;male #1: Thank you.

01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:47.330
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: I think we'll have time
just for one more question.

01:23:47.330 --> 01:23:54.480
&gt;&gt;Alex: Hey, my name is Alex, I am an equipment
maintenance tech so I keep rooms like this

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:55.480
operational.

01:23:55.480 --> 01:24:05.610
So you gave us some very practical things
to try to rid ourselves of distraction. I'm

01:24:05.610 --> 01:24:13.980
curious about another issue really strong
emotion. For example, like right now I'm like

01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:21.000
nervous, there's no reason to be nervous,
nothing bad could possibly happen. How do

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:26.500
you overcome emotions like that and jealousy,
hatred, any strong emotion? Do you have any

01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:29.090
practical tips that we could try for that?

01:24:29.090 --> 01:24:30.460
Thank you.

01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:36.700
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: Well, first it's helpful
to see the connection which is usually the

01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:43.040
case between the particular thoughts that
you are thinking and the emotion that you

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:52.020
feel. Most of the time the emotions are caused
by particular patterns in your mind, for example,

01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:59.880
anxiety is caused by thinking about possible
future things that may happen or things that

01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:04.500
you want to happen but they may not happen,
you may not get what you want, you may not

01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:10.380
get what you need, you may lose what you already
have; these things are all mind patterns that

01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:12.040
create fear.

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:17.570
So very often it is the thought that creates
the emotion and the thought creates the emotion

01:25:17.570 --> 01:25:23.480
because you are totally, you totally believe
in the thought, in other words, you're totally

01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:30.800
identified with the thought then the body
responds as if the thought were reality. "I

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:37.290
might lose my job." If you think that you
wake up in the middle of the night and then

01:25:37.290 --> 01:25:43.250
you start thinking more thoughts on those
lines, the body can't tell the difference,

01:25:43.250 --> 01:25:48.750
the body kind of responds to the thoughts
that go through your mind, they affect the

01:25:48.750 --> 01:25:55.780
physiology of the body. I mean if you doubt
that think of biting into a lemon and you'll

01:25:55.780 --> 01:26:04.310
find saliva accumulating in your mouth, [chuckles]
so what you think affects the body. The body

01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:09.611
believes your thoughts to be real so when
you think that you might lose your job, you've

01:26:09.611 --> 01:26:14.980
lost your job already according to the body
and you're destitute and that's how the body

01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:18.370
reacts and that's how the emotion is created.

01:26:18.370 --> 01:26:26.360
So it's often then by looking, seeing a thought
as untrue that you actually begin to become

01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:31.510
free. You can only see it as untrue if there's
an awareness there that is aware that there

01:26:31.510 --> 01:26:38.050
is a thought; without the awareness there's
only the thought. The thought then swallows

01:26:38.050 --> 01:26:44.120
up your entire consciousness and there's nothing
else you can do then. But with awareness:

01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:50.480
here's the awareness and here's the thought
and then the thought may still operate for

01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:57.410
a while but it's not empowered anymore and
the emotion then is also going to weaken.

01:26:57.410 --> 01:27:02.360
There may be times when there's not much thought
as in this, when you just said when you came

01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:09.230
up to the microphone, you felt nervous, perhaps
you didn't have any particular thought on

01:27:09.230 --> 01:27:13.630
this occasion, you just became nervous because
many people when they go up to a microphone

01:27:13.630 --> 01:27:21.340
and speak in public feel nervous. And again,
in these cases the question of simply allowing,

01:27:21.340 --> 01:27:27.469
acknowledging the emotion and allowing it
to be there, as I sometimes put it you become

01:27:27.469 --> 01:27:30.130
the space for it; you allow it to be there.

01:27:30.130 --> 01:27:34.830
So you could step up to the microphone, it's
actually what you said is very helpful when

01:27:34.830 --> 01:27:41.590
you go to the mic and you start by saying,
"I feel nervous, the palms of my hands are

01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:50.219
sweaty because I'm here." It's a beginning
of allowing it to be there without feeling

01:27:50.219 --> 01:27:54.460
that I shouldn't be feeling nervous then you
feel even more nervous.

01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:59.440
But if you allow the emotion to be there,
there comes a little space around it and there's

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:04.980
an aware space, yes, there's nervousness,
but there is an awareness around it, so you're

01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:10.710
not totally in the nervousness, you allow
it. And when you share it with others it's

01:28:10.710 --> 01:28:17.010
even, it's a lovely thing when you share any
emotion in that way with others rather than

01:28:17.010 --> 01:28:23.320
inflicting your emotion on them and saying,
"You did that to me." But when you say, "When

01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:31.949
you said that, this is what I felt," there's
an awareness there rather than, "You make

01:28:31.949 --> 01:28:39.470
me feel this." You can say, "When you said
that, this is what I felt," or "At this moment,

01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:42.600
this is what I feel."

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:48.670
Everybody loves that and there's an honesty
with that rather than coming up to the microphone

01:28:48.670 --> 01:28:54.630
and pretending not to be nervous; it's actually
much more powerful and you connect more deeply

01:28:54.630 --> 01:28:57.210
if you ever go into public speaking, perhaps
you will --

01:28:57.210 --> 01:28:59.260
[laughter]

01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:03.670
you connect much more deeply to the audience
when, instead of hiding the fact that you're

01:29:03.670 --> 01:29:11.510
nervous you start off by saying, "I feel really
nervous," then you connect with everybody.

01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:14.530
If you're pretending you don't connect.

01:29:14.530 --> 01:29:21.720
So again, just brief summary, see what thoughts
are causing the emotion which is often the

01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:31.590
case or in other cases, if an emotion just
arises allow it to be, be the space for it,

01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:37.910
and it's part of your experience of the present
moment and you might as well say yes to it

01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:45.170
because whatever arises in the present moment
is as it is already, whether you argue with

01:29:45.170 --> 01:29:52.130
it or not. The present moment is always as
it is and that's the is-ness, and when you

01:29:52.130 --> 01:29:59.290
become friendly with the is-ness that in itself
is a transformation of consciousness.

01:29:59.290 --> 01:30:05.700
&gt;&gt;Bradley Horowitz: So there's a lot of people
to thank. I wanna start by thanking those

01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:10.989
that tuned in on the webcast, I wanna thank
all of you Googlers who chose to take your

01:30:10.989 --> 01:30:15.870
afternoon and spend it here with us, I wanna
thank Rich and the Learning and Development

01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:21.260
Team here at Google who make events like this
possible, and of course I wanna thank Eckhart

01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:23.150
on behalf of all of us.

01:30:23.150 --> 01:30:28.090
Thank you for your wisdom, thank you for your
being, and also your doing in the world, your

01:30:28.090 --> 01:30:32.950
choice to share this knowledge with us. You've
given us a lot to think about and more importantly

01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:34.730
the ability not to think at all.

01:30:34.730 --> 01:30:35.730
&gt;&gt;Eckhart Tolle: [chuckles]

01:30:35.730 --> 01:30:36.730
[laughter]

01:30:36.730 --> 01:30:37.730
Thank you.

01:30:37.730 --> 01:30:37.731
[applause]
