00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:02.169
Oh hi! I hope you don't
mind that I'm eating.

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:03.489
This is actually
just my first course.

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:05.910
For my birthday, the
writers wrote me a script

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.360
where I just get to eat!

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.300
The whole time!

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.780
And I can't think of a
better way to demonstrate

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.049
the workings of the
digestive system,

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.409
the series of hollow organs
that we use to break down

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:18.880
and process the nutrients and
energy we need to function.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.850
Though...wait a second,
if I remember correctly

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.260
digestion is actually pretty
freaking disgusting...

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.210
so maybe I shouldn't
be eating right now.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:35.210
Oh whatever... Waiter!

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.930
 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.640
The digestive system is so
fundamental that it's basically

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.750
step number one in the
guide: How to Make an Animal.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.250
You probably remember that during
the embryonic development of most

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.630
animals, the digestive tract is
the very first thing that forms.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.250
When the blastula, that little wad
of cells that we all used to be,

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.559
turns into a little wad of cells
with a tube running through it,

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.730
that tube is your digestive system.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.770
And pretty much every animal has
a digestive system of some kind,

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.890
but they're not all alike.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:03.960
Far from it.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.350
In fact, digestive tracts
are specially adapted

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.860
to animals' feeding
behavior and diet.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.479
For instance, a house fly eats
mostly liquid or very finely

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.450
granulated food, but
before it does that,

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.600
it's got to puke its digestive
juices all over its lunch

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.869
and then let them
digest it for a while

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.869
before it sucks it
up into its mouth.

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.070
If we did it like that, first
dates would be...less common.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.049
Most vertebrates put food
in one end of the tube

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.170
and our digestive
system processes it,

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.030
and then it gets rid of the waste
out the other end of the tube.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.080
No muss, no fuss.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.420
Well, actually, there's a
little bit of muss, at the end.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.229
You may have noticed.

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.479
But the beauty of it is that
this whole process is run by our

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.000
autonomic nervous system, so we
don't have to think about it,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.090
until maybe the very last
step when we're in traffic

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.720
and just had two cups of
coffee and a bran muffin...

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.540
then we have to think
about it a little bit.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.970
Among vertebrates, the digestive
tract might be short or long,

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.580
or have organs that
do different things

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.460
depending on what its
feeding habits are.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.610
For instance, dogs are mostly
carnivores and also scavengers:

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.810
They mostly eat meat,

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.710
but sometimes that meat's
been dead for a while.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.770
So, the dog's digestive system
has developed to take food in,

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:06.729
absorb as many
nutrients as possible,

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.220
and then deposit it
on somebody's lawn,

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.190
all in a period of
about six hours.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.989
Dogs have an extremely short
digestive tract, because,

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.970
if you're in the habit
of eating rotten meat,

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.440
you'd better be able
to digest it fast.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.900
If you don't, the bad bacteria
that's probably living on that

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.709
armadillo carcass is going to
take up residence in your gut

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.190
and put you in a world of hurt.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.819
Cows, on the other hand, take
a very very very long time

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.450
to digest their food,
around 80 hours,

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.510
because they have to process
plants, mostly grass.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.930
Grass has a ton of cellulose
in it, and evolution has yet

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.319
to produce an animal that can
manufacture a stomach acid

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.410
or enzyme tough enough
to break down cellulose.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.780
So, cows have microorganisms
in their guts

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.800
that break down the
cellulose for them.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.730
This process takes a
four-chambered stomach

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.209
each one with a slightly
different microecology

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.250
and a lot of cud-chewing,

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.700
or regurgitating and
re-chewing of grass

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.090
before it passes all
the way through.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.879
So, nature is full of
crazy digestion stories,

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.360
and I honestly wish that I
had time to tell them all.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.980
But let's focus on human digestion
from now on, mostly because:

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.319
You're probably a human, we
don't assume anything here,

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.760
and you'll be wanting to know
how YOUR body does all this stuff.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.319
And humans actually have
a have a pretty good

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.470
all-purpose digestive system:

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.760
We're omnivores, after all,
we eat plants AND meat

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.290
so our systems are generalized
to handle all kinds of stuff.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.090
Like most animals, humans have
a bunch of different acids

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.670
and enzymes in our digestive
tracts that break food down

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.760
so that it can be absorbed
and used by our bodies.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.349
But the secret to
successful digestion

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.909
is maximizing surface area.
In more that one way, actually.

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.819
The first way we maximize surface
area is on the food itself.

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.190
Say I take a bite
out of this apple.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.379
Right now there's like, an apple
boulder sitting there in my mouth.

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.069
I've got enzymes in my
saliva that immediately start

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.180
breaking it down, like,
the outsides of the boulder.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.690
If I swallowed this
chunk whole right now,

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.739
not only would it hurt like heck,

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.799
the rest of my digestive system
would have a really hard time

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.450
dealing with it, because
most of the enzymes and acids

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.430
would have the same difficulty
working all the way

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.060
through this big solid hunk.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.049
But, when I use my awesome teeth
to chew up this hunk of apple

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.680
suddenly there's double, triple,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.140
quadruple the surface
area on the food!

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.620
I'm making up apple gravel
from the apple boulder.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.659
Maybe even apple sand.

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:19.439
For humans, chewing is key because
breaking down our food into

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:23.050
smaller and smaller bits allows
enzymes and acids to get at them.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.419
And after our teeth have
made the pieces small enough,

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.650
the chemicals break them
down further until

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.119
they're fine enough for our bodies
to absorb nutrients from them.

00:04:30.119 --> 00:04:32.319
But it's not just the surface area
of the food that's important,

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:34.400
the surface area of
the digestive system

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.559
is key to the whole
process as well.

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:38.369
Last time I talked about
how we have a whole bunch

00:04:38.369 --> 00:04:42.199
of surface area in our lungs to
absorb tons of oxygen all at once.

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.699
Well, our digestive systems
work in much the same way.

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.669
Most of the absorption of nutrients
happens in our small intestines,

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.050
and the length of the average
human adult's small intestine

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.009
is about 7 meters!

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:53.800
Plus, inside our small intestines

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.050
there are a bunch of little
folds and little absorbing fibers

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.249
with absorbing fibers on them,
and no I didn't mis-speak,

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:00.569
the fibers have fibers..

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:03.580
that's how hard our intestines work
to increase their surface area.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.389
Last episode I was all
impressed that lungs had

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.879
a total surface area
of 75 square meters...

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:13.189
well the small intestine has a
surface area of 250 square meters!

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:15.439
Blegh... It's kind of gross.

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:18.159
I wouldn't want to see it spread
out over a tennis court or anything

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:20.110
But I'm getting
ahead of myself here.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.349
Digestion does not start at
the small intestine, people,

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:23.180
it starts at the mouth.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.599
Now, as you can see, this
hot pocket is surrounded

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.599
by some kind of bread,
if you can call it that.

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:31.430
Bread is a starch, which
breaks down into glucose.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.110
When I start gnawing
on a piece of bread,

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.559
because the outside
here is mostly bread.

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:38.869
the glands in my mouth
start secreting saliva,

00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:41.930
which contains salivary amylase,
an enzyme designed to break

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.249
down starch into glucose.

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:45.499
The more I chew, the more amylase
will get to all the different

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:47.839
sides of the bread, and that's
why the more you chew bread,

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:49.180
the sweeter it tastes.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.599
Amylase doesn't really do much
to the meat or the cheese

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:51.149
in this thing.

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:53.490
I've got other enzymes and acids
that are going to work on them

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.129
later on in the system, but I am
gonna chew all that stuff up

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:59.779
real good right now so
that those other enzymes

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:00.740
can do their jobs later.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.289
I'm gonna swallow all this.

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:04.869
So now the masticated hot pocket
has passed down my pharynx,

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:08.330
or throat, and into my esophagus,
which leads to my stomach.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.849
There's actually this
little cool flap of tissue

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:13.520
called the epiglottis that blocks
the trachea when I swallow,

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.179
so that the food doesn't end
up in my respiratory system.

00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:17.839
This ball of food
that I just swallowed

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:21.149
actually has a scientific
name, it's called a bolus

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:23.960
and it rides a kind of wave of
muscle action down the esophagus

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.649
into the stomach.

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:27.259
This wave-like contraction of the
smooth muscles around the tube

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:30.369
of the esophagus is called
peristalsis, and it's basically

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:33.729
how most of the movement in your
digestive system is accomplished.

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:36.409
Now my hot pocket bolus
is in my stomach now

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:38.749
which is where the food really
starts getting manhandled.

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:40.490
The stomach basically
takes a scorched earth

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.819
approach to digestion.
It's not messing around.

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.559
It's like a churning cement
mixer that can contract

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:47.330
and expand with these big,

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.629
accordion-like folds
of muscle called rugae.

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:51.809
Your stomach's job is to
turn everything over and over,

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:52.979
smooshing and mixing
all the pieces up

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:56.360
with its cocktail of acids and
enzymes called gastric juice.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.569
Gastric juice is mainly made
up of hydrochloric acid,

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:01.789
an enzyme called pepsin,
and some mucus and water.

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:04.110
Hydrochloric acid
has a Ph of about 1

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:05.959
which is strong enough that,
if you got it on your hand,

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:07.369
it would give you a chemical burn.

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:09.429
So the acid breaks things
down and hopefully kills

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:11.719
most of the bacteria that
you might find on your food.

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:14.860
The pepsin starts breaking down
proteins into amino acids.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.089
Now, that mucus is important.

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:20.959
It's there to protect your stomach,
so that it doesn't digest itself.

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:24.119
When you don't have enough of that
mucus you get peptic ulcers,

00:07:24.119 --> 00:07:25.529
which happen when
your stomach lining

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:27.709
comes in direct contact
with your stomach acid.

00:07:27.709 --> 00:07:29.659
And the water's just in there
to make everything all soupy,

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:32.469
because what you want by the
time your food leaves your stomach

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:36.149
is chyme, which is a kind of
liquidy slop that you might

00:07:36.149 --> 00:07:38.619
be familiar with from the last
time you had a stomach virus.

00:07:38.619 --> 00:07:40.240
You knew this conversation
was going to have to get

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.499
a little bit gross and I didn't
want to bring diarrhea into it

00:07:42.499 --> 00:07:44.429
too much because, you
know, I've been eating.

00:07:44.429 --> 00:07:46.550
But when something bad is going
on in your digestive tract,

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.830
your body doesn't worry too
much about absorbing nutrients,

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.869
it just wants to get
the chyme out of there.

00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:54.270
So, chyme is what you see when...

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.110
You get the picture.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.209
Anyway, there's a
little valve, or sphincter

00:07:57.209 --> 00:07:58.830
between the stomach and
the small intestine

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.459
that regulates how much chyme
gets into the small intestine

00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:02.330
and when it gets in there.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.089
The very beginning of the small
intestine is called the duodenum,

00:08:05.089 --> 00:08:07.719
this is where a lot of the
small intestine action happens,

00:08:07.719 --> 00:08:10.879
by which I mean, lots of things
get absorbed and also secreted,

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:13.429
like bicarbonate, which
neutralizes the gastric acid

00:08:13.429 --> 00:08:14.499
before it goes any further.

00:08:14.499 --> 00:08:16.899
Now, the coolness of the small
intestine can't be overstated.

00:08:16.899 --> 00:08:19.989
It's ground zero for
cellular exchange of nutrients

00:08:19.989 --> 00:08:21.629
and the breakdown of fats.

00:08:21.629 --> 00:08:23.869
And again, the reason
it's so good at absorbing

00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:26.550
is because of all the surface
area it's got going on.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:28.499
A lot of that surface area
comes from the fact that,

00:08:28.499 --> 00:08:32.169
despite its name, your small
intestine is frickin' long:

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:35.849
in a human, it can range anywhere
from 4.5 to 10.5 meters.

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:37.419
But that's not all!

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:40.250
The whole inside is lined
with epithelial tissue

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.899
that has tons of ridges
and folds in it.

00:08:42.899 --> 00:08:44.279
Surface area to the max!

00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:47.079
And on those ridges and folds are
these little hair-like fibers

00:08:47.079 --> 00:08:49.079
of flesh called villi.

00:08:49.079 --> 00:08:52.360
Each villus has capillaries in it,
so that it can absorb nutrients.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.389
And get this: each villus, which
is only like half a millimeter long

00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:59.120
is covered in teeeny
tiny little microvilli,

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.019
providing even more surface area!

00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:03.670
In fact, apparently, the
small intestine has a texture

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.620
kind of like velvet, which is...

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.410
[DISGUST]

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:11.329
Oh great, now I eat the
milkshake? Fantastic. Okay.

00:09:11.329 --> 00:09:12.940
So another thing the
small intestine does,

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.629
with the help of its
friend the gallbladder,

00:09:14.629 --> 00:09:16.889
is break down fatty stuff,
like this milkshake.

00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:19.500
Near the top of your small
intestine is a little pipe

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.550
where bile salts,
manufactured by the liver

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.079
and stored by the
gallbladder, are squirted out

00:09:24.079 --> 00:09:26.029
into the small intestine.

00:09:26.029 --> 00:09:28.500
Bile works like dish
detergent on a pan

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.220
you just fried something in:
it's an emulsifier.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.730
It takes hydrophobic fat
molecules and breaks them up

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:35.850
into fatty acids
and monoglycerides,

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:37.779
which can be absorbed by all
that epithelial tissue!

00:09:37.779 --> 00:09:39.379
I've never had Chunky Monkey before

00:09:39.379 --> 00:09:42.110
Mmmmm!

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:44.850
Nuts!

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.019
After your food passes through
those yards and yards

00:09:47.019 --> 00:09:50.060
of small intestine, the chyme
goes through another sphincter

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.199
and enters the cecum, the
beginning of the large intestine.

00:09:53.199 --> 00:09:56.029
The large intestine's job is
to remove most of the water

00:09:56.029 --> 00:09:59.509
and bile salts from the chyme so
you don't have constant diarrhea.

00:09:59.509 --> 00:10:01.009
So, you can thank it for that!

00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:03.870
It's called "large" because it's
wider than the small intestine,

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.180
but it's not nearly as long:

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.769
it's basically just a one-
and-a-half meter victory lap

00:10:07.769 --> 00:10:10.860
around outside of the small
intestine and then it calls it good

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.250
Also, I should mention,
at the end of the cecum

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:16.639
there is a little tube where
the the appendix comes in.

00:10:16.639 --> 00:10:19.579
For a long time, we thought that
the appendix was a worthless,

00:10:19.579 --> 00:10:22.139
vestigial structure that we
used to need at some point

00:10:22.139 --> 00:10:23.790
in our evolution but
didn't need anymore.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.269
However, recent studies are finding
that the purpose of the appendix

00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:29.370
in modern humans is probably
to act as a safe house

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.990
for all of the good bacteria you
need to help you digest your food.

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:35.000
If you get a virus or
food poisoning or something

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.970
and all your digestive systems
say, "GET IT ALL OUT OF ME!"

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.329
The appendix has a little
sample of your gut bacteria

00:10:40.329 --> 00:10:43.370
that it spits out to help
recolonize you after your illness.

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.709
So, I think you're familiar
with the final step

00:10:45.709 --> 00:10:47.639
in the digestive system.

00:10:47.639 --> 00:10:48.970
That's the pooping.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:52.879
Your food can spend as long as
3 days in your digestive tract,

00:10:52.879 --> 00:10:55.189
and a lot of that time is
spent in the large intestine,

00:10:55.189 --> 00:10:57.899
mostly reabsorbing the
excess water from the chyme

00:10:57.899 --> 00:11:01.370
and prepping your poo for its
great entrance into the world.

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:04.129
When it's done, it passes through
everybody's favorite sphincters,

00:11:04.129 --> 00:11:05.379
the anal sphincters.

00:11:05.379 --> 00:11:06.370
There are two of them.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:09.649
And, you know...out in the
world to live its own life.

00:11:09.649 --> 00:11:11.449
And that's the end of
our little tale here

00:11:11.449 --> 00:11:13.019
that begins with the hot pocket.

00:11:13.019 --> 00:11:16.569
I hope you'll join us next
time for more disgustingness,

00:11:16.569 --> 00:11:20.290

of the Excretory System!

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:22.290
