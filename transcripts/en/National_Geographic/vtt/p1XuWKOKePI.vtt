00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:02.568
In East Africa,
ivory trafficking is

00:00:02.568 --> 00:00:04.003 line:0%
probably what you might guess.

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:06.005 line:0%
It's organized crime,
it's poachers on the ground,

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:07.073 line:0%
corrupt governments.

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:11.143 line:0%
Central Africa; Completely
different. It's a war zone.

00:00:11.443 --> 00:00:13.212
<i> These are the rangers.</i>

00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:15.248
<i> These six men are dead.</i>

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:20.053
They were on an anti-poaching
mission on Heban Hill in 2012

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:22.154
in Chad,
Zakouma National Park

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:24.357
when Janjaweed came in

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:25.959
they were in their
morning prayers

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:27.993
and killed them all.

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:31.063
<i>This woman was attacked by
the Lord's Resistance Army</i>

00:00:31.063 --> 00:00:34.167
<i> which cut her, she's had
multiple surgeries since.</i>

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:37.837
<i>Cut her ears off, her lips off,
 and her nose.</i>

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:40.739
<i>This is Emmanuel de Merode.
 He and his men were</i>

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.575
<i>Explorers of the Year here
 at National Geographic.</i>

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:45.177
<i> Emmanuel runs the
 park at Virunga.</i>

00:00:45.177 --> 00:00:47.413
<i> The most courageous man
 on the planet.</i>

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:50.717
He was shot last year,
ambushed...

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:53.653
for his work to preserve
Virunga National Park.

00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:56.488
<i> Innocent,
 who works with Emmanuel.</i>

00:00:56.488 --> 00:00:59.259
<i> A National Geographic
 Emerging Explorer.</i>

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:01.294
<i> These tusks were
 seized from FDLR.</i>

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:04.330
The Rwandans,
Hutus have come into

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.267
and live in Virunga National
Park and exploit that park

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:11.571
and have killed a number
of rangers this year.

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:13.973
<i> These guys are,
 a part of a force</i>

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:16.176
<i> the African Union force
 dedicated to going after</i>

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.177
<i> Joseph Kony and the
 Lord's Resistance Army.</i>

00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:22.015
These are anti-Lord's Army
Resistance army rangers.

00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:24.750
This is all the more significant

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.986
<i> because these men don't
 know how to swim.</i>

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:29.322
<i>And they go out every day,
 this--</i>

00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:31.891
<i>This guy is a defector from
the Lord's Resistance Army.</i>

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:35.928
<i>Michael Onen, beaten by the
 men who kidnapped him.</i>

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:39.165
And it's all because
of those two teeth.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.135
So, let's go after these people.

00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:44.637
Let's be creative.

00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:46.472
Let's move forward.

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:49.576
This is George Dante, one of
the world's best taxidermists.

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:53.746
<i> I hired him to build me
 fake elephant tusks.</i>

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:55.581
<i> Then I had an engineer
 in California</i>

00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:58.351
<i> build me a satellite
 based GPS system.</i>

00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:01.154
<i> And I laid them
 inside those tusks.</i>

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:04.290
<i> That's the result, you
tell me which one's real.</i>

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.361
<i> We put our tusks in
 Central Africa</i>

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:13.566
<i>in the black market, and we
watched them, using an iPad.</i>

00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:17.270
<i> And they went to this
 area of Darfur.</i>

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.772
<i> Called Kafia Kingi.</i>

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:21.341
<i>That's where Joseph Kony is.</i>

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:25.110
And so that was the new face,
for me, of the ivory story.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.680
The violence,
the terrorism behind ivory.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.082
And I was excited about
telling this story

00:02:30.082 --> 00:02:33.553
we told it as the
September cover story.

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:37.790
We told it as the launch, new
launch of the Explorer series

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.760
"Warlords of Ivory",
and as a result

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.996
you give the world the
opportunity to ask

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.331
"does it want this?"

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:50.103
<i> "Does it want this?"</i>

00:02:51.937 --> 00:02:54.507
Every story is a gift.

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:56.943
These stories are my gift

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:59.878
to these animals
that can't speak

00:02:59.878 --> 00:03:03.483
and to these men and
women who pay so much

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:06.986
and your gift to them can
be to share this story.
