Okay--let's move on, and now we're going to talk about HTTP.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
If you recall, this was what we described as the main protocol of the Web.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is what your browser uses to talk to the Web Servers.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The request from your browser for the URL,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
www.example.com/foo,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
begins with the request line.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It looks something like this: this is the request line.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now, HTTP is a very simple text protocol,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
so this text is sent over the Internet to the Server--

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
just like this; it's human-readable too.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The request line has 3 main parts.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
First is the method,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
next is the path--

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and finally, is the version.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The method is what type of request you're making to the Server.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The most common method, by far, is GET--

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and this is how you GET a document from the Server.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Other popular methods are GET and POST.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
There are other ones, but these are the one's we're going to use in the class.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Next is the path--in this case, it's "/foo".

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
You remember this from the URL,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
but the path from the URL comes here.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This is the actual document we're requesting from the Server.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And finally, is the version.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
It's always "HTTP/" and then a version number.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Most browsers and Servers these days speak 1.1,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
but we'll also touch on 1.0 a little bit in this class

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
because 1.0 has a few uses of its own.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Now--you're wondering where the host name is in this request line?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It's not here--all that's here is the path.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We're connected to this host.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Your browser connected to this host--or,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
if we're playing around with HTTP, we made the connection.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But that's how we know where we are.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So this is used for making a connection,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and the path is used for making the request.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Let's have a quick quiz--given the following URL:

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
example.com/foo/logo.png?p=1#tricky

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.662
what is the request line to GET this URL using HTTP/1.1?
