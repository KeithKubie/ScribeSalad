00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.580
Hi, I'm Hank. And I'm a human,
but let's pretend for a moment

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.380
that I'm a moth. And not just
any moth, a peppered moth.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.730
Now let's pretend that I'm living
in London in the early 1800s,

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.779
right as the industrial revolution
is starting. Life is swell.

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.550
My light-colored body lets me
blend in with the light-colored

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.419
lichens and tree bark, which means
birds have a hard time seeing me,

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.539
which means that I get to live.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.380
But it's starting to get noticeably darker
around here with all these

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.550
coal-powered factories spewing
soot into the air, and suddenly

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.340
all the trees have gone from
looking like this to looking

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.010
like this.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.460
So thanks to the soot-covered
everything, I've got problems.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.680
But you know who doesn't have
problems? My brother.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.480
He looks like this Yeah,
he has a different form

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.690
of the gene that
affects pigmentation.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.690
Moths like him represent about
2 percent of all the peppered

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.290
moths at the start of the
industrial revolution.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.630
But by 1895 it'll be 95 percent!

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.739
Why? Well, you're probably already
guessing, as the environment

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.960
gets dirtier, darker moths will be
eaten less often, and therefore

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.240
have more opportunities
to make baby moths.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.119
The white ones will get eaten
more, so over time,

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.130
the black-colored trait
will become more common.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.569
As for me? [Eaten.]

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:27.569
This, my friends, is a
wonderful example of

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.549
natural selection. The process by
which certain inherited traits

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.340
make it easier for some
individuals to thrive and multiply,

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.799
changing the genetic makeup
of populations over time.

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.109
For this revelation, which remains
one of the most important

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:47.569
revelations in biology, we have to
thank Charles Darwin, who first

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:52.100
identified this process in his
revolutionary 1859 book,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.679
On the Origin of Species
by Natural Selection.

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.770
Now lots of factors play a role
in how species change over time

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.179
including mutation, migration and
random changes in how frequently

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.439
some alleles show up, a
process known as genetic drift.

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.360
But natural selection is the most
powerful and most important cause

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.110
of evolutionary change, which is
why today we're going to talk

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.440
about the principles behind it,
and the different ways

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.160
in which it works.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.580
Darwin came to understand the
process of selection because he

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.190
spent his adult life, even most of
his childhood, obsessed with

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.250
observing nature.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.960
He studied barnacles, earthworms,
birds, rocks, tortoises, fossils,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.650
fish, insects and to some extent,
even his own family.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.220
I'll get back to that in a bit.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.040
But it was during Darwin's famous
voyage on the H.M.S. Beagle

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.890
in the 1830s, a surveying
expedition around the world,

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.960
that he began to formulate
this theory. Darwin was able to

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.420
study all kinds of organisms,
and he kept amazing journals.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.940
Looking back on his notes,
he hit upon a couple of

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.100
particularly important factors
in species' survival.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.980
One of them was the many examples
of adaptations he noticed on

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.350
his journey. The ways in which
organisms seemed to be nearly

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.750
ideally shaped to enhance their
survival and reproduction in

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:06.900
specific environments.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.970
Maybe the most famous example of
these were the variations of beaks

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.450
Darwin observed among the finches
in the remote Galapagos Islands

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.100
off the coast of South America.
He observed more than a dozen

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.630
closely-related finch species,
all of which were quite similar

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.420
to mainland finch species,
but each island species had

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.560
different shaped and sized beaks
that were adapted to the food

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.220
available specifically
on each island.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.510
If there were hard seeds,
the beaks were thick.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.640
If there were insects,
the beaks were skinny and pointed.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.960
If there were cactus fruit,
the beaks were sharp

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.450
to puncture the fruit's skin.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.060
These superior inherited traits
led Darwin to another idea,

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.020
the finches' increased fitness for
their environment, that is, their

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.890
relative ability to survive
and create offspring.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.860
Explaining the effects of
adaptation and relative fitness

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.930
would become central to Darwin's
idea of natural selection.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.100
And today we often define natural
selection, and describe how it

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.620
drives evolutionary change,
by four basic principles,

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.890
based on Darwin's observations.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.950
The first principle is that
different members a population

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.430
have all kinds of
individual variations.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.960
These characteristics,
whether their body size,

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.750
hair color, blood type,
facial markings, metabolisms

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.070
or reflexes, are called phenotypes.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.680
The second is that many variations
are heritable and can be passed

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.350
on to offspring. If a trait
happens to be favorable,

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.440
it does future generations no
good if it can't be passed on.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.960
Third: this one tends to get
glossed over a lot, even though

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.730
it's probably the most interesting,
is Darwin's observation that

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.970
populations can often have way
more offspring than resources,

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.639
like food and water, can support.

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.680
This leads to what Darwin called
"the struggle for existence."

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.620
He was inspired here by the work
of economist Thomas Malthus,

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.090
who wrote that when human
populations get too big,

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.490
we get things like plague
and famine and wars,

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.930
and then only some of us survive
and continue to reproduce.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.380
If you missed the SciShow Infusion
that we did on human overpopulation

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.560
today and Malthus's predictions,
you should check it out now.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.790
This finally leads to the last
principle of natural selection,

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.660
which is that, given all of this
competition for resources,

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.790
heritable traits that affect
individuals' fitness can lead to

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.570
variations in their survival
and reproductive rates.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.660
This is just another way of saying
that those with favorable traits

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.450
are more likely to come out on top
and will be more successful

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.460
with their baby-making.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.840
So to wrap all these principles
together, in order for natural

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.840
selection to take place,
a population has to have

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.000
variations, some of which are
heritable, and when a variation

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.740
makes an organism more competitive,
that variation will

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.860
tend to be selected.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.139
Like with the peppered moth.
It survived because there was

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:33.669
variation within the species,
the dark coloration,

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:36.610
which was heritable,
and in turn allowed every moth

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.310
that inherited that trait to

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.280
better survive the
hungry birds of London.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.950
But notice how this works.
A single variation in a single

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.130
organism is only the very
beginning of the process.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.960
The key is that
individuals don't evolve.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.900
Instead, natural selection
produces evolutionary change

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.750
because it changes the genetic
composition of entire populations,

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.840
and that occurs through
interactions between individuals

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.560
and their environment.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.889
Let's get back to Darwin
for a minute.

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:11.240
In 1870, Darwin wrote to his
neighbor and parliamentarian

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.949
John Lubbock requesting that a
question be added to England's

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:18.500
census regarding the frequency
of cousins marrying and the

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.340
health of their offspring.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.870
His request was denied,
but the question was something

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.889
that weighed heavily on
Darwin's mind,

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:28.820
because he was married to
Emma Wedgwood, who happened to be

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.620
his first cousin.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.750
Her grandfather was
Josiah Wedgwood,

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.690
founder for the company that
remains famous for its

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:35.880
pottery and china.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.160
Oh, and he was also
Darwin's grandfather.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.889
In fact, much of Darwin's family
tree was...complicated.

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:46.790
His marriage to Emma was far from
the first Wedgewood-Darwin pairing.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.850
Darwin's maternal grandparents and
mother were also Wedgwoods,

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.030
and there were several other
marriages between cousins

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.830
in the family, though not always
between those two families.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.660
So Darwin, and to a greater extent
his children, carried more genetic

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.820
material of Wedgwood origin than
Darwininan. And this caused

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.310
some problems, the likes of which
Darwin was all too aware of,

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.280
thanks to his own scientific research.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.680
Darwin of course spent time
studying the effects of

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.550
crossbreeding and inbreeding
in plants and animals,

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.949
noting that consanguineous pairs
often resulted in weaker

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:21.419
and sickly descendants. And the
same was true of his family.

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:24.820
Emma and Charles had 10 children,
three of whom died in childhood

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.860
from infectious disease,
which is more likely to be

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.169
contracted by those with
high levels of inbreeding.

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:32.240
And while none of Darwin's seven
other children had any deformities,

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.380
he noted that they were
"not very robust"

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.729
and three of them were unable to
have children of their own,

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:39.479
likely another effect of inbreeding.

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:41.930
Now, so far we've been talking
about natural selection in terms

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.979
of physical characteristics,
like beak shape or coloration.

00:07:45.979 --> 00:07:48.419
But it's important to understand
that it's not just organism's

00:07:48.419 --> 00:07:51.740
physical form, or its phenotype,
that's changing but its

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.350
essential genetic form,
or genotype.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.850
The heritable variations we've
been talking about are a function

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:00.330
of the alleles that organisms are
carrying around. And as organisms

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.180
become more successful,
evolutionarily speaking,

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.740
by surviving in larger numbers for
longer and having more kids,

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.740
that means that the alleles that
mark their variation

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.820
become more frequent.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.520
But these changes can come about
in different ways.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.900
To understand how, let's walk
through the different

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:16.560
modes of selection.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.060
The mode we've been talking about
for much of this episode is an

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.460
example of directional selection,
which is when a favored trait is

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:27.120
at one extreme end of the range of
traits, like from short to tall,

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.430
or white to black, or blind to
having super-night-goggle vision.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.789
Over time this leads to distinct
changes in the frequency of that

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:38.399
expressed trait in a population,
when a single phenotype is favored.

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:40.860
So our peppered moth is an example
of a population's trait

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:45.170
distribution shifting toward one
extreme, almost all whitish moths,

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:47.850
to the other extreme,
almost all blackish.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.290
Another awesome example is
giraffe necks. They've gotten

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.930
really long over time because
there was selection pressure

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.399
against short necks, which
couldn't reach all of those

00:08:55.399 --> 00:08:56.240
delicious leaves.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.020
But there's also stabilizing
selection, which selects against

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:02.390
extreme phenotypes and instead
favors the majority that are well

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:05.250
adapted to an environment.
An example that's often used is a

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.370
human's birth weight: Very small
babies have a harder time defending

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.440
themselves from infections and
staying warm, but very large

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.550
babies are too large to deliver
naturally. Because of this, the

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.770
survival rate for babies has
historically been higher for those

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:22.000
in the middle weight range,
which helped stabilize

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.800
average birth weight.
At least, until Cesarian sections

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.760
became as common as bad tattoos.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.700
So what happens when the
environment favors extreme traits

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.930
at both ends of the spectrum,
while selecting against

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.050
the common traits?
That's disruptive selection.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.170
Now examples of this are rare,
but scientists think they found

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:41.529
an instance of it in 2008, in a
lake full of tiny crustaceans

00:09:41.529 --> 00:09:43.730
called Daphnia.
The population was hit with an

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:47.020
epidemic of yeast parasite,
and after about a half-dozen

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.620
generations, a variance had
emerged in how the Daphnia

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.120
responded to the parasite.
Some became less susceptible to

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.050
the yeast, but were smaller and
had fewer offspring. The others

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:58.220
actually became more susceptible
to the parasite, but were bigger

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.959
and able to reproduce more,
at least while they were

00:10:00.959 --> 00:10:02.560
still alive.
So there were two traits that were

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.110
being selected for, both in
extremes and both to the exclusion

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.440
of each other: susceptibility
and fecundity.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.520
If you got one,
you didn't get the other.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.720
An interesting example,
of selection being

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.640
driven by a parasite.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.700
Now while these are the main ways
that selective pressures can

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.839
affect populations, those
pressures can also come from

00:10:17.839 --> 00:10:21.350
factors other than environmental
ones like food supply or predators

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.670
or parasites.
There's also sexual selection,

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:24.890
another concept introduced by

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.110
Darwin and described in The Origin
of Species as depending

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:31.940
"not on a struggle for existence,
but a struggle between individuals

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.899
of the same sex, generally the
males, for the possession

00:10:35.899 --> 00:10:37.149
of the other sex."

00:10:37.149 --> 00:10:39.070
Basically, for individuals to
maximize their fitness,

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:43.370
they not only need to survive but
they also need to reproduce more,

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:44.970
and they can do that one
or two ways:

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.380
One, they can make themselves
attractive to the opposite sex.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:53.140
Or two, they can go for the upper
hand by intimidating, deterring

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.310
or defeating the same-sex rivals.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:58.240
The first of these strategies is
how we ended up with this:

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.680
I mean, the peacock tail isn't
exactly camouflage. But the more

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.680
impressive the tail, the better
chances a male will find a mate

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.770
and pass its genes
to the next generation.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.410
Sad-looking peacock tails will
diminish over generations,

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:13.709
making it a good example
of directional sexual selection.

00:11:13.709 --> 00:11:17.620
The other strategy involves
fighting, or at least looking like=

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:20.440
you want to fight, for the
privilege of mating,

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.910
which tends to select for
bigger or stronger

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:24.220
or meaner-looking mates.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.209
And finally, thanks to us humans
there are also un-natural forms

00:11:27.209 --> 00:11:29.890
of selection, and we call
that artificial selection.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:32.040
People have been artificially
selecting plants and animals

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.070
for thousands of years, and Darwin
spent a lot of time in Origin of

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:41.070
Species talking about the breeding
of pigeons and cattle and plants

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:42.890
to demonstrate the
principles of selection.

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:46.260
We encourage the selection of some
traits and discourage others.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.010
It's how we got grains that
produce all those nutrients.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:52.560
Which is how we managed to turn
the gray wolf into domesticated

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.089
dogs that can look like this

00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:57.820
or like that, two of my favorite
examples of artificial selection.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.360
Now these are different
breeds of dogs-

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.089
Oh, where you goin'?
No. No.

00:12:01.089 --> 00:12:04.279
But they're both still dogs.
They're the same species.

00:12:04.279 --> 00:12:08.070
Technically, a corgi and a
greyhound could get together and

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.279
have a baby dog, though it would
be a weird looking dog.

00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:12.980
But, what happens when selection
makes populations so different

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.440
that they can't even be the same
species any more?

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.320
Well, that's what we're going to talk about next episode on Crash Course Biology:

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.960
How one species can turn into another species.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.399
