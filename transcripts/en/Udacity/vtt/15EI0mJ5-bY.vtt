One thing you may consider is
reaching out to other markets.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.138
There are vastly growing markets out
there that maybe a great opportunity for

00:00:07.138 --> 00:00:08.260
you to expand.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.550
This is called Localizing Your App,
localizing your app can maximize your

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.730
distribution potential resulting in
users and ratings from around the world.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.680
Now if you do this there are a few

app into different languages.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.820

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.240
