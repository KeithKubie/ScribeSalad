00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.900
SPEAKER: There are
approximately 285 million people

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.570
with visual impairments
around the world.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.780
Making your app accessible
not just opens it up

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.990
to these users, but
it has a potential

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.170
to improve design for everyone.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.290
Most people are familiar with
an accessibility service called

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.300
TalkBack, which
is a screen viewer

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.200
utility for people who are
blind and visually impaired.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.730
With TalkBack, the
user performs input

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.120
via gestures such as
swiping or dragging,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.430
or an external keyboard.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.300
The output is usually
spoken feedback.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.740
There are two
gesture input modes.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.820
The first one is
touch exploration,

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.450
where you drag your
finger across the screen.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.140
And the second one
is linear navigation,

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.170
where you swipe left and
right with your finger

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.000
until you find the
item of interest.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.150
Once you arrive to the
item you're interested in,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.870
you double tap on
it to activate.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.720
The primary way in which you
can attach alternative text

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.940
description for your UI elements
to be spoken by TalkBack

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.110
is by using an Android attribute
called ContentDescription.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.570
If you don't provide
ContentDescription for an image

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.050
button, for example, the
experience for a TalkBack user

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.500
can be jarring.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.200
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Unlabelled button.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.180
Double tap to activate.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.770
Unlabelled button.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.780
Double tap to activate.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.520
SPEAKER: For decorative elements
such as spacers and dividers,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.930
setting
ContentDescription to null

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.430
will tell TalkBack to ignore
and not speak these elements.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.620
Make sure to not
include control type

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.560
or control state in your
content description--

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.060
words like buttons,
selected, checked, etc.,

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.790
as Android natively
does that for you.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.640
Android linked
automatically show you

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.120
which UI controls lack
content descriptions.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.910
To keep TalkBack
spoken output tidy,

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.550
you can arrange related
content into groups

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.710
by using focusable containers.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.110
When TalkBack encounters
such a container,

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.710
it will present the content
as a single announcement.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.080
For more complex
structures such as tables,

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.460
you can assign
focus to a container

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.940
holding one piece
of the structure,

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.530
such as a single row.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.760
Grouping content both reduces
the amount of swiping the user

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.300
has to do while
streamlining speech output.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.390
Here is an example of how
ungrouped table of contents

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.140
works.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.730
AUTOMATED VOICE: Song details.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:36.610
Name.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.410
Hey Jude.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.360
Artists.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.180
The Beatles.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.820
Cost $1.45.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.880
SPEAKER: And here's the same
content with grouping applied.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.220
AUTOMATED VOICE: Content
grouping activity.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.020
Song details.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.360
Name, Hey Jude.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.450
Artists, the Beatles.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.970
Cost $1.45.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.910
SPEAKER: You should manually
test your app with TalkBack

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.820
and eyes closed
to understand how

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.340
a blind user may experience it.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.770
We also provide
Accessibility Scanner

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.200
as an app in Google Play.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.420
It suggests accessibility
improvements

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.900
automatically by looking
at content labels,

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.930
clickable items,
contrast, and more.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.930
Vision impairments doesn't
just refer to blindness.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.050
65% percent of our population
is farsighted, for example.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.240
With careful design,
you can make sure

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.880
that many of your
visually impaired users

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.490
can have a positive
experience without having

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.500
to rely on TalkBack.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.430
Begin by making sure
that UI of your apps

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.870
works with other
accessibility settings,

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.890
including increased font
size and magnification.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.950
Keep your touch targets large--

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.590
at least 48 x 48 dp.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.270
This makes them easier
to distinguish and touch.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.980
Provide adequate color contrast.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.480
The World Wide Web Consortium
created color contrast

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.180
accessibility
guidelines to help.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.270
And to assist users
with color deficiencies,

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.310
use cues other than color
to distinguish UI elements.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.329
For example, more descriptive
instructional text.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.200
If you're using custom views
or drawing your app window

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.580
using OpenGL, you need
to manually define

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.020
accessibility metadata, so
that Accessibility Services can

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.630
interpret your app properly.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.580
The easiest way to
achieve this goal

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.480
is to rely on the
ExploreByTouchHelper class.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.580
With just a few
methods, you can build

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.530
a hierarchy of
virtual views that

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.630
are accessible to TalkBack.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.420
Making your app
accessible doesn't just

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.130
open it to new users.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.710
It helps to make the
world a better place,

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.300
one app at a time.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.580
