00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:45.010
the guy being like you know here's the
big picture but a man come on it you're

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:45.020
big picture but a man come on it you're
 

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.420
big picture but a man come on it you're
right I think that's one thing you're

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:46.430
right I think that's one thing you're
 

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:50.769
right I think that's one thing you're
missing is cuz we know they're gonna get

00:13:50.769 --> 00:13:50.779
missing is cuz we know they're gonna get
 

00:13:50.779 --> 00:13:52.180
missing is cuz we know they're gonna get
there on time we know they do get there

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:52.190
there on time we know they do get there
 

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.180
there on time we know they do get there
on time they don't know that but I think

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:55.190
on time they don't know that but I think
 

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:56.800
on time they don't know that but I think
it's being implied that sock has a bit

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:56.810
it's being implied that sock has a bit
 

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:58.900
it's being implied that sock has a bit
out of his mind on this one or so so cuz

out of his mind on this one or so so cuz
 

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:00.579
out of his mind on this one or so so cuz
of it out of his mind on this one that

00:14:00.579 --> 00:14:00.589
of it out of his mind on this one that
 

00:14:00.589 --> 00:14:03.250

he is so obsessed you see this obsession
 

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.500
he is so obsessed you see this obsession
continue with him you know because he

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:05.510
continue with him you know because he
 

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.030
continue with him you know because he
wants to be part of it maybe it's

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.040
wants to be part of it maybe it's
 

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.370
wants to be part of it maybe it's
justified or or it's justified but

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:09.380
justified or or it's justified but
 

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.290
justified or or it's justified but
everyone I'm wondering if they open

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:11.300
everyone I'm wondering if they open
 

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:12.910
everyone I'm wondering if they open
those what I'm talking about yeah I I

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:12.920
those what I'm talking about yeah I I
 

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.890
those what I'm talking about yeah I I
think I think that would be like think

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:14.900
think I think that would be like think
 

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.000
think I think that would be like think
it's being implied that he's being

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:16.010
it's being implied that he's being

obsessive and he's probably over
calculating the crap out of this and

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:19.550
calculating the crap out of this and
 

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:20.949
calculating the crap out of this and
they probably have more time than it's

00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:20.959
they probably have more time than it's
 

00:14:20.959 --> 00:14:22.540
they probably have more time than it's
being led on okay well they could make

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:22.550
being led on okay well they could make
 

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:24.730
being led on okay well they could make
that a little bit more clear even though

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:24.740
that a little bit more clear even though
 

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.470
that a little bit more clear even though
he's eccentric they've shown his ideas

do well I mean what you've learn now is

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:28.610
do well I mean what you've learn now is
 

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:30.550
do well I mean what you've learn now is
when you calculate things you always add

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560
when you calculate things you always add
 

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.740
when you calculate things you always add
like two hours yeah now I double my time

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:32.750
like two hours yeah now I double my time
 

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:35.170
like two hours yeah now I double my time
he's probably doing that right now is

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:35.180
he's probably doing that right now is
 

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:39.400
he's probably doing that right now is
what I'm guessing but um it's these two

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:39.410
what I'm guessing but um it's these two
 

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:41.850
what I'm guessing but um it's these two
competing philosophies going on and in

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:41.860
competing philosophies going on and in
 

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.199
competing philosophies going on and in
and what they end up doing is just both

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:43.209
and what they end up doing is just both
 

00:14:43.209 --> 00:14:46.620
and what they end up doing is just both
of them simultaneously and that's why I

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:46.630
of them simultaneously and that's why I
 

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:48.030
of them simultaneously and that's why I
think it worked that's why I think it

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.040
think it worked that's why I think it
 

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.759
think it worked that's why I think it
works you know the the question is if

00:14:50.759 --> 00:14:50.769

there's two it's basically these two
 

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:47.130
there's two it's basically these two
philosophies are just colliding and

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:47.140
philosophies are just colliding and
 

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.449
philosophies are just colliding and
they'll collide all the way to the very

00:15:48.449 --> 00:15:48.459
they'll collide all the way to the very
 

00:15:48.459 --> 00:15:50.310
they'll collide all the way to the very
end that I mean I don't think either one

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:50.320
end that I mean I don't think either one
 

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.990
end that I mean I don't think either one
is necessarily a hundred percent right

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000
is necessarily a hundred percent right
 

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.800
is necessarily a hundred percent right
or wrong yeah I mean uh stray money get

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:55.810
or wrong yeah I mean uh stray money get
 

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:57.689
or wrong yeah I mean uh stray money get
you it's usually not best to deal with

you it's usually not best to deal with
the experience yeah I mean there's

00:15:59.850 --> 00:15:59.860
the experience yeah I mean there's
 

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.380
the experience yeah I mean there's
always going to be a job the one the one

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:01.390
always going to be a job the one the one
 

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:03.509

thing this show keeps hammering in again

00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519
thing this show keeps hammering in again
 

00:16:03.519 --> 00:16:05.280
thing this show keeps hammering in again
again is there's always an alternate way

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:05.290
again is there's always an alternate way
 

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:09.780
again is there's always an alternate way
so you know which is good because

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:09.790
so you know which is good because
 

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.280
so you know which is good because

00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:23.490
so I don't know it didn't bother me that
much because I feel it's another way to

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:23.500
much because I feel it's another way to
 

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.290
much because I feel it's another way to
