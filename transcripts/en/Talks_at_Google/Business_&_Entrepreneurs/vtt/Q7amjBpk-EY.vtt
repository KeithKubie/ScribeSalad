[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.020
KAREN LELAND: Good afternoon.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.530
Well, I am so
delighted to be here.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.280
Google is really one
of my favorite places

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.654
to work and to talk.

00:00:13.654 --> 00:00:15.070
So what I want to
talk about today

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.710
is I want to talk about
what I call the contribution

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.810
gap and our personal brands.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.040
So a few years ago, I
had a six month period,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.940
and in that six month period
I left a long marriage--

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.220
after a couple of decades--
and got a divorce.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.830
My step-- all within six
months-- my stepfather

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:33.490
dropped dead.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.500
My stepfather died
of a lung disease.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.310
My father dropped dead after a
heart attack two weeks later.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.440
I moved from
California to New York

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.380
and then back to
California again.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.695
And as one of my friends said--

00:00:46.695 --> 00:00:48.070
you know how
there's those scales

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.610
of things you're not supposed
to do because they can kill you?

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.170
There's things like
move or a death

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.800
in the family-- they
increase the rate of death.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.630
She said, you're
not supposed to do

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.670
even one of them,
let alone all six

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.800
of them in a short
period of time.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.920
And so it really made me stop.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.780
And I had to stop, and
I had to step back,

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.397
and I had to take
a look at, what

00:01:06.397 --> 00:01:08.230
did I want the next
period of my life to be?

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.780
What really was my contribution
in the next period of my life?

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.190
And so I went on this long,
yearlong research project

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.910
about--

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.160
what is really at the
heart of our contribution?

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.320
What is really at the heart
of our personal brands?

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.945
And what I want to
share with you today

00:01:21.945 --> 00:01:23.639
is what I found
out in that year,

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:25.180
because what I found
out in that year

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.420
really changed my own personal
brand-- it changed how I think

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.470
about things, it
changed how I work,

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.560
it changed how I
work with clients.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.350
And I found that, in
that research that I did,

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.680
there's a lot we can learn about
our brands and our contribution

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.415
that isn't always the way
that we talk about them.

00:01:41.415 --> 00:01:43.540
So that's what I want to
talk about with you today.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.090
I want to share what I learned
in that research with you

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.935
today.

00:01:46.935 --> 00:01:48.220
The first thing I want
to ask you to do--

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.020
I know everyone's sat
down-- but the first thing

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.790
I'd love to ask
everybody to do is just

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.442
to stand up for one minute.

00:01:54.442 --> 00:01:56.900
And I know you just sat down,
but stand up for one minute--

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.930
and what I'd like you to do is
say hello to one or two people

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.000
around you, only
here's the catch--

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.590
say hello like
you're really looking

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.190
for someone a lot more important
to say hello to, all right?

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.199
So if everybody would
just do that for a minute.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.199
Go ahead and say hello.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:15.440
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.800
KAREN LELAND: All right, now
would you please say hello

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.920
to somebody next to
you or around you,

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.050
but say hello like they're
your long-lost friend

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.397
and you're thrilled to
have found them again.

00:02:26.397 --> 00:02:32.105
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:02:32.105 --> 00:02:33.710
KAREN LELAND: All right, stop.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.830
Very good, thank
you, and have a seat.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.600
So you know how
in that first one,

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.300
it was a little bit
like, meh, so-so.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.170
And the second one--

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.070
the volume-- I saw many
more hugs in the second one

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.810
and the volume goes up.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.529
I think when we have
a really strong idea

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:52.820
of our personal brand, and
we have a really strong idea

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.130
of what we contribute,
it's much easier

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.360
to connect with other people.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.850
It's almost like we walk
into the room with that,

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.060
because that sense of connection
is much more palatable.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.440
And it isn't that it's bad--

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.190
the first experience--
it's just a little empty.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.650
And what I call that is
the contribution gap.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.690
When we're really clear
about our brand, when

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.030
we're really clear about
our contribution, then

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.029
what we have a way to
instantly almost connect

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:17.820
with other people--

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.530
Whether these are
people at a conference,

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.030
whether they're
people we work with,

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.390
whether they're people
in a social situation.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.450
It gives us that sense of
what our contribution is.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.830
We walk in with that.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.070
And so what I studied
in that year that I had

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.620
was what the contribution
gap was in my own life

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.827
and what the contribution gap
was in other people's lives.

00:03:39.827 --> 00:03:41.660
And one of the things
I found in my research

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.810
is one of the things that
gets in the way of our brands

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.874
being the strongest
and our contribution--

00:03:46.874 --> 00:03:48.290
making our greatest
contribution--

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.690
is what I call
the myth of roles.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.850
And this is all the
I ams in our life--

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:53.900
I am a mother.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.010
I am a wife.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.110
I am a software engineer.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.760
I am a dancer.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.290
I am a cat lover.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.540
I am a dog lover.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.450
I'm a fan of "Game of Thrones."

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.360
Whatever your I ams are,
whatever your roles are--

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.900
and so I discovered that
these roles, really,

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.160
are one of the things that get
in the way of our contribution.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.035
And for some of you--

00:04:14.035 --> 00:04:15.743
what are some of the
roles that you have?

00:04:15.743 --> 00:04:16.910
You can just shout it out--

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.594
some of the roles that you
have, personal or professional.

00:04:19.594 --> 00:04:20.089
AUDIENCE: Daughter.

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:21.422
KAREN LELAND: Daughter, exactly.

00:04:21.422 --> 00:04:22.693
What else?

00:04:22.693 --> 00:04:23.446
AUDIENCE: Husband.

00:04:23.446 --> 00:04:24.570
KAREN LELAND: Husband, yes.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.717
What else?

00:04:25.717 --> 00:04:26.550
AUDIENCE: Room mate.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.260
KAREN LELAND: Room
mate, exactly.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.010
AUDIENCE: Googler.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.910
KAREN LELAND: Googler,
yes, very important role.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.910
But what's the problem
with all roles eventually?

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.300
What happens to all
roles eventually?

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.810
They end, right?

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.840
By their nature, all
roles eventually end.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.540
And so if we think our
contribution or the heart

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.079
of our contribution
is about our roles,

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:49.620
then what happens
is-- when they end,

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.799
we find ourselves
going, well who am I?

00:04:51.799 --> 00:04:53.340
What is it that I
have to contribute?

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.130
That's a lot of what
happened when my father died,

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.440
and I stopped being someone's--
my father's daughter.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.620
I was still my
mother's daughter,

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.119
but when I stopped
being my father's

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:02.560
daughter-- or when
I got a divorce

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.350
and I was now not
someone's wife.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.150
And you know, all
of these roles--

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.840
and I wasn't a
Californian anymore--

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.780
and so all these roles
started to change.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.322
And I started to say, well, if
I'm not all of that, who am I?

00:05:12.322 --> 00:05:14.029
So one of the things
that gets in the way

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:15.870
of our personal brands
and our contributions

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.640
is this myth of the roles--

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.129
who we think we are.

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.670
The other thing I discovered in
my research-- and by the way,

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.630
I interviewed several
thousand people

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.730
all over the world in
different companies.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.594
And male, female,
despite age, race,

00:05:30.594 --> 00:05:32.010
gender-- it didn't
matter-- what I

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.880
found was there was a
lot of commonalities.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.850
And the other
commonality was this myth

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.110
of knowledge and results.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.070
A lot of us define our
brands and our contribution

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.720
by the results we
produce or what we know.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.160
The writer Gretchen Cryer calls
that, I know the worlds of.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.930
So what are the
worlds that we know?

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.210
Like you might know the
worlds of volleyball,

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.910
or the world of travel,
or the world of Google,

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.490
or the world of speaking
French, or the world of dogs--

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.740
there's a million worlds
that you can know.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.900
And all that is
part of our brand,

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.090
but that's not the heart
of our contribution

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.546
or the heart of our brand.

00:06:04.546 --> 00:06:06.420
And so the other thing
I found in my research

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.690
is that people often get
very stifled because they

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.260
think that their brand--

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.980
or they think that
their contribution--

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.820
are these worlds that they know.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.160
So if it's not those
two things, what is it?

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.870
Well, here's what I
found in my research.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.050
I found that our brands
and our contribution--

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.990
at the heart of them is
what I call the weather

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.490
you bring with you.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.150
It's the thing-- when
you walk into the room,

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.230
it just comes with you.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.620
It's the thing that
people feel from us.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.850
It's the thing that
people can sense about us

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.490
and feel from us the moment
they walk into a room

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.121
without knowing
anything about us.

00:06:42.121 --> 00:06:43.620
So I'll give you
an example of this.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.580
I was walking in the Lower East
Side of Manhattan about a year

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.960
ago with a friend, and we see
this woman-- a traffic cop--

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.060
and she's directing traffic.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.430
And she isn't just
directing traffic-- she's

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.920
doing it like it's ballet.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.980
Now, I have the greatest respect
for New York City traffic cops.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.440
That is a hard job,
but a lot of them

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.780
often have the
look on their face

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.900
like, this would be a great
job if it wasn't for all

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.360
those people driving cars.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.450
And this woman is leaping,
and she's jumping,

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.120
and she's going, come
on, sir, go this way.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.190
Ladies, cross the street.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.510
She is so alive and
so enthusiastic,

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.250
and we're all just-- all the
pedestrians are standing there

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.350
like this--

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:27.580
wow.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.350
And we're just watching this,
and the cars are honking at her

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.709
and waving, and she is this
great example of bringing

00:07:33.709 --> 00:07:35.000
the weather you bring with you.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.970
She has just got this
aliveness and this joy,

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.950
and she's making this
amazing contribution.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.480
And of course, she's completely
establishing her brand

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.230
by what she's doing,
but she's doing it

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.020
in this really
enthusiastic, excited way.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.280
And cars are honking--

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.920
and the thing that was
amazing about this woman was,

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.710
did she know she had a
solid role as a traffic cop?

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.000
Yes, I'm sure she did.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.080
Was she knowledgeable?

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.080
Yes, I'm sure she was
knowledgeable in all thing

00:07:59.080 --> 00:07:59.940
traffic laws.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.826
But it wasn't her
role or her knowledge

00:08:01.826 --> 00:08:03.200
that was making
a difference-- it

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.940
was the way she was doing it.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.370
It was the weather that
she was bringing with her

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.820
that was making a difference.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.430
And in the work that I did and
in the research that I did,

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:17.000
I actually found that
there's some archetypes

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.750
or there's some ways that
people typically contribute,

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.937
and I call these brand
energies or brand archetypes.

00:08:23.937 --> 00:08:25.520
These are-- and there
were 12 of them.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.260
I actually could
identify and find

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:32.419
12 core brand archetypes of how
we approach our personal brands

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.084
and how we contribute.

00:08:34.084 --> 00:08:36.250
And the interesting thing
about these brand energies

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:40.280
is all of us have access
to all these energies.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.220
Any of us can step into
any of these at any time.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.980
But usually, there's
one or two that-- when

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:50.210
we look back to being kids--
we can see that way, way, way

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:51.785
back, we had this.

00:08:51.785 --> 00:08:54.650
This is something that
we had, even as kids.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:58.520
This has always, in a way, been
what we bring to the party.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.544
It's been the weather
that we bring with us.

00:09:00.544 --> 00:09:02.960
And so I wanted to go through
these 12 archetypes with you

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.376
because I want you to think
about-- as I go through them--

00:09:05.376 --> 00:09:06.920
where do you see yourself?

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.210
But where do you see the
people that you work with?

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.230
Because one of the other
things I found in the research

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:15.050
was that the best
marriages, the best teams,

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:18.410
the best departments, the
best problem solving groups--

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:22.410
all of those people had people
with different contribution

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.020
styles with different
brand energies--

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.850
that it wasn't just one.

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:27.890
That when you had
people with a mix--

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:31.760
when you had more of a diversity
of contribution style--

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.909
things went a lot better because
people brought different things

00:09:34.909 --> 00:09:35.450
to the party.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:38.390
So I'm going to go through the
12 that I discovered with you.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:39.890
Now, for the
overachievers in here

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.890
who are like, no, I'm not
just one or two, I'm all 12--

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:44.600
fine, you can be all 12.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.190
But generally,
you'll notice-- as I

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:50.192
go through-- that you usually
tend to be leaning more

00:09:50.192 --> 00:09:52.650
in the direction of one or the
other, and that's important.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.024
It's important to
know which ones

00:09:54.024 --> 00:09:56.630
you are because
then you can invite

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.890
other people to the party--

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.410
and to be on teams with
you and to work with you--

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.900
who are different-- who
actually bring a different kind

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.430
of energy and contribution.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.100
And when you're
putting teams together,

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.050
you can consciously
think about, how

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:10.700
am I going to have
this team reflect

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.820
all of those different kinds
of energies or at least a mix

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.401
so it's not just one type?

00:10:15.401 --> 00:10:16.400
So here was one of them.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.860
These are people whose
weather they bring with them--

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.960
their contribution--
is the fixer.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.330
And the fixer is the
person that's the healer--

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.370
they're a restorer,
they're the mender.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.770
These are the people that
you give when a problem needs

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:30.440
to be solved because you know
that that's the thing that they

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.310
love.

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:33.530
My friend Joanne used to
talk about her dad, who

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:34.350
was in real estate.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:38.324
And she'd say her father would
come into work every morning.

00:10:38.324 --> 00:10:40.490
He'd sit down at his desk,
he'd roll up his sleeves,

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:44.010
he'd get his cup of coffee
out, and he literally say, OK,

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.130
what problems do we have today?

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:47.190
And he was excited--

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.972
he was excited to see
what problems showed up.

00:10:49.972 --> 00:10:52.430
Now, I don't know about you,
but I do not go into my office

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:55.670
every morning and go, wow what
problems do we have today?

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.400
That tends not to be my
relationship with problems.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.100
I have other things
I do, but not that.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.810
So fixers love problems.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:05.427
That's one of the things
that's in that archetype.

00:11:05.427 --> 00:11:07.010
They are really those
kind of people--

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.500
useful people to have on
a team-- useful energy

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.740
to have because those people
are able to literally take

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:16.169
that attitude towards making
something better and solve it.

00:11:16.169 --> 00:11:17.960
Then you have people
that are facilitators,

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.430
and this archetype
is people that

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:22.571
are mediators, and
moderators, and go-betweens.

00:11:22.571 --> 00:11:24.320
These are the people
that are able to take

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.650
all these different groups
and different people

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.290
and get them aligned and
going in the same direction.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:31.580
Amazing skill to have, right?

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.960
Amazing contribution to make.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.740
Then you have people
that are storytellers.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.500
And storytellers
are these narrators,

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.384
and orators, and minstrels.

00:11:41.384 --> 00:11:43.550
These are the people--
whether it's through writing,

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.350
or whether it's
through painting,

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:48.320
or whether it's through video,
or whether it's through dance,

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.940
or whether it's
through theater--

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.900
these are the people that are
able to convey this emotion

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.820
and this feeling through story.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.550
And those are incredibly
important people to have

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:01.490
in our world, and in our life,
and on our teams because when

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:03.470
you have that brand of
being a storyteller--

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.540
when that's the weather
you bring with you--

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.520
you're able to translate
all of these things

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.196
in a way that's very powerful.

00:12:09.196 --> 00:12:11.570
You know, one of the things
that I learned in my research

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:15.027
was that metaphor and stories
was one of the best way

00:12:15.027 --> 00:12:16.610
to get your point
across to somebody--

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.160
that when you could speak
in metaphors and stories,

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.340
people were able to hear it in
a much different way than when

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.969
it was just pure, straight
facts and figures.

00:12:25.969 --> 00:12:27.760
Then you have people
that are synthesizers.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.500
And people who-- the
weather they bring with them

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.260
as synthesizers, and the energy
that they bring with them--

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.450
these are the integrators,
and the blenders,

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:35.881
and the producers.

00:12:35.881 --> 00:12:37.630
These are the people
that are able to take

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:41.470
all these disparate things,
put them together, and create

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:42.520
something new.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.170
And those synthesizers
are people

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.170
that we rely on because
they're able to see something

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:49.360
new in all of the
different elements.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.990
And it's a really
wonderful, rich archetype

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.510
and a really wonderful
and rich brand energy,

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:56.920
because bringing
all those things

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.830
together is often the
thing that transforms it--

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.990
you know, from a
caterpillar to a butterfly--

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:05.417
transforms into something
brand new and beautiful.

00:13:05.417 --> 00:13:07.000
Then you have people
that are mentors,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.041
and the mentors are
interesting because these are

00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:10.920
the people whose contribution--

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.270
their real essence
of their brand

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.850
is being advisors, and
teachers, and guides.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.180
And I love this picture.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.720
This is actually a photo
that I took at the--

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.820
I think it's the Wizarding
World of Harry Potter.

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.100
I was visiting with some
friends and their kids,

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.160
and this little kid saw
one of these Minions.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.010
And the look on
this child's face

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:31.660
was like he had just seen God--

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:32.940
[GASP]

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.950
And the parent's there, and the
kid wanders up to the Minion,

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:38.410
and you can see the way
he's just kissing the Minion

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:39.580
and looking at him.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.910
But often, our relationship with
mentors is-- we look up to them

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:45.172
and we admire them so
much because-- it's

00:13:45.172 --> 00:13:47.380
the people with this energy--
they're the people that

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.830
are really shepherding us along,
and helping us make our goals,

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:54.520
and helping us be the best
people that we can be.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.620
And so this mentor
energy is incredibly

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.570
important and valuable
as a contribution.

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:01.600
That's the thing about
all these archetypes.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.200
One isn't better than the other.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.020
One is not more
useful than the other.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.660
One isn't more desirable
than the other.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.760
They're all useful,
and that's why

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.190
when you have teams,
or groups, or people

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:15.130
that have a mix of
them together, you

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.260
tend to get a better
result because you're

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.310
getting all of these
different energies together.

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:21.850
You're getting all of these
different archetypes, which

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:25.390
you can see, you really need
to produce the best outcome.

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:29.080
And really owning the
archetype that we are-- really

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.870
owning what our
contribution is, and being

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.880
certain about our
contribution, and really

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.280
making it is a big
part of people who

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.600
have strong personal brands.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.420
They know-- to the
depth of their being--

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.240
what that contribution
is, and they trust it.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.072
They trust their
own contribution.

00:14:45.072 --> 00:14:46.780
That is what I found
in my research-- was

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.680
these people were very solid
in what their contribution was.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.260
It doesn't mean they couldn't
step into other energies,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.832
but they really saw the
depth of that contribution.

00:14:57.832 --> 00:14:59.540
Then you have people
that are connectors.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.000
These are some of
my favorite kinds

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.590
of energies-- these people
that are connectors.

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:04.590
And these are the networkers,
and the arrangers,

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:05.465
and the coordinators.

00:15:05.465 --> 00:15:08.048
These are the people that you'll
go to a party and they'll go,

00:15:08.048 --> 00:15:09.550
hey, you should
know such and such,

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:12.100
and I'm going to do an email
and introduce you to this person

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.817
because you two should
talk to each other

00:15:13.817 --> 00:15:15.400
about this, that,
and the other thing.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.461
They're always putting
people together.

00:15:17.461 --> 00:15:19.210
And the people they
put together magically

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:20.960
seem to be perfect for
each other in terms

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.190
of the contribution they
can make to each other.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:26.050
Then you have people
that are visionaries,

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.630
and the visionaries are
the conceptualizers,

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.916
and the idealists,
and the dreamers.

00:15:30.916 --> 00:15:32.290
And these are the
people that are

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:35.200
able to see something
and actually come up

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.960
with the concept of
what it should be.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.770
These are the people that are
actually able to stop and go,

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:42.520
hmm, we're doing it
this way, but maybe we

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.900
could do it that way.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:47.574
This is sort of this
ideal that I have.

00:15:47.574 --> 00:15:49.240
Then we have people
that are motivators,

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.450
and motivators are a little
bit different than mentors.

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:54.640
They might mentor, but
motivators are those people

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.190
that can light a fire under us.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:58.240
They're the cheerleaders,
and the influencers,

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.680
and the persuaders.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.210
These are the people
that really can

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.240
get a group of people going
on a team, in a group,

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.842
individually, with friends.

00:16:05.842 --> 00:16:08.050
These are the people that
they just walk in the door,

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.990
and what they bring with them
is this instant cheeriness,

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:14.930
and influence, and
ability to persuade.

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:16.880
Then you have the people
that are the makers,

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.770
and these are the
artisans, and the creators,

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:19.880
and the inventors.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.340
And these people
could be creating code

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.519
or they could be
creating paintings.

00:16:24.519 --> 00:16:26.810
I have this thing I talk
about, is the everyday artist.

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:28.760
One of the things I
discovered in my research

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.840
was everyone is what I
call an everyday artist.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.240
Every single person
has something

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.401
about what they do that's art.

00:16:37.401 --> 00:16:39.150
Doesn't matter if
they're computer coding,

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:40.350
it doesn't matter
if they're a doctor,

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:41.975
it doesn't matter if
they're a painter.

00:16:41.975 --> 00:16:44.580
Everyone has something that
they do that a part of it

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:45.630
is their art.

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:48.030
It's the way they do it
where they're creating.

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:50.940
And these people
literally are driven

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.820
by inventing, and
creating, and art.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.830
That's their whole world.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:57.230
It's not just painting.

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:58.980
It's not just being on stage.

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.650
It could be-- I've known
that are artisans that

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:02.730
that's their makers--

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:05.490
that's their essential self--

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:08.551
their essential contribution,
and what they're making is code

00:17:08.551 --> 00:17:10.050
or what they're
making are products.

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:13.334
But it's that feeling of
that they're creating.

00:17:13.334 --> 00:17:15.000
Then you have people
that are advocates,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.374
and these are the
people that are

00:17:16.374 --> 00:17:18.900
the activists, and the
champions, and the campaigners.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.150
These are the people that
you invite to a dinner party

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:22.140
and they can't help
it-- they're going

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.640
to talk about what
they're passionate about

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.980
and what they're advocating
for, no matter what-- even

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:26.760
at a dinner party.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.259
That's their energy that
they bring with them.

00:17:29.259 --> 00:17:31.050
Then you have people
that are implementers,

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:34.470
and these are achievers, and
administrators, and executors.

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:37.680
These people are awesome because
it's one thing to have ideas,

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:42.390
it's another thing to have those
ideas actually get implemented.

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:45.330
And so these people are really
amazing at taking something

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.879
from a concept to an idea
and making it happen.

00:17:48.879 --> 00:17:50.670
Then you have people
that are interpreters,

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:52.044
and these are the
people that are

00:17:52.044 --> 00:17:54.810
able to translate, and
change, and transform

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:57.780
an idea or a group of
ideas, and interpret it

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.630
in a way that's something
completely new happens--

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:02.100
that [? something ?]
completely new

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.100
occurs because they're able to
take all those different parts

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.700
and not only synthesize them,
but interpret them in a totally

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.890
new and different way.

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:14.440
So what gets in the
way of those things?

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.610
Those are some of our
contributions and archetypes.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:18.830
What gets in the way of them?

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:21.872
Well, the first thing is--
is do you know what yours is?

00:18:21.872 --> 00:18:23.830
Can you have a sense of
what your archetype is?

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:25.455
Actually, what I'd
love everybody to do

00:18:25.455 --> 00:18:27.400
is just kind of quickly
pair up with someone

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.610
next to you, and of those
ones that I just ran through,

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.890
which one or two do
you think you are?

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:35.217
Which one resonates
most strongly with you?

00:18:35.217 --> 00:18:37.300
And then, which one or two
reminded you of someone

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:37.799
you know?

00:18:37.799 --> 00:18:40.540
So everybody just get a
partner and really quickly just

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.190
with your partner,
share what that is.

00:18:45.115 --> 00:18:45.970
Great.

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:48.760
So let me just share some
examples of which one

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.212
resonated with you personally.

00:18:51.212 --> 00:18:52.920
Which ones resonated
with you personally,

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.104
let me just hear some examples.

00:18:56.104 --> 00:18:57.520
AUDIENCE: I would
say a visionary.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.519
KAREN LELAND: Visionary?

00:18:58.519 --> 00:18:59.240
OK, great.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.825
Who else?

00:19:00.825 --> 00:19:02.200
AUDIENCE: I'd say
an implementer.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.770
KAREN LELAND: An implementer?

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:04.280
OK.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.330
See now, what's interesting is
if we put these two together,

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:07.890
they're a perfect pair, right?

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:08.970
Because we have
the vision and then

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.140
we have the implementation.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.904
What happens when you have a
team just of all visionaries?

00:19:12.904 --> 00:19:14.070
AUDIENCE: Nothing gets done.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.236
KAREN LELAND: They're happy.

00:19:15.236 --> 00:19:18.240
They're excited, but nothing
gets done because they're not

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:18.870
implementers.

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:22.045
What happens when you have
a team of all implementers?

00:19:22.045 --> 00:19:23.920
AUDIENCE: They can go
in the wrong direction.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.950
KAREN LELAND: They
can-- yeah, they're

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:26.180
awesome at getting
it done, but they

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.620
could be going in
the wrong direction,

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.860
or they could be going in
a limited direction, which

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.270
is why we need
everyone's contribution--

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:35.067
which is why this
diversity of contribution

00:19:35.067 --> 00:19:37.400
is really, really important--
why it's important to have

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.710
this inclusion of
different people

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:42.804
who have different
contributions to bring in teams,

00:19:42.804 --> 00:19:43.720
and groups, et cetera.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.020
Who else?

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.380
Let me just hear a
few other examples.

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:45.880
Over here.

00:19:48.675 --> 00:19:50.300
AUDIENCE: There's
connectors back here.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.260
KAREN LELAND:
There's connectors?

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.120
KAREN LELAND: You're
all together--

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.494
the connectors
are all connected.

00:19:54.494 --> 00:19:56.090
OK, perfect.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:58.634
You managed to find
each other, great.

00:19:58.634 --> 00:20:00.800
So how many of you could
see your coworkers in this?

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:01.921
Just raise your hands.

00:20:01.921 --> 00:20:02.420
Yeah.

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:03.760
Your bosses?

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.360
Your wives?

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.675
Anybody see their animals?

00:20:06.675 --> 00:20:08.300
Every once in a while
people say to me,

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:09.680
I think my dogs a connector.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.470
I'm like, OK.

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:13.991
So what gets in the way of this?

00:20:13.991 --> 00:20:16.490
Well, one of the things I found
in the research was that one

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.170
of the big things
that gets in the way--

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:20.030
that creates a
contribution gap--

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.250
is our fear of missing out.

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:25.880
And we live in a world
where it's easier than ever

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.950
to have this fear of
missing out, isn't it?

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:31.830
Because every time we turn
on the iPhone or the Google--

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.500
whatever we're
using-- whatever PDA

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.958
we're using-- the Google, the
iPhone, whatever-- every time

00:20:35.958 --> 00:20:37.430
we turn it on, what happens?

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:40.290
We look at Facebook
and we see, oh,

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:43.280
that person's living so much
of a better life than I am.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.085
They're having so much
more fun than I am.

00:20:45.085 --> 00:20:48.260
And doesn't everyone's life
look so much better than ours?

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.395
Come on, tell the truth.

00:20:49.395 --> 00:20:51.020
It's like I'm always
looking and going,

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.840
well wow, Kim Kardashian
didn't retweet my picture

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.730
of my macaroni and cheese.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:56.750
How come?

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:59.270
I want to be the
mother of dragons.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.690
So what happens is we have
this fear of missing out

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.180
that happens-- in part,
we have-- social media's

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:08.090
been wonderful for a lot
of things, and I love it,

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:10.520
but it's also contributed
to this fear of missing out.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.840
It's contributed to this idea
that, somehow, everybody's

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.639
living this better
life than we are.

00:21:16.639 --> 00:21:18.680
And the fear of missing
out was one of the things

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.480
that my research
showed really got

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.330
in the way of
people's contribution.

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:25.940
And it also created
a sense of isolation.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:29.150
It created a sense of, I'm
sort of here in my world

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:30.740
doing my thing, and
other people are

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.440
in their world
doing their thing,

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.207
and we're not really
always connecting--

00:21:35.207 --> 00:21:37.040
even though we might
be connected on social,

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.810
we're not always connecting.

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:40.610
So what I found in
the research was

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:43.970
that this fear of missing out
led to a sense of emptiness

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.760
that had people not
really believe or have

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.480
faith in their contribution--
like their contribution wasn't

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.440
enough.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.620
Their contribution was somehow
insufficient or not enough

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.420
to bring to the party.

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.860
That's one of the things
that gets in the way.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.339
So how do you bridge that gap?

00:22:00.339 --> 00:22:02.630
Well, I think you bridge that
gap a couple of the ways,

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:04.010
and one of the
ways you bridge it

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:07.070
is by practicing what
my friend Lynette calls

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:08.727
the joy of missing out.

00:22:08.727 --> 00:22:10.310
So instead of the
fear of missing out,

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:12.320
you practice the
joy of missing out.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.459
I love Lynette because I
will say to her, Lynette,

00:22:14.459 --> 00:22:15.750
do you want to go to the movie?

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:18.572
And she'll go, yeah, no, I don't
really feel like doing that.

00:22:18.572 --> 00:22:20.780
And I'll go, OK well, Lynette
do you want to do this?

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:21.860
No, I don't think so.

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.940
It's not like Lynette
doesn't participate.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.720
She just isn't afraid
of missing out on things

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:30.340
so she really has that
joy of not doing things.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.680
And how many times
do we do something

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.577
because we have a fear
of missing out on it?

00:22:35.577 --> 00:22:37.160
We're just afraid
to say no because we

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.650
might miss this opportunity,
or we might miss this person,

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:41.450
or something might happen?

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:42.710
A few years ago--

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:43.850
I love to travel.

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:45.830
Travel is one of my
most favorite things

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.090
in the world to do.

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:49.040
And a few years
ago, I got invited

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.990
to go with a girlfriend--
a friend of mine

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:52.147
was going to go to Iceland.

00:22:52.147 --> 00:22:54.230
And she had a small group
of people put together--

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:55.039
some friends.

00:22:55.039 --> 00:22:56.330
So I decided to go to Iceland--

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:58.413
I'd never been there-- to
see the northern lights.

00:22:58.413 --> 00:23:01.370
Now, I know that
Iceland is cold,

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:05.600
but I thought Iceland was
cold the way New York is cold.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.370
And what I found
out is, no, Iceland

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:09.700
is not cold the way
New York is cold--

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.990
it's much, much colder.

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:16.290
So I, as a result, was not
properly dressed in Iceland,

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:16.790
and it was--

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:18.680
I think it was in
the winter, too.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:22.160
So I was not properly dressed
in Iceland, and I looked good,

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.330
but I was really cold.

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:26.900
And I was so cold that
I actually got violently

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.180
sick-- like seriously
sick-- in Iceland.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:32.032
And so I spent most of my time
in bed with a cold, recovering.

00:23:32.032 --> 00:23:34.490
It was just one of those trips
that didn't-- nothing turned

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:35.390
out.

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:38.870
Rarely happens when I travel,
but nothing turned out.

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:42.290
And so I got home from Iceland,
and I was like, OK, that's it.

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:44.480
And Lynette and I have a
good friend named Teresa,

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.270
and Teresa said to me-- maybe
a week after I got back from

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:48.140
Iceland--

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:52.164
Karen, a bunch of us are
going to go on a trip.

00:23:52.164 --> 00:23:53.330
Do you want to come with us?

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:56.630
And I was like, hell no.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:58.220
And I think I said
something else,

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.730
but I said hell no, I do
not want to go on that trip.

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:03.860
And they were like, oh
no, it'll really be fun.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.220
It's going to be an
interesting thing.

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.345
And I was like, no, I don't
want to go on the trip.

00:24:07.345 --> 00:24:08.640
It was overseas somewhere.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:13.400
And then about three months
or four months goes by,

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.860
and Teresa's talking
to me about their trip.

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:19.409
And I go-- and I literally say
to her, what do you mean you

00:24:19.409 --> 00:24:20.450
guys are going on a trip?

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:22.260
How come you didn't invite me?

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.020
And she goes, we did invite you.

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.674
You said hell no.

00:24:25.674 --> 00:24:27.840
And I said, oh, I must have
been in my post-Iceland.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.720
She goes, yeah, you were
in your post-Iceland phase.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.760
You were not feeling
like going on that trip.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.342
So anyway, they all
went on the trip

00:24:33.342 --> 00:24:35.300
and they were sending me
pictures from the bus,

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:36.980
and they're all
having a good time.

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.830
And I started feeling that fear
of missing out, like, darn it.

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:40.740
I missed out.

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:42.680
I missed out on
going on that trip.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.050
And then, all of the sudden,
I realized, you know what?

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:47.780
I didn't go on that trip,
but the country they went to

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:49.010
isn't going anywhere.

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:50.900
| didn't go on that
trip, but you know what?

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:52.160
Look at all these
other things I got

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.784
to do because I didn't
go on that trip.

00:24:53.784 --> 00:24:57.770
And I started to see
how-- even in retrospect--

00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:59.552
we look at things,
and we have this fear

00:24:59.552 --> 00:25:01.760
of missing out about things
that have already passed.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.799
Does everyone know
what I'm talking about?

00:25:03.799 --> 00:25:05.340
And then we spend
our mind, like, oh,

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:06.260
I should have gone
to that meeting,

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.370
or I should have
been at that party,

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:08.810
or I should have
done this thing.

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:12.230
And so this fear of missing
out-- the alternative--

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:14.270
the key to really
giving our contribution

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:16.350
is to step into the
joy of missing out.

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:19.010
It's like really practicing
that if something isn't

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:20.659
the right thing
for us at the time,

00:25:20.659 --> 00:25:22.700
we're going to have the
joy of missing out on it.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:25.280
We're going to have the joy of
saying no to the things that

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:29.110
aren't right and that saying yes
to the things that are right.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:31.120
So I have a contribution
challenge for you,

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.250
and here's the challenge.

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:35.680
It's really in the next month--

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:39.280
only do things that are
really within your greatest

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.150
contribution.

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:42.790
Only do things that are really
on the path of your greatest

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:44.170
contribution.

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:47.350
Only say yes to those
things that really feel

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:49.359
like they're within your gift--

00:25:49.359 --> 00:25:50.650
the gift that you have to give.

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:52.360
Now obviously, there's
things your boss is going

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.484
to ask you to do that you
can't say, oh, I'm sorry,

00:25:54.484 --> 00:25:56.560
that's not within my
gift or my contribution.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.670
I won't be doing that.

00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:58.774
Yeah, don't do that.

00:25:58.774 --> 00:26:00.190
But you know,
there's other things

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:02.560
that you're going to want to say
yes to that really aren't there

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.000
out of a fear of missing out.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.150
Just say no to those
things because saying no

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:09.130
to those things has a
certain power to it.

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:10.750
That makes a huge
difference when you

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.040
start moving in that direction.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.980
So that's one of things
I found is when people

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:16.480
took on this
contribution challenge,

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.589
it made a huge difference.

00:26:19.589 --> 00:26:20.630
The other thing is that--

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:25.220
take a look at how you're
represented in terms

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.090
of your brand in the world.

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:28.430
So what does that mean?

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:31.160
Number one, in business
that means LinkedIn.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.590
Take a look at your
LinkedIn profile and see--

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:35.480
it doesn't really represent me.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.920
I get calls every
day from people

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.170
that ask me to work with
them on their personal brand.

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:41.860
First thing I do is check
out their LinkedIn profiles.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:45.620
And as many of you know,
your LinkedIn profile is--

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:48.152
a lot of people-- like up
to 77% of the people that

00:26:48.152 --> 00:26:49.860
are going to talk to
you or work with you

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.950
are going to check you
out on LinkedIn first.

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:55.190
So having your LinkedIn profile
really reflect and represent

00:26:55.190 --> 00:27:00.170
you is one of the key things to
having your brand in the world

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:01.280
be solidified.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.810
You know, I always
tell people they

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:05.050
should be Googling themselves
at least once a month.

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:06.425
You just put your
name on Google,

00:27:06.425 --> 00:27:09.620
and Google yourself once a
month, and see what comes up.

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:12.390
How are you being
represented in the world?

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:16.520
So your LinkedIn is one of the
places you want to think about,

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.110
how are you
representing your brand?

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:21.334
Are you just giving a
recitation of your--

00:27:21.334 --> 00:27:23.000
everything you've
done-- of your resume,

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.083
or are you actually having
a little bit of-- there

00:27:25.083 --> 00:27:26.150
in the summary--

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:28.145
of who you are and
what you contribute.

00:27:28.145 --> 00:27:30.020
I don't mean writing
the archetypes in there.

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.720
I mean talking a little
bit about what you're

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.670
committed to, talking
a little bit about what

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:36.200
it is you bring to the party.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.390
You know, I always tell
people their summaries ought

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:40.400
to have a little bit of
that feeling of, what's

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.380
the weather you bring with you?

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.270
When that's in your
summary and your Google--

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:46.069
I mean in your
LinkedIn, excuse me--

00:27:46.069 --> 00:27:47.360
then it makes a big difference.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.080
People can get a sense of that.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.725
So one is, are you
represented on your LinkedIn

00:27:51.725 --> 00:27:53.946
in a way where your
brand really shows up?

00:27:53.946 --> 00:27:56.570
Because in the world we live in
today, that's one of the places

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:57.404
people go.

00:27:57.404 --> 00:27:59.570
I don't know if you all
have seen this yet, but now,

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:01.910
on my calendar--

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:04.370
on my cell-- when I go
to meet with somebody

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:07.070
I haven't met with before,
a little message will pop up

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:09.710
that says, you're going to
meet with such-and-such soon.

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:11.840
Would you like to see
their LinkedIn profile?

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.780
So it's automatically
taking me to see

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.120
people's LinkedIn profile
when I'm meeting with someone

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.090
I haven't met with before or
it doesn't recognize as someone

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:20.900
I know.

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:23.016
So that's going to
be just standard.

00:28:23.016 --> 00:28:24.890
I think in about a year,
that's going to just

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:26.840
be built into every
calendar program

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.340
everywhere, regardless
of what you're using.

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.300
So that kind of
access to people is

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.250
part of how our brands
are getting defined.

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:35.660
So how do you show up online?

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.010
What's your LinkedIn look like?

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:39.350
That's the reason LinkedIn's
important-- is because it's

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:40.580
the business-to-business one.

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.680
It's the biggest
business-to-business one.

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.780
But then, how are you
represented on Facebook?

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:49.610
Listen, I know people who
have stuff on Facebook--

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:52.730
pictures-- shots of taking
tequila shots as they get out

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:55.580
of the ocean half-dressed--

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.950
saying really
inflammatory things

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:01.165
politically on both sides of
the aisle-- doesn't matter.

00:29:01.165 --> 00:29:03.290
I have people that have
had stuff on their Facebook

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:06.097
that I'm saying, do you want
an employer to really see that?

00:29:06.097 --> 00:29:08.180
Do you want a potential
client you're meeting with

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.050
to really see that?

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:11.690
Because that's shaping
their narrative about you,

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:13.290
and they can find it.

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:15.950
So part of it is thinking
about how, also, do we

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:17.450
represent ourselves online?

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:20.150
I think we've gotten really
loose about just putting

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:23.180
anything online we want
on Facebook or Twitter,

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:25.640
and while there's a certain
freedom to that-- a freedom

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.430
of expression-- there's also
a certain consequence in terms

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:30.510
of how it shapes our
brand in the world.

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:33.110
So it's thinking about the
social media and how are you

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:34.820
represented in social media.

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.320
And then the other
thing is thinking

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.260
about what I call--
these are brand projects.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.900
What projects do
you take on at work?

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:45.329
What projects do you say yes to
that can help shape your brand,

00:29:45.329 --> 00:29:47.870
and what projects do you say no
to because they're really not

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:49.130
on your path?

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:51.505
Oftentimes we don't look
for those brand projects,

00:29:51.505 --> 00:29:52.130
and we need to.

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:54.620
We need to look for
projects at work that

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.786
help us shape that brand.

00:29:56.786 --> 00:29:59.160
And then there's other ways
to start to build your brand,

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:02.870
whether it's a podcast, or
it's blogging, or it's writing,

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:05.870
or it's doing articles, or
it's speaking on panels.

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:08.120
Everyone today-- for
their own career--

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.400
has to start to
think about, what

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.161
is my strategy for
managing my personal brand?

00:30:13.161 --> 00:30:15.410
Obviously, you have to take
a few things into account.

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:18.530
One is, what do the policies
of your company let you do?

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:20.210
There are some
limitations, usually,

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:21.710
with companies about
what we can do.

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:24.920
So given that you're operating
within those policies,

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.100
what are you going to do?

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.766
The other thing is,
what are your gifts?

00:30:27.766 --> 00:30:30.440
If you're a great writer,
then you should probably

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.430
be doing some writing.

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:34.070
You should probably be
blogging somewhere or at least

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:36.650
contributing to some articles
if you're a great writer.

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:39.500
If you're a great speaker, maybe
you should be doing a podcast

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.735
or being interviewed on a
podcast for your expertise

00:30:41.735 --> 00:30:43.570
or your area.

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:45.320
If you're really a
good speaker, maybe you

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.960
should be on a panel for a
conference for your area.

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.790
Those are the kinds
of things that you

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:52.910
want to start to think about
building because they take

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:54.950
your contribution
from being something

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:57.020
abstract to something tangible.

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:59.660
And it's one thing for us to
know what our contribution is

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:00.650
and feel it--

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:04.160
it's another thing to make
it tangible in our companies

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.130
and in the world.

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:07.910
And so it's really
on us to make sure

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:10.160
we're shaping our
brands out in the world

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.210
in a way where
people can get it.

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:14.210
And by the way, when I
say shaping our brands,

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:16.550
I don't mean lying,
exaggerating,

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:17.360
making things up--

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.110
I'm not a fan of any of that.

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:22.340
I'm talking about the authentic
expression of who we are

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:23.960
and what's effective for us.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:27.800
But too many people I see
really don't take enough effort

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:28.750
to shape their brand.

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:30.920
One, they think they maybe don't
need to because of the level

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:31.610
they're at.

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:33.470
Two, they don't think they
need to because they're already

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:36.290
gainfully employed, and they're
not looking for another job.

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:38.660
But the reality
is, is those things

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:40.874
do start to shape our brand.

00:31:40.874 --> 00:31:42.540
I'll give you one
really simple example.

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:43.850
This was years ago.

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:45.350
A friend of mine
told me this story.

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:47.141
She used to work in a
company with a woman,

00:31:47.141 --> 00:31:49.580
and the woman was like a
mid-level manager in a Fortune

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:50.510
500 company.

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:51.441
Her name was Susan.

00:31:51.441 --> 00:31:52.940
And Susan would get
in the elevator,

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.590
and oftentimes-- just
because of the floor

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:57.650
she was on and the
timing of her meetings--

00:31:57.650 --> 00:31:59.510
she would often find
herself in the elevator

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:01.432
with the CEO of the company.

00:32:01.432 --> 00:32:02.890
He'd say, Susan,
how are you today?

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:03.420
I'm fine.

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:03.740
How are you?

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:04.100
It's good.

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:04.850
How's everything going?

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:05.370
It's good.

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:06.260
It was a little rainy today.

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:07.310
Oh, was snowing today.

00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:10.202
And that was the degree
of their conversation.

00:32:10.202 --> 00:32:12.410
And then Susan started
working on her personal brand.

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:14.240
And she said one
day she realized

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:19.697
that how she must seem to the
CEO is like the weather girl

00:32:19.697 --> 00:32:21.530
because every time he
asked her how she was,

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:22.887
that's what she talked about.

00:32:22.887 --> 00:32:24.470
So she started to
get in the elevator,

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:25.730
and he would say, Susan,
how are you today?

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:26.570
And she goes, I'm great.

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:27.080
And he'd go, really?

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:27.530
That's good.

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:29.405
And she'd go, yeah, my
team and I are working

00:32:29.405 --> 00:32:30.950
on a really fabulous project.

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:32.960
And every time she saw
the CEO, she would just

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.136
do a little bit like that.

00:32:34.136 --> 00:32:35.510
And within a few
months, she said

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:37.790
she had been invited
to be on a task team

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:40.870
that he was running for a major
initiative in the organization

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:43.950
because she reshaped
his experience of her.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:46.820
He reshaped his
experience of her brand.

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.120
So while we're not trying
to do anything, again,

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.620
that's exaggerating or lying--
we're trying to be authentic.

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:54.080
It's important to be
authentic in our brands.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.960
We have to do it in a way
where other people can get it.

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.120
If they can't get it
and get the message,

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.020
there's no real point to it.

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:02.697
So just remember
that it's not enough

00:33:02.697 --> 00:33:05.030
for you to know what the
weather is you bring with you--

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:07.310
you have to translate
it into ways

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:09.620
that the people you work
with, that the people

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.780
in the outside world
can actually see,

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.820
can actually feel,
that starts to create

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:16.410
that narrative about yourself.

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:18.320
So here's the thing I
want to leave you with.

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.690
It's not what you
know that's important,

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:22.380
it's knowing what's important.

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:25.170
That's what makes a difference,
is knowing what's important.

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:27.080
It's not the script
that you follow,

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.660
it's really the script that
you write for yourself.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.640
And lastly, it isn't
really the weather

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.010
you find but the weather
you bring with you

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.150
that makes the
biggest difference.

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:38.990
So thank you very much for
your time and your attention.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.570
Thank you.

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:40.903
It's been a pleasure to be here.

00:33:40.903 --> 00:33:43.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:46.390
And I am going to
take some questions.

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:49.410
So please, anybody
have any questions

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:52.950
about anything-- about any
aspect of personal branding?

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:54.690
I think we have mics
right there, right?

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:55.814
Is that where the mics are?

00:33:55.814 --> 00:33:56.790
OK, fantastic.

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:58.710
Yes, please.

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:01.020
AUDIENCE: So you talk
about projecting internally

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.721
what you bring, but
I was just wondering

00:34:02.721 --> 00:34:05.220
if you have any advice around
just understanding what you're

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.450
projecting to other people?

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:10.026
So I think we can know ourselves
very well but knowing, also,

00:34:10.026 --> 00:34:11.400
what other people
see and getting

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.570
feedback on that to make
sure that we're [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:15.361
KAREN LELAND: Yeah,
that's a great question

00:34:15.361 --> 00:34:16.920
because here's what happens.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:21.130
It's like you said-- we think
we know how we're coming across,

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:24.060
but I always say you can't see
the inside of your own eyelids.

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:25.170
It's really hard to tell.

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:26.250
So I think one of the things--

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:27.820
there's a couple
of ways to do that.

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.060
One is to have people
that you trust--

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:33.310
and you trust not only
the way they look at you

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:35.100
and their ability to see you--

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:37.139
but you trust that they'll
be honest with you--

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:38.580
and you can ask them,
how do you think

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:39.760
I came across in that meeting?

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.010
What do you think my brand is?

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:42.801
One of things I always
tell all new clients

00:34:42.801 --> 00:34:45.630
to do is I tell them to go
talk to six people they know

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:47.132
and say, if you
were to just give me

00:34:47.132 --> 00:34:49.590
a few descriptions of what you
think my personal brand are,

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:50.639
what are they?

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:52.409
And people often
come back and go--

00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:54.247
they're shocked at
how consistent it is.

00:34:54.247 --> 00:34:55.830
That's what people
are shocked at-- is

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:59.460
how do six different people from
six different places know that?

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:00.840
The shortcut to
this, by the way,

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.580
is ask your spouse,
or your boyfriend,

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:04.980
or girlfriend because
they always know.

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:05.820
They always know.

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:07.403
So that's one thing--
is really what--

00:35:07.403 --> 00:35:09.450
is you can ask the
people that you know.

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:11.520
You can also be more
formal and actually--

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:14.689
when you get your 360s or when
you do something like that--

00:35:14.689 --> 00:35:16.980
you can ask people to give
you their impression of what

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:20.640
your personal brand is as
an additional piece of that.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.547
But it is important
to get that feedback.

00:35:22.547 --> 00:35:24.630
The thing is, you have to
establish a relationship

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:27.210
with people where they're going
to be honest about giving you

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:30.580
that feedback, and that
means no consequences.

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:33.090
So you have to say to
people, you can say anything

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:35.390
that you really see, and
there will be no consequences.

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:36.990
I won't hold it against you.

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:38.730
I won't bring it up, et cetera.

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:41.471
That's one really good
way to do it, thank you.

00:35:41.471 --> 00:35:41.970
What else?

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:42.780
Other questions?

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:43.320
Yes.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.019
AUDIENCE: I got one.

00:35:45.019 --> 00:35:46.810
What about people--
I've seen a lot lately,

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:48.750
people that rebrand their name--

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.030
their own name themselves.

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:52.230
So I see a lot of
executives that-- all

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:54.900
of a sudden-- their
signature's signed off

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:57.180
with a shorter, different name.

00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:58.574
I've got friends
that are lawyers

00:35:58.574 --> 00:36:00.740
that now call themselves
slightly different versions

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:02.960
of their name
because they think--

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.930
for example, one--
her name's Kate.

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:06.900
She now calls herself
Katie, and everyone else

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.060
to call herself Katie.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:09.370
What's your take on--

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:12.660
I think our executive teams seem
to do this branding training,

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:14.640
and then they've all
got different names?

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:15.600
What's your take on--

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:19.752
like I've always thought
you can't choose--

00:36:19.752 --> 00:36:21.210
it has to be organic,
so it seems--

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:22.320
KAREN LELAND: It's like, your
parents gave you that name,

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.440
you should stick with it.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.940
AUDIENCE: It doesn't
feel authentic.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:27.870
So do you teach that, or
what's your take on that?

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:29.890
KAREN LELAND: Now,
I'm-- what's your name?

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:31.210
AUDIENCE: My name's
Brent, and-- yeah--

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:32.043
KAREN LELAND: Brent.

00:36:32.043 --> 00:36:34.840
Because we can make your
the Big-B. I don't know.

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.890
No, I don't generally teach
that people change their name

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:39.690
unless they have a really--

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:41.162
a name that's problematic.

00:36:41.162 --> 00:36:43.620
So I had a woman who called
me, and her company was named--

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:46.470
no kidding-- Isis, and it
was a health care company.

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:48.090
And she called me because she
was very upset, because she

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:50.185
says, I've had this name
of my company for 20 years,

00:36:50.185 --> 00:36:51.434
and I don't want to change it.

00:36:51.434 --> 00:36:53.430
And I'm like, look I'm
sorry, but there's just

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:55.020
no way around this one.

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.520
You are going to have to change
the name of your company.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.940
So are there times when you
have to change your name?

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.130
Yes, but I'm not-- in general--

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:02.820
a fan.

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.050
I'm not criticizing anyone.

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:06.030
If that's what they
want to do, that's fine.

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:09.300
I don't think that's really
what rebranding is about.

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.880
To me that's kind of a
shallow way to rebrand.

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.130
I think what real rebranding
is about is when you've

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:16.796
discovered-- it's like I used to
have a friend that used to say,

00:37:16.796 --> 00:37:18.660
before you can have
a new reputation,

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:20.970
you have to be responsible
for the reputation you

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:22.050
have currently.

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:23.850
So, to me, what
real rebranding is,

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:26.190
is when you realize you
have a certain reputation,

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:27.930
and it's not what
you want, and it's

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:31.200
time to really make some
deep changes in yourself

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.860
and externally to that.

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:34.849
So I think sometimes people do--

00:37:34.849 --> 00:37:36.390
and I don't know
any of these people,

00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:38.105
so I'm not saying
they've done that.

00:37:38.105 --> 00:37:39.480
But I think
sometimes what people

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.354
do is they try to fix
their brand with a name

00:37:41.354 --> 00:37:44.450
change, or a logo change,
or just changing--

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:47.430
I used to wear blue jackets,
now I'm wearing red jackets.

00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:50.040
And all of that's fine,
but that isn't really

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.146
what makes an impact.

00:37:51.146 --> 00:37:52.770
That isn't really
the depth of branding

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:54.280
that really makes a difference.

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:57.360
So I think the problem is when
we try to rebrand in a shallow

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.640
way-- or we try to rebrand
just on the surface,

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.440
I guess would be a
better way to say it--

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.810
when we try to brand
on the surface,

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:06.090
it lacks a certain
impact and depth,

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:08.640
and you run the risk
of seeming inauthentic.

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:12.180
And that's the problem with
that kind of surface rebranding.

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.134
Does that make sense?

00:38:13.134 --> 00:38:14.300
Yeah, it's a great question.

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:15.490
Please.

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:18.090
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm curious if--

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:22.950
in your research-- you
found helpful insights

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:25.140
about vulnerability
because you're

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:28.920
calling us to be authentic-- to
kind of put ourselves out there

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.120
and be more open to scrutiny.

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:34.560
So I'm kind of wondering if
that surfaced in your research,

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.685
and how does that play out?

00:38:35.685 --> 00:38:37.185
KAREN LELAND:
That's-- first of all,

00:38:37.185 --> 00:38:39.660
that's such a great question,
and that absolutely surfaced

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:40.390
in my research.

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:44.220
So how many people here have
seen Brene Brown's TEDx talk--

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:46.780
of the Houston TEDx talk on
the power of vulnerability?

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.070
Anybody seen that in here?

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:50.100
If you haven't, I want
to highly recommend that.

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:52.890
That's a really powerful
video, but, similar to

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:55.680
what Brene Brown is talking
about in that video,

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:59.940
I found that the people that had
the strongest personal brands--

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:01.560
positive personal
brands-- let me

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.210
qualify it like that
because there can

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:04.854
be negative personal brands.

00:39:04.854 --> 00:39:06.270
But people that
had the strongest,

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:08.520
positive personal
brands were people

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.230
that were seen as
being authentic,

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:12.870
and what made them
authentic was their humility

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:14.490
and their vulnerability.

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:17.220
So they were willing to
say, I made that mistake.

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.210
I screwed that up.

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:21.534
I'm trying to do this,
and I failed at it.

00:39:21.534 --> 00:39:23.700
They didn't look like they
were all together-- like,

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:25.616
oh, I've had it all
together, and everything's

00:39:25.616 --> 00:39:28.710
perfect in my life,
and I have 2.7 kids,

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:31.000
and my marriage is fabulous,
and don't I look great?

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.070
They didn't have that.

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:34.090
They were really willing
to say, I'm struggling.

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:35.547
I'm struggling with my kids.

00:39:35.547 --> 00:39:36.880
I'm struggling with my marriage.

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:37.921
I'm struggling in my job.

00:39:37.921 --> 00:39:40.050
I'm having a trouble with
this particular part.

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:42.390
I don't mean they were
dumping it on people,

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:43.920
but they were really,
really willing

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:47.370
to be authentic, and
honest, and vulnerable

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:49.020
about their struggles.

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:51.000
How many of you-- when
you work with somebody

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.160
or you know somebody who's
willing to be authentic

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.200
with you about their
struggles-- you actually

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.900
feel more connected to that
person when they share that?

00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:59.608
How many people have
had that experience?

00:39:59.608 --> 00:40:00.720
Just raise your hands.

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.095
And it's so funny
because I think

00:40:02.095 --> 00:40:04.150
we're afraid that's going
to drive people away.

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:05.640
But in my research,
what I found is

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.799
that people who are willing to
embrace that vulnerability--

00:40:08.799 --> 00:40:10.590
that's what made them
authentic, and that's

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:13.320
what made other people
able to connect with them

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.950
and with their brands.

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:17.640
And they were actually more
able to make their contribution

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:20.760
out of that vulnerability
than less able to make it.

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.300
So yeah, that's
a great question.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:23.141
Thank you.

00:40:23.141 --> 00:40:23.640
What else?

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.867
Other questions, please.

00:40:25.867 --> 00:40:27.200
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name is Brooke.

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:27.970
KAREN LELAND: Hi, Brooke.

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:28.650
AUDIENCE: Thanks for being here.

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:29.960
KAREN LELAND: Pleasure.

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.960
AUDIENCE: Kind of a
tag-along question to that--

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.290
at what point is an overshare--

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:34.140
is it an overshare?

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:37.970
And at what point are
certain taboo subjects--

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:40.102
for example, like relationship
issues, addiction,

00:40:40.102 --> 00:40:42.560
something like that-- what if
you want to share that openly

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:43.730
and vulnerably, but--

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:44.910
KAREN LELAND: That is
such a great question.

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:45.940
Well, one thing is--

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:49.910
I'll tell you a little
story, which is--

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:52.460
when I was writing my last book,
"The Brand Mapping Strategy"

00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:53.570
book, somebody called
me and they told

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:55.730
me to go online and
look at this thing up,

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:57.680
and this woman had
been on Facebook,

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.530
and she had been sharing
about some guy she

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:02.750
had dated the night before,
and it was very explicit,

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:04.192
and whatever.

00:41:04.192 --> 00:41:05.900
I won't tell you any
details because that

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:07.270
would be oversharing.

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:08.660
It was very explicit.

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:12.380
And then somebody else said to
her, why are you putting this

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:13.340
publicly on Facebook?

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.350
And she goes, oh no, I
thought I was sharing it

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:16.070
in the private area.

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:17.750
And they go, no, you're
sharing it publicly.

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:18.740
Everyone can see this.

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:20.739
And it became this whole
thing, and she actually

00:41:20.739 --> 00:41:23.510
got fired from her job
because her client saw it,

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:26.480
and it was pretty risque stuff.

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:31.160
So, I think, one thing is I see
a lot of sharing on Facebook--

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:34.220
that when I see it,
I cringe, and I go,

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.960
that's too much
information-- that's

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.787
oversharing because
anybody can see it.

00:41:38.787 --> 00:41:39.620
A client can see it.

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:40.899
An employer can see it.

00:41:40.899 --> 00:41:43.190
So we used to have this thing
we used to say, which is,

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:45.770
don't put anything in public--

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:48.410
on the Facebook, Twitter,
whatever-- don't put anything

00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:50.300
out there in public
you wouldn't want

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.547
printed on the front page
of The New York Times.

00:41:53.547 --> 00:41:55.880
So when it comes to social
media, that's one of the ways

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.350
to think about it--
how would I feel

00:41:57.350 --> 00:41:59.516
if this was on the front
page of The New York Times?

00:41:59.516 --> 00:42:00.590
Would I be OK with that?

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:01.820
If you would be, then put it.

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:02.986
If you wouldn't, then don't.

00:42:02.986 --> 00:42:05.014
I think when it comes
to the personal sharing,

00:42:05.014 --> 00:42:06.680
I think you have to
make a distinction--

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:10.910
and the distinction is the
container of the relationship

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:12.420
you have with the person.

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.180
In other words, is
this person a coworker

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:15.590
but they're also a friend?

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:17.270
And you talk about
personal things--

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:19.340
I think when there's
that container,

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:22.010
then it's fine, especially
if you have a confidentiality

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:24.440
agreement to share those
things with each other.

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:26.670
I think when the container
is that you're coworkers

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:28.580
but you're not really
personal friends,

00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:31.385
you have to think about, is
that information something

00:42:31.385 --> 00:42:32.760
that's going to
burden the person

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:35.051
because they're going to feel
like they have to keep it

00:42:35.051 --> 00:42:37.552
from other people, so you're
now putting a burden on them?

00:42:37.552 --> 00:42:39.260
Or is it something
that's going to affect

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:42.440
their relationship with
you in a way that's

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.030
negative or difficult?

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:47.540
So I think part of it is-- it's
really a case-by-case basis,

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:50.850
but we have a big problem in
today's world with oversharing.

00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:52.850
I mean, how many of you
go on Facebook sometimes

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:55.040
and you literally go,
why did that person

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:56.390
put that on Facebook?

00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:57.220
You wonder that.

00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:59.442
How many people of you
have wondered that?

00:42:59.442 --> 00:43:01.400
I mean, I could give you
so many more examples,

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.733
and it's-- now we've got
people showing videos of things

00:43:03.733 --> 00:43:07.070
and I'm like, why are they
putting that video on Facebook?

00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:08.092
Does that help?

00:43:08.092 --> 00:43:09.050
Yeah, that's very good.

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:09.920
Thank you.

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.099
Other questions, please.

00:43:12.099 --> 00:43:13.640
AUDIENCE: So I've
been thinking a lot

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:17.320
about juggling kind of an
aspirational personal brand

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:21.140
and something that you really
actually haven't done yet.

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.840
I feel like a couple of
my peers would say, well,

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.340
I'm a marathon runner.

00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:27.800
And you'd say, oh well,
what marathons have you run?

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.590
Well you know, I'm
training for one.

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:30.920
Or I'm a community architect.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:33.200
Well, what communities
have you built?

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.940
And so it's not
dishonest because there's

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:39.320
a genuine desire to get to
that, but it just ends up

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.840
feeling a little shallow
and without integrity,

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:43.850
even though they
do have the skills

00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:46.970
or they're working towards
getting to that brand,

00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:47.990
if that makes sense.

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:51.680
So how would you recommend
working towards something

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:55.770
and trying to get yourself
into that next step

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:57.650
while not being dishonest?

00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:59.820
And it kind of seems
like it's lying, almost.

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:01.060
KAREN LELAND: Right.

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:04.400
Yes, that's a great question
because we have a lot of--

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.680
things get hyped up today.

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:07.670
We hype things up.

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:09.061
Like people say, I'm a writer.

00:44:09.061 --> 00:44:09.560
Really?

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.360
Well, what have you written?

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:13.765
Well, nothing but I'm writing.

00:44:13.765 --> 00:44:15.140
So it's like-- I
think part of it

00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:18.650
is we've lost that distinction
of what those achievements are.

00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:21.510
So I think part of it is--
you really just said it--

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:22.760
it's being honest with people.

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.135
I don't think you need to say,
I'm a-- remember the thing

00:44:25.135 --> 00:44:26.150
about roles?

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:27.980
Marathon runner's a role.

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:31.070
You don't have to identify
yourself by that role to say,

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:35.120
one of my projects this year is
I'm training to run a marathon.

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:37.010
I'm really into the
athletics this year.

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:38.060
I'm really trying to
have a breakthrough

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:39.030
in my athletic ability.

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:40.700
I'm training to run a marathon.

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:43.910
You don't have to give yourself
the label, and I think we are--

00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:46.640
again, I think part of it is
we get into this thing this day

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:48.860
where we feel like we
have to label everything.

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:49.830
I'm a writer.

00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:50.960
I'm a marathon runner.

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.305
I'm an artist-- whatever it is.

00:44:53.305 --> 00:44:54.680
And part of it
is-- if we can let

00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:56.734
go of the identification
with the role,

00:44:56.734 --> 00:44:58.400
then we can talk about
it from the point

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.920
of view of what we're learning.

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:03.290
You know, I'm studying Spanish.

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:05.976
You know, I'm learning
to run a marathon.

00:45:05.976 --> 00:45:08.142
You know, I'm-- what was
the other example you gave?

00:45:08.142 --> 00:45:09.558
AUDIENCE: The
community architect.

00:45:09.558 --> 00:45:11.072
KAREN LELAND: Yeah,
I'm studying how

00:45:11.072 --> 00:45:12.530
to be a community
architect, or I'm

00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:14.900
really passionate about
community architecture.

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:16.700
We don't have to have
ourselves in a fixed

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:17.770
position as the role.

00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:19.230
Does that make sense?

00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:22.070
And part of what happens
with social media

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:24.509
is we get encouraged to
categorize ourselves a lot.

00:45:24.509 --> 00:45:26.300
We get encouraged to
categorize ourselves--

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.940
I can check the boxes for
all of the different things--

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:30.470
like that's what our brand is.

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:33.620
And what I'm saying is our
brand isn't really those roles.

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:36.640
It's what we bring to it--
it's what we contribute.

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:37.640
Like for myself--

00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:39.410
I consider myself
a lifelong learner.

00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:42.260
I'm always going to
be learning something.

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:44.480
When I was in my 40s,
I took up tap dancing.

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.730
I wasn't very good at it,
but I would never say,

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:47.900
I'm a tap dancer.

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:49.564
No one would ever say that.

00:45:49.564 --> 00:45:51.980
But I would say to people,
yeah, I'm studying tap dancing.

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:53.160
It's really fun.

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:54.390
I'm learning a lot--

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:57.080
because I didn't have to
be identified in the role.

00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:59.450
So it's like it's a matter
of what-- like right now,

00:45:59.450 --> 00:46:02.420
I'm learning to make jewelry,
but I would never call myself

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:03.740
a jeweler.

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:05.129
I could, but I
wouldn't because I

00:46:05.129 --> 00:46:06.920
don't need to be
identified with that role.

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:08.390
Right now, it's just like, oh,
I'm learning something new.

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:10.327
I'm learning to make
jewelry, how fun.

00:46:10.327 --> 00:46:12.410
So I think part of it is
we want to get everything

00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:15.110
kind of like boxed down to,
these are our seven roles

00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:18.000
and these are-- the seven roles
are what define who we are.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.830
And what I'm saying
is the opposite

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:22.200
is, the roles aren't
really what we are.

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:22.940
It's the quality.

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:25.273
So maybe the quality for the
person running the marathon

00:46:25.273 --> 00:46:28.040
is challenging themselves,
so the thing to talk about

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.350
is, I love to challenge
myself, and my new way

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:33.350
of challenging myself is I'm
learning to run marathons.

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:34.640
Does that make sense?

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.400
Because then you're focusing
on the quality rather than

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:38.720
the role itself.

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.400
And that's a really
key point because we

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.050
do tend to lead with our roles.

00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:45.350
We tend to lead with our
resumes like that's our brand,

00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:49.879
and it's not-- or that that's
our contribution, and it's not.

00:46:49.879 --> 00:46:52.420
Well, I really want to thank
you for your time and attention.

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:54.120
I know how hard it is
to get away from work

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:56.620
and come to something like this,
so thank you for your time.

00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:59.290
I hope this was useful for you,
and if you have any questions,

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:00.790
please feel free
to reach out to me.

00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:01.817
Thank you very much.

00:47:01.817 --> 00:47:02.400
Appreciate it.

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:05.750
[APPLAUSE]
