00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:08.842
right in the middle
of the entire audience,

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.744
and stands up and has
this "Braveheart" moment.

00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:18.284
And he goes,
"He doesn't speak Spanish!"

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:20.519
[growling]

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:03.162
- All right, this next guy
is a good friend of mine.

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:04.564
I've known him
for about 10, 12 years.

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:06.165
He's absolutely hilarious.

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:08.635
He's on "The Daily Show"
as the Latino correspondent.

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:11.738
Please give it up
for Mr. Al Madrigal, everybody!

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:13.172
Let him hear it!

00:01:13.172 --> 00:01:15.474
[cheers and applause]

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:18.344
- So, in 2002, I went

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:22.148
to the Montreal Just for Laughs
Comedy Festival,

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:24.350
which is like the NBA Draft
for young comedians.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.018
There's a new face.

00:01:26.018 --> 00:01:30.923
And I was so excited to see
the one other Latino comedian

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:32.691
that was there--
his name is Willie Barcena.

00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:34.594
He's a great comic.
Yeah, I was so excited.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:37.196
I go, "Hey, Willie!
How you doing?

00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:38.798
Al Madrigal.
How are you?"

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:40.499
And he just walked up,
and he goes,

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:42.769
"You don't even say
your own name right, bro?"

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:44.203
And just--

00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:47.306
[laughter]

00:01:47.306 --> 00:01:48.607
And just walked away.

00:01:48.607 --> 00:01:50.809
And...

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:54.513
as he left, I go, "Oh, yeah,
okay, Willie, see you later."

00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:56.815
And I had no idea
I was even--

00:01:56.815 --> 00:01:58.451
I hadn't gone to L.A.
at that point.

00:01:58.451 --> 00:01:59.785
I was up in San Francisco.

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:03.056
I had no idea that I was
a Mexican comedian.

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:04.790
I had no clue.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.493
That's how bad--
My Spanish is horrible.

00:02:07.493 --> 00:02:10.229
And I go down to L.A.
for the very first time,

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.730
and I didn't know that L.A.--

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.332
You do this now
with all these shows,

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:14.566
and none of these are made up,

00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:17.069
but they take
all the black comics,

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.474
and they have Chocolate Sundaes
at the Laugh Factory

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:23.242
and Mo Better Mondays

00:02:23.242 --> 00:02:28.081
and Chopshtick Wednesdays,
if you're an Asian comic, and--

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:29.582
and they go--

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:33.252
All my Persian friends
are on the Axis of Evil show

00:02:33.252 --> 00:02:34.687
and so on and so on.

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:38.257
So I go down there
with my friend Becky.

00:02:38.257 --> 00:02:39.692
This is my first set
in L.A.

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:41.594
And that's your first sign
right there.

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:43.396
No self-respecting
Mexican comedian

00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:45.498
has a friend
named Becky, right?

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:46.933
You're never gonna hear,

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:49.268
"Me and my friend Becky
got some pressed juices."

00:02:49.268 --> 00:02:51.437
Uh, yeah...

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:54.340
That's not...

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.676
So, anyway, we go down,
and she has a set

00:02:57.676 --> 00:03:00.279
at the historic Melrose Improv,

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:01.948
with the Budd Friedman
and the monocle.

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:05.785
And it's for the HBO
Aspen Comedy Arts Festival,

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:08.287
another big deal
for young comedians.

00:03:08.287 --> 00:03:10.289
And so I watch her check in,

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:12.592
and she gets
an HBO Comedy hat,

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:15.762
HBO Comedy T-shirt,
and she checks in for her show.

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:18.297
She's on the Thursday night
8:30 show

00:03:18.297 --> 00:03:20.032
with the rest of my friends.

00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:21.467
And then I go to check in,

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:24.069
and they give me a tin
of Red Hots,

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.105
like a Hot Tamales candies,

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:30.877
in a mini Altoids case
that says "HBO Latino."

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:33.313
[laughter]

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:34.814
And I get that,

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:37.483
and then I go and check in
for my show,

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:39.485
and I'm on the Friday night
late show

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:41.754
called "Refried Fridays."

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:45.958
And it's with Carlos Mencia,
Gabriel Iglesias,

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:49.595
hosted by Pablo Francisco,
Jeff Garcia,

00:03:49.595 --> 00:03:51.663
Freddy Soto,
God rest his soul.

00:03:51.663 --> 00:03:53.333
And so I look at the Red Hots.

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:54.834
I look at the list
one more time,

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:56.401
and I look at Becky,
and I call her.

00:03:56.401 --> 00:03:58.070
[whispering]
I go, "Becky.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.007
"I'm a Mexican comedian.
What do I do?"

00:04:02.007 --> 00:04:03.509
[normal voice]
And right at that moment,

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:05.077
this guy taps me
on the shoulder and goes,

00:04:05.077 --> 00:04:06.979
<i> "Hola.</i>My name is Mateo.
I'm from HBO Latino.

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:08.847
Do you mind if I interview you
in Spanish?"

00:04:08.847 --> 00:04:11.750
And I go,
"You can fucking try, bro.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.187
"It's not--it's not
gonna work out for you.

00:04:15.187 --> 00:04:18.691
And, by the way,<i>¿cómo se dice,</i>■
'Where's my T-shirt?'

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:19.992
"How do you say that?

00:04:19.992 --> 00:04:23.262
"Because everyone else
got T-shirts,

00:04:23.262 --> 00:04:27.033
and I got these Red Hots."

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:29.802
[laughter]

00:04:29.802 --> 00:04:31.204
And then the gigs
started coming in.

00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:34.140
You know, I have a young family
in Los Angeles,

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.641
and I get these, uh--

00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:38.210
At first, when you start doing
comedy in San Francisco,

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.212
you do open mics, right?

00:04:40.212 --> 00:04:41.614
There's no microphone there.

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.215
It's like three homeless people
passed out

00:04:43.215 --> 00:04:45.351
at this place called
The Luggage Store that I did.

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:49.555
Then you find out there was
a microphone in Oakland.

00:04:49.555 --> 00:04:51.524
So we went over
to Jack London Square

00:04:51.524 --> 00:04:54.226
and performed in front of all,
like, these black gang members.

00:04:54.226 --> 00:04:57.063
So I was like just doing
my stuff and somebody goes,

00:04:57.063 --> 00:04:58.898
"That's not funny,
motherfucker."

00:04:58.898 --> 00:05:01.834
And I go, "It's new stuff.
I'm working on it, RJ."

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:04.804
And he's just talking.

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:08.841
"Just trying
premises out, so..."

00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:12.845
But then this really big gig--
once I moved down to L.A.

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:15.581
And it's funny that it brought
me back to the Bay Area,

00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:18.918
but I get this gig
in East San Jose, California.

00:05:18.918 --> 00:05:21.554
You don't have to be familiar
with the San Francisco Bay Area

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:23.589
to know than anything east,
most cities,

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:25.090
usually pretty shitty.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.159
So...

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:29.394
driving there with my wife,

00:05:29.394 --> 00:05:31.597
commercial comes
on the oldies station,

00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:33.533
Tony Sandoval,
KISS FM,

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:35.401
for the show
I'm actually going to do.

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:37.035
So, "We got a big Latino
comedy jam,

00:05:37.035 --> 00:05:40.072
and Al Madrigal
is going to be there!"

00:05:40.072 --> 00:05:43.076
I'm in my car going, "Whoa.
Oh, so that's how you say it.

00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:45.778
Okay, got it."

00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:47.446
Then I go to the gig,

00:05:47.446 --> 00:05:51.517
and it's 2,000 Mexicans
in a GI hall...

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:52.618
just packed.

00:05:52.618 --> 00:05:54.453
It's like a big cafeteria.

00:05:54.453 --> 00:05:55.955
And my wife looks at me,
and she goes,

00:05:55.955 --> 00:05:58.925
"Dude, you got to get
the fuck out of here!"

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:00.793
'Cause she's supportive
like that.

00:06:00.793 --> 00:06:04.196
And I say, "No, honey.
Have a little faith in me.

00:06:04.196 --> 00:06:05.131
I can handle myself."

00:06:06.965 --> 00:06:10.636
is that the guy before me is
doing his entire act in Spanish

00:06:10.636 --> 00:06:12.638
and destroying.

00:06:12.638 --> 00:06:14.873
Every single time
he hits a big punch line,

00:06:14.873 --> 00:06:16.875
little Mexican guys
with gold-plated teeth--

00:06:16.875 --> 00:06:18.378
they all have corn
on a stick,

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:21.613
so they're fucking putting
their corns in the air.

00:06:21.613 --> 00:06:24.316
Crema is flying everywhere.

00:06:24.316 --> 00:06:27.486
It's like "Cloudy
with a Chance of Carnitas."

00:06:27.486 --> 00:06:29.121
[laughter]

00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:31.157
And I didn't know
that the Mexican corn

00:06:31.157 --> 00:06:35.494
was like the concert lighter
for a Latino Def Jam Show.

00:06:35.494 --> 00:06:38.430
[shouting]

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.399
So now I got to go up there.

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:43.236
And I ask myself--
I go, "Okay, I can do this.

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:46.605
What would Carlos Mencia do
in this situation?"

00:06:46.605 --> 00:06:48.006
That's one of the rare times

00:06:48.006 --> 00:06:50.943
you want to ask
yourself that question.

00:06:50.943 --> 00:06:54.513
And I go, "I know.
I'm gonna go up there."

00:06:54.513 --> 00:06:56.181
And I do a little cheerleading.

00:06:56.181 --> 00:07:00.352
So I go up onstage, and I go,
"What's up, East San Jose?

00:07:00.352 --> 00:07:04.523
Make some noise!"

00:07:04.523 --> 00:07:06.025
And they all
make some noise.

00:07:06.025 --> 00:07:07.859
All right,
so I'm doing good.

00:07:07.859 --> 00:07:09.995
So I say, "Where are
all the white people at?

00:07:09.995 --> 00:07:14.366
White people make some noise.
White people!"

00:07:14.366 --> 00:07:16.168
Nothing.

00:07:16.168 --> 00:07:19.539
Half of me is
the only white guy there.

00:07:24.376 --> 00:07:26.379
So I say, "Where are
all the black people at?

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:29.548
Black people make some noise!
Black people!"

00:07:29.548 --> 00:07:31.216
Nothing.

00:07:31.216 --> 00:07:35.787
Where the hell were you guys?
Could've fucking used you!

00:07:35.787 --> 00:07:37.823
And then I say,
"So it's all Latinos!"

00:07:37.823 --> 00:07:39.524
[imitates cheering]

00:07:39.524 --> 00:07:42.294
2,000 corns just up in the air

00:07:42.294 --> 00:07:44.330
at the exact same time.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.298
And I'll never forget, right
where you are in the front,

00:07:46.298 --> 00:07:50.203
this little guy goes,
"East side Latinos."

00:07:50.203 --> 00:07:53.839
And I said, "East side Latinos!"
Even bigger roar.

00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:56.909
Like, I think a bacon-wrapped
hot dog went flying.

00:08:00.912 --> 00:08:03.349
Then I proceeded
to do my act

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:06.319
just by saying
"fuckers" and "bros" nonstop.

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:08.921
Just "fuckers" and "bro,"
"fuckers" and "bros,"

00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:13.092
and then humping
for no reason whatsoever.

00:08:13.092 --> 00:08:15.094
It didn't make
any fucking sense.

00:08:15.094 --> 00:08:16.428
If you're sitting
near a Latino,

00:08:16.428 --> 00:08:18.497
look how much
they love this right now.

00:08:18.497 --> 00:08:20.266
They can't get enough.

00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:24.670
Does not make sense,
but they can't get enough of it.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.605
What's up, fuckers?

00:08:26.605 --> 00:08:28.040
I just had a new baby,
fuckers.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:32.544
Fuckers, bro, bro,
fuckers, fuckers.

00:08:32.544 --> 00:08:35.614
25,000 "fuckers" later,
25 minutes,

00:08:35.614 --> 00:08:37.116
I'm out of there.

00:08:37.116 --> 00:08:39.851
Then I go to the next gig.
It's a two-parter.

00:08:39.851 --> 00:08:42.922
Next day it's
in Stockton, California,

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:45.891
which is this meth shithole
in the middle of nowhere.

00:08:45.891 --> 00:08:47.392
Industry has died.

00:08:47.392 --> 00:08:50.128
It was like Ground Zero
for the housing crisis, right?

00:08:50.128 --> 00:08:52.231
Foreclosure signs everywhere.

00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:54.367
People are angry
all the time.

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:58.971
I think there's just pods
with embryonic MMA fighters.

00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:05.811
And when you start to do
stand-up, the younger comics--

00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:08.547
The older comics
pull us to the side,

00:09:08.547 --> 00:09:10.949
and they tell us three shows
that you should not do.

00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:13.118
I was just told this
by great comics

00:09:13.118 --> 00:09:14.620
that sort of were very helpful.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.322
They said,
"Don't perform outside.

00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:18.291
"Don't perform
in front of kids.

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:20.258
And don't perform
during the day."

00:09:20.258 --> 00:09:21.927
This is all three.

00:09:21.927 --> 00:09:24.930
Even the kids
are fucking tough in Stockton.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.765
I'm not sure if anyone's
ever been intimidated

00:09:26.765 --> 00:09:28.301
by a five-year-old, but--

00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:30.002
little wife-beaters
walking by,

00:09:30.002 --> 00:09:31.637
going, "Fuck you,<i>ese."</i>

00:09:31.637 --> 00:09:32.838
And you're like, "Ah.

00:09:32.838 --> 00:09:36.175
Okay, children, run along."

00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:40.112
So I walk into the show,
and I walk backstage.

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:41.814
The guy who was doing so well
the night before--

00:09:41.814 --> 00:09:43.782
Remember him?
He's now crying.

00:09:43.782 --> 00:09:46.185
He's got a tear
running down his cheek.

00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:48.754
And I go, "Ruben, what's wrong?
How was your set?"

00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:52.357
He goes,
"Al, they threatened my life."

00:09:52.357 --> 00:09:54.860
What happened was,
he went up in Stockton,

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.263
and he went onstage
and said he was from L.A.

00:09:58.263 --> 00:10:00.031
And apparently
Ruben hadn't been watching

00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:03.135
his National Geographic
gang documentaries,

00:10:03.135 --> 00:10:05.537
because that was a no-no.

00:10:05.537 --> 00:10:08.707
Big battle going on
between the north and the south.

00:10:08.707 --> 00:10:10.108
Ruben was unaware.

00:10:10.108 --> 00:10:12.044
He went up,
said he was from Los Angeles,

00:10:12.044 --> 00:10:14.212
and guys started sharpening
their corn sticks.

00:10:14.212 --> 00:10:16.615
They were ready
to fucking stab his ass.

00:10:16.615 --> 00:10:17.850
He pointed the dudes out.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.285
Now I got to go up there,

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:21.354
and I already determined
on the long car ride out,

00:10:21.354 --> 00:10:23.389
"I'm not gonna be
this Latino Def Jam character

00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:24.690
that I'm not."

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:25.958
I spent the first half
of my life--

00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.526
My parents sent me
to French school

00:10:27.526 --> 00:10:28.827
in San Francisco.

00:10:28.827 --> 00:10:30.796
I went to
Ecole Notre Dame Des Victoires.

00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:32.397
All right?

00:10:32.397 --> 00:10:36.802
I used to wear a sailor suit
to school every single day.

00:10:36.802 --> 00:10:41.173
I rode the cable car with
a dickey blowing in the wind.

00:10:41.173 --> 00:10:43.409
Now I'm gonna be
this Latino Def Jam character?

00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:45.910
That's bullshit.
I want to be myself.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:48.880
And that was a horrible idea.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.316
Never be yourself.

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:53.052
Change it up. Fuck it.
What do you got to lose?

00:10:56.589 --> 00:10:58.657
So I go up onstage,

00:10:58.657 --> 00:11:02.727
and I start to do this bit
about how my Spanish is horrible

00:11:02.727 --> 00:11:07.065
and how you spot half Mexican--
overuse of the word<i>"poquito."</i>

00:11:07.065 --> 00:11:08.734
<i> ¿Habla español?
 Un poquito.</i>

00:11:08.734 --> 00:11:10.902
<i> ¿Salsa picante?
 Un poquito.</i>

00:11:10.902 --> 00:11:13.272
<i> ¿Maricón?
 Un poquito.</i>

00:11:16.341 --> 00:11:18.209
And this guy stands up
right in the middle,

00:11:18.209 --> 00:11:20.179
right in the middle
of the entire audience,

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:23.115
and stands up and has
this "Braveheart" moment.

00:11:23.115 --> 00:11:29.855
And he goes,
"He doesn't speak Spanish!"

00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:32.258
[growling]

00:11:36.261 --> 00:11:38.697
And then starts
violently flipping me off.

00:11:38.697 --> 00:11:40.065
Not just like,
"Hey, fuck you."

00:11:40.065 --> 00:11:41.967
But the holding it, shaking,
going...

00:11:41.967 --> 00:11:44.570
[groaning]

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:48.040
So he starts leading people
in boos against me.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.808
He's going,
"He doesn't speak Spanish.

00:11:49.808 --> 00:11:52.211
"Boo! Boo!

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:53.545
"He doesn't speak Spanish.

00:11:53.545 --> 00:11:57.950
Boo! Boo!"

00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:59.551
20 people are booing,
80 people are booing,

00:11:59.551 --> 00:12:03.155
and finally I broke down,
which I tend to do.

00:12:03.155 --> 00:12:04.589
I said, "Look, you guys,

00:12:04.589 --> 00:12:07.326
"this isn't exactly
a dream gig for me either.

00:12:07.326 --> 00:12:09.995
"I'm stuck in Stockton
of all God forsaken places,

00:12:09.995 --> 00:12:11.329
"and the best part about it
is I get to leave,

00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:12.998
"and you people are stuck here

00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:15.333
"for the rest of your
miserable fucking lives.

00:12:15.333 --> 00:12:18.404
"Now, I'm taking the money,
and I'm being paid handsomely.

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:20.506
"I'm gonna go blow it
in Tracy Outlet Mall.

00:12:20.506 --> 00:12:23.475
So fuck off!"

00:12:23.475 --> 00:12:24.910
And the guy stood
back up and goes,

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.113
"He's got money!"

00:12:28.113 --> 00:12:30.449
Then I ended up jumping a fence
like a salmon,

00:12:30.449 --> 00:12:32.251
while the black security guards
laughed at me.

00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:33.652
That's how that
fucking turned out.

00:12:33.652 --> 00:12:36.856
All right, thank you
very much, everybody.
