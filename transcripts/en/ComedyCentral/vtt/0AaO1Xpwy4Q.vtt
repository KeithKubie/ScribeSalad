Natasha, the budget for
your special is out of control.

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:42.034 align:start position:0%
We've got to keep
this thing simple. Look.

00:01:42.067 --> 00:01:44.170
I can show you market research
that proves

00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:46.572
people do not
want to see effort.

00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:49.275
Uh-uh. I didn't
get into this business to read.

Okay, then
I'll summarize it for you, okay?

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:52.545
Specials aren't special anymore.

00:01:52.578 --> 00:01:54.213
And you're making yours
way too special.

00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:55.615
You're spending too much money.

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:57.617

hear the music.

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:03.856 align:start position:0%
He literally
gets off the bus,

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:05.491
he wipes mustard off his shirt,

00:02:05.524 --> 00:02:07.426
he does the show in a T-shirt.

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:08.928 align:start position:0%
That's
a producer's dream.

00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:09.962

00:02:13.732 --> 00:02:15.434
Thought about it.
Hell no.

00:02:15.467 --> 00:02:16.969
Okay, it's really annoying
when you talk

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:18.471
in tempo to the music, okay?

00:02:18.504 --> 00:02:19.805

Okay, it looks amazing.

00:02:28.647 --> 00:02:31.017

spending money.
