00:00:00.794 --> 00:00:02.976
Voiceover: You are given
the following starting

00:00:02.976 --> 00:00:06.589
numbers and rules for
two sequences of numbers.

00:00:06.897 --> 00:00:09.159
The first sequence, Sequence x,

00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:12.155
starting number should be one,

00:00:12.155 --> 00:00:14.702
and then the rule is add one.

00:00:14.837 --> 00:00:17.311
Sequence y, starting
number should be five,

00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:19.672
and then the rule should be add five.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.505
Fill in the table with the
first three terms of x and y.

00:00:23.505 --> 00:00:26.227
Then plot the ordered pairs (x,y)

00:00:26.227 --> 00:00:27.234
on the graph below.

00:00:27.234 --> 00:00:29.143
So let's see, Sequence x.

00:00:29.143 --> 00:00:30.980
They say, the starting number,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.828
the starting number should be one.

00:00:33.828 --> 00:00:35.848
So the starting number is one,

00:00:35.848 --> 00:00:37.388
and then the rule, to
get to the next number,

00:00:37.388 --> 00:00:38.788
you just add one.

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:41.025
So, one plus one is two.

00:00:41.025 --> 00:00:43.069
Two plus one is three.

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:44.798
Fairly straight forward.

00:00:44.798 --> 00:00:46.099
Now, let's look at Sequence y.

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:48.356
They're saying the starting
number should be five.

00:00:49.064 --> 00:00:51.988
Starting number five,
and then the rule is,

00:00:51.988 --> 00:00:53.778
to get the next term, we just add five.

00:00:53.778 --> 00:00:55.488
So, five plus five is ten,

00:00:55.934 --> 00:00:58.879
ten plus five is fifteen.

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.869
Now they want us to plot these things.

00:01:01.515 --> 00:01:04.885
Let's see, we plot them as ordered pairs,

00:01:04.885 --> 00:01:07.037
so we're going to have the point (1,5).

00:01:07.037 --> 00:01:11.339
When x is one, y is five.

00:01:11.339 --> 00:01:14.464
We see that there, x is one, y is five.

00:01:14.627 --> 00:01:16.610
When x is two, y is ten.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.940
When x is two, y is ten,

00:01:21.111 --> 00:01:24.129
and then when x is three, y is fifteen.

00:01:24.544 --> 00:01:31.109
When x is three, y is fifteen,

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:32.213
and wee see that.

00:01:32.213 --> 00:01:35.711
For every one we move to the right,

00:01:35.711 --> 00:01:38.752
for every one we increase
in the horizontal direction,

00:01:38.752 --> 00:01:44.025
every one we increase in
x, we increase five for y.

00:01:44.025 --> 00:01:48.044
We increase one for x,
we increase five for y.

00:01:48.114 --> 00:01:51.293
So now we just have one
last thing to answer.

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.537
The terms in Sequence y are blank,

00:01:53.537 --> 00:01:56.150
times the terms in Sequence x.

00:01:56.352 --> 00:01:59.044
So you immediately see, this term, five,

00:01:59.044 --> 00:02:00.575
is five times one.

00:02:00.575 --> 00:02:02.308
Ten is five times two.

00:02:02.308 --> 00:02:04.870
Fifteen is five times
three, and it makes sense.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.866
You started five times higher,

00:02:07.096 --> 00:02:09.892
and here you added one
each time, and we see that

00:02:09.892 --> 00:02:10.999
visually right over here,

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:14.442
we add one each time, while here we add

00:02:14.442 --> 00:02:15.869
five times as much each time.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.946
We add five each time.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.179
The terms in Sequence y are five
times the terms in Sequence x.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.846
We got it right.
