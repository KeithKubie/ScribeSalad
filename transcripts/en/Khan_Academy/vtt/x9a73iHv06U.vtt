00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.965
- [Voiceover] Chepi is an
ecologist who studies the change

00:00:02.965 --> 00:00:06.784
in the narwhal population of
the Arctic ocean over time.

00:00:06.784 --> 00:00:10.720
She observed that the
population population loses 5.6%

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.144
of its size every 2.8 months.

00:00:14.144 --> 00:00:16.129
The population of narwhals can be modeled

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.602
by a function, N, which
depends on the amount

00:00:18.602 --> 00:00:20.533
of time, t in months.

00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.889
When Chepi began the study, she observed

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:27.765
that there were 89,000
narwhals in the Arctic ocean.

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:30.771
Write a function that models
the population of narwhals

00:00:30.771 --> 00:00:33.898
t months since the
beginning of Chepi's study.

00:00:33.898 --> 00:00:35.175
Like always, pause the video

00:00:35.175 --> 00:00:36.312
and see if you can do it on your own

00:00:36.312 --> 00:00:38.530
before we work through it together.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.930
So let's now work through it together.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.032
To get my essence of what
this function is to do,

00:00:42.032 --> 00:00:45.711
it's always valuable to
see, to create a table

00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:48.033
for some interesting
inputs for the function

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:52.131
and seeing how the function should behave.

00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:53.914
So first of all, if t is in months

00:00:53.914 --> 00:00:57.815
and N of t is, in N is the,

00:00:57.815 --> 00:01:01.878
that models, N is the number
of narwhals, the narwhals.

00:01:01.878 --> 00:01:04.200
So what, when T is equal to zero,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.593
what is N of zero?

00:01:05.593 --> 00:01:07.357
Well, we know a T equals zero.

00:01:07.357 --> 00:01:10.503
There are 89,000 narwhals in the ocean.

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:13.882
So 89,000.

00:01:13.882 --> 00:01:16.819
And now, what's another interesting one?

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:17.674
Well, T is in months

00:01:17.674 --> 00:01:19.822
and we know that the population decreases

00:01:19.822 --> 00:01:22.840
5.6% every 2.8 months.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.044
So let's think about when T is 2.8,

00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:27.425
2.8 months.

00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:28.900
Well then the population,

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.847
it should have gone down 5.6%.

00:01:32.847 --> 00:01:36.179
So going down 5.6% is the same thing

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:37.839
as retaining.

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:40.799
What's one minus 5.6%?

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.106
Retaining 94.4%.

00:01:45.106 --> 00:01:45.744
I'll be clear.

00:01:45.744 --> 00:01:47.908
100%,

00:01:47.908 --> 00:01:51.625
if you lose 5.6%,

00:01:51.625 --> 00:01:56.625
you are going to be left with 94.4%.

00:01:57.354 --> 00:01:59.606
The 0.6 plus 0.4 gets you a 95

00:01:59.606 --> 00:02:01.069
plus another five is 100.

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:02.929
So another way of saying, this sentence,

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.748
that the population loses 5.6%
of its size every 2.8 months

00:02:06.748 --> 00:02:09.465
is to say that the population is 94%,

00:02:09.465 --> 00:02:12.785
94.4% of its size every 2.8 months

00:02:12.785 --> 00:02:16.604
or shrinks to 94.4% of its original size

00:02:16.604 --> 00:02:19.669
every, or let me phrase this clearly.

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:22.687
After every 2.8 months, the population,

00:02:22.687 --> 00:02:25.102
you can either say it shrinks 5.6%

00:02:25.102 --> 00:02:27.865
or you could say it has, it's gone from,

00:02:27.865 --> 00:02:31.348
it's 94.4% of the
population at the beginning

00:02:31.348 --> 00:02:32.902
of those 2.8 months.

00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:37.902
So after 2.8 months, the
population should be 89,000 times,

00:02:38.172 --> 00:02:40.413
I could write times 94.4%

00:02:40.413 --> 00:02:44.789
or I could write times 0.944.

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:48.442
Now, if we go another 2.8 months,

00:02:48.442 --> 00:02:51.622
so two times 2.8.

00:02:51.622 --> 00:02:53.329
I have to say you could
just write that as,

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.129
I could write that as 5.6 months

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:56.951
but let me just write this is 2.8 months.

00:02:56.951 --> 00:02:57.706
Where are we gonna be?

00:02:57.706 --> 00:03:00.132
We're gonna be 89,000

00:03:00.132 --> 00:03:03.309
times 0.944.

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:04.470
This is where we were before

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.666
at the beginning of this period.

00:03:05.666 --> 00:03:08.046
Now, we're gonna be 94.4% of that.

00:03:08.046 --> 00:03:10.696
So we're gonna multiply by 94.4% again

00:03:10.696 --> 00:03:13.154
or 0.944 again

00:03:13.154 --> 00:03:16.868
or we can just say times 0.944 squared.

00:03:16.868 --> 00:03:20.998
And after three of these periods,

00:03:20.998 --> 00:03:24.235
well, we're gonna be times 0.944 again.

00:03:24.235 --> 00:03:26.812
So it's gonna be 89,000

00:03:26.812 --> 00:03:31.812
times 0.944 squared

00:03:32.133 --> 00:03:33.909
times 0.944

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.171
which is gonna be 0.944
to the third power.

00:03:37.171 --> 00:03:39.331
And I think you might
see what's going on here.

00:03:39.331 --> 00:03:41.721
We have an exponential function.

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:43.370
Between every 2.8 months,

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.961
we are multiplying by this common ratio

00:03:45.961 --> 00:03:48.399
of 0.944.

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:52.404
And so we could write our function N of t.

00:03:52.404 --> 00:03:57.311
Our initial value is 89,000

00:03:57.311 --> 00:04:02.261
times 0.944

00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:04.943
to the power of, however, many of these

00:04:04.943 --> 00:04:07.585
2.8 month period we've gone so far.

00:04:07.585 --> 00:04:09.396
So if we take the number of months

00:04:09.396 --> 00:04:11.567
and we divide by 2.8, that's how many

00:04:11.567 --> 00:04:14.446
2.8 month period we have gotten gone.

00:04:14.446 --> 00:04:16.815
And so notice, when t equals zero,

00:04:16.815 --> 00:04:18.115
all of this turns into one,

00:04:18.115 --> 00:04:19.752
erasing the zero part, that becomes one.

00:04:19.752 --> 00:04:21.029
You have 89,000.

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:24.326
When t is equal to 2.8,
this exponent is one.

00:04:24.326 --> 00:04:27.448
Now we're gonna multiply by 0.944 once.

00:04:27.448 --> 00:04:30.908
When t is 5.6, the exponent
is going to be two.

00:04:30.908 --> 00:04:34.066
Now we're gonna multiply by 0.944 twice.

00:04:34.066 --> 00:04:36.285
And I'm just doing the values that make

00:04:36.285 --> 00:04:38.219
the exponent integers
but it's going to work

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:39.346
for the ones in between.

00:04:39.346 --> 00:04:40.702
I encourage you to graph it

00:04:40.702 --> 00:04:43.581
or to try those values in
a calculator if you like.

00:04:43.581 --> 00:04:44.958
But there you have it, we're done.

00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.540
We have modeled our narwhals.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.553
So let me just underline
that and we're done.
