00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.320
are far-reaching because proteins play a
key role in cancer

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330
key role in cancer
 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.770
key role in cancer
if you're going to understand the origin

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780
if you're going to understand the origin
 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.339
if you're going to understand the origin
of cancer you've got to understand the

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:51.349
of cancer you've got to understand the
 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:55.809
of cancer you've got to understand the
control of a protein that influences the

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:55.819
control of a protein that influences the
 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:58.510
control of a protein that influences the
DNA ubiquity and media that protein

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520
DNA ubiquity and media that protein
 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.309
DNA ubiquity and media that protein
degradation which is the system that we

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:00.319
degradation which is the system that we
 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:01.960
degradation which is the system that we
discovered seems to be involved in

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970
discovered seems to be involved in
 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.689
discovered seems to be involved in
almost every basic process in life and

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699
almost every basic process in life and
 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:06.879
almost every basic process in life and
that is because proteins are involved in

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889
that is because proteins are involved in
 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.040
that is because proteins are involved in
almost every bladesey processor in life

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050
almost every bladesey processor in life
 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.219
almost every bladesey processor in life
and that that includes a control of cell

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229
and that that includes a control of cell
 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.140
and that that includes a control of cell
division which is very important because

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150
division which is very important because
 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.180
division which is very important because
when cells get out of control then we

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190
when cells get out of control then we
 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.689
when cells get out of control then we
have cancer so the surprise is the

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:19.699
have cancer so the surprise is the
 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.999
have cancer so the surprise is the
chemistry price because it was done for

chemistry price because it was done for
 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.249
chemistry price because it was done for
understanding how how the chemical

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:24.259
understanding how how the chemical
 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:26.589
understanding how how the chemical
processes are in the body but actually

you know the the his results and
 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.680
you know the the his results and
actually should do a next experiment so

research it was not my whole life so

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:05.029
research it was not my whole life so
 

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:07.360
research it was not my whole life so
therefore since it wasn't my whole life

glad that the urban Rose was included in

glad that the urban Rose was included in
 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.129

the most prestigious price of all and he

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:21.139
the most prestigious price of all and he
 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:23.140
the most prestigious price of all and he
deserves it because he had a very

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150
deserves it because he had a very
 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.719
deserves it because he had a very
important impact it at the most crucial

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:25.729
important impact it at the most crucial
 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:29.020
important impact it at the most crucial
period of his research
