00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.840
Hi, I’m John Green; this is Crash Course
World History and today we’re going to do

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.350
some compare and contrast, because that’s
what passes for hip in world history.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.769
Right, so you’ve probably heard of Christopher
Columbus who in 1492 sailed the ocean blue

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.989
and discovered America, a place that had been
previously discovered only by millions of people --

00:00:15.989 --> 00:00:18.920
Mr Green, Mr Green! Columbus was just a lucky
idiot.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.420
Yeah, no. Here’s a little rule of thumb,
Me from the Past: If you are not an expert

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.599
in something, don’t pretend to be an expert.
This is going to serve you well both in your

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.480
academic career and in your Kissing Career.
MOVING ON.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.860
[intro music]

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.840
So unlike Me from the Past, I'd argue that
Columbus has a deserved reputation in history

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.450
— but was he really the greatest sailor
of the 15th Century? Well, let’s meet the

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.760
other contestants. In the red corner, we have
Zheng He, who, when it comes to ocean-going

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.960
voyages was the first major figure of the
15th century. And in the blue corner is Vasco

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.460
da Gama, from scrappy little Portugal, who
managed to introduce Europeans to the Indian

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.809
Ocean trade network. Columbus, you have to
sit in the polka-dotted corner.

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.320
As you’ll no doubt remember from our discussion
of Indian Ocean trade, it was dominated by

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.799
Muslim merchants, involved ports in Africa
and the Middle East and India and Indonesia

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.330
and China, and it made a lot of people super
rich. This last point explains why our three

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.780
contestants were so eager to set sail. Well,
that and the ceaseless desire of human beings

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.979
to discover things and contract scurvy.

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.420
Let’s begin with Zheng He, who is probably
the greatest admiral you’ve never have heard

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.740
of. Couple of important things about Zheng
He, First, he was a Muslim. That may seem

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.119
strange until you consider that by the late
14th century, China had long experience with

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.530
Muslims, especially when they were ruled by,
wait for it... The Mongols.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.409
Secondly, Zheng He was a eunuch. Fortunately,
15th century China had excellent general anesthesia,

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.799
so I’m sure it didn’t hurt at all when
they castrated him — what’s that, Stan?

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.320
They didn’t have any anesthesia? Oh, boy.
Oh. Stan! I’M SEEING IT! I can see, AH AH

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.280
AHHHH. Stan! SHOW ME SOMETHNG CUTE RIGHT NOW!
Oh, hi there kitty! How’d you get in that

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.689
little teacup? Thank you, Stan. Right, so
Zheng He rose from humble beginnings to lose

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.180
both of his testicles, and become the greatest admiral
in Chinese history. Let’s go to the thought Bubble.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.760
Between 1405 and 1433, Zheng He led seven
voyages throughout the Indian Ocean, the expeditions

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.050
of the so-called treasure ships, and they
were huge. Columbus’ first voyage consisted

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.410
of three ships. Zheng He led an armada of
over 300, with a crew of over 27,000 — more

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.940
than half of London’s population at the
time. And some of these ships were, well,

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.420
enormous. The flagships, known as the treasure
ships, were over 400 feet long and had 7 or

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.209
more masts. See that little tiny ship there
in front of the Treasure Ship? That’s a

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.510
to-scale rendering of Christopher Columbus’s
flagship, the Santa Maria.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.550
Zheng He wasn’t an explorer: The Indian
Ocean trade routes were already known to him

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.530
and other Chinese sailors. He visited Africa,
India, and the Middle East, and in a way,

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.440
his journeys were trade missions, but not
in the sense of filling his ships up with

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.950
stuff to be sold later for higher prices.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.980
At the time, China was the leading manufacturer
of quality goods in the world, and there wasn’t

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.890
anything they actually needed to import. What
they needed was prestige and respect so that

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.519
people would continue to see China as the
center of the economic universe, so there

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.150
was a tribute system through which foreign
rulers or their ambassadors would come to

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.920
China and engage in a debasing ritual called
the kowtow wherein they acknowledged the superiority

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.750
of the Chinese emperor and offered him - or
her, but usually him - gifts in exchange for

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.310
the right to trade with China.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.379
The opportunity to humble yourself before
the Chinese emperor was so valuable that many

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.269
a prince was happy to jump on a treasure ship
and sail back to China with Zheng He. Also,

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:38.209
these tribute missions brought lots of crazy
things to China, including exotic animals:

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.920
from Africa, Zheng He brought back a zoo’s
worth of rhinos, zebras, and even giraffes.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.690
Basically, he was like the medieval Chinese
Noah. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.720
So the Chinese were world leaders in naval
technology, and they wanted to dominate trade

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.180
here in the Indian Ocean. So why, then, did
these voyages end? One reason was that Zheng

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.560
He couldn’t live forever, and sure enough,
he didn’t. Also his patron, the Yongle Emperor,

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.599
died. And the emperor’s successors weren’t
very interested in maritime trade. They were

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.750
more concerned with protecting China against
its traditional enemies, nomads from the steppe.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.330
To do this, they built a rather famous wall.
The Great Wall was mostly built under the

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.250
Ming Dynasty using resources that they only
had because they stopped building gigantic

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.690
ships. Just imagine what might have happened
if the Ming emperors had embraced a different

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.400
strategy. One that was based on outreach instead
of isolationism.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.880
And now, to the blue corner. Representing
Portuguese exploration, we have Vasco da Gama.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.960
Couple things about Portugal: first, it has
a fair bit of coastline. Secondly, it was

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.490
relatively resource-poor, which meant it relied
upon trade in order to grow. Also, the Iberian

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.650
peninsula was the only place in Europe where
Muslims could be found in large numbers in

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.300
the 15th century, which meant the Christian
crusading spirit was quite strong there, presumably

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.560
because Muslims had brought so much stability
and prosperity to the region.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.330
And chief among these would-be crusaders was
Prince Henry the Navigator, so called because

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.910
he was not a navigator. He was, however, a
patron, not only of sailors themselves, but

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.530
of a special school at Sagres in which nautical
knowledge was collected and new maps were

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.770
made, and all kinds of awesome stuff happened.
And all that knowledge gave Portuguese sailors

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.310
a huge competitive advantage when it came
to exploration.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.690
Henry commissioned sailors to search for two
things. First, a path to the Indian Ocean

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.460
so they could get in on the lucrative spice
trade. And second, to find the kingdom of

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.620
Prester John, a mythical Christian King who
was supposed to live in Africa somewhere,

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.320
so that Henry could have Prester John’s
help in a crusade.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.500
Da Gama was the first of Henry’s protégés
to make it around Africa, and into the Indian

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.940
Ocean. In 1498, he landed at Calicut, a major
trading post on India’s west coast. And

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.979
when he got there, merchants asked him what
he was looking for. He answered with three

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.840
words: Gold and Christians. Which basically
sums up Portugal’s motivations for exploration.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.550
So, once the Portuguese breached the Indian
Ocean, they didn’t create, like, huge colonies,

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.130
because there were already powerful empires
in the region. Instead, they apparently sat

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.710
in the middle of the Indian Ocean doing nothing.
Actually, they were able to capture &amp; control

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.770
a number of coastal cities, creating what
historians call a “trading post empire.”

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.449
They could do this thanks to their well-armed
ships, which captured cities by firing cannons

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:57.990
into city walls like IRL Angry Birds.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.880
But since the Portuguese didn’t have enough
people or boats to run the Indian Ocean trade,

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.550
they had to rely on extortion. So, Portuguese
merchant ships would capture other ships and

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.889
force them to purchase a permit to trade called
a cartaz. And without a cartaz, a merchant

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:12.960
couldn’t trade in any of the towns that
Portugal controlled. To merchants, who’d

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.860
plied the Indian Ocean for years in relative
freedom, the Portuguese were just glorified

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.310
pirates, extracting value from trade without
adding to its efficiency or volume.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.810
So, the cartaz strategy sort of worked for
a while, but the Portuguese never really took

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.490
control of Indian Ocean trade. They were successful
enough that their neighbors, Spain, became

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.610
interested in their own route to the Indies,
and that brings us to Columbus.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:34.699
But first, let’s dispel some myths:

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:39.240
One, Columbus and his crew knew the earth
was round. He was just wrong about the earth’s

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.319
size. Columbus used Ptolemy’s geography
and the Imago Mundi, based on Muslim scholarship

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:48.090
— and ended up overestimating the size of
Asia and underestimating the size of the oceans.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.460
Two, Columbus never thought he’d made it
to China. He called the people he encountered

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.000
“Indians” because he thought that he’d
made it to the East Indies, what we know as

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.360
Indonesia.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.180
And three, Columbus was not a lucky idiot.
He navigated completely unknown waters primarily

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.009
relying on a technique known as dead reckoning,
in which you figure out your position based

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:09.380
on three pieces of information: the direction
you’re going, your speed, and the time,

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.849
which you figure out via hourglass. With only
that technology to guide you, it's not actually

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:18.120
that easy to hit a continent. Come here, people
who are saying he didn’t hit a continent,

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.690
that he only hit some islands. Come here.
DAHHH!

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:28.590
Oh, it’s time for the Open Letter?
An open letter to the Line of Demarcation.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:33.780
But first, let’s see what’s in the secret
compartment today. Oh, its a globe. Thanks

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.270
Stan! Just what I always needed.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.069
Dear Line of Demarcation, You have so much
to teach us about the way that the world used

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:43.979
to work, and the way that it works now. In
1494, Pope Alexander VI settled a dispute

00:07:43.979 --> 00:07:50.280
between Portugal and Spain by dividing the
world into two parts: The Spanish part, and

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.319
the Portuguese part. This whole thing, at
least according to Pope Alexander VI, could

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:56.669
be split between Spain and Portugal.

00:07:56.669 --> 00:08:01.750
At least when it came to so-called unclaimed
land. I mean, unclaimed by whom? You know

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:05.080
all the American Indians were like, “wait,
this land is available? In, in that case,

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.139
we’ll just, we’ll just keep it. If it's
all the same to you.”

00:08:08.139 --> 00:08:12.740
Anyway, Line of Demarcation, I have great
news for you. What Alexander VI did totally

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.240
worked. We haven’t had a problem since.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.840
Best wishes, John Green

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.530
So, Columbus’s first journey (he made four,
the last three of which were pretty calamitous)

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:23.620
was tiny, and he initially landed on a small
Caribbean island he called San Salvador in

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:27.800
search, like the Portuguese, of Gold and Christians.
He was able to convince Ferdinand and Isabella

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.319
of Spain to fund his expedition by promising
riches and conversions of the natives, hopefully

00:08:32.319 --> 00:08:34.560
to sign them up for yet another crusade.

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.310
And there’s a long-standing myth that Columbus
tricked Ferdinand and Isabella into paying

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:41.390
for his trip, but in fact they’d commissioned
two different sets of experts to analyze his

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:45.350
plans, both of which agreed, he was crazy.
One called the plan, “Impossible to any

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.360
educated person.”

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.470
But even so, Ferdinand and Isabella footed
the bill, partly because they were full of

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:54.040
Crusading zeal after expelling the Muslims
from Spain, and partly because they were desperate

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.160
to get their hands on some of that pepper
richness. Columbus, of course, failed at finding

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.910
riches — he returned with neither spices
nor gold. He did create some Christians, as

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:05.420
we’ll discuss in a future episode, but in
terms of goal accomplishment, Columbus was

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:09.060
much less successful than either Zheng He
or Vasco de Gama.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.899
But within two generations of Columbus, Spain
would become fantastically wealthy, and for

00:09:12.899 --> 00:09:16.880
a time they were the leading power in Europe.
Columbus’s voyages also had a huge, largely

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.450
negative, impact on the people the Spanish
encountered in the Americas. And excitingly

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:24.209
from my perspective, once Columbus returned
from San Salvador, we can speak for the first

00:09:24.209 --> 00:09:29.050
time of a truly world history. Except for
you, Australia.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:32.690
So who was the greatest mariner of the 15th
century? Well, as usual, it depends on your

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:37.029
definition of greatness. If you value administrative
competence over ill-advised adventure, than

00:09:37.029 --> 00:09:40.959
Zheng He is certainly the winner. But the
reason we remember Columbus over him or Vasco

00:09:40.959 --> 00:09:45.519
de Gama is that Columbus’s voyages had a
lasting impact on the world, even if it wasn’t

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:48.700
necessarily a positive one. And that makes
me wonder what kind of person you’d want

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:53.040
to be: A capable administrator and brilliant
sailor like Zheng He? A daring captain like

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.310
de Gama? Or the bearer of a complicated but
famous legacy like Columbus? Let me know in

00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.570
comments.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.250
Thanks for watching, and we’ll see you next
week.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:04.000
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller, our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.160
The show is written by my high school history
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself, and our graphics

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.980
Last week’s Phrase of the Week was, “You
smell pretty.” Thanks for that suggestion,

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.779
by the way. If you want to suggest future
phrases of the week, you can do so in comments,

00:10:14.779 --> 00:10:18.470
where you can also guess at this weeks phrase
of the week or ask questions about today’s

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:21.310
video that will be answered by our team of
historians. Thanks for watching Crash Course,

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:25.310
and as we say in my home town, Don't Forget
To Be Awesome.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.350
Ahhh, crash! No, avoided!
