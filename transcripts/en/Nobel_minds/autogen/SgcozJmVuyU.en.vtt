it's not that everybody is the same but

it's not that everybody is the same but
 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.710
it's not that everybody is the same but
that on average we tend to err in the

that on average we tend to err in the
 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.539
that on average we tend to err in the
same direction so we all think that

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549
same direction so we all think that
 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.909
