you kind of need to start out with and
 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.219
you kind of need to start out with and

these are mostly the tools that I used
 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.780

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.540
use or what kind of tools are good to
start out with if they want to start

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550

making props or costumes or that kind of
thing for me these are kind of like the

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540
thing for me these are kind of like the
 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.139
thing for me these are kind of like the
core tools that I use when I first

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149
core tools that I use when I first
 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.050
core tools that I use when I first
started making props and they're pretty

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060
started making props and they're pretty
 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.850
started making props and they're pretty
basic and some of these a lot of these

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860
basic and some of these a lot of these
 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.859
basic and some of these a lot of these
you'll probably already have like in

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869
you'll probably already have like in
 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.229
you'll probably already have like in
your garage or at home or whatever but

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239
your garage or at home or whatever but
 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.080
your garage or at home or whatever but
and they're all pretty easy to obtain

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090
and they're all pretty easy to obtain
 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.220
and they're all pretty easy to obtain
so all these tools aren't super

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230
so all these tools aren't super
 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.420
so all these tools aren't super
expensive they're not gonna break the

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430
expensive they're not gonna break the
 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.370
expensive they're not gonna break the
bank and if you're serious about making

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380
bank and if you're serious about making
 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.100
bank and if you're serious about making
props then these are the basic core

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110
props then these are the basic core
 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.509
props then these are the basic core
tools they should probably start out

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519
tools they should probably start out
 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.180

started off I just had it was pretty

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:29.090
started off I just had it was pretty
 

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:30.610
started off I just had it was pretty
simple it was actually a battery-powered
