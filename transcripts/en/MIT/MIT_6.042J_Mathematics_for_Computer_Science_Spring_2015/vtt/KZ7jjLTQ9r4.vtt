00:00:00.061 --> 00:00:01.810
PROFESSOR: We're going
to look at the most

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.710
fundamental of all mathematical
data types, namely sets,

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.661
and let's begin with
the definitions.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.460
So informally, a
set is a collection

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.280
of mathematical
objects, and the idea

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.350
is that you treat the collection
of objects as one new object.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.390
And that's a working definition.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.170
But of course, it might
help a little bit,

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.510
but it's a circular definition.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.347
This is not math yet
because I haven't defined

00:00:31.347 --> 00:00:32.930
what a collection
is, and a collection

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.030
is no clearer or easier
to define than a set is.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.960
So let's try to work
up the idea of sets

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.539
by looking at some examples.

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.580
So we've already talked
about some familiar ones.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.996
There's the real
numbers for which

00:00:45.996 --> 00:00:50.120
we had this symbol
R in a special font,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.120
and the complex numbers
C, and the integers

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.850
Z. And we might have
mentioned, and you

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.990
might have seen already, the
idea of the empty set for which

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.170
we use this symbol that
looks like a zero with a line

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.420
through it.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.740
Let's look at an example
to pin things down.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.820
Let's look at this
set of four things.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.850
Namely, it's got two numbers,
pi/2 and 7, a character

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.076
string in quotes, "Albert R,"
and the Boolean value true.

00:01:25.076 --> 00:01:26.950
So those are the four
different things in it.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.400
They're of mixed type.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.017
And you might not like to
have a mixed type like this

00:01:33.017 --> 00:01:34.100
in a programming language.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.650
But mathematicians don't worry
about such things very much,

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.590
rarely.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.450
Anyway, the first
observation is that the order

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.820
in which these elements
are listed doesn't matter.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.470
This set-- the braces
indicates that it's

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.580
the set of these
things-- is the same if I

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.370
listed T first, then the string,
and the two numbers last.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.265
There is no notion
of order in a set.

00:01:59.265 --> 00:02:02.194
Now, to a computer scientist
this is a little unnatural.

00:02:02.194 --> 00:02:03.610
The most natural
thing to be would

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.490
be to define a
sequence of things,

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.764
like the sequence that
began with 7, then

00:02:07.764 --> 00:02:09.680
had the character string,
then had the number,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.220
then had the Boolean.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.940
And you could get by with
working with lists of things

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.280
as long as they're finite.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.500
But they very quickly
get out of hand

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.000
when you have to talk
about, say, a set of lists.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.630
Then it's not clear how to
make a list out of those,

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.610
and you wind up
making sets again.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.660
So sets, in fact, are an
unavoidable kind of idea.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.030
So another basic
thing to understand

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.880
about the notion of a
set is that an element

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.360
is either in a set
or not in a set.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.800
So if I write down
7, pi/2, 7, this

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.432
is the same description
of the same set 7, pi/2.

00:02:50.432 --> 00:02:52.390
I'm just telling you the
same thing twice here.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.280
That 7 is in the set, and
the 7 is in the set again.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.530
So no notion of being in
the set more than once.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.810
Now, sometimes,
technically you want

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.880
to add a notion of
so-called multisets

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.740
in which elements
can be in a set

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.360
a certain number of times,
an integer number of times.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.030
But there's no
real need for that.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.610
It's a secondary idea.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.270
And from our point of view,
you're in or out of a set.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.340
If you repeat elements, it's the
same as mentioning them once.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.870
So the most fundamental feature
of a set is what's in it.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.040
And for that, there's
a special notation.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.580
So we'll say that x is a
member of A, where A is a set,

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.850
and use this epsilon symbol
to indicate membership.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.350
It's read x is a member
of A. So for example, pi/2

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.730
is a member of that set that we
saw before that had pi/2 in it.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.790
14/2 is also a member of
that set because 14/2 is just

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.440
another description of 7.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.810
When I write 7 here, I
don't mean the character 7.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:50.960
I mean the number 7.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.350
And so 14/2 is the description
of the same number.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.360
It's in that set.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.790
On the other hand,
pi/3 is a number

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.450
that's simply not in that set.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.360
So I'm using the epsilon with
a vertical bar through it,

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.180
or some kind of a line through
it, to mean not a member of.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.770
Membership is so basic that
there's a lot of different ways

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:12.270
to say it.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.340
Besides using the membership
symbol x is a member of A,

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.290
you can sometimes say
x is an element of A,

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.640
or x is in A, as well
as x is a member of A.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.010
They're all synonyms.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.450
So for example, 7 is a
member of the integers.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.900
Z is our symbol
for the integers.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.210
2/3 is not a member
of the integers

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.040
because it's a fraction
that's not an integer.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.210
And on the other hand,
the set Z of integers

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.830
itself is a member of this
three-element set consisting

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.090
of the truth value T,
the set of all integers,

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.600
and the element 7.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.680
So here's an example where a
set can contain sets, quite

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.760
big ones even, and that's fine.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.480
That's not any problem
mathematically.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.660
Related to membership is another
fundamental notion of subset.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.050
So A is a subset of
B, it's pronounced.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.120
So that horizontal U
with a line under it

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.520
is meant to resemble a less
than or equal to symbol.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.400
So you can think of it as being
A is less than or equal to B.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.880
But don't overload the symbols.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.520
Less than or equal to is used
on numbers and other things

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.810
that we know how to order.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.220
And this is a relation that's
only allowed between sets.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.290
So A is a subset of B-- A
synonym is that A is contained

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.170
in B-- simply means
that every element of A

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.560
is also an element
of B. If I wrote

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.130
that out in predicate
logic notation

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.750
as a predicate formula, I'd say
for every x, x is in A implies

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:52.650
x is in B. If it's in A, then
it's in B. Everything in A

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.860
is in B.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.180
So some examples of
the subset relation

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.960
are that the integers are
a kind of-- an integer

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.560
is a special case
of a real number.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.910
So the set of integers is a
subset of the real numbers.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.740
A real number is a special
case of a complex number,

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.430
so the real numbers are a
subset of the complex numbers.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.530
And here's a concrete
example, where

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.270
I have a set of three
things, 5, 7, and 3,

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.230
and this is the set with
just the element 3 in it.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.360
Now, we sometimes are
sloppy about distinguishing

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.220
the element 3 from the set
that's consisting of just 3

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.240
as its only element.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.640
But in fact, it's a pretty
important distinction

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.060
to keep track of.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.990
In this case, 3 is not a subset
of this set on the right.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.910
But the set consisting of 3 is
a subset of the set on the right

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.370
because, after all, the only
member of this set is 3,

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.250
and that is a
member of this set.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.350
A consequence of this general
definition is that every set is

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.770
a subset of itself because
everything in A is in A .

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.680
That's not really
very interesting.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.340
Another important
general observation

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.380
is that the empty set is
a subset of everything.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.500
The empty set is a
subset of every set.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.780
Let's look at why that
is in more detail.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:13.120
So the claim is that the empty
set is a subset of everything.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.480
Let B be any old set,
then the empty set

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.310
is a subset of B. What exactly
does that mean according

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.770
to the definition of subset?

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:24.110
Well, it says that everything
that's in the empty set,

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.960
if it's in the
empty set, then it

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.970
implies that it's in
B. For every element,

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.430
if it's in the empty
set, then it's in B.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.820
Well, what do we
know about this?

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.110
The assertion that x is
in the empty set is false.

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.720
No matter what x is, there's
nothing in the empty set.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.790
And now I have an
implication that

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:49.110
implies where the left-hand
side, the hypothesis, is false.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.490
That means that the whole
implication is true,

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.170
and it doesn't
depend on what B is.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:55.590
I'm not even going
to look at B. I

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:58.340
can see that x is in
empty set is false,

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.320
so the whole
implication is true.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.450
And so what I'm saying
is that for every x,

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:06.000
something that's
true has to be true.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:06.920
Well, it is.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.280
And that's why the empty
set is a subset of B

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.280
satisfies this definition
in a formal way.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.750
And this is an example
of why that convention

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:20.400
that false implies anything
is convenient and is made

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.097
use here.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:29.550
So when you're defining
sets, if they're small,

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.480
you can just list
the elements, as we

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:37.620
did with that set with 7
and pi/2 and "Albert R."

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.682
Sometimes we can even
describe infinite sets

00:08:40.682 --> 00:08:41.640
as some kind of a list.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.900
Like I might describe the
set of integers as saying,

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.700
well, it's 0, 1, minus
1, 2, minus 2, and so on,

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.890
and you would understand that.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:55.510
But in general,
if I'm describing

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:57.710
a set that is not
so easy to list,

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.400
say the real numbers,
then what I'm going to do

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.250
is define a set by a defining
property of in the set.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:08.880
So I'm interested in a
property P of elements,

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.720
and I'm going to look
at the set of elements

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.330
x that are in some set A
such that P of x is true,

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.630
and that's the notation we use.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:21.640
So this would be read as the
set of x in A such that P of x

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.270
holds, that x has property P.
So notice this vertical bar is

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.200
read as "such that."

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.790
It's just a mathematical
abbreviation.

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:32.860
This is those elements in A
that have property P that P of x

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:36.279
holds for, and that defines
a set of those elements.

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:37.570
Let's look at a simple example.

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:41.950
The set E of even integers is
simply the set of numbers n

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.020
that are integers
such that n is even.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:49.500
So in this case, the property
P of n means that n is even.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.895
One last concept is the
concept of the power set.

00:09:55.895 --> 00:10:02.790
So the power set of a set A
is all of the subsets of A.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.180
So we could define
it using set notation

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.960
as it's the set of
B such that B is

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:14.430
a subset of A. An
example would be--

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:18.670
let's take the power set
of the two Boolean values

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:19.570
true and false.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.030
So the power set
of true and false,

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:23.870
of that set consisting
of two elements,

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.100
is-- well, what are
some of its subsets?

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.260
The set consisting of just true
is a subset of true, false.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.850
So is the set
consisting of false,

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:33.380
and so is the whole thing.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:34.960
It's a subset of itself.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.810
And one final element,
the empty set,

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:43.970
is a subset of the set of
Boolean values true and false.

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:45.990
So the power set of
this two-element set

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:50.290
is a set that has four things
in it-- two elements of size 1,

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:53.480
one element of size 2,
one element of size 0.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.860
And that's going to be
a general phenomenon

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.110
that we'll examine more later.

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.350
How big is the
power set of a set?

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:06.750
The even numbers, E that we just
defined on the previous slide,

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.670
is a member of the power
set of Z because it's

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:11.260
a subset of integers.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.780
Even integers are a
special case of integers.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:19.350
And the integers are a
member of the power set of R.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:21.830
That's just a synonym
for saying that integers

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.140
are a subset of reals.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.364
Every integer is a
real, so the integers

00:11:26.364 --> 00:11:27.780
are a subset of
reals, which means

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:31.080
they're a member of
the power set of reals.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.250
So the general property
is that a set B

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:37.390
is a member of the power
set of A if and only

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:40.660
if B is a subset of A.
That was the defining

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:45.170
condition for power set.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:49.900
And that's a fact to remember,
and it may potentially

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:50.500
confuse you.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.720
But it's a good
exercise in keeping

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.750
track of the difference
between is a member of

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.300
and is a subset of.
