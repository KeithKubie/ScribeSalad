1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:04,840
Hey, what's going on as bill burn?
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04,841 --> 00:00:08,340
Just before Friday. Monday
morning podcast in, ah,

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,580
just checking in on you.

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,840
[inaudible] how are Ya?
What's going on? Jesus Christ.

5
00:00:16,841 --> 00:00:20,470
I wrote my little notes here. I will
collect, collect ticks instead of Celtics.

6
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:25,750
Huh? Oh fuck. There's another helicopter
flying over. I am out here in Los Angeles.

7
00:00:25,751 --> 00:00:29,460
Los Angeles is on fire.
Um,

8
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,980
that's all everybody's talking
about. Oh my God. Are you okay?

9
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,490
How are you anywhere near the fire.
I am fine.

10
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:42,190
I am fine. I have not had
to evacuate yet. I have a,

11
00:00:42,191 --> 00:00:45,610
I've driven past the fires. It's
just, it's just what happens out here.

12
00:00:45,611 --> 00:00:49,210
Plus a global warming is the issue.

13
00:00:49,211 --> 00:00:54,040
Earlier this year we had unseasonably
high rains in the hills, turn green.

14
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,420
It looked like fucking Portland,

15
00:00:55,421 --> 00:01:00,130
Oregon and the fucking dumb ass may
or out his leg. The drought is over.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,090
Everybody goes back to water and they're
fucking lines and it's just like the

17
00:01:04,091 --> 00:01:05,470
drought is never over out here.

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,150
It's over fucking populated and we live
in a place that should not exist. Okay.

19
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,550
That is such a fucking
irresponsible statement.

20
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,980
We have enough water now
where there isn't a drought,

21
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,860
but please conserve it because we don't
know when it's gonna rain like that

22
00:01:17,861 --> 00:01:21,460
again. Thank you. And it's, you know,
it's on to Chicago and let's win there.

23
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,720
That's what the fuck she should have said.
Oh Hey, I know where the fuck it was.

24
00:01:25,721 --> 00:01:26,554
Right?

25
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,200
So all it did was just fatten up the
fucking lands that always burned out here.

26
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:36,460
Anyways, so Santa and Wednesday come
in after my Javvi desert over there.

27
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,410
It's like a giant fucking hair dry.

28
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,310
It dries out the fucking they'll fuck
in the hills in it. Lights on fire.

29
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,030
The problem is people live there now.
So then that's when it becomes a problem.

30
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,910
Mike, oh, are you going?
How are they gonna get their
fucking Prius out of there?

31
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,010
Um, by the way, I love all
the people playing like
politics, you know, going good.

32
00:01:57,011 --> 00:01:59,440
All those fucking liberals
are burning out there. It's a,

33
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,010
La is one of the most conservative fucking
places you're ever going to live in.

34
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,920
The second she get into the valley,
just get out of there.

35
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:11,250
Get out of Hollywood with all these
starlets solving problems as they accept a

36
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:14,020
fucking award.
You know,

37
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:19,150
let's not forget about the fucking planet
poses in the cove next to the blood

38
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:24,430
diamonds. Thank you so much. This
one's for all the fat bitches, right?

39
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:27,570
Whatever the fuck it
is. They say, you know,

40
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,110
before they jump in their limo back to
the fucking gated community outside,

41
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,920
outside, you just go to Burbank
and they're making it great again.

42
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,110
All right.
And first of all,

43
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:41,010
what kind of a fucking ass watch his
fellow Americans houses burned down,

44
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:47,270
you know, and they actually are
happy about it. You know what I mean?

45
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,950
This is how fucked up like,

46
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:54,110
like politics has become in this,
in this goddamn country. However,

47
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:58,730
I feel like Hollywood did
bring it on themselves with
their fucking finger wagon.

48
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,800
You know, I told you that fucking jerk
off. So this guy on Twitter and he goes,

49
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:07,480
okay, in case you didn't take your
smart pills today, um, Obama is awesome.

50
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,590
It's just like, look, how dumb are you
that that's how you'd present your point.

51
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,450
As opposed to me who just
calls everybody comes,

52
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,610
he should do it the way that
I do it. So anyways, I'm

53
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,680
watching all of this shit happen
and knowing that, you know,

54
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:28,570
and I believe anyways that we are
playing a major role in it is really

55
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:33,370
depressing. But I've, I've now I've got
myself in a positive mindset about it.

56
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:37,780
I just think they, they, they're going
to look at like the last hundred years

57
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,820
is just this, um, period in our
history where we were wrong.

58
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,480
I mean,
it's not wrong with oil.

59
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:49,060
We didn't fucking realize that it
was going to do all of this shit.

60
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:52,240
But now we know and I think
there's getting in the future,

61
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,650
I think that we're going to, hopefully
we'll utilize solar power, wind,

62
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,270
uh, water or whatever the fuck it is at
these egg heads know how to use, I mean,

63
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:04,660
I show you, I saw that flash
like the other day. It just
runs on water. I mean, we,

64
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,250
we can do stuff like this and
we can live happily. All right.

65
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:12,370
We don't need to cut beaks off chickens.
You know,

66
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:17,050
I think in every period, like when you
look at how we get to live right now,

67
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,010
it's fucking amazing.

68
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,910
And even still how we treat each other
is amazing compared to way we did it for

69
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,240
500 years ago.
Well,

70
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,700
eventually there's going to be four or
500 years beyond this and they're going

71
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,020
to be looking at us like
they were barbarians and
they were spraying on leaded

72
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,940
fuel until the address. Fear was
hating. God, policies were burning down.

73
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,080
They bought the big stuff that
chickens. Right. You know,

74
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,850
as we sit there thinking we're fucking
amazing because we can take a pill that

75
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:46,840
makes her dick stand up
even though we're 85. Um,

76
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,530
so I think we're going to
come out of it. I think, uh,

77
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,560
what has to happen is to solar people
have to start paying off politicians the

78
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:58,600
way the oil people do.
And once that happens,

79
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,130
then hopefully what will happen is the
same thing that happened in my business

80
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:06,970
where I watched everybody being at
the big three networks all of a sudden

81
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:11,500
wanting to be over at Netflix.
So if you look at the big three,

82
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:15,910
like NBC, ABC, and CBS is,
you know, the oil companies,

83
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,210
hopefully everybody will jump
over to like solar stuff.

84
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:22,690
And I know what people are saying. They,
well, you know, you need fucking January,

85
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,670
January, she boogie [inaudible]
I know, I realize that.

86
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,410
I realize that there's always going
to be some sort of lubricant. Um,

87
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,520
I understand that. But you
know, have you seen that, that,

88
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,630
that fucking shit that Tesla guy came out
with where they got the, they got the,

89
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,750
uh, the roof tiles that are solar.
I don't know if they work yet.

90
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,570
I don't know if he can even fucking get
it. But if those things fucking work,

91
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:42,910
and I mean there's a thing,

92
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,300
there's a thing that below
$1 billion a month on,

93
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,100
right as a plos post,

94
00:05:49,101 --> 00:05:53,620
a fly and [inaudible] trying to find
fucking people with the little bag of

95
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:55,300
dynamite and some nails in it.

96
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,680
Those little cock suckers over there,
man, they fucking bankrupt in us

97
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,570
running around with a little trick or
treat bag and we'll fucking see sitting in

98
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,030
$1 billion worth of shit
at him every fucking month.

99
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,640
They're never going to
defeat us in that game.

100
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,150
They're going to kill this
fucking financially. That's it.

101
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,460
I'm off my tree stump
that just burned down.

102
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,580
One of the great things about spending a
lot of time alone is nobody debates the

103
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:24,920
points you're making.
So you always feel like you're right.

104
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,450
And that's what I'm doing right
now. Um, please by all means,

105
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:31,940
don't take any of this shit seriously.
Alright? I'm just fucking around.

106
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:36,590
I talk about what's in the news.
Okay? Don't get your red tie.

107
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,130
Oh, your blue tie or your
fucking panties in a bunch.

108
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,280
Alright.
Grow the fuck up.

109
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,853
Um,

110
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,910
hey, what's going on this
weekend? Not The fucking La Rams.

111
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,900
The who would have thought La fucking
rams. What are they? 92, 10 and two.

112
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:58,210
I don't know where the fuck we are.
I'm too busy editing.

113
00:06:58,211 --> 00:07:01,960
The third season of F is for family.
Um, I don't know where the hell we are.

114
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,250
God dammit.
It's already December.

115
00:07:03,251 --> 00:07:07,630
Can you believe that the regular
season of football is almost over?

116
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,950
The regular season of college
football is already over.

117
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,800
We're already into the bowl season.

118
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:20,801
It's just unfucking believable how fast
the football season goes by September,

119
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,380
October, November, December.
If you look at baseball,
that's April, May, June, July.

120
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,910
Well, no wonder they still play September.
We've also, they still play September,

121
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:36,410
August, September and into October and
into fucking November. Oh, there you go.

122
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,410
Unfucking believable. Um, well I guess
they play into February here, right?

123
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,920
Who knows. Anyways, um, I was actually
going to have time next week to,

124
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,040
uh, start flying again. The helicopter.

125
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:55,100
I was going to try and get up to
150 hours by the end of the year.

126
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:59,810
And I had this flight I wanted to do
from long beach up to Bakersfield over to

127
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:04,811
Santa Barbara and then back down to a
long beach and was going gonna take me

128
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:09,800
roughly like three hours.
And I was going to do that about five,

129
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:13,070
six times and I was
going to get my, uh, um,

130
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,180
I was going to be up to 150 hours and uh,

131
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,300
then the fire's games and I was
like, all right, you know what,

132
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:23,060
I'm not going to be another asshole
up there in the fucking way.

133
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:27,980
And plus I don't want to have to deal with
trying to fly around that shit. So, uh,

134
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,360
I don't know, maybe I'll do it in January
cause I'm taking most of January off.

135
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,860
Um, by the way, I was going to be in Santa
Barbara this weekend. That got moved. Um,

136
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,410
that got cancelled and moved
because of the fires. Um,

137
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:47,000
so I don't know,
maybe in February or something like that.

138
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,830
I'll let you guys know what the
a three sheds you'll date is. Um,

139
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,070
anyways, let's, uh, let's move ahead.

140
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:57,241
Um,
oh,

141
00:08:57,241 --> 00:09:00,360
and also I forgot to trash the liberals
that we're happy that Rupert Murdoch's

142
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:04,410
house caught on fire too. I mean, do you
just, you just beyond a childish cunt,

143
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,460
if watching another person's house on
fire because you don't agree with their

144
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:12,130
fucking political, but views, it's just,

145
00:09:12,131 --> 00:09:15,370
that just blows my mind,
you know,

146
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,540
I don't know. Look, if it's Thai caught
on fire anymore, blah, blah, blah. Well,

147
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,410
when he had to pat it off, cause
I mean, that's funny. You know,

148
00:09:21,411 --> 00:09:24,800
the guy's got a zillion fucking ties.
He probably has a zillion houses too.

149
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,490
I mean, what, what am I saying
here? I'll tell you what I'm saying.

150
00:09:28,491 --> 00:09:32,420
I watched the Celtics, I'm getting
caught up on the sellies, the Celtics.

151
00:09:32,421 --> 00:09:33,950
I watched my Bruins,
uh,

152
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,510
make a valiant effort to get
back in the game with Nashville,

153
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:42,410
which they did a bright, as I said,
in the second period, I was just like,

154
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:42,981
just come on man.

155
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:45,920
Let's go one fucking goal here
before the end of the second period.

156
00:09:45,921 --> 00:09:49,880
They did still ended up
losing a five to three,

157
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,190
but, um, I dunno, I dunno what
the Bruins are doing, you know,

158
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,151
I was like,

159
00:09:56,151 --> 00:09:59,480
what the fuck are they doing when they
blew up the team and then we started to

160
00:09:59,481 --> 00:10:04,481
make some progress last year and this
year I know what I think we just have,

161
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,440
we had a bunch of injuries and shit,

162
00:10:06,441 --> 00:10:10,880
so I'm still holding out hope that they
know what they're doing. But I just,

163
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,150
I think we just signed some guy that
was more of a physical presence,

164
00:10:14,151 --> 00:10:18,530
but somebody we're still
feeling the effects of not
having Lou Cheech out there,

165
00:10:18,531 --> 00:10:23,480
man. Every three or four shifts.
But, uh, I watched the Celtics first,

166
00:10:23,481 --> 00:10:28,320
the, uh, the Milwaukee Bucks and I watch
that Yannis, uh, super cal fragile,

167
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:33,260
whatever his fucking name is. Uh,
the Greek freak. Jesus Christ. Yes.

168
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,740
The difference between him last year
when the Celtics played, and this year,

169
00:10:36,741 --> 00:10:41,220
I mean, that guy was
unbelievable. Yeah. He had every,

170
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,470
every fucking shot you
could possibly have.

171
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:47,010
The guy's hitting fucking three pointers.
He was dunking on gay.

172
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,190
He was dunking on guys.
He was like 12 feet away from the rim,

173
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:54,810
and he would just reach his
fucking arm. Just keeps going. Um,

174
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,130
I got to see that guy live that is, uh,
that's, uh, when he's fucking young,

175
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:03,190
before his knees and they
start, you know, like, you know,

176
00:11:03,191 --> 00:11:06,010
like when you look at Tom Brady and
he was like, what do you see as socks?

177
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:09,040
And you can see there's all kinds of metal
and shit underneath his fucking socks

178
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:13,650
now. Um hmm. Or like Allen Iverson,

179
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:15,890
who by the end was wearing like a catsuit,
you know,

180
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,370
they had like those compression sleeves
and then you got one on your leg. Um,

181
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,540
I want to see that dude when
he's fucking young, you know,

182
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:29,160
not favored and injury, just dunking on
people the way I saw the other night.

183
00:11:29,161 --> 00:11:33,420
It was, it was, it was an
incredible display. Um,

184
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,920
I got to start watching them. I
just don't have fucking time. I,

185
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,260
this is what I take. I take
Bruins, Celtics, patriots,

186
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,210
and Duke University.

187
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,653
MMM.

188
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,010
And I try to stay up on those
as much as I can. And, um,

189
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,880
I got to start taping the Kansas
Jayhawks too. And there's just,

190
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,370
there's just not enough fucking time.
Kansas Jayhawks that's my first team.

191
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:59,530
That's my first team. But I got into Duke
last year when I went to that game and,

192
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:00,800
um,

193
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,633
okay.

194
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,840
I Dunno.
And I also,

195
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,010
I called in this show and I got to talk
to coach k and he was talking about like

196
00:12:07,011 --> 00:12:09,930
how hard it is to recruit now,
uh,

197
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,880
because everybody's like one and done
and he somehow got another whole batch of

198
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:18,620
one and done or said or the shit.
Two or three guys and a, I dunno,

199
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,630
it's like what Kentucky does every year,
but a, I don't know what happened to me.

200
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,700
I've slowly become like a college sports
fan while trying to still pay attention

201
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:34,910
to the pro shit. Still not knowing what
the Los Angeles Rams record is. All right.

202
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,870
Well we got, we got, Jared
was hitting golf Joffe,

203
00:12:38,871 --> 00:12:41,240
however the fuck he sits at his,
his last name is like,

204
00:12:41,241 --> 00:12:44,510
how do you say Gif Gif said Gif is it Gif,

205
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,570
um, versus, uh, Carson Wentz. Um,

206
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,470
although I got to tell you after watching
the Seattle Seahawks last fucking week,

207
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,760
I mean that was, that was a, that was an
MVP level performance by Russell Wilson.

208
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,310
I don't know, I couldn't even tell
how good their offensive life.

209
00:13:04,311 --> 00:13:06,170
It was good if it just absolutely sucked.

210
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:10,070
It was like every fucking play drop back
for a pass. They'd be like three eagles,

211
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:15,200
you know, defensive lineman in
his face and he would just fucking

212
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,670
zigzag around up dead changed direction.
Do is spin.

213
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:25,040
The one thing I will say about the
Seahawks offensive line is they are really

214
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:30,041
good about not holding when some shit
like that because usually when somebody

215
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:33,080
changes direction somebodies like, oh
fuck, now you're going back the other way.

216
00:13:33,081 --> 00:13:36,110
Then they just, there they can't
fight the urge to just hold.

217
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:39,530
They were really good about not doing
that shit I guess when you can't really

218
00:13:39,531 --> 00:13:43,160
tackle somebody, there's
no reason to block. But um,

219
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:44,990
I was really,

220
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:49,991
really impressed with how well Pete
Carroll had those guys playing in the fact

221
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:51,164
that,
uh,

222
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:55,490
Sherman was out with the ruptured
Achilles and you hate to see that.

223
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,630
Where is the fun beating Seattle? If
sh, you know, Sherman isn't playing,

224
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,160
you're not beating the
Seahawks. I mean, come on,

225
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,440
you're beating an injured fucking
team, but they stay still looked. Uh,

226
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,410
I think the Patriots,
Jesus Christ,

227
00:14:09,411 --> 00:14:10,970
we don't get enough
pressure on the quarterback.

228
00:14:10,971 --> 00:14:12,650
Forget about a guy that
runs around like that.

229
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:16,880
I would not want to play those
guys. Um, there I admitted it.

230
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,900
They were scary fucking team quite.
Let me read a little bit of, um,

231
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,810
let me read a little bit of this shit
here. Um, the advertising. All right,

crate a crate for a mad.

want to get by your guy, create a shit.

237
00:14:50,461 --> 00:14:54,920
This is probably, it's hard to pick.
It's hard to pick out the perfect gift.

238
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,280
It's also hard to fucking
mind for diamonds,

239
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,940
but all too easy to get it totally wrong.

said the rugged outdoorsman,

247
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:34,430
I thought they're going to

favorite drink.
They put your name on the glass.

254
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,960
You don't even feel like an alcoholic.
You feel like you accomplished something.

255
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,920
I love man crate and the grill master

And so everyone can get a perfect fit.

283
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,870
You know what those adult onesies
remind me of. You know those people,

284
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:56,880
I don't even believe
that they agree exists.

285
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:00,540
Those people that dress up like mascots
so they can fuck each other with some

286
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:04,860
donkey head on. I don't exist. I don't
believe that those people exist. Um,

287
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,670
or is that a stepping
stone just to beastiality

Everybody about who to do beyond these
[inaudible] La is fucking on fire.

304
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:06,450
Doo Doo Doo Doo. Brds beyond
the summit. Fuck it. Lit a tire.

305
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,110
It rolled into the hills
and burn the houses down.

306
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,300
The guy who created the Ninja turtles

307
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,580
now as address like a clown because
he had all his money in a fucking safe

308
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:20,190
inside his house at fucking burned down.
The money didn't burn.

309
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:24,690
The fire department stole it, but
now, but now, but DB boom. Um,

310
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,670
and that's a big thing.
You know,

311
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,660
just like this corrupt
referees in the NBA,

312
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,050
there's corrupt firemen and you'll have,

313
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,880
you'll have a fire in your
fucking garage and then, you know,

314
00:19:35,881 --> 00:19:38,040
they'll put that out. And when
you go into your bedroom, you,

315
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:42,600
your wife's missing your earrings. Where's
my earrings at? Burned up in the fire.

316
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,010
Me undies,
everybody.

317
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:52,670
Every year millions of people received
the least light gift of all time

318
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,480
underwear.
Uh,

319
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,890
but we will still give it to our family
and our loved ones who just don't want

320
00:19:58,891 --> 00:20:01,950
it. But maybe it's not that
that the underwears the problem.

321
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:05,370
Maybe it's the kind of underwear.
Let me tell you about me undies.

322
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:09,990
The only underwear that makes for an
amazing gift bmds made underwear the

perfect gift that everyone
is going to love you for.

324
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,990

Jack Nicholson should be then.

325
00:20:16,991 --> 00:20:20,150

same old holiday traditional shit.

Send a pro flowers bouquet
or plant through it.

334
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:55,601

you should send one of these to another
guy friend just cause it's fucking

mini Christmas tree that comes with

341
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:22,670
lights and ornaments. I'm going to get
one of those because we're going back.

342

We're going back to you. Did she go
family bed gauged uh, for Christmas.

All right.

353
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:09,200
Guess what I'm doing? Um,
this this fucking month.

354
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:13,760
I am trying to stay off social
media because I think it is a,

355
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:18,710
uh, I think it has, it's, it's,
it definitely has its good points.

356
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,010
All right? But wherever they
are, I don't see them right now.

357
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,750
I'm taking a month off.
I'll still obviously tweet and post shit,

358
00:22:26,751 --> 00:22:30,480
but I'm not reading anything
or any of that fucking crap.

359
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,710
Um, I'm trying to be
perfect Billy, this month.

360
00:22:34,711 --> 00:22:38,610
I'm trying to go back to the bill
that I was when I was eight years old.

361
00:22:38,611 --> 00:22:42,480
I didn't drink. You know, I didn't
take the occasional hit a weed.

362
00:22:42,481 --> 00:22:46,110
I didn't fucking, I
didn't watch porno. Right?

363
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,610
I didn't watch people getting fucking
slapped by gorillas on fucking youtube,

364
00:22:50,611 --> 00:22:53,010
but didn't exist.
Okay.

365
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,020
I ended up pure fucking mind.
I went outside,

366
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,940
I picked up a stick and I played cowboys
and Indians and reenacted the genocide

367
00:23:02,941 --> 00:23:06,150
that made this country. What
it is. Okay. I was innocent.

368
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,310
Uh, yeah. I'm just trying to fucking, I'm
trying to slow it down here. All right.

369
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,000
I've been doing great man.
Uh,

370
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:17,580
d del Rey has gotten me on this
fucking diet that is working for me.

371
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,970
I just got to eat more
salads. I gotta get, I get,

372
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,420
I haven't been doing that lately,
but, uh, um, I swear to God.

373
00:23:24,421 --> 00:23:26,250
I know you guys are
going to fucking hate me.

374
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,970
I know you're going to fucking hate me.
I'm laying off the bread.

375
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:35,550
I'm kind of doing that gluten free thing,
you know? And I used to always be like,

376
00:23:35,551 --> 00:23:38,580
fuck that dude. I'm always eating
pizza. I'm always eaten bread and shit.

377
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,340
I got to tell you something dude.
The fucking waitress,

378
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,250
if you don't booze and you lay off the
bread and the flower that and you eat

379
00:23:46,251 --> 00:23:49,700
well that the fit,
the Fed has no way to hide.

380
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:52,790
It's like fucking roaches when you
turn the light or I guess they run an,

381
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:56,270
I don't think, I don't know what it is.
I don't know. I don't know what the,

382
00:23:56,271 --> 00:23:58,990
I don't know. Hey people, I don't know
what the fucking analogy is. It's,

383
00:23:58,991 --> 00:23:59,900
it's out there somewhere.

384
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,450
All right. But it's not
in my brain right now. Um,

385
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:09,790
and I'm actually liking the Goddamn food.
I finally went to steel cut oats.

386
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,180
Uh,
and for some reason on this diet,

387
00:24:13,181 --> 00:24:15,400
I'm putting a little brown sugar
and a little bit of butter in there.

388
00:24:15,401 --> 00:24:16,810
It's been fucking tremendous.

389
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,840
And I know there's all these
people and I don't like that.

390
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:23,350
Glad is going to clog up your
arteries. You know what? Fuck you,

391
00:24:23,351 --> 00:24:24,400
I got to eat something.

392
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,233
MMM.

393
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,300
Then I have a couple of eggs over AEG.
I,

394
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,100
I got this other thing that I can make
some times of breakfast where it's just

395
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:39,320
keen what black beans in an egg. I throw
a little salsa on top, fucking delicious.

396
00:24:39,321 --> 00:24:44,060
I just don't wrap it up. One of those
giant flour tortillas, you know,

397
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,650
with the fucking,
you know what the deal is.

398
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:49,100
Then all of a sudden you start throwing
the sour cream on and the cheese and all

399
00:24:49,101 --> 00:24:51,890
of that shit and you
literally like you fucking,

400
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:56,000
you leave the Taco stand and you fucking
walking out like lean into one side,

401
00:24:56,001 --> 00:24:57,890
like someone punched in your fucking ribs.

402
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,390
Um, yeah. And then also I,

403
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:05,710
uh,

404
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,900
my teeth will get fucked up down
the bottom. Just as you get older,

405
00:25:09,901 --> 00:25:11,700
I guess your job keeps
growing or whatever.

406
00:25:11,701 --> 00:25:15,000
This is whatever the fucking
dentist told me. So I actually,

407
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,570
I finally bit the bullet and
I got that fucking Invisalign,

408
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,530
so I got to wear that thing for the
next 12 to 16 weeks and I'll do it.

409
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,900
I'll tell you right now,
dude, it fucking sucks.

410
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,970
It sucks man.

411
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,630
But it definitely makes you
eat less because it's like,

412
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:31,910
I don't want to take this fucking thing
out and go through this whole rig of

413
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,163
Morel.

414
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:34,843
MMM.

415
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,840
Oh my God, Dude. You realize I'm bald.
I'm going to be 50 and be wearing braces.

416
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,710
Can you want us,

417
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:45,510
do you understand the Trifecta of fucking
thank God I have knee and my life.

418
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:48,060
Can you mind if I was a single man
and that's what the fuck I was doing.

419
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:49,723
Okay.

420
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:53,080
Um, I'm kind of doing like a fucking
light overhaul on my body right now.

421
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,610
I'm laying off the booze.

422
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,330
I'm getting my fucking teeth down the
bottom because I was starting to look like

423
00:25:58,331 --> 00:26:00,550
a fucking,
I dunno what some sort of a,

424
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:05,230
where are my references today?
I don't know why the hell they are.

425
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,330
I'm trying to think that there's
a couple of fucking wild.

426
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:08,800
Yeah.

427
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,120
What's dead fucking thing that exists in

428
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,520
mmm,

429
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,060
South American. It's the worst kind
of animal to be. It's like you would,

430
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:20,050
you're like,
you exist to keep the top predators alive.

431
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,730
Like people are, they fuck like rabbits.
The reason why rabbits fuck like that.

432
00:26:24,731 --> 00:26:28,120
And they have all this because
everybody eats them in the wild. Okay.

433
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,750
They'll let their like the, the, hey,
you guys want to get some sliders.

434
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,350
That's where like rabbits are in the wild.
So there's some sort of fucking,

435
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,780
it's not a pig and it's not a rat.

436
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,830
What does that fuck?
I gotta look it up now.

437
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,250
South

438
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,310
America.
I want to go to South America.

439
00:26:47,311 --> 00:26:51,690
So bad South American pig rat.

440
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:57,270
Let's see what they show it. The
fuck is it? Come on man. Come on.

441
00:26:57,271 --> 00:26:58,104
Internet.

442
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,120
Yeah.

443
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:04,990
A cabby cabby Barra. Is that what
it is? These giant Guinea pigs.

444
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,480
That's what my lower teeth
are starting to look like.

445
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,680
Come on clicking on the images.
Did I do it right?

446
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,460
Did I fucking nailed it?

447
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,650
Fucking nailed it.

448
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,930
It's like if a squirrel fucked up pig.
Well they have,

449
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:30,050
they have like surprisingly
one of the pig size rats.

450
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:36,860
I got to omit the kind of cute, the
face really makes them fucking cute. Um,

451
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:42,650
this is going to be like the next
Pixar movie. These giant motherfuckers.

452
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,373
Um,

453
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:46,690
okay.

454
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,610
By the way, Dude. Yeah. I
have South American man. I've,

455
00:27:48,611 --> 00:27:51,640
I've wanted to go there for so God
damn long. I just don't have the time.

456
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,870
I'd love to go down there and
do a fucking show, you know,

457
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:01,690
I've always wanted to go to the
Galapagos Islands. All of this shit.

458
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:07,230
It just seems green and
beautiful. You know, I don't know.

459
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,510
I gotta get my ass fucking down there at
some point. Why? Why the hell wouldn't I?

460
00:28:10,511 --> 00:28:11,980
If I talk about global warming,

461
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:16,840
why don't I jump on a fucking jet plane
and spray on leaded leaded fuel across

462
00:28:16,841 --> 00:28:20,890
the fucking atmosphere for a
good 12 hour flight from La.

463
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,350
This is how dumb I am. I actually thought,
cause I moved out here, I was actually,

464
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,820
it's a shorter flight to fucking
like Brazil or something.

465
00:28:27,821 --> 00:28:31,390
I didn't realize that like,
you know when you look at it,

466
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,590
if you were in New York and he flew
due south, you'd be on the east,

467
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:39,820
the west coast of their country. Um,
yeah. Bill. Yeah, we all have a globe.

468
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,980
We've all looked at a map at some point.
Well you know what,

469
00:28:41,981 --> 00:28:46,000
sometimes I don't look at Shit.
Um,

470
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,750
anyways, so I don't know shit
about NFL football this year.

471
00:28:49,751 --> 00:28:52,990
So I'm actually gonna go out on a limb
here and say something that is based on

472
00:28:52,991 --> 00:28:55,420
watching one football game.
Um,

473
00:28:55,450 --> 00:29:00,450
I'm actually thinking all right that
the winner of the Rams Eagles game will

474
00:29:02,261 --> 00:29:06,820
fucking lose to Seattle or the
Seattle might be on the road,

475
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:12,490
can play off time. I have no,
can you imagine if Marshawn
lynch didn't fuck them,

476
00:29:12,491 --> 00:29:16,720
retire and kept, was still playing
with them, but they got that other kid,

477
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,310
that fucking mini Marshawn that
came with a fucking maniac.

478
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:24,550
Like I don't know what p care, what
the Fuck Pete Carol does, you know,

479
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,680
aside from looking the other way,

480
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:30,930
would half his defense is doing fucking
steroids? I don't know what they are.

481
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:33,220
What's in the water up there in Seattle,

482
00:29:33,221 --> 00:29:37,360
but they got some people that
could fucking play. Um, all right,

483
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:41,170
I'm done blowing the Seattle
Seahawks. Um, all right,

484
00:29:41,171 --> 00:29:43,290
that's the podcast here for this,
uh,

485
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,600
this wonderful Thursday,
um,

486
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:52,300
all sober bill who would have
thought all slender sober bill.

487
00:29:52,301 --> 00:29:55,350
I finally stood on the scale
today up to fucking not booze and

488
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:01,030
eating like a fucking Hollywood douche.
And um,

489
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:06,790
you know, when I went back in August,
I was pushing like, I was like one 87.

490
00:30:06,791 --> 00:30:11,320
I was pushing like a push and you know,
it's closing in on 200 days.

491
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,160
Um,
I'm now down to about,

492
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,820
I said one 71.6.
It's perfect.

493
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,740
My clothes fit now and this is what
I'm going to do this time. All right.

494
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,550
I'm actually going to buy jeans that fit,
you know,

495
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:30,950
when I'm this weight because the
problem is, is I have a bump.

496
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,810
All my jeans fit me when I'm one 87 so
as I put on the way, and I don't notice,

497
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:39,850
I'm all comfortable, I just fucking
walking around my big fucking Jade's Oh,

498
00:30:39,851 --> 00:30:44,280
Billy big jeans.
Oh,

499
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,230
that might be my favorite
one. Oh, Billy big jeans.

500
00:30:47,231 --> 00:30:49,630
I'm not fucking doing it anymore.
Do you understand me?

501
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,370
These still speak English of fucking Bob.
I'm gonna uh,

502
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:58,060
does like a skid row right
down the street from me.

503
00:30:58,061 --> 00:31:01,750
I don't go to goodwill anymore. I
don't trust those cuts. All right?

504
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:05,670
What I do is I go down
to skid row and I got,

505
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,800
Hey, you homeless mother
fuckers want free clothes?

506
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,720
Um, no, I don't do that. I s you know,

507
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,290
anybody who is sort of
my size step right up.

508
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:22,690
I just know I go down and I just have the
bag and I walk up to where their tents

509
00:31:22,691 --> 00:31:26,890
are and I just fucking set it down and
I turned around and I walk away like

510
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,280
fucking Santa Claus for junkies.

511
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,150
Okay. And I got all kinds
of shit in there, you know?

512
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:38,690
And it's just funny to me that uh,
that I'm,

513
00:31:38,691 --> 00:31:41,500
I'm giving away clothes that like,
maybe I like this,

514
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:46,501
some like fucking homeless guy walking
around wearing a shirt that I wore on

515
00:31:46,691 --> 00:31:47,530
Conan O'brien.

516
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:55,960
I know what I should be doing is going
down there and thinking, oh my God,

517
00:31:55,961 --> 00:31:58,870
this is so sad that fellow
Americans have to live this way.

518
00:31:58,871 --> 00:32:02,320
But I am such a self
involved Hollywood douche.

519
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:07,530
I actually walk away still thinking about
how about myself and how I just gave

520
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:13,510
away close that had TV credits.
You know,

521
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,790
I hate that about myself, but you
know, I'm just being honest. I do.

522
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:23,320
And I also feel good that I
did something like that. Right?

523
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:27,940
It's all that stuff that allegedly
Jesus doesn't appreciate, you know,

524
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,280
he then spraying in public,
I should just do that shit.

525
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,430
And not tell you guys that I did it,
but now I'm telling you that I did it.

526
00:32:33,431 --> 00:32:36,040
Which takes away the,
uh,

527
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,690
the good deed because
if you do a good deed,

528
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,230
just so you can walk
around and talk about her,

529
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,460
sit down and talk about it on a podcast,
you're not a good person.

530
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,990
You're a cunt and a, yeah, so
that's what we learned here.

531
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,410
You know,
if there really was a Jesus,

532
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:57,070
if there really was a Santa Claus did
be coal in my stocking and I would be on

533
00:32:57,381 --> 00:33:01,100
my way to the fiery depths of health,
right?

534
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:04,730
According to my religion, just because I
went down there and I gave the clothes,

535
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:07,670
but then told you guys about it.
That's how it works in my religion.

536
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,820
That's how my religion is.
I'm all right.

537
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,800
I don't even know what the fuck I'm
talking about this point. All right.

538
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:15,470
That's the end of the podcast.
Okay.

539
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,720
But fortunately we have
some bonus material for you.

540
00:33:17,721 --> 00:33:19,160
We're going to play a little music.

541
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:21,920
The Great Andrew Feminists always
comes up with these tracks.

542
00:33:21,921 --> 00:33:24,470
You guys are always out gay man.
Like, who is this being? Well, Bill,

543
00:33:24,471 --> 00:33:28,940
you listen to all this interesting music.
It's not me. It's Andrew. All right.

544
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:33,210
And then after the music is over,
you'll then be able to listen to a,

545
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:37,000
a greatest hits podcast from a Thursday
gone by from earlier this year of

546
00:33:37,001 --> 00:33:40,430
fucking, I don't know, whenever the hell
I started these and that's how it works.

547
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,340
And if you have a problem with that,
then you know what I would do?

548
00:33:43,341 --> 00:33:45,920
I would go to the all things comedy
network and I will listen to a different

549
00:33:45,921 --> 00:33:47,420
podcast.
By the way,

550
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:51,380
thank you guys so much for buying tickets
to the Patrice O'neil comedy benefit.

551
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:52,460
Um,

552
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:56,180
tickets are going fast.
The lower level is already sold out.

553
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:59,030
Now we've got the upper two decks to go.
You know what?

554
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:03,200
It makes a wonderful Christmas gift.
Why don't you get your best guy, friend

555
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,880
a fucking, um, uh,

556
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,040
uh,

557
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,480
Kay of candy cane fucking
roses from pro flowers and get,

558
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,880
you know,
and then in the card when they think that,

559
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:19,520
that you went gay for them and
they're going like, oh my God,

560
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,280
how do I still hang out with this guy?
I thought it wasn't homophobic.

561
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:25,520
I'm not homophobic until my best guy
friend who I thought was straight has a

562
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,280
crush on me.
Is that considered homophobia?

563
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,860
Okay. If you don't have a
problem with gay people,

564
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,930
but then one of your friends
who you thought was straight,

565
00:34:33,931 --> 00:34:38,640
then I'm going to use this.
The stupid expression becomes gay,

566
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:42,150
you know, like, like, like, like they
caught the mumps or something. Um,

567
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:46,560
tells you that this whole time that Ben
gay and that they also have feelings for

568
00:34:46,561 --> 00:34:51,360
you if you get weirded out by that. Like,
dude, I can't hang out with you for,

569
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:54,600
can I hang out with you for awhile
until, uh, I can't hang out.

570
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,950
I don't think I can hang out with you.

571
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,230
I mean, a woman would say that, right?
If you will. Just like, you know,

572
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,960
I though we'd been friends for awhile,

573
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,930
but I just want to let you know that
I've developed feelings for you. Yeah.

574
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:09,320
You're not coming over her apartment
to fucking watch survivor at that point

575
00:35:09,321 --> 00:35:12,860
anymore unless, unless she has feelings
for you. Right. Isn't that how it works?

576
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:17,490
What is it? I don't know. All right.

577
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:22,940
There's a lot of times I
should have stopped a podcast
10 15 minutes earlier and

578
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,330
uh, this might be one of
those times, I have no idea.

579
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:28,820
But you don't want to have to do the
second eye fucking shut this off is I have

580
00:35:28,821 --> 00:35:32,810
to put my fucking Invisalign back in.
It's fine once they're fucking in there,

581
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:37,590
but when you're, when you pop them
in there, like it's, you know,

582
00:35:37,591 --> 00:35:38,040
to get the

583
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,210
best results were at 22 hours a day.
You know,

584
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,210
you ever go to the airport and you see
those people who like broke their fucking

585
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:48,330
ankle and then it's like they
got that thing that they are,

586
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,980
it's like a scooter and they can just
rest their knee on it. This is like,

587
00:35:52,981 --> 00:35:55,020
this is the teeth version of that.

588
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,350
I don't understand why those people
just don't use fucking crunches.

589
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,680
Do they have like that
little upper body strength?

590
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,690
Is their cast that fucking heavy
or is it just more efficient?

591
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,830
Those are the hard hitting questions
we ask here in the podcast. All right,

592
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,690
have a great weekend.
You're constant joy.

593
00:36:13,691 --> 00:36:17,290
The music and the greatest hits Thursday
afternoon, just before Monday. No,

594
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:18,990
just pull the whole Friday.
Monday morning. Paul.

595
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,393
Yay.

596
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:07,650
[inaudible]

597
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,390
I have the urge to make
a pumpkin pie this week.

598
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:14,580
I want to practice before the
holidays. Uh, ginger, scumbag

599
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:22,880
bill. I've been a fan of
yours for 15 years. Okay,

600
00:37:22,881 --> 00:37:27,710
so you guys got that. This guy has
been a fan of mine for 15 years,

601
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,160
so for 15 years this guy has been falling
me enjoying things that I'm doing.

602
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:37,670
All right?
This guy's locked in for 15 years.

603
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:42,230
The people that work hard every day
and spend their hard earned cash.

604
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:46,040
That's kind of redundant, sir. If you
work hard, then you have harder and cash.

605
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,690
All right? We've got
an easy job, you know,

606
00:37:47,691 --> 00:37:50,210
and then you be spending your
fucking teddy money, right?

607
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:55,370
They'll just read the fucking email.
All right. Just having fun. Bill,

608
00:37:55,371 --> 00:37:56,840
I've been a fan of yours for 15 years.

609
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:00,920
The people that work hard every day and
spend their hard earned cash to see you

610
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:05,180
have been really disappointed.
This is one of the classic things.

611
00:38:05,181 --> 00:38:08,030
When people complain, rather than
just complaining for themselves,

612
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,980
they act like they're standing in front
of like a zillion people and they go,

613
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:14,650
relax,
attention everyone.

614
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:20,230
I will send the email and we'll
convey all of your feelings.

615
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:25,120
Get on with your day.
Relax. I will handle it.

616
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,380
So evidently he has like, you know, all
of these people are disappointed in me.

617
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:33,980
He said, the people that follow
you and made you who you are,

618
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:38,320
they made me people.
I didn't work hard on stand up.

619
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:40,750
I was just standing there
and they all said, hey yo,

620
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,880
we have decided to make you
and who you are. So sad.

621
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:48,790
It'd be said, so set it be done. He said,

622
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:51,880
you have made dates all around the
country and then cancelled them.

623
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,390
When Hollywood calls you to do a part,
that's exactly what happened.

624
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:58,180
I picked up the phone. I said hello.
They said, this is Hollywood here.

625
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,940
We're calling you to do a part c.
Uh,

626
00:39:00,941 --> 00:39:03,610
the people that go to
your shows and made you,

627
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:08,140
that made you aren't making a
10th of the money that you make,

628
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:11,110
but they paid to see you. Hey, ginger boy.

629
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:19,150
Without these fans, you're illiterate. Ass
would be working at Mcdonald's at best.

630
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:22,690
Now, I take offense to that, sir. Okay?

631
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,790
Without my fan base, I would not be
working at Mcdonald's. You son of a bitch,

632
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:32,530
I would be unloading trucks in
a warehouse. Get it straight.

633
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:36,520
He goes, you're a scumbag. Be a gee,

634
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:41,970
you're a scumbag page and I hope every
fan realizes what you are and stops going

635
00:39:42,361 --> 00:39:43,240
to your shows.

636
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:48,310
I will never listen to your shows or
podcasts again and we'll tell everyone to

637
00:39:48,311 --> 00:39:49,144
do the same.

638
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,470
You are the typical sellout to
Hollywood fucking disappointment.

639
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:57,670
I know you won't have the balls to
read this on your podcast. Instead,

640
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,570
you will read a letter from a 20 year old
guy confused about his girlfriend sex,

641
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,180
sexuality.
This is the best part here.

642
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,350
You're a real cunt.
Fuck you and everything you do

643
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:19,870
as one of the greatest endings where
the greatest sending standing email ever

644
00:40:19,871 --> 00:40:24,310
got your a real cunt. You're
the real deal. If you, if
you tip over your current,

645
00:40:24,311 --> 00:40:29,290
you see the stamp of approval from the
current factory and then it's just not,

646
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:32,560
fuck you.
It's fuck you in everything you do.

647
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,860
You want to go to the grocery
store? Yeah. That too.

648
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,110
Fuck you when you're picking out apples.

649
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:40,463
MMM.

650
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:42,890
Jesus Christ,
sir.

651
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:44,700
Okay.

652
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,610
You made me,
did I have anything to do?

653
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,310
Did I do anything that I worked?

654
00:40:50,311 --> 00:40:53,520
Did I not fucking go onstage and eat
my balls? Learning how to do this?

655
00:40:53,521 --> 00:40:57,750
I guess you did. I listen. I just
want to thank you for making me,

656
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,820
uh, without your hard work of going
through. I mean, I can't imagine how many,

657
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,090
uh, I mean, how many people
live in this country?

658
00:41:06,091 --> 00:41:08,580
I just can't imagine when you're
just going through the mug book,

659
00:41:08,581 --> 00:41:13,440
trying to figure out who you've decided
will become a professional comedian.

660
00:41:13,441 --> 00:41:14,190
That just is.

661
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:18,240
And the fact that you also have a day
job during the time where I guess you're

662
00:41:18,241 --> 00:41:21,880
grossly underpaid. I mean, that's
just incredible to me, sir.

663
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:24,900
What the fuck do you want from me?
Let me ask you this,

664
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:30,730
okay? If Hollywood called you
and asked you to be in a movie,

665
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,910
you're going to say,
you're going to say no.

666
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:41,710
All right. And like you told your
mom, Hey, listen Ma, don't worry.

667
00:41:41,711 --> 00:41:45,520
I'll come over and I'll clean up
your yard this Saturday. All right?

668
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:48,610
And then all of a sudden Hollywood
comes to Collins says, Hey,

669
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:51,970
do you want to pretend you're
a lot tougher than you are
and get into a gunfight

670
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:55,840
and gets shot by, I don't know,
whoever your favorite actor is,

671
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:01,390
you're going to say, no, I have
to go. Uh, I got a stick. What?

672
00:42:01,391 --> 00:42:03,640
You've never broken a fucking,
you know what? Fuck that.

673
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,710
Even like a play off game comes along.

674
00:42:05,711 --> 00:42:10,420
You've never fucking had to change a
schedule, sir. I had to cancel some dates.

675
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:14,530
I didn't cancel them. I rescheduled
the fuck. Do you want from me?

676
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:21,210
You want me to stay in the strip malls
for my entire career telling jokes I did

677
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:25,800
that. I'm trying to fucking,
you know, and all, all,

678
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:28,710
all these movies to do is make
more people know who I am.

679
00:42:28,711 --> 00:42:32,040
So more people come out to my shows so
I can keep writing more hours and having

680
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:36,510
a good time. All right. I don't
even know why I'm talking to you.

681
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,720
You said you're never going to
listen to my shit again, right?

682
00:42:39,721 --> 00:42:43,200
Are you a man of your word after you
saying, I'm not a man of my word.

683
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:47,250
If you're actually listened to this, then
you're a fucking hypocrite. All right.

684
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,113
What's the matter?

685
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:49,893
Huh?

686
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,470
Jesus Christ.

687
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,810
You fucking pissed on your
sweatpants this weekend.

688
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,760
I don't know what the fuck that was all
about and you didn't even say what it

689
00:42:58,761 --> 00:42:59,594
was.

690
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:03,610
You may dates all around the country and
then cancelled them with the fuck are

691
00:43:03,611 --> 00:43:05,030
you talking about?
I had one tour.

692
00:43:05,031 --> 00:43:09,840
I had to move around and I fucking
did the first two dates. Then I'm,

693
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:14,860
I've made up a one to 3 cents then and
add in another one that wasn't even on

694
00:43:16,611 --> 00:43:20,030
that original tour. So go
fuck yourself. All right.

695
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:24,740
All the tickets are honored and if he
can't make that date, you get it refunded

696
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:29,600
Jesus Christ. Do you know that
Ted tour that I was going to do?

697
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:33,290
I was just going to land in Boise,
you know,

698
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:38,300
jump on a bus and knock them all out in
10 days now because of that whole thing

699
00:43:38,301 --> 00:43:41,870
blew up. Now I've got to get on it, you
know, second extra 10 airplane ride.

700
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:46,130
You don't hear me bitching,
do you fucking cunt.

701
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:49,670
You're a real cop. Fuck you and
everything you do that was worth it.

702
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,150
That was worth them getting mad. That's
fucking tremendous, sir. You know what?

703
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,390
As much as you do, you disappointed
me. You're a real disappointment.

704
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:59,390
You fucking jerk off.
You've liked me for 15 years.

705
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,400
One canceled fucking Gig and now you,

706
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:05,360
now you're saying fuck me in everything
I do. I make that Pumpkin pie this week.

707
00:44:05,361 --> 00:44:09,260
You saying fuck the pie too. That's a
part of it. You're saying, fuck America.

708
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:11,270
If you're saying fuck punk Pumpkin Pie.

709
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,133
Yeah,

710
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:18,010
but I got here, I am a real cunt.
I, you know, I can't argue that.

711
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,753
Okay.

712
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:31,440
You know something. Could somebody please
put that on a tee shirt? You're a cut.

713
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,000
Fuck

714
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,980
you in everything you do.
Just to have that just out

715
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:22,653
[inaudible] [inaudible]

716
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:28,883
[inaudible]

717
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:39,550
we still go onto the regional try gain
is wrong or she'll try it on the seat and

718
00:45:41,871 --> 00:45:42,704
oceans.

719
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,020
We shall fight with growing confidence
and growing strength in the air.

720
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:52,270
We shall defend our island.
Whatever the cost.

721
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:57,280
Maybe we shall fight on the beaches or
fight on the landing run and she'll fight

722
00:45:59,061 --> 00:46:03,560
you to the field. I ended up streaks
which will fight in the hills,

723
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:05,950
which you'll never have.
Surrender.

724
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:15,560
Pilbara is the Monday morning podcast
and I think I have the swine flu.

725
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,630
Yeah, I'm sweating here. Roasting,

726
00:46:23,631 --> 00:46:27,950
baking, boiling. It's like a fucking
sauna, I guess. Second. Cleveland.

727
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:31,400
Why did I play Winston
Churchill to begin this podcast?

728
00:46:31,401 --> 00:46:34,100
I'll tell you why you
group of fucking cons.

729
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:37,340
It's because I'm one week
out from my standup special,

730
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:42,370
my next hour special that I'm taping
December 17th two shows at the Fillmore in

731
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:44,450
San Francisco,
California,

732
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:49,700
and I am beyond fucking ready for this
thing and I'm getting myself psyched up

733
00:46:49,701 --> 00:46:54,230
and I always fucking love that speech
for started as an iron maiden fan.

734
00:46:54,231 --> 00:46:56,180
When power slave came out,
right?

735
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:00,290
That power slave when the fucking doe,
the live the live,

736
00:47:00,291 --> 00:47:03,050
when they weren't screened for
me, Long Beach. Remember that one?

737
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:06,470
And they play that speech right
before they went into ace is high.

738
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:10,250
And I was like, what the fuck is
that speech? That's, you know,

739
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,460
it's incredible.
We had a fight on the land.

740
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,560
We're going fighting this huge in New
York and we shall never saw Landa.

741
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:20,760
Can you imagine that?

742
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:23,830
What a fucking time to be alive.

743
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,160
All these fucking NFL coaches getting
credit for their little halftime

744
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:31,960
adjustments. You, well,
it's win one for the gipper.

745
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,520
There's nothing compared to that shit.

746
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,590
Do you understand what
the fuck was going on?

747
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:39,680
Can you imagine living in
that little fucking island?

748
00:47:39,681 --> 00:47:41,450
They call it country
over there in England.

749
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:46,310
That little sissy ass little
fucking island. I'm just
fucking with you. You can't,

750
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:51,310
you live in over there in England and
you got that fucking sweaty cow licked.

751
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:56,540
Half a mustache, psychopath,
eight off China, Holland,

752
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:01,580
getting all those fucking maniacs.
All excited for the blitzkrieg.

753
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:03,230
Yeah,

754
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:06,620
and you're sitting there,
haven't yet a little fucking cup of tea.

755
00:48:06,621 --> 00:48:08,210
Whatever the fuck it is you do over there.

756
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:14,720
You know with your fucking
handmade bridges listening
to the radio or you go to

757
00:48:14,721 --> 00:48:18,020
this guy
shall fight on the land.

758
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:22,850
We shall fight in this fight in
France. Uh, so fucking greatest.

759
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,820
It's the fucking greatest thing ever.
And they did it.

760
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:29,780
They fucking fought them off.
They survived the fucking blitzkrieg.

761
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,340
What exactly was the blitzkrieg?

762
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:35,990
That was a Adolf strategy
where he hits you from the air,

763
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:39,890
from the sea, and also on the
land all at once was, that's what,

764
00:48:39,891 --> 00:48:44,660
was that what it was or was it
just his bombing? Sort of a,

765
00:48:44,661 --> 00:48:48,650
I don't fucking know. My nose is
clogged up. I want to fucking,

766
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:50,430
yeah,

767
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:53,670
I want to know is transplant.
This sucks fucking blows.

768
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:58,830
I was getting sick all the way to
Cleveland. You know, I fight this shit.

769
00:48:58,831 --> 00:49:02,820
What kind of a fucking asshole gets
a cold in Los Angeles? You know,

770
00:49:02,821 --> 00:49:05,370
that's why I moved out
here. I was like, Oh my God,

771
00:49:05,371 --> 00:49:07,230
I'm so sick of getting this sniffles.

772
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:12,710
I don't want to get the full
30 for fucking losing my voice.

773
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:17,580
It's a Sunday night.
It's nine 31 and uh,

774
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:19,830
just flew back from Cleveland today.

775
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:23,820
I'm supposed to be in my acting class
and I wasn't able to do that because

776
00:49:23,821 --> 00:49:26,400
obviously, you know, and then one
of those fun, don't you hate that?

777
00:49:26,401 --> 00:49:31,401
Fuck those fucking assholes who are sick
and they still come to work and then,

778
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:36,300
and then not only do they come to
work, they want to get like, like,

779
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:41,700
they want you to like be like, wow,
what a trooper. It's like, dude,

780
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:44,940
you're fucking sick and now you're
gonna make me sick. You know,

781
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:46,981
get Outta here.

782
00:49:46,981 --> 00:49:51,840
Go crawl back down your fucking man
hole wherever you got that 28 days virus

783
00:49:51,841 --> 00:49:56,010
that you fucking bring in any a, a maniac.
Get outta here. The Fuck Outta here.

784
00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:01,680
What you do here is not important.
Do you understand that?

785
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:06,120
That's why your cubicle is so small.
Take a fucking day off.

786
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:10,980
I fucking ain't all those people.
All those assholes.

787
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:16,130
The first fucking warm day in the
spring and you look out the door,

788
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:21,720
you see some asshole and a tank top and
fucking short shorts jogging down the

789
00:50:21,721 --> 00:50:25,350
fucking Goddamn River, right?
Right next to the fucking river.

790
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,850
Stupid son of a bitch is going get sick
and then he's going to fucking show up

791
00:50:28,851 --> 00:50:32,180
and get everybody else sick. So I
don't do that shit. When I get sick,

792
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:37,620
I stay home and I do a podcast.
That's what I do.

793
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:42,980
Ah, fuck. I got one of those. Those
headaches where if when you're lying down,

794
00:50:42,981 --> 00:50:47,240
it doesn't hurt, and then when you
get up, you almost fucking tip over.

795
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:52,560
You can feel every time your heart beats
on either side of your forehead. Ah,

796
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:56,910
fuck. You know what I noticed
is such a weird night. You know,

797
00:50:56,911 --> 00:51:01,380
if you don't watch football like Sunday
night, especially around December,

798
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,570
they showed all the first one episodes.

799
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:06,870
So they got a lot of reruns and now
they're trying to do some little holiday

800
00:51:06,871 --> 00:51:10,680
special things.
I was just watching Pavarotti duets.

801
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:16,790
MMM. Live from, I don't know where
I'm going to guess Italy. Uh,

802
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,210
cause it looked European. The guy's
singing an Italian. I know it's opera.

803
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,840
We sing it in anywhere else,
but whatever man,

804
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:29,860
I turn it on and there's Annie Lennox and
that scraggly dude from the eurythmics

805
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:33,730
and they're singing some song.
She's a terrible dancer by the way.

806
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:38,740
I'm really surprised me and he's
standing there stoically and uh,

807
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:43,550
in a little in his fucking Tuxedo waiting,
waiting to sing.

808
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:47,000
She's dancing around like a,
you know,

809
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:49,640
you don't like when you want to
adjust your fucking underwear,

810
00:51:49,641 --> 00:51:51,890
but you can't use your hands
cause you were in public.

811
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:55,130
So you do that little weird
move with you fucking, you know,

812
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,590
sort of Elvis hole.

813
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:02,680
You do the WHO [inaudible] my
fucking underwears up my ass.

814
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:05,670
Right. If I was in Seco, had done
that smoothly, that would have been,

815
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,770
we actually would've been funny.
So anyways,

816
00:52:07,771 --> 00:52:11,000
she's dancing like a fucking retard
and he's just standing there.

817
00:52:11,001 --> 00:52:14,690
She's sitting there going,
sweet dreams are made of these.

818
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:19,200
Wait for him to be like,
Eh. [inaudible] eh,

819
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:23,270
but they put up, put up on up or
do I even know what the fuck it is?

820
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:27,980
I know what they're doing.
You know, I should actually
keep my voice down because,

821
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:30,870
uh, downstairs is, uh,

822
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:35,720
this is an old guy who lives beneath
me. Um, just picture of Pat Cooper.

823
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,130
If he wasn't funny,

824
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:41,660
just keep the rage and eliminate
all the brilliant jokes.

825
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:46,400
That's what lives underneath me and he's
a fucking cunt. And I'll tell you why,

826
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:51,350
because he yells at my girlfriend.
All right,

827
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:54,380
it's fucking old.
Motherfucker yells at my girlfriend,

828
00:52:54,381 --> 00:52:58,100
but he only does it when I'm on the road.
Okay.

829
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:02,300
Cowardly bastard. So
it's like, first of all,

830
00:53:02,301 --> 00:53:05,930
how the fuck do you know when I'm
not in town? This is what happens.

831
00:53:05,931 --> 00:53:10,730
We have hardwood floors and you know,
my gorgeous girlfriends,

832
00:53:10,731 --> 00:53:15,620
like most gorgeous girlfriends, they
have a lot of Horry shoes. You know,

833
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,400
all women have that little horse shoes.

834
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:19,670
You know the sound they make
when they go across, you know,

835
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:23,840
when she tries to put them on the last
seconds before she leaves. You know,

836
00:53:23,841 --> 00:53:25,590
you know that sound of the horseshoes,

837
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,480
the who was shoes hitting the
hardwood floors, maybe some linoleum.

838
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,071
Have any,

839
00:53:32,071 --> 00:53:37,071
you guys notice that you can be engrossed
in the greatest conversation ever with

840
00:53:37,231 --> 00:53:40,590
one of your guy friends. And the second
you hear high heels hitting the floor,

841
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,820
you immediately, both of you stopped
talking. You turned to look, you know,

842
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:48,660
let's see. Let's see what level
of horror we're talking. Oh, oh,

843
00:53:48,661 --> 00:53:52,860
the old business suit. Oh yeah, I have
a career. I'm not that kind of girl.

844
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:55,480
You're shoes are giving you a way,
Wendy,

845
00:53:55,860 --> 00:54:00,810
we know all about you and your drunken
escapades down at the Tgi Friday's.

846
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:05,640
Okay, so stop with your whole
demeanor. More little fucking vibe.

847
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:09,560
What is going on with that fucking
brought anyways to me more.

848
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:13,630
And she going to age at any
point. You know what, uh,

849
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:15,840
when I was flying out back from Cleveland,

850
00:54:15,841 --> 00:54:19,560
I actually sometimes I
don't want to think and I,

851
00:54:19,561 --> 00:54:24,330
I bought people magazine and uh, you
know, you do the crossword puzzle,

852
00:54:24,331 --> 00:54:25,890
you feel smart and uh,

853
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:35,430
start with seven across on happy days.
Anson Williams.

854
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:38,730
Oh God, look at that 17 letters. Um,

855
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,410
what am I going, what am I trying
to say here? Yeah. So there's,

856
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:47,190
so some woman had written in,
um,

857
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,220
I wish I still had the magazine.
Somebody asked me if they were like,

858
00:54:50,221 --> 00:54:52,800
can I look at that? Can you look
at it? You can fucking have it.

859
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:57,600
Blow your nose on it. I don't
give a shit. People magazine, um,

860
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:00,270
some lady had written in,
cause they had,

861
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:05,220
they had written a big article on Demy
Moore where they would just throw stacks,

862
00:55:05,221 --> 00:55:07,740
they throw hard and 48 and then this,

863
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:11,730
this person had written in and
response to that says sexy.

864
00:55:11,731 --> 00:55:13,830
So hot and 48.
Yeah.

865
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:18,950
Anybody could be that with
botox at private chef and
a fucking personal trainer.

866
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,970
You know, women are really
competitive with that shit.

867
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:25,853
You know,

868
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,640
that's like if they did an article and
they talked about the toughest guy I ever

869
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:32,970
on the planet, you know, no
matter how much you respect them,

870
00:55:32,971 --> 00:55:35,430
at some point you're going to
have to be like, that guy's a fag.

871
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:41,520
You know though all I would, you know when
I would do right. No, I'm serious dude.

872
00:55:41,521 --> 00:55:45,780
You know I do. I will fucking, I just
walk up to them, you know, like, hey bro,

873
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:47,940
what's going on? Do you want,
you'll look, I'm going to buy a run.

874
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:51,390
Which cha the secretary looked away,
dude, I front kick him right in his knee.

875
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:54,390
Blow out his fucking ACL.
Dude, I'm telling you it works.

876
00:55:54,391 --> 00:55:56,960
I'm taking this fucking Israeli
shit, dude. I'm telling you,

877
00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:02,370
telling you I took like two classes and
now I just use the fucking gears pajamas.

878
00:56:02,371 --> 00:56:06,000
But you know, I still feel like
I know how to fight shut up.

879
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,700
Um,
yeah,

880
00:56:08,701 --> 00:56:12,570
there's a few girls out there who
just are not aging to me more.

881
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:16,410
And Courtney Cox, I dunno
what to do. Just like,

882
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:20,220
that's a funny thing about that Courtney
Cox, uh, move, uh, show that she has,

883
00:56:20,221 --> 00:56:24,430
that's out right now where she's a,
you know,

884
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:28,540
she supposed to be like this desperate,
uh, what the fuck do they call those? Uh,

885
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:33,100
Jesus wolfs
ducklings.

886
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:38,330
Cougars. There we go. There we go.
Fucking NYQUIL kicking in baby. Uh, yeah,

887
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,110
she supposed to be this desperate
cougar trying to fucking, you know,

888
00:56:42,111 --> 00:56:45,800
hook up with the younger guy and
it's like, all right. First of all,

889
00:56:45,801 --> 00:56:50,780
she's still hot and she's
in ridiculously good shape.

890
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:53,510
And then the way they shoot
her with that fucking,

891
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:55,880
I don't know what the trick is that,

892
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:58,820
but it basically eliminates
every line in your face.

893
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:03,170
So now she looks like she's
like 31, 32, you know,

894
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:07,540
that's a hard age for a woman.
So like [inaudible],

895
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:11,440
that's the whole fucking thing
doesn't work for me, you know,

896
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,690
and then they got to dress like this,
this,

897
00:57:13,691 --> 00:57:18,691
this is so fucked on that show
because they're trying to appeal,

898
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:20,561
I guess,

899
00:57:20,561 --> 00:57:23,740
to this certain segment of women that
they're going to watch it who are in that

900
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:26,950
situation. There's a lot of
divorces out there. 53% right.

901
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,680
But uh,
and the other thing,

902
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:33,610
but the other side of it is they
have to make her look good. You know,

903
00:57:33,611 --> 00:57:37,780
they got a whore out so they kind of
cancel each other out and like it doesn't

904
00:57:37,781 --> 00:57:39,430
make sense. I'm like
looking at it going, wow,

905
00:57:39,431 --> 00:57:42,340
I fucking bang that girl the
second she's gorgeous. Right.

906
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:45,580
But then they're making her walk
around like she's desperate.

907
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,410
You know? I just realized, I
admitted that I watched that show.

908
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:53,870
Where the fuck did I watch it too?

909
00:57:53,871 --> 00:57:56,780
I at least have the out that I
was on the road and I was lonely.

910
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:02,570
I think I watched that show
by myself in my own apartment.

911
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:04,971
Wow.
You know,

912
00:58:04,971 --> 00:58:09,080
every once in awhile you find a new
level of sadness in your life that you

913
00:58:09,081 --> 00:58:11,300
didn't even know exist like your existed.

914
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:16,430
Like just so not even in touch with how
pathetic you're life has become that you

915
00:58:18,771 --> 00:58:22,190
just openly admit something like that.
And then by the end of it, you know,

916
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,470
like if you guys were actually
sitting here like halfway through it,

917
00:58:24,471 --> 00:58:28,040
you would have given me that look the
same look you just gave you fucking iPod

918
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:32,630
or your radio. Oh, your high fi, whatever
the fuck you listen to this thing on.

919
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,000
You know, cause I, but I didn't see it.

920
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:37,010
That's the great thing about
this podcast is when I,

921
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:40,010
when I start opening up and
making an ass out of myself,

922
00:58:40,011 --> 00:58:43,250
you guys can sit there
and laugh at me and fuck,

923
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:48,040
I wish you were here right now cause
I would have stopped at story. Wow.

924
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:51,570
That's embarrassing. That is
really fucking embarrassing. Um,

925
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:57,490
so anyways, I'm sick. Um,

926
00:58:57,850 --> 00:58:59,980
and I'm getting ready to do my special,
but I'm getting over this shit.

927
00:58:59,981 --> 00:59:03,220
I don't give a fuck. I want to thank
everybody came out to see me at hilarity.

928
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:07,750
He's in Cleveland this past weekend.
I had a great time.

929
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:10,150
And uh,
you know,

930
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:14,260
I want to thank nick for having me out
there just to fucking great club owner,

931
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:18,070
you know, salt of the Earth Guy. He's
one of these guys, he's like fucking,

932
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,920
I don't know how old the guy is.
He's somewhere in his,

933
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:25,580
I'll say 61 in Casey's listed and I
know he's like 63, but he still lifts,

934
00:59:25,581 --> 00:59:29,720
still wears like a wife beater.
But he's a classic guy, you know,

935
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:35,150
he is still, he can still fuck
somebody up. That's, you know,

936
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:38,060
it's very inspirational.
He was funny about him too,

937
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:39,960
is that you can tell that he a,

938
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:44,030
we were talking about having a
temper and a, I have a temper,

939
00:59:44,031 --> 00:59:45,560
but I wear my more on my sleeve,

940
00:59:45,561 --> 00:59:50,180
which lets you know that I'm pretty much
harmless, but it's, it's the guys who,

941
00:59:50,181 --> 00:59:54,440
you know, have a temper and they're,
they're, they're really soft spoken.

942
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:58,610
Those are the guys who will literally
twist your fucking head off like a fucking

943
00:59:58,611 --> 01:00:03,590
beer cap. You know, those
guys, he's one of those dudes,

944
01:00:03,591 --> 01:00:08,150
like somebody told me you're fucking
story about him doing some crazy shit.

945
01:00:08,151 --> 01:00:11,990
And then I asked him about it and then
he's telling the story and he's just, Oh,

946
01:00:11,991 --> 01:00:16,650
you know, and I can't, you know, you
had a situation and uh, you know,

947
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:21,110
it things got interesting and uh,
you know,

948
01:00:21,111 --> 01:00:23,780
I mean it's just one of those
things is what happened.

949
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,000
And they just like immediately moves on

950
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:30,290
and then later on you find out he beat
the shit out of seven guys with like a

951
01:00:30,291 --> 01:00:31,340
fire hydrant,
you know,

952
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:36,400
as opposed to the other guy who doesn't
even throw a fucking punch and then adds

953
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:38,300
like 97 details.
Right.

954
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,220
So I could tell the way he was
standing that he was a south pass,

955
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:45,710
so I start cheating to the right. Right.
Shut the fuck up dude. I'm telling you,

956
01:00:45,711 --> 01:00:49,850
I'm taking this Jujitsu stuff. You know,
I started watching spike, you know,

957
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:52,900
without I gotta I gotta Ghee.
I went down there,

958
01:00:52,901 --> 01:00:55,460
I took one class that got my ass kicked,
but uh,

959
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:59,390
I'm really good at like seeing things
for like an hour and then being able to

960
01:00:59,391 --> 01:01:00,290
talk about them.
Like,

961
01:01:00,291 --> 01:01:03,860
I've been doing it for 10 years while
my nose just had another level of being

962
01:01:03,861 --> 01:01:07,340
fucking stuffed up. Ah, okay.

963
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:12,530
This is going to be a short
podcast everybody. Um, all right.

964
01:01:12,531 --> 01:01:15,860
What else can I admit to that's fucking
embarrassing. Sat, embarrassing.

965
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:18,080
A Santa Claus is coming to town.

966
01:01:19,370 --> 01:01:21,110
Is that the name of it is on tomorrow.

967
01:01:21,111 --> 01:01:24,860
That that claymation thing that I used
to watch as a kid and I'm recording it

968
01:01:24,861 --> 01:01:26,270
and I'm going to watch
it with my girlfriend.

969
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:31,220
Hopefully I'll have a Christmas
tree up by then and uh,

970
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:35,000
if I had a fireplace that we get
a fire going, but I doubt so uh,

971
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:39,770
I'll just late our little
fuck candle. Um, anyways,

972
01:01:39,771 --> 01:01:42,110
happy holidays to everyone.

973
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:46,220
I have not even started
my shopping. Um, you know,

974
01:01:46,221 --> 01:01:48,800
I do a thing on this podcast
where people give me an a,

975
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:53,860
I give people advice and this
week somebody is actually
giving me advice how to

976
01:01:53,961 --> 01:01:56,480
fuck to both nostrils get
clogged up at the same time.

977
01:01:58,220 --> 01:01:59,930
They fuckin dog sleeps all day,

978
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:04,190
all day long and then it comes in at
night and is like tired from sleeping.

979
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:09,200
You're a bum. Look at you. You know,

980
01:02:09,201 --> 01:02:11,740
I'm teaching the dog how to speak
in them, but I swear to God, I give,

981
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:16,280
you got to hear it. You got to hear
it. It's absolutely adorable to me.

982
01:02:16,281 --> 01:02:20,070
It will be annoying to you. And I'm
gonna. I'm gonna fucking play it. Oh,

983
01:02:20,071 --> 01:02:21,030
I know what I wanted to do.

984
01:02:21,031 --> 01:02:25,020
I wanted to go on fucking youtube and
find out why Carsello got suspended

985
01:02:25,021 --> 01:02:29,100
against the fucking
capitals. Dude. That guy,

986
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:34,130
I swear to God is like Mickey
Featherstone on fucking skates.

987
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,930
Jimmy [inaudible]. You know,
that's why when I look at it,

988
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:41,640
he's got that same haircut. Anybody
read that book? The westies.

989
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:42,960
That's what he reminds me of.

990
01:02:42,961 --> 01:02:44,910
Like you should be in Hell's
kitchen to the seventies.

991
01:02:44,911 --> 01:02:49,690
But he's played for the
flyers. All right. Cars Sylo

992
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:56,590
suspended. Let's see what this
brings up. Sorry. Winston Churchill,

993
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:02,970
a cheap shot cars. Sylo uh, that's
2000. What the fuck did he do?

994
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:06,690
But anybody knows what he did. Let me
know. Just let me know what he did.

995
01:03:06,691 --> 01:03:10,410
He did something against the
capitals. I have no fucking idea. Uh,

996
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,840
anyways,
let's get onto the advice.

997
01:03:12,841 --> 01:03:15,660
Somebody wanted to give me some advice
this week, which is a nice turn of the,

998
01:03:15,661 --> 01:03:20,640
if I consider we get it as
the holidays. Um, all right.

999
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:26,040
Jesus Christ Carsello has more fight
videos that Brittany Spears has look at my

1000
01:03:26,041 --> 01:03:30,960
vagina videos. Thank you.
That was a joke. Sorry,

1001
01:03:30,990 --> 01:03:35,250
I'm sick. This is really bad. Come
on bill. Step it up. Oh, you know,

1002
01:03:35,251 --> 01:03:37,860
I didn't finish telling her this
story about the guy downstairs, right?

1003
01:03:37,861 --> 01:03:41,870
So this fucking asshole, this
is what he does. Anytime,

1004
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:48,890
uh, my girlfriend walks across the
floor, he just goes, why does he say,

1005
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:52,790
he goes like, oh great,
keep it up. Keep it up.

1006
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:57,791
He says he's real sarcastic and it
infuriates my girl to no fucking dead.

1007
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:03,610
To the point that she's claiming that
he's harassing her and she wants me to go

1008
01:04:03,711 --> 01:04:05,960
downstairs and have a talk with this guy.

1009
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,770
There's no way this isn't
going to be fucking hilarious,

1010
01:04:09,771 --> 01:04:13,460
which I'm going to go do. Right. But
I don't understand. Like if this guy,

1011
01:04:13,461 --> 01:04:16,160
what did this guy just says? You
know, why don't you go fuck yourself?

1012
01:04:16,161 --> 01:04:20,480
What am I going to do? I mean, I wouldn't
fight this guy. If he was my age,

1013
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:26,000
I would now I would have a fucking seven
year old guy who lives alone at all.

1014
01:04:26,001 --> 01:04:29,000
It's the same fucking thing. I'm just
like, why don't you just laugh it off?

1015
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:35,810
I dropped something. What? I was up here
one time and he goes, he's real sarcastic.

1016
01:04:35,811 --> 01:04:39,530
And he goes, do it again.
And you know what I did?

1017
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:43,580
I did it again even harder and
I yelled out. How was that?

1018
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:48,530
And he's never yelled at me again.
You know, you guys fucking harmless.

1019
01:04:48,531 --> 01:04:50,630
Jesus Christ having a word
in your life that what I got.

1020
01:04:50,631 --> 01:04:55,380
I got to run downstairs and confront this
guy like I'm at a Bronx Tale, you know?

1021
01:04:57,330 --> 01:05:02,100
Anyways. All right, here's the advice. I
got. Jesus Christ by fucking knows this.

1022
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:07,010
It's done fully 19 minutes.
So this is going to be a half
hour one. All right guys,

1023
01:05:07,011 --> 01:05:11,540
I'm sorry. Whatever you got shopping to
do. Don't ya? Can I shop for Kwanzaa?

1024
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:17,060
Hanukkah? Uh, are there, how many days?
A hundred car? There's, I like 13.

1025
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:18,250
Why don't I keep asking questions

1026
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:20,890
about the Jewish religion?
I think I'm searching for something new.

1027
01:05:21,930 --> 01:05:26,090
You know,
I'm a [inaudible]

1028
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:28,220
aware of my mortality.
Um,

1029
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:30,930
especially with the swine flu
that I caught out in Cleveland.

1030
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:36,180
Don't you guys just celebrated or one
day or do you really have to buy somebody

1031
01:05:36,181 --> 01:05:39,690
13 fuck gifts and give
them some every day?

1032
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,860
That's it. More that a
religious bullshit. That's,

1033
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:48,210
that's their version of Jesus Pollard
the fish out of the fucking basket where

1034
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,040
it's some Guy Dave Jebidiah.

1035
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:55,550
He only had enough fucking knock Zima
to keep the zits off his face for five

1036
01:05:55,951 --> 01:05:59,160
days and sub, but somehow he
did it for fucking 13 rarely.

1037
01:05:59,161 --> 01:06:03,060
Who gives a shit just set
around the collection basket.

1038
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:06,040
We'll keep paying for your bed sheets.
All right,

1039
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:12,810
dear bill, irregular serve
you weekly podcasts, uh,

1040
01:06:12,811 --> 01:06:14,190
which I enjoy immensely.
Thank you.

1041
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:18,000
I noticed that on occasion that you
have met should you are learning to play

1042
01:06:18,001 --> 01:06:20,640
guitar. First of all, Kudos. Secondly,

1043
01:06:20,641 --> 01:06:25,641
please tell me that you will never
fucking incorporate any form of guitar

1044
01:06:25,891 --> 01:06:27,330
playing into your act.

1045
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:31,620
I know it's easy to learn a few open
chords or they'd pile all your c grade

1046
01:06:31,621 --> 01:06:34,890
material. Just a bullshit
SOG. Although you could do it.

1047
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:38,490
I know people read idiots would
laugh at you and you'd kill five,

1048
01:06:38,491 --> 01:06:41,010
10 minutes of set time, easy. However,

1049
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:46,200
please promise me you will never stoop
to that level. Sincerely concerned.

1050
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:50,940
Fat Ass. Fucking hilarious. Yeah, dude,
I have no intentions of doing that,

1051
01:06:50,941 --> 01:06:53,520
but I hope I do do it someday.
I'm standing up right now.

1052
01:06:53,521 --> 01:06:58,170
Hopefully this will clear me up. Uh
Oh. It's like magic. You're like that.

1053
01:06:58,210 --> 01:07:01,520
Like hear me sniffle or
this fucking thing. Um,

1054
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:05,100
I actually hope that I do that one
day, sir. And you know why that is?

1055
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:09,600
Because that would mean that I have
actually reached such a level of success

1056
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:14,070
that no one around me can tell me what
a horrible mistake I'm fucking making

1057
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:18,840
with my career. You know, kind of like
Al Pachino in the 90s. He was like, so,

1058
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:19,381
you know,

1059
01:07:19,381 --> 01:07:24,150
such a legend at that point that one
director ever pulled him aside and was

1060
01:07:24,151 --> 01:07:27,270
like, Al, ah, you're yelling.

1061
01:07:28,830 --> 01:07:31,710
Yeah, yeah. You're, you're just,
you just sort of yelling here,

1062
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:35,840
not you don't act and you're just
yelling. No, no, no, I'm serious.

1063
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:38,580
We were like on the sixth day of the
shoot here and uh, you know what I mean?

1064
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:40,560
The scene is like, you know, two lines.

1065
01:07:40,950 --> 01:07:44,040
You're get some coffee
and a donut and I'm,

1066
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:47,080
yeah,
you just kind of yell at,

1067
01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:52,610
Oh, and I don't want to, I mean, I respect
you where the Godfather, but you know,

1068
01:07:52,611 --> 01:07:54,380
you just fuck, you know,
one of those deals.

1069
01:07:54,410 --> 01:07:59,410
So if I actually got to the point
where nobody actually told me to stop,

1070
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:03,650
you know, to not go on stage
with a guitar, do it. I'm like,

1071
01:08:03,651 --> 01:08:07,100
I'm never gonna do that shit.
I should never say never.
But I'll tell you this, I,

1072
01:08:07,101 --> 01:08:11,960
I'd be lying if I didn't already fantasize
about doing it, you know, like fuck,

1073
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:16,100
and having the greatest hour special
of all time. And then the end,

1074
01:08:16,101 --> 01:08:20,750
my encore is I come out, I play better
than Stevie Ray Vaughn, you know,

1075
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:24,470
and then next thing you know, I'm
playing drums in them, crooked vultures.

1076
01:08:24,471 --> 01:08:27,980
When David Grohl asked to
take a night off, right?

1077
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:30,740
Once you guys have fantasies like that,

1078
01:08:31,490 --> 01:08:36,380
you've got to dream big and let's sit
down and watch that. Courtney Cox fucking,

1079
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:40,880
whenever the COO fucking cougar show is,
oh,

1080
01:08:40,881 --> 01:08:43,130
he had a little epilogue
here to this. He said, ps,

1081
01:08:43,131 --> 01:08:46,010
I saw that picture of you playing
with the victor Wooten band,

1082
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:51,020
playing drums with them and know that
you've been an avid drummer for a long

1083
01:08:51,021 --> 01:08:55,190
time. So what's it like to
learn a real instrument now,

1084
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:56,633
boo Yah,

1085
01:08:57,420 --> 01:09:00,980
that that's fucking guitarists are also
full of themselves with their feathered

1086
01:09:00,981 --> 01:09:05,450
hair playing the same fucking power cords
that have been playing since fucking

1087
01:09:05,451 --> 01:09:09,410
Peter Frampton. Once you guys get over
yourself, you know, you know what?

1088
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:13,290
I hope you go to a holiday party and
for no particular reason, just in, in,

1089
01:09:13,291 --> 01:09:15,980
in this, in this, in the,
in the vein of a Bronx tale,

1090
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:18,500
every time I think I'm
a Bronx tale is Chazz.

1091
01:09:18,501 --> 01:09:23,000
Palminteri in the end of that pistol
just comes out and whacks him in the back

1092
01:09:23,001 --> 01:09:27,020
of the head. You know I helped that APP
is to you, but it's a fucking Ukulele.

1093
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,150
I don't want you to die,

1094
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:32,750
but I just really want you to take a
nice fucking get a little blunt force

1095
01:09:32,751 --> 01:09:36,110
trauma with the Ukulele. What
do you think about that? Huh?

1096
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:40,490
I would love to have
youtube video of you alone.

1097
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:44,630
You know some of this stupid rock
poses that you probably did back in the

1098
01:09:44,631 --> 01:09:49,610
eighties if you're older. Huh? Did
you do the point in a little kick?

1099
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:51,650
We did.
You do the thing,

1100
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:56,240
the state trooper to the 10th power
where you stand with your legs apart but

1101
01:09:56,241 --> 01:10:00,980
really far apart. Huh? Admitted
you ever done that? Mr Guitarist?

1102
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,670
Mister fucking musician.
Ah, he never would do it.

1103
01:10:04,671 --> 01:10:08,720
A little tap on solo in the bathroom
mirror and then started flicking your

1104
01:10:08,721 --> 01:10:11,910
tongue like you were looking at Colette.
Ah,

1105
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:15,620
cause you saw the white snake video.
Did you lick your guitar?

1106
01:10:15,621 --> 01:10:20,080
Like the Douche bag in that band?
That's what I want to know. The fucking,

1107
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:23,180
you know, guitars are so fucking
annoying. I really think, you know,

1108
01:10:23,181 --> 01:10:25,670
they all think they're fucking
virtuosos. They're not, you know,

1109
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:30,140
they're doing the same bullshit. I
actually didn't notice that, you know,

1110
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:32,900
I'm not even going to say that.
Why would I do that?

1111
01:10:32,901 --> 01:10:34,820
Then it'd be shitting on a band
that I fucking like. All right,

1112
01:10:34,821 --> 01:10:38,540
let's plow ahead here. The fuck is
wrong with my keyboard here. Um,

1113
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:42,680
all right, Bill. Oh, this is, this
is what I would tell you right now.

1114
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:45,830
This guy's asking me for
advice and I don't know.

1115
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:49,970
I don't know what to do on this one.
Okay. So I need some help on this one.

1116
01:10:50,130 --> 01:10:53,210
All right, Bill, I have
a situation for you.

1117
01:10:55,340 --> 01:11:00,050
Um, so I've been banging this engage
girl for the past several months

1118
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:08,720
and we're in, we just went in with
both feet. Okay. How's the water? Fine.

1119
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:09,530
All right.

1120
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:12,420
I started with the two years ago where
we took a break for a year when she got

1121
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:15,210
in in 2008.
Um,

1122
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:19,380
she reinitiated our
arrangement over the summer.

1123
01:11:20,570 --> 01:11:21,403
Uh,

1124
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:26,410
what the fuck? Sorry guys. I got to
stand up here. So I'm looking fucking,

1125
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:30,200
all right. While I know it's wrong
to be bagging and engaged girls.

1126
01:11:30,201 --> 01:11:33,190
She's a petite Latin girl,
a great lay a,

1127
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:37,670
she's 22 and a fiance lives over
in London. A guy yesterday too.

1128
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:40,640
That's what he says. Yeah, you
just justified it. However,

1129
01:11:40,641 --> 01:11:44,690
now that the miserable son of a bitches
moving from London to New York to be

1130
01:11:44,691 --> 01:11:45,350
with her,

1131
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:49,400
it hit me that marriage is actually a
serious move in life and this poor bass is

1132
01:11:49,401 --> 01:11:52,490
going to be spending the
rest of his life with her.

1133
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:55,340
That only do I feel a bit guilty though.

1134
01:11:55,341 --> 01:11:58,880
I don't hesitate to call her at 4:00
AM when I'm at least 20 drinks deep.

1135
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:03,230
I feel bad for the poor guy that
he's going to be marrying this slag.

1136
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:08,090
Maybe this girl is so fucking whore is
she actually compares the size of my deck

1137
01:12:08,091 --> 01:12:12,050
with her fiance's. Wow. Uh, I mean,

1138
01:12:12,051 --> 01:12:15,950
she thinks that I'm going to be taken
as a compliment that mine is bigger and

1139
01:12:15,951 --> 01:12:20,060
she even invited me to her wedding.
What the fuck is wrong with her?

1140
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:26,780
Jesus Christ, dude, it is
a situation. Uh, he said,

1141
01:12:26,781 --> 01:12:27,770
I'm going to use a,

1142
01:12:27,771 --> 01:12:31,400
I'm going to use her as exhibit a when
I educate my son's on how women are

1143
01:12:31,401 --> 01:12:35,960
complete whores. Really? So now they're
all whores because of this one here. Dude,

1144
01:12:35,961 --> 01:12:40,070
you really, you, you picked
a fucking winner here. Uh,

1145
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:42,740
in any event,
my question boils down to this.

1146
01:12:43,490 --> 01:12:47,270
My friend suggest that I write
her fiance and anonymous email.

1147
01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:51,620
Um, I was thinking more of one of those
kidnapping letters with the different

1148
01:12:51,621 --> 01:12:56,060
letters cut out from magazines did
that would be fucking hilarious.

1149
01:12:57,170 --> 01:12:58,820
Um, about how I was, uh,

1150
01:12:59,150 --> 01:13:02,870
whatever the letter would be about how
I was begging her for the last several

1151
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:04,640
months. What do you
think? While I hate rats,

1152
01:13:04,670 --> 01:13:07,790
I think I'd be saving this guy in
lifetime of misery. On the other hand,

1153
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:11,510
that bastard propose to her after
only three months of meeting her.

1154
01:13:11,511 --> 01:13:14,930
So he kind of deserves it.
Am I doing this poor bastard or favor?

1155
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:18,350
Any advice would be appreciated. Ah, okay.

1156
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:24,230
Okay. Okay. Okay. Where do we go
with this one? What should you do?

1157
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:26,850
MMM.
[inaudible]

1158
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:29,160
well, you know what,
dude, in a perfect world,

1159
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:35,220
you could actually send a letter to that
guy. You could tell him what was up.

1160
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:39,990
And once he got over the shock of it, he
would actually be like, oh, thank God.

1161
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:43,860
You know, you know, I'm not saying
he would like you, but he'd be like,

1162
01:13:43,861 --> 01:13:45,300
thank God you did me a favor.

1163
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:49,680
I almost fucking married this psycho.
Right?

1164
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:55,350
And, and then the little Latino
hoary girl would be like, you know,

1165
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:59,700
as mad as I am at you, um, you were right.

1166
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,890
I was doing the wrong fucking thing.

1167
01:14:01,891 --> 01:14:06,880
So I should probably shouldn't be getting
married to a mature blah, blah, blah,

1168
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:10,920
blah, blah. And uh, and
then you'd stop fucking her.

1169
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:12,560
Yeah,

1170
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,200
right.
That would be the perfect world.

1171
01:14:14,201 --> 01:14:17,140
But this is probably what's going
to happen. You're going to do it.

1172
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:21,160
This guy's going to flip out and flip out,

1173
01:14:21,161 --> 01:14:26,161
has a whole rainbow of emotions
anywhere from collapsing in the street,

1174
01:14:26,441 --> 01:14:31,270
crying and peeing on himself to going
over there and choking that woman to

1175
01:14:31,271 --> 01:14:34,000
death.
Um,

1176
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:38,920
and she's going to flip the fuck out at
you and it's just gonna be a big fucking

1177
01:14:38,921 --> 01:14:39,754
mess.

1178
01:14:40,690 --> 01:14:41,523
Okay?

1179
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:44,960
You go with your gut here.
What kind of a fucking asshole?

1180
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:50,900
What kind of a fucking asshole,
you know,

1181
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:54,410
date somebody who lives on the
other side of the fucking ocean.

1182
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:58,310
If you need a passport to get to the
person that you're going to marry you,

1183
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:02,270
not only should you not marry them, you're
not even in a relationship with them.

1184
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:04,043
You know what I mean?

1185
01:15:05,410 --> 01:15:08,290
Fuck that. That's fucking
retarded. You know what that is?

1186
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:09,970
He was so used to fuck it.

1187
01:15:09,971 --> 01:15:14,410
All those pasty bitches over there in
London with their awful fucking teeth and

1188
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:15,790
their fish and chips breath.

1189
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,600
All of a sudden he comes over in New York
on the fucking Puerto Rican Pride Day

1190
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:23,680
parade and it was over. That's what
happened. That's what I'm guessing.

1191
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:25,070
Okay.

1192
01:15:25,070 --> 01:15:28,850
Couple of those little j Lo girls came
walking by and he said, Holy Shit,

1193
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:32,630
life doesn't have to be this hard.
It's just like sexy beast,

1194
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:34,343
you know?

1195
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:40,310
Do you ever meet the a Miss London? I
remember that guy was fucking say it all.

1196
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:45,110
It's shit
Evie Cantwell along face Dell.

1197
01:15:45,111 --> 01:15:48,800
Make me laugh.
He really made the London seem miserable.

1198
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:51,800
I'm just fucking with you guys. Some
reason I keep shitting on England here.

1199
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:56,730
Yeah Dude. You know what? You got a
great story. Just fucking tap out mad.

1200
01:15:57,380 --> 01:16:01,220
You don't want to do that shit. You
know, lets his story. Just tell it a bar.

1201
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:03,860
Fuck this guy.
Fuck up.

1202
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:06,310
You know,
come on.

1203
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:10,000
Rarely this girl is this pick up.
I don't know.

1204
01:16:10,001 --> 01:16:13,720
But women are so great at fucking lie.
They really are better at than us.

1205
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:15,460
They lie just as much as we do.

1206
01:16:15,461 --> 01:16:17,590
So I don't want to make this seem
like I'm trashing women here.

1207
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:19,480
I view women that they're,

1208
01:16:19,481 --> 01:16:23,200
they're sitting in the same mud puddle
that were sitting in their animals just

1209
01:16:23,201 --> 01:16:25,770
like us with the same fucking desires.

1210
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:30,490
The one thing I do like about this story
is what I've been saying all along,

1211
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:34,990
getting into horrific arguments with
my girlfriend is, you know, they,

1212
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:36,940
why don't they ever catch women cheating?

1213
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:38,260
Yeah.

1214
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,600
You know, tiger woods,
another guy getting busted.

1215
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:44,800
It's like the sixth fucking
famous guy to get busted,

1216
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:46,900
you know?
So it really,

1217
01:16:46,901 --> 01:16:51,901
people are starting to buy into this shit
that guys are the only ones who cheat.

1218
01:16:52,511 --> 01:16:55,450
And I can tell you this
being a road comic,

1219
01:16:56,350 --> 01:16:59,110
the amount of fucking married
women who have approached me,

1220
01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:04,290
I was face fucking ridiculous. You
really sit there. You got your job.

1221
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:07,960
Oh my God. Did the fucking guy just yell
at me? I think he just yelled at me.

1222
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:10,050
I fucking, what's he going to do? Huh?

1223
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:15,740
By the time he walked up all my
stairs, you know what I'm saying? Um,

1224
01:17:17,790 --> 01:17:21,320
anyways, the fuck was I
just talking about. Yeah.

1225
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:26,450
They just did just, they're fucking,
they're better at it. They're better.

1226
01:17:26,451 --> 01:17:29,630
They already like do a mild
form of lying all day long.

1227
01:17:29,631 --> 01:17:33,230
They call it manipulation, you
know, let's shut that. They do,

1228
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:37,010
you know, they, they want something
and they just immediately,

1229
01:17:37,011 --> 01:17:39,260
they always know like, what
emotion? Let me try cute.

1230
01:17:39,261 --> 01:17:42,170
And they put their shoulders at,
he did a little fucking smile.

1231
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:44,840
Or they do the pouty face,
you know?

1232
01:17:44,841 --> 01:17:47,690
Or do they act like they're just like
this helpless little fucking thing.

1233
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:52,010
Those are all lies.
It's just all shit tickets.

1234
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:57,040
That just basically means
there's something that I
don't want to do and I want

1235
01:17:57,201 --> 01:18:00,800
you to do it for me and I want you
to pay for it and I want you to,

1236
01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:04,730
and not only do I want you to do, like,
they're so good at it that it's not even,

1237
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,460
it's not even good enough for
you to just do it for them.

1238
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:12,560
They want you to actually enjoy it,
enjoy doing it for them like that.

1239
01:18:12,561 --> 01:18:14,670
Like that's how much they get
your fucking head spinning.

1240
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:18,960
So that's why they never get
caught. That's my, that's
my belief. All right, Bill.

1241
01:18:20,910 --> 01:18:22,910
Uh, you know, if that made sense.

1242
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:26,300
I sort of fucking zoned out halfway
through that with the Nyquil haze I have

1243
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:31,280
going on here. No, actually took dayquil
deny. I don't fucking know. Anyways,

1244
01:18:31,281 --> 01:18:33,830
let's go to overrate.
Underrated. Overrated.

1245
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:38,870
Condescending comes from Connecticut.
Jesus, a little, little literation.

1246
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:39,933
They're condescending.

1247
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:45,120
Cons from Connecticut who infest New
York bars and grade you on that three

1248
01:18:45,591 --> 01:18:48,020
dimensional grid of where you work.

1249
01:18:48,530 --> 01:18:52,670
Went to school and live these cuts,
work in PR,

1250
01:18:52,910 --> 01:18:57,770
make 30 grand a year and live off
daddy's AMX and his rent checks for their

1251
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:03,110
Chelsea flats, uh, should be purged.

1252
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:05,870
That didn't even make sense, dude. I don't
know if you edited that last sentence.

1253
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:10,640
All right. Um, do you got, you
got some issues with women here.

1254
01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:12,740
Okay. First of all, you're going to wear,

1255
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:15,440
there's condescending [inaudible]
there's plenty of great women out there.

1256
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:20,330
You know, he just, you're, you're fishing
in the same poisoned pond. You know.

1257
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:22,490
What are the names of these
places that you go to?

1258
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:27,020
I lived in New York for 12 years. I never
met women like that. I never met him.

1259
01:19:27,021 --> 01:19:30,350
I ain't one of those a Wall Street bars,
you know,

1260
01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:33,710
go to work. What are some,
a little bit different?

1261
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:36,830
Start off with like a sports bar that,
you know,

1262
01:19:38,210 --> 01:19:40,790
what about those wine bars?
Is that where you're going?

1263
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:47,210
People sit there and a chat? I don't
know what the fuck I'm talking about.

1264
01:19:47,810 --> 01:19:50,510
Um, I'm just trying to take the edge off
of how bad women are getting trashed on

1265
01:19:50,511 --> 01:19:55,490
this, uh, underrated. Um,
what the fuck does that say?

1266
01:19:56,120 --> 01:20:00,140
Heleo sequence a kickass
band from Portland, Oregon.

1267
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:05,420
H e l I. L sequence. All right, I'll check
those guys out. Thank you for the email.

1268
01:20:06,610 --> 01:20:06,921
All right,

1269
01:20:06,921 --> 01:20:10,300
let's to the questions and I'm going to
have to tap out guys because obviously I

1270
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:15,360
feel too fucking hot here. All right,
questions bill. Um, love the podcast,

1271
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:15,781
but,
but all,

1272
01:20:15,781 --> 01:20:19,140
here's what it from a guy who actually
went to my Saturday night show at

1273
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:23,200
hilarity. He's in Cleveland. Um, as
such, I was at your late show for, uh,

1274
01:20:23,310 --> 01:20:25,320
last Friday night,
a Saturday night in Cleveland.

1275
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:29,490
The group I was with went out for dinner
or drinks before the show and everyone

1276
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:31,920
was having a great time.
So we get to the club,

1277
01:20:31,921 --> 01:20:36,150
take our seats to the waitress and forms
by buddy that they have some absence

1278
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:37,970
Martinis have set,

1279
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:40,880
I believe was illegal for a long
time and recently now it isn't.

1280
01:20:41,310 --> 01:20:46,200
They used to think of, make
people go crazy or something
like that. Um, so anyways,

1281
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:49,330
so he offers to buy them.
Uh,

1282
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:53,280
so I buddy offers to buy those absent
Martinis for everyone in our group.

1283
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:55,000
Mind you,
um,

1284
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:57,720
everyone had said that they were not
planning on drinking at the club due to

1285
01:20:57,721 --> 01:21:02,190
various obligations they had the next day.
So he buys was for everyone but me,

1286
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:05,370
I'm driving even though no one
really seems to want it. Dot.

1287
01:21:05,371 --> 01:21:09,150
My girlfriend is a small girl as such,
cannot really hold their liquor that well.

1288
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:12,420
So this Martini cubs that she didn't
want and she begins to drink it.

1289
01:21:12,690 --> 01:21:15,720
I see you're sipping on it throughout
the opening of middle acts until it's

1290
01:21:15,721 --> 01:21:18,990
finished. Finally, you get onstage.
We're all laughing our asses off.

1291
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:23,220
That'll all of a sudden I noticed her
stop. I look at her ask if she's okay,

1292
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:26,850
to which she shakes her head and says no.
And she says,

1293
01:21:26,851 --> 01:21:31,340
she needs me to take her to the bathroom.
Why?

1294
01:21:31,341 --> 01:21:35,870
I need to go. I have no idea. You know
why? Because she's a fucking woman.

1295
01:21:36,890 --> 01:21:40,430
They drag you down with them.
If you had to fucking Puke,

1296
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:45,620
you would just get up and puke.
Right? I need you to go with me.

1297
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:47,220
Okay.

1298
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:51,110
Fucking, Oh God, it's so fucking annoying.
Why I need to go. I have no idea.

1299
01:21:51,111 --> 01:21:54,140
I guess so I get, uh, I have no idea.

1300
01:21:54,141 --> 01:21:56,540
I guess so I get to look like,

1301
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:59,990
I guess so I get to look like the Douche
walking out with their behind me anyway,

1302
01:21:59,991 --> 01:22:03,320
she ends up puking and I ended up having
to take her home missing half of your

1303
01:22:03,321 --> 01:22:04,700
show.
So my question is,

1304
01:22:04,701 --> 01:22:08,780
should I be mad at my buddy for buying
her the extremely potent drink that she

1305
01:22:08,781 --> 01:22:12,470
didn't want or should I be pissed at her
for drinking it after saying she didn't

1306
01:22:12,471 --> 01:22:16,040
want it because she didn't want to get
drunk. I'm kind of mad at both of them,

1307
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:20,420
but more so at her because no one put a
gun to her head and forced her to drink.

1308
01:22:20,421 --> 01:22:25,100
She chose to. Um, all right.
Who should you be mad at?

1309
01:22:25,630 --> 01:22:26,463
Um,

1310
01:22:29,450 --> 01:22:29,450
MMM Christ.

1311
01:22:29,450 --> 01:22:31,610
I don't, I don't fuck it.
These are hard questions.

1312
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:33,823
Yeah.

1313
01:22:33,970 --> 01:22:37,670
Do you know what? You should kind of
be mad at yourself for some hot item.

1314
01:22:37,671 --> 01:22:40,430
First of all, you know, I need
you to go with me to the bathroom.

1315
01:22:42,690 --> 01:22:43,800
You know, that's just
one of, you know what,

1316
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:46,650
that's one of those things where you
shouldn't have to go to the fucking

1317
01:22:46,651 --> 01:22:48,780
bathroom, but that's one of
those things, if you don't,

1318
01:22:48,781 --> 01:22:50,670
they're going to make it seem like,
you know,

1319
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:54,180
it's Vietnam and you took off in the
chopper and left him down there like

1320
01:22:54,181 --> 01:22:57,840
fucking Willem to fall. You know what
I mean? It just becomes that. Yeah,

1321
01:22:58,170 --> 01:23:01,710
if you think I would have fucking
blah, blah, blah, you know,

1322
01:23:01,711 --> 01:23:02,730
it's amazing sweetheart.

1323
01:23:02,970 --> 01:23:06,760
Why you're always a hero in
these hypothetical situations.
You know why that is?

1324
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:10,540
Because they're hypothetical
and annoys me.

1325
01:23:10,541 --> 01:23:13,600
Why do you have to go to the
fucking bathroom? What did you do?

1326
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,580
You can't go in there.
What she did?

1327
01:23:15,581 --> 01:23:20,170
You sit there with like a glass up to the
door so you get to hear her puking. Um,

1328
01:23:20,171 --> 01:23:21,530
who should you be mad at?
A,

1329
01:23:21,531 --> 01:23:26,140
you should break your fucking buddies
balls and then tell your girl that she

1330
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:28,870
needs to take you out for a
fucking something or other.

1331
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:31,090
Just go and make her do something for you.

1332
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:33,310
Break a break or fucking balls about it,
you know?

1333
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:37,330
Cause you've got fucked in all of that.
You brought your buddies a dickhead.

1334
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:38,393
What do, what do you care? You know,

1335
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:41,470
he's probably trying to bang the
other girl that's at the table, right?

1336
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:43,750
He's doing what he's doing.
He's getting everybody look it up.

1337
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:48,160
He's trying to be a show
off, right? Yeah, absolutely.

1338
01:23:48,170 --> 01:23:52,330
I used to be illegal writing. What is
all the fucking things? I don't know.

1339
01:23:52,331 --> 01:23:53,111
That's what,
that's what I would do.

1340
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:55,620
I break your buddy's balls and
that I'd make your girlfriend,

1341
01:23:57,230 --> 01:23:58,063
I don't know.

1342
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:01,230
Totally go make your breakfast
or something. It's sad.

1343
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:06,170
Is chauvinistically as possible,
you know? And if she doesn't,

1344
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:08,460
I would just start jerking off right
in front of her. But that's mate.

1345
01:24:08,490 --> 01:24:11,670
That's what I do. All right,
next question. Hey Bill,

1346
01:24:11,730 --> 01:24:15,750
a big fan of yours from the opiate Anthony
show and the Monday morning podcast.

1347
01:24:15,751 --> 01:24:19,200
You do look to the, to the,
to the quick question for you.

1348
01:24:19,201 --> 01:24:23,940
I am a military vet. I'll do this is
a brutal, this is a brutal situation,

1349
01:24:24,330 --> 01:24:28,960
situation. Um, all right,

1350
01:24:29,790 --> 01:24:33,420
quick question for you. I am a military
veteran and I also happened to be Korean.

1351
01:24:34,910 --> 01:24:37,800
Um, I'm in college right now
and all my friends are white.

1352
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:40,890
When we hang out and get drunk,
the ugly racist shit comes out.

1353
01:24:41,310 --> 01:24:43,740
I know the difference between
joking around in real hate.

1354
01:24:43,741 --> 01:24:48,720
My problem is I was homeless week
getting food with my dad went outside.

1355
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:51,090
I hear, fuck you chink, yelled at us.

1356
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:56,010
I went blind with rage and jumped out
of the car that was going about 20 miles

1357
01:24:56,011 --> 01:24:59,640
an hour. I chased those, fuck the two
fucks down, but they will, I try to,

1358
01:24:59,641 --> 01:25:01,230
but they were too fast and got away.

1359
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:04,380
I'm chink is probably the
racial slur that hurts the most.

1360
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:07,020
That shit really eats away at me
and my parents are immigrants,

1361
01:25:07,021 --> 01:25:10,950
but they work hard and I've never fucked
over anyone or cheated on their taxes,

1362
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:15,930
etc. I felt that I served my country for
a year in the desert just to come back

1363
01:25:15,931 --> 01:25:17,970
and still be hated because I have a small,

1364
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:22,920
because I have small eyes and
a tiny penis or you just, wow.

1365
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,170
Okay. Okay. Um,

1366
01:25:24,180 --> 01:25:28,560
any advice on how to
handle undeserved racism?

1367
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:34,620
Uh, many advice to help
my friends understand what
it's like to be a minority.

1368
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:39,480
Anyways, let me know what you
think. A huge fan of fucking chink.

1369
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:42,210
I'm all right, dude. All right.

1370
01:25:42,211 --> 01:25:46,560
The first advice I would give you is
when you want somebody to understand what

1371
01:25:46,561 --> 01:25:47,970
it feels like to be a minority,

1372
01:25:47,971 --> 01:25:50,730
you probably shouldn't ask
a white male heterosexual.

1373
01:25:54,090 --> 01:25:56,910
Because I read that whole
thing and my big question was,

1374
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:02,040
what is when you're hanging out with
your friends and they get drunk and you

1375
01:26:02,041 --> 01:26:03,890
know all the racist stuff out,
and you were like,

1376
01:26:03,891 --> 01:26:08,090
I can tell the difference
between joking and just, uh,

1377
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:12,670
in real hate. Uh, my question is, is why?

1378
01:26:12,671 --> 01:26:17,671
Just because you're Korean that it just
seems like my brain for half a second

1379
01:26:18,851 --> 01:26:23,530
was like, oh, he's Korean. So because
he is a minority in this country,

1380
01:26:23,531 --> 01:26:27,960
that means he's incapable of
racist thoughts. My question
would be, I'll, I'll ask,

1381
01:26:28,230 --> 01:26:30,640
I've got a question for you.
Have you ever thought something fucked up?

1382
01:26:31,450 --> 01:26:33,790
You had to have,
you know,

1383
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:37,810
you never saw a black guy
coming down the street like, oh,

1384
01:26:37,811 --> 01:26:41,170
this guy's going to rob me. And
then it turned out, uh, you know,

1385
01:26:41,230 --> 01:26:44,500
he just cured pancreatic cancer or some
shit. You know, that never happened.

1386
01:26:44,501 --> 01:26:48,550
Who doesn't have that fucking story?
Right. It doesn't make you a bad person,

1387
01:26:48,790 --> 01:26:49,840
but what are you supposed to do?

1388
01:26:50,740 --> 01:26:53,800
Come of age when gangster
rap is on the television.

1389
01:26:54,220 --> 01:26:57,880
You live in the white suburbs.
You don't know any better. Um,

1390
01:26:58,230 --> 01:27:01,590
the fuck am I doing here? Let me
try to answer this question. Well,

1391
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,190
what the fuck was the question?
Um,

1392
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:08,150
any advice on how to
handle undeserved racism?

1393
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:13,230
Oh Jeez. I mean, I dunno. I Dunno
what intuit, in a perfect world,

1394
01:27:13,231 --> 01:27:16,200
you could go out there and beat the
living shit out of him and everyone else

1395
01:27:16,201 --> 01:27:18,840
would cheer you on as you did it,
you know,

1396
01:27:18,841 --> 01:27:21,630
and then buy a drink for serving the
country. I mean, that's, you know,

1397
01:27:21,660 --> 01:27:25,750
the world I would like to live
in. You know, you wouldn't
kill those people. Well,

1398
01:27:25,790 --> 01:27:28,230
I guess you would cause they're
not gonna change. Yeah. Fuck it.

1399
01:27:29,770 --> 01:27:29,830
Okay.

1400
01:27:29,830 --> 01:27:33,220
You know, then I'll have to
traffic a little bit. Um,

1401
01:27:33,370 --> 01:27:35,750
I don't know what to tell you,
dude. Well, why don't you, um,

1402
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:37,480
I'm not trying to be an asshole here,
but I would,

1403
01:27:37,481 --> 01:27:42,481
I would probably not hang out with people
who got drunk and suddenly started to

1404
01:27:43,001 --> 01:27:47,800
sound racist. You know, I would pick
a better group of friends. I mean,

1405
01:27:47,801 --> 01:27:49,660
it's bad enough.
You got to hear it from strangers.

1406
01:27:49,661 --> 01:27:53,140
I wouldn't want my inner circle
of people like, you know,

1407
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:59,020
that's not a good thing. That's not a
good sign. Do you know, when I get drunk,

1408
01:27:59,021 --> 01:28:03,340
I like to explain stuff. I don't just
start, you know, putting on a Klan Hood.

1409
01:28:05,050 --> 01:28:09,760
So that would be my advice. I would
get some better friends. And, um,

1410
01:28:11,050 --> 01:28:14,470
as far as helping your
friends to understand what
it's like to be a minority,

1411
01:28:14,471 --> 01:28:19,010
I just, they're not going to
be able to understand it. Yeah.

1412
01:28:19,110 --> 01:28:22,770
It's, they're just not,
they would have to, uh,

1413
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:26,820
move to South Africa and to have a farm
that was being taken away from him or

1414
01:28:26,821 --> 01:28:30,690
some shit, uh, they'd have to do it
like that. You know, I don't know.

1415
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:33,360
And even then they would
still have the arrogance of a,

1416
01:28:33,361 --> 01:28:37,290
I am a fucking from the white race. They'd
still have that card to throw it down,

1417
01:28:37,291 --> 01:28:42,030
you know? But it really got ugly, you
know? So, uh, I don't think, yeah,

1418
01:28:42,031 --> 01:28:44,970
I don't think somebody white could
ever understand that. You know,

1419
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:46,410
you can empathize,

1420
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:49,740
you can listen to the stories and nod
and have a concerned look on your face.

1421
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:53,610
But at the end of the day, you know, I
don't know. Well, let me ask you this,

1422
01:28:53,611 --> 01:28:58,440
like a Koreans. All right. Now as far as
I know about Asia, Japanese are sort of,

1423
01:28:58,441 --> 01:29:02,820
the white people have a,
of Asia, you know, well,

1424
01:29:02,821 --> 01:29:03,631
they kind of don't take,

1425
01:29:03,631 --> 01:29:06,990
kind of consider themselves superior or
they look down on the Chinese and the

1426
01:29:06,991 --> 01:29:08,220
Koreans and that type of shit.

1427
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:11,670
And they've kind of been just a little
country with their little shogun warrior

1428
01:29:11,671 --> 01:29:14,310
practices.
Is that what they tried to do?

1429
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:18,720
The rape and Dan King and all that shit
that they did in World War Two? You know,

1430
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:22,860
how to Koreans feel, why am I asking
you this? Man? You're from America.

1431
01:29:24,270 --> 01:29:29,160
Have you ever robbed me? I haven't read
any books on Ireland or Germany. Yeah,

1432
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:33,750
I'm an asshole. Yeah. I wouldn't even
fly by you even listening to this. Um,

1433
01:29:33,810 --> 01:29:38,190
anyways. You know what I would
do? Said Steve Bird in email,

1434
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:43,710
comedian Steve Byrne, hilarious
comedian. And he is, uh, he's half white,

1435
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:45,180
half Korean?
I believe so.

1436
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:47,433
Um,
yeah.

1437
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:49,720
He'd probably tell you to punch
him in the face if I know him.

1438
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:53,770
He likes to play hockey. All right.
More overrated. Underrated. Uh,

1439
01:29:53,771 --> 01:29:58,180
I had a great time, but you
show in Cleveland. Did it,
it today underrate. Okay. Um,

1440
01:29:58,450 --> 01:30:01,140
your, um, okay,

1441
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:03,510
there's this eat this guy
basically did an overrated,

1442
01:30:03,511 --> 01:30:05,970
underrated from the
show that he saw me do.

1443
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,600
He said underrated the
way nonsmokers smell.

1444
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:12,213
MMM.

1445
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:16,210
I'm not saying that your fans steak,
but sweet Jesus Christ.

1446
01:30:16,211 --> 01:30:19,510
I kept looking around during your set
because I could've sworn that someone was

1447
01:30:19,511 --> 01:30:23,080
smoking a cigarette, especially
those two Hicks who are heckling you.

1448
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:27,670
I was behind the midline for your DVD or
they just reeked of cheap tobacco would

1449
01:30:28,180 --> 01:30:32,350
booze. I'm not some militant anti
smoking guy. As a matter of fact,

1450
01:30:32,351 --> 01:30:34,120
I quit smoking about four months ago.

1451
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:37,900
I'm just horrified that I smelled that
bad for 20 years and wasn't even aware of

1452
01:30:37,901 --> 01:30:38,530
it.

1453
01:30:38,530 --> 01:30:42,700
The other underrated people who don't
have to tell you every thought that pops

1454
01:30:42,701 --> 01:30:43,540
into their head,

1455
01:30:44,470 --> 01:30:49,000
the guy sitting behind me at your show
is easily the guy who was laughing the

1456
01:30:49,001 --> 01:30:52,930
loudest, which I'm guessing is
good for you as a comedian. Uh,

1457
01:30:52,931 --> 01:30:54,670
what you couldn't hear,
thankfully his,

1458
01:30:54,671 --> 01:30:58,000
the way he would comment on almost
everything you said on stage.

1459
01:30:59,710 --> 01:31:00,543
MMM.

1460
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:04,600
Now he goes to give some examples. Uh,
what a great analogy bill just made.

1461
01:31:05,690 --> 01:31:10,220
That is really, that is a really
old reference. That's hilarious.

1462
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:12,560
I can't believe bill just said that.
Jesus,

1463
01:31:12,561 --> 01:31:14,510
how did you not punch
that guy in the throat?

1464
01:31:15,550 --> 01:31:18,620
And he said he did about a
thousand more deep observations.

1465
01:31:18,621 --> 01:31:21,050
Obviously he's being sarcastic.
Uh,

1466
01:31:22,010 --> 01:31:24,230
I was glad it was enjoyed
your show so much, but fuck,

1467
01:31:24,231 --> 01:31:28,250
I just want it to turn around and tell
him it's okay to just think these things

1468
01:31:28,910 --> 01:31:32,060
that you should have said
that, uh, you don't think, uh,

1469
01:31:32,450 --> 01:31:35,270
you don't have to tell your buddy every
reaction you're having to build, choke,

1470
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:37,280
save something for the ride
home for Christ's sake.

1471
01:31:37,281 --> 01:31:41,090
But I didn't say anything because of a
peace loving pussy who just sits there

1472
01:31:41,091 --> 01:31:42,230
and lets people know him.

1473
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:45,530
Thanks for the great show and was nice
to meet you afterwards. All right dude.

1474
01:31:45,531 --> 01:31:47,600
Sorry you had that bad time.
Yeah, that was a weird show.

1475
01:31:48,470 --> 01:31:53,030
I just had a couple of couple of drugs
there who thought they were helping the

1476
01:31:53,031 --> 01:31:56,300
show and uh,
they weren't.

1477
01:31:56,870 --> 01:32:01,330
So I fucked with him a couple of times
and then I just had to deliberately make

1478
01:32:01,331 --> 01:32:04,300
it uncomfortable.
And then I got out of it.

1479
01:32:04,630 --> 01:32:07,090
And then what ended up happening was
most people didn't even hear him.

1480
01:32:07,091 --> 01:32:10,180
So they were like, what did
they say? What did they say?

1481
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:13,840
They were yelling Jew and then
they kept yelling, faggot.

1482
01:32:13,870 --> 01:32:14,703
That's what they were doing.

1483
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:18,880
I don't know why I made a reference to
a Drayton and then they thought it would

1484
01:32:18,881 --> 01:32:20,950
be funny if they just kept yelling Jews.

1485
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:28,600
I don't know why they were vibing on,
on some shit.

1486
01:32:28,630 --> 01:32:33,010
And then I was talking about some sort
of homophobic thing and then they were

1487
01:32:33,011 --> 01:32:37,990
yelling, you faggot, you fucking faggot.
Faggot. The whole, the entire joke,

1488
01:32:37,991 --> 01:32:41,950
like every two and a half seconds.
Uh,

1489
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:45,400
and in their world it was hilarious
and it was helping my set.

1490
01:32:45,550 --> 01:32:49,630
So where are you going
to do all right? I, uh,

1491
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:52,870
I'm going to go take a bath

1492
01:32:55,780 --> 01:32:56,970
is a visual for you.

1493
01:32:57,430 --> 01:33:01,960
I'm all fucking aches and pains here
and I'm not gonna fucking take a shower

1494
01:33:01,961 --> 01:33:06,370
like a fucking man. Uh, that's it. That's
some money money podcast this week.

1495
01:33:06,371 --> 01:33:08,440
I apologize for the,
uh,

1496
01:33:08,890 --> 01:33:12,060
the nasal problems here and,
uh,

1497
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:14,770
I apologize to my country
downstairs neighbor.

1498
01:33:14,771 --> 01:33:18,940
Everybody have a great week and a
police come out and see me up at a,

1499
01:33:18,941 --> 01:33:21,970
the punchline up in Sacramento,
um,

1500
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:26,800
uninformed radio.com to listen to my
radio show with the wonderful Joe Derosa,

1501
01:33:27,610 --> 01:33:28,540
the teen idol,

1502
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:33,280
a teen idol sensation of the opiate
Anthony Radio Program on Sirius Xm.

1503
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:35,740
What else can I hype?
I think that's it.

1504
01:33:35,741 --> 01:33:40,660
Got a billboard.com I have about five
people on my mailing list away from having

1505
01:33:40,661 --> 01:33:42,550
10,000 people on my mailing list,

1506
01:33:42,551 --> 01:33:46,360
and I would like as a Christmas gift
for four of you to sign up for it.

1507
01:33:46,361 --> 01:33:50,820
Could you do that? Lovely. And that's it.
You guys have a great week and I'll talk

1508
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:52,153
