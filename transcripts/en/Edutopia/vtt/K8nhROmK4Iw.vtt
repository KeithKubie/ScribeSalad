00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:03.650
(indistinct chatter)

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.950
- [Narrator] ConGloms are an informal time

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.850
for the teacher and the
students to interact,

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.456
so it becomes a bonding time.

00:00:12.456 --> 00:00:15.070
(students clap enthusiastically)

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.610
The ConGlom sets the tone for the day,

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.080
and throughout the course of the day

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.000
you see the team-building,
sharing ideas, opinions,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.670
respecting each other.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.040
- Both of us were having difficulty.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.640
They did not just give up or blame us.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.743
They helped us along.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.370
- The mission of Riverside is

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.130
every child should graduate saying I can.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.450
They should go out with
the confidence that yes,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.040
I can deal with any
problem, any situation.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.290
(students cheer happily)

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.146
- First thing in the
morning, what do we do?

00:00:52.146 --> 00:00:53.098
- [Student] Conglom.

00:00:53.098 --> 00:00:54.270
- Can we do a Conglom?

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.146
Yeah, you want a fun Conglom?

00:00:56.146 --> 00:00:57.370
- [All Students] Yes!

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.550
- Conglom is a Riverside jargon.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.760
It means coming together.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.960
It actually comes from
the word conglomerate.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.280
Conglom is like a morning meeting

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.510
where it is a pure
relationship building time.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.940
They like the fact that this is

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.600
an unstructured time for them.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.690
It's just talking time, maybe
playing a game together,

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.470
always trying to know each other.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.270
- It helps me wake up from home.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.874
And it helps me start my brain.

00:01:19.874 --> 00:01:21.810
- One team over here.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.460
We have different types of Congloms,

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.950
we have physical Congloms,

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.590
we have social intuition Congloms,

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.450
we have spiritual
Congloms where we look at

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.193
how am I growing my heart bigger.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.310
- It's just like a good start to the day

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.330
because you don't want
to start the day with

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.440
studying or seeing books.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.850
We either do an activity or we have some

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.160
specific topic to talk about.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.320
- The need of the
Conglom comes mainly from

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.880
what is the need of the class.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.460
- Maybe that class has a lot of tension

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.853
between the boys and girls.

00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:54.200
Maybe they're getting totally
wrapped up in exam stress.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.580
You kind of tailor those
Congloms with that.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.830
- The Conglom that grade six had,

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:00.707
the topic was body awareness.

00:02:00.707 --> 00:02:04.027
- We had a girl and boy Conglom separate.

00:02:04.027 --> 00:02:07.080
When it's like completely girls,

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.390
then it's very comfortable
to say anything we want.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.120
- So is it fair that someone teases you

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.060
because you are starting to grow breasts?

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.410
What else do you get teased for?

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.046
- Tuli was telling me that I
have a mustache and everything.

00:02:24.046 --> 00:02:27.270
- He was calling her a hairy potato.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.600
- So we also talk about
people calling us names

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.470
and saying that you're fat, you're thin.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.086
So then we would also
shouted these to them.

00:02:35.086 --> 00:02:37.060
- The first thing I would do is,

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.280
whatever is happening at that moment,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.700
I would firmly say stop it

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.030
and second, I would approach a teacher.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.537
- Questions about the
body or about behavior,

00:02:46.537 --> 00:02:49.430
we would never approach our teachers,

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.860
maybe not even our parents,

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.100
but Congloms are a moment
when you don't get judged.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.200
- Okay guys, we're gonna play a game.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.860
Each team, three people will be mute,

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.320
two people will be blind,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.220
and one person physically disabled.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.490
Today's Conglom was an active game

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.950
to understand how my peers work,

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.870
to understand how I react
to certain situations

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.800
which are difficult and stressful for me.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.340
Your challenge is to use
these cardboard pieces

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.630
to get your whole team
to reach the other side

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.750
of the lava pit.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.600
- It was a team building activity.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.470
It was about involving everyone

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.600
no matter how different or alike we are.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.203
- Three, two, one, go!

00:03:30.354 --> 00:03:33.570
- How our team goes, we were taking care

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.810
of the people blindfolded
because the mute people

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.890
could see and hear us, so we guided them,

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.878
and we took support of
them in terms of helping.

00:03:41.878 --> 00:03:44.359
- Keep going, keep going!

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.274
(students cheer happily)

00:03:46.274 --> 00:03:47.107
- We're in the journey together,

00:03:47.107 --> 00:03:49.560
so Congloms help us grow an individual

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.980
who's going to go out into society

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.160
and be able to solve problems
and be able to understand

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.890
themselves and connect with
other people emotionally.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.530
- We all have different
strengths and weaknesses.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.734
Working as a class, we can cross the hole.

00:03:59.734 --> 00:04:01.560
(students clap enthusiastically)

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.220
- Every morning, the students
look forward to the Conglom.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.060
Even I look forward, as an educator.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.870
It is absolute outstanding,

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.630
and we would not want
to miss it for anything.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.130
(students cheer joyfully)
