( intro music )

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:08.675
Information only becomes
meaningful

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:10.410
when you've had
an experience.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.012
How do you really bring
that experience of science

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:14.547
to people all around the world?

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:18.751
<i> A big vision that
 we have is to bring</i>

00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:22.755
<i>a microscope into the pocket of
 every single kid in the world.</i>

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:24.623
It's about getting to
places where

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:26.392
these tools
would never go.

<i> This is a girl that
 I met in Nigeria.</i>

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:31.063 line:0%
<i> And I showed her for
 the very first time</i>

00:00:31.063 --> 00:00:33.633 line:0%
<i> how mosquitoes
 actually feed blood.</i>

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:35.434
We found a fellow friend

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:37.169
there was a mosquito
biting him right there

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:38.304
we caught it

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:40.740
we put it under our microscope,
and we actually showed

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.575
blood cells inside the
gut of that mosquito.

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:47.580
This girl had a completely
different perspective.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.716
And the next day,
when she went back home

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:52.084
she actually slept
under a bed-net.

00:00:52.084 --> 00:00:54.286
That's the perception
that you want

00:00:54.286 --> 00:00:55.587
when you're trying to bring

00:00:55.587 --> 00:00:57.590
science and technology
into people's hands.
