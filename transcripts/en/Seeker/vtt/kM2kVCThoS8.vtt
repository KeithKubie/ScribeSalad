00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.710
Some people are incredible human beings, who
are mentally and physically so special they

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.790
earn their place among the select few we call
astronauts.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.020
And some people get sick to their stomachs
riding in a car let alone blasting off on

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.849
a rocket, or heaven forbid in a car on a rocket.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.199
And sometimes those people are one and the
same.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.520
Thanks to one woman though, talented astronauts
don’t have to be sidelined because their

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.460
stomachs can’t keep their shrimp cocktail down.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.599
Her name is Dr. Patricia Cowings, and she
led the development of the Autogenic-Feedback

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.469
Training, or AFT.

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.710
Your autonomic nervous system controls things
you don’t normally think about, like your

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.129
heart rate, breathing, sweating, digestion,
that sort of thing.

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.510
And if you’ve ever experienced motion sickness
you may notice those things start to spiral

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.589
out of control.

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.030
Dr. Cowings’ training teaches astronauts
how to control what they usually can’t.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.789
50% of astronauts will get motion sick in
space, which makes sense.

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.510
Your floating and everything is moving and
orbiting…

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.400
Cowings’ method achieves this by figuring
out where the trainee’s resting levels are,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.800
and then strapping them into a rotating chair
that spins the bejesus out of them.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.160
Once Cowings knows how stress affects the
trainee, she teaches them autogenic therapy

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.060
techniques that focus their attention on something
like the sensation in their fingertips.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.950
Trainees are taught to focus so well that
they don’t pay attention to anything else

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.070
like the room spinning round and round.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.021
By changing their reaction to stress, trainees
can keep over two dozen bodily systems in

00:01:32.021 --> 00:01:34.320
check and their lunch down.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.260
The AFT method is actually something you can
learn too (sort of).

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.810
It’s basic operant conditioning, just think
Pavlov’s dogs that were trained to salivate

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.630
at the sound of a bell…You can train humans
to control their heart rate!

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.870
All you have to do, says Dr Cowing’s paper
on the topic, is ‘remove the blindfold’

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.930
or teach yourself to perceive your heart rate,
your stress level, and so on.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.840
Astronauts were put in a rotating chair that
rotated at a different speed from the wall

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.700
of the room (which were going the opposite direction)
and asked to assess their stress level and

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.120
autonomic functions every five minutes.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.440
Over just a few hours, with the right reinforcement,
they learned to understand their responses and

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.730
control them!

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.670
The uses go beyond preventing a mess inside
your space helmet.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.770
Astronauts can use these techniques to help
them perform better in stressful situations,

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.470
or sleep better in microgravity.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.650
And amazingly training only takes six hours
over the course of about three weeks.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.290
Dr. Cowings work helps astronauts prepare
for the rigors of space, something few of

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.340
us could probably imagine.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.980
Not Dr. Cowings though because before developing
this training for astronauts she went through

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.690
the rigamarole herself, and holds the distinction
of being not just the first African-American

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.930
woman to receive scientist astronaut training,
she was the first American woman trained full

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.930
stop.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.900
Dr. Cowings has been contributing science
at NASA for years and we’re happy to celebrate

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.830
her achievements for Black History Month.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.400
If you think this channel has the right stuff
you should subscribe.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.810
Think you have what it takes to be an Astronaut?

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.890
Check out Julian’s video here to find out.Not
only is Dr. Cowings work helping our astronauts,

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.940
its also helping our soldiers too.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.660
The US Army uses it to evaluate how their
vehicles affect soldiers to help them keep combat ready

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.069
and not get motion sick.

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.260
Thanks for watching and I’ll see you next
time on Seeker!
