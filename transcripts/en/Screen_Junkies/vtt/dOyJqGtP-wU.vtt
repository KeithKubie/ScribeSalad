00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.170
Ok, ok, we got it! Keep your star pants on!

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.440
Without the rights to some of its most popular
titles

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.860
and its biggest stars' contracts about to
expire,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.590
watch Marvel Studios scrape the bottom of
the barrel for their

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.660
obscure 70's comic book that barely anyone
read

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.559
proving once and for all we'll see ANYTHING
if you slap Marvel's name in front of it.

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:33.440
Guardians of the Galaxy.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.160
Suit up for Marvel's attempt at Star Wars,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.430
in a science fantasy adventure about heroes
you've never heard of

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.360
"Star-Lord."

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.280
"Who?"

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.340
protecting a planet none of them live on

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.430
from an underdeveloped alien villain whose
problems you couldn't

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.690
care less about.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.810
... We're really reaching here. This was a
fun movie.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.170
Journey across the galaxy to meet this gang
of lovable misfits.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.670
There's Captain Star-Lord, from America. The
human leader from a

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.430
different time and place...

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.160
like Captain America.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.110
Gamora, the Black Widow-ish leatherclad female
assassin...

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.409
like Black Widow.

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:14.350
Drax, the guy with killer aaaabs who doesn't
understand our customs in a Thor kind of way...

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.070
Groot, a big hulking tree. Get it?

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.060
And Rocket, the wisecracking tech genius with
a drinking problem,

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.640
like Tony Stark.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.930
What I'm trying to say is, they're the Space
Avengers.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.260
I guess it's technically it's not stealing
if they're ripping off themselves.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.430
Watch the guardians race to find an excuse
for more Avengers sequels by chasing after

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.900
the Infinity Stone --

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.490
an orb of world conquering power that no one
bothers to guard

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.510
and a gem so powerful it can kill you just
by touching it

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.320
unless you're this guy...

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.860
or you can join hands to disperse its power...

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.290
unless you're these guys...

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.110
or you can just jam it into a hammer and use
it safely from

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.799
there.

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.130
It's best not to think about it too hard.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.909
You thought the Avengers was nerdy?

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.689
You ain't seen nothing yet.

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.590
Between all the action and comedy, get ready
for a whole lot of space mumbo jumbo.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.790
"I will unfurl one thousand years of Kree
justice on Xandar."

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.170
"What's important now is we get the Ravagers'
army to help us save Xandar."

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.780
"So we can give the stone to Yondu?"

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.209
"The remnants of these systems were forged
into concentrated ingots..."

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.120
Then if you can figure any of that out, try
to figure out why this blue alien

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.269
isn't working with THIS blue alien

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.419
who's working for THIS blue alien

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:30.180
to kill this GREEN alien

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.519
who both want to kill this PURPLE alien

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.180
as does this Christmas-colored alien.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.959
But if you get confused, just remember:

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.279
the hero is still the white guy.

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:43.260
So experience the swagger of a movie studio
drunk on its own power,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.249
as Marvel trolls the world with balls out
middle fingers to the audience they know they

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:48.840
have in the palm of their hands.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.870
Oh, you like superheroes? Well how about a
movie that stars a f***ing raccoon and a f***ing

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:54.189
tree?

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:57.189
You like Vin Diesel? Yeah well we cast him
and he only says one

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:59.510
f***ing line.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.989
"I. AM. GROOT."

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.230
You want more some pedigreed actors? We'll
put 'em in stupid outfits and make 'em say

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.189
space bullsh*t.

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:11.719
"All Nova pilots interlock and form a blockade."

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:14.769
Because who doesn't want to be in a f***ing
Marvel movie?

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.749
Hey recognize that chubby idiot from Parks
and Rec? We're gonna

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:21.469
turn into a sex symbol, that would be hilarious...

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:25.059
Remember the worst movie we ever made, Howard
the Duck? Stick that after the credits

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:26.629
when everyone's expecting Avengers
2...

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.669
it'll totally f*** with our fans and they'll
love it anyways.

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:33.139
Speaking of which, remember Thanos from that
one scene at the end of The Avengers a few

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:37.510
years ago? Well, we're bringing him back,
and he's STILL not doing sh*t.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.159
Why? Because f*** you we're Marvel, that's
why.

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:44.689
What are you gonna do, watch DC?

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:47.769
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:49.820
Thought so.

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.549
Starring...

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.359
Marvel Chris #3

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:54.689

and Darkseid

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:05.969
Marvel's Space Avengers

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.300
Ok, I get where Star-Lord's Walkman came from,
but where do you get a tape deck for a spaceship?

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.500
Galaxy Shack?
