00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.501
We've intercepted a secret message, but it's scrambled. You're going to write a

00:00:03.501 --> 00:00:07.672
for loop that prints every tenth letter, starting at the zeroth one. You'll use

00:00:07.672 --> 00:00:11.480
it to decode the secret message. This is the project you'll be working with.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.990
The decoder tester has the string with the secret messages embedded in it.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.065
You'll write code for the decoder class. So that you can use a decoder to

00:00:20.065 --> 00:00:24.520
decode messages. Here's the Decoder class, and here's the decode method that

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.219
you want to fill in.
