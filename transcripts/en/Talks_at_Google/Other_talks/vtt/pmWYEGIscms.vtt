00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:05.790
LISA NASH: OK, great.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:06.970
Welcome everyone.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.960
Happy beautiful
afternoon in California.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.880
My name is Lisa Nash, and I run
a non-profit called Blue Planet

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.010
Network.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.180
And we are specifically
designed to help over

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.040
100 water and sanitation
organizations around the world,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.910
who are doing amazing work
bringing water and sanitation

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.380
to people who do
not have it today,

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.870
but don't have the
tools they need

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.880
or the communication
they need to really do

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.570
the best job they can.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.300
So our network of
110 organizations,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.490
of which Sabore's Well
is one, work together

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.440
online on our online
platform in order

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.350
to share information,
share their learning,

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.300
and they use our mobile and
internet tools and services

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.390
in order to be able to
better manage their programs

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.176
and monitor them on
a long-term basis.

00:00:57.176 --> 00:00:58.800
Because all the great
work in the world

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.920
goes down the drain
if something breaks,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.540
someone doesn't
know how to fix it,

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.330
and suddenly all that work
you put into building a well

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.790
falls apart.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.990
So I am particularly
excited today

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.570
to introduce Sabore, who is
in charge of Sabore's Well.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.620
He's going to tell you about an
amazing story of an individual,

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.080
who saw a need in his community
for water and sanitation,

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.260
and has worked to
make it happen.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.060
And how he's using technology,
as well as just amazing stories

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.030
to do it.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.160
So I would encourage
all of you in this room

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.890
and online to go check out
Sabore's Well on our website,

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.620
www.blueplanetnetwork.org,
and you'll

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.835
be able to follow along as he
goes back to Kenya, implements

00:01:45.835 --> 00:01:47.970
his program, and
you'll be able to meet

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.710
the people who are
impacted by his work

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.520
and the great
things that happen.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.060
So with that, Sabore, I'm
going to turn it over to you.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.870
SABORE OLE OYIE: Thank
you very much, Lisa,

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.180
for the good introduction.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.500
And thank you everybody,
you're welcome,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.020
and thank you kindly for
taking your time to come

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.320
and talk with me.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.040
So my name's Sabore Ole Oyie.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.250
I'm from Kenya, and I'm from
the original Narok county.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.704
And I'm a Maasai by the tribe.

00:02:20.704 --> 00:02:23.660
And I am happy to
be here today to be

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.470
able to speak out and tell
people what my vision is,

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.890
and what I want to
do for my community.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.260
For the women of my community,
for the girls of my community,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.350
and how to better their lives.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.350
So as Lisa said,
that my vision is

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.260
to bring fresh water
to the community,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.020
and to be able to liberate
women from walking between six

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.300
and eight miles, or even
up to 14 kilometers,

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.590
to go and collect water and
bring it back to the village.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.890
And the water that they collect
is not even that clean water,

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.730
it's just contaminated
water, so I'm

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.591
really happy that I'm here to
be able to share it with you.

00:03:03.591 --> 00:03:04.090
Thank you.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.820
KAI WULFF: Welcome.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.610
Welcome, Sabore.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.490
My name-- I know
in Kenya we say,

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.755
my name's-- but my
name is Kai Wulff.

00:03:15.755 --> 00:03:19.610
I work as the Access
Field Director for Google.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.210
So my job is to connect
the other five billion.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.110
Big theme is about
shared infrastructure,

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.500
like a borehole or a well,
is definitely something

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.250
that I would consider a
shared infrastructure.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.020
I'm what I would call
a business shark.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:43.310
So I'm not doing
philanthropy as my main job.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.410
I'm basically looking at
the business cases as well.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.780
And development in
a community-- and we

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.460
had a discussion about a
year ago, a little bit less

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.120
than a year ago--
development in a community

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.070
can be incubated, in my
opinion, by something

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.560
that is driven by philanthropy.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.520
But, long term,
to be sustainable,

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.550
it needs a support network.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.440
The support network
needs to come out

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.040
of extra incumbent
[INAUDIBLE] in the areas.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.410
And I would love to
hear your thoughts

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.529
about what you think
will develop around

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:24.310
those wells in terms of
business opportunities

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.070
and in a way where
income is derived.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.300
Because just to shorten the
way to walk to get water

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.099
is one aspect of it, but
what else can be done?

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:36.890
SABORE OLE OYIE: There
is one aspect of it.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.520
And then the other
thing is about creating

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.480
a chance for girls
to go to school.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.800
Because being at home
helping your parent

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.190
to go collect water or
maybe go collect firewood

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.040
is not the only thing
that you can do.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.200
You can get an education
and become a better person

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.370
in future.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.460
Work for a big company,
become-- go to high tech

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.950
and do stuff like that.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.420
We believe that the girls in my
community are capable of that,

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.330
doing that.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.020
And, also, for the
women in future,

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.662
after we get the
fast wells is we

00:05:15.662 --> 00:05:18.470
are planning to have
maybe irrigation.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.590
Like a small scheme
irrigation for the women

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.092
to be able to grow
their own crops.

00:05:24.092 --> 00:05:26.370
KAI WULFF: You remember
the reservation

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.340
that many people had about the
Maasai being herdsmen, and not

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.890
necessarily in farming.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.050
And this transition,
how it works culturally,

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.010
it will be of interest
to, again, share with us

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.390
why you think this change
of mindset will come about.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:51.870
That you have now women being
empowered in a society where

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.660
women before-- no matter if they
had access to water or not--

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.810
were not necessarily empowered.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.430
So what makes the
mind change work?

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.610
Do you think that it has
a long-term social impact

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.140
if women have more
to say in society?

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:15.380
There are statistics out there
that societies led by women

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.000
are more peaceful, more
inclusive, more prosperous

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.190
over time.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.990
So tell us about the
challenges you're having.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.820
You are an elder,
there are other elders.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.185
It would be against what
I know about the Maasai

00:06:31.185 --> 00:06:34.350
that I've interacted
with in my life

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.530
that everybody
agrees that easily.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:42.300
So I would love that you share
a little bit with everybody,

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.130
and what are the
challenges, what

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:45.760
are the pushbacks
you are getting,

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:51.650
and what do you think is the
point where people will accept

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.876
the model that it's working,
that it's actually beneficial?

00:06:56.876 --> 00:06:59.000
SABORE OLE OYIE: Our culture
is a very rich culture

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.410
and it's deeply
rooted into people.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.422
And like [INAUDIBLE]
talking about the change

00:07:06.422 --> 00:07:12.570
of set mind of coming to do
agriculture, most of the land

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.010
is now demarcated.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.820
That these people own land.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.830
And in order for them
to sustain themselves,

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.860
I believe in sometimes
to come there

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:27.850
will be not a lot of movement
of nomadics, moving the cows.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:31.220
As you know, cows are
very special to us.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.700
There will be no
movement of cows

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.080
going one place to another.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:39.990
So the alternative is to grow
maize, wheat, and of which they

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.560
have already started
their planting it.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.280
And educating a girl
is educating a village.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:53.030
And I believe that as the women
are starting to be empowered,

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.440
getting the
education, and getting

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.170
to know what's going
around the world,

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.340
and understand what
are their rights,

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.930
it's something that
will change the culture.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:04.930
And I believe it's
going to change

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:06.850
the culture on a positive way.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.730
That we need that
as a direction we

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:13.740
need to go where they also need
to be part of decision making

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:20.380
within the society because
when you look at, for example,

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:26.420
maybe probably women can
start a women's group

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.720
that would create a
business for them.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.220
To be able to take
care of the children,

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:37.110
help them, and buy clothes for
them, which the man can also

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.020
help on that.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.190
So I think it is very
critical that they also

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.549
get the chance to expose
themselves, and become

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:45.430
better people in the future.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.080
And I know it's hard
for our culture that

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.970
has been women less
powered people.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:58.280
It's really hard for a culture
like that to change instantly,

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.250
it will have to take some time.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.130
And it will have to
take a lot of commitment

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:06.220
between the youth
and the elder people,

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:14.340
going out and talking to people,
and campaigning for that.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.520
That is the best thing.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.410
And involving the
community too is

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:21.230
one of the most critical
things that you have to do.

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:25.290
KAI WULFF: So you're saying it's
not necessarily only a problem

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.730
of funding a well or
funding a business venture,

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.250
it's the whole ecosystem
you have to look at it.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.310
That people believe
in it, that you

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.760
don't have too much pushback.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.460
I don't let you
lose over pushback,

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.070
but tell me some of
the prejudices you got.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:42.840
Last time we even
had the discussion

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.270
about the influence
of certain NGOs

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:50.700
or certain churches
into a community that

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.420
comes from a
different mindset that

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.910
tries to impose rather
than to include.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:00.080
So I think that's
the utmost interest

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.485
because some people
believe there

00:10:01.485 --> 00:10:03.830
is a silver pool that some
people believe you just

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.840
throw money at the problem
and every little thing

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.880
will be solved, or dig a
hole and then call it a well,

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.120
and then don't have the
support system with it.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.620
SABORE OLE OYIE: I
think the best thing is

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.460
if you want to come up
and help the community,

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.330
you want to do something.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.590
The best thing is to
go to them and ask them

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:29.720
what exactly they want, and what
exactly is important to them.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.350
Because you might come up
with $100,000 and you tell us

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.150
I want you to build a church.

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:39.350
And the church is
not what we want.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:44.190
We want a hospital, we want
water, we want a school.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:45.980
So the best thing
is to go with them

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.750
and involve them and tell
them that this is what I want,

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:52.080
and find what they
want for you to do.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:58.690
For now, for our project is not
involving a big NGO coming in

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:00.560
to say that this
is what we want.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.230
I, myself, and some other
people in my-- my partners

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:08.240
that I work with just came
out with this is our vision

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.190
and this is what we want to do.

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:14.314
And this was my idea to
come up that we need water

00:11:14.314 --> 00:11:16.480
to be able to liberate these
women from going there.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.270
So the challenge is we think
that people who come in

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:25.130
and how we can be able
to include them within us

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:29.030
so they have to
accept what we want,

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.780
not coming in and saying that
this is what I want you to do.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.630
So actually those are
the most challenges.

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:40.940
And when you look
at the big NGOs,

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.360
the big NGOs comes in
with an objection of,

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.470
we want you to do this.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.570
In business, we want you to
buy cows and, for example,

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:51.200
[INAUDIBLE].

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.030
Do this and this and this.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.650
We want you to go
to school, we want

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.230
you to buy cows and keep
it as a business of which

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:00.740
is really good because this
is empowering them and trying

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.380
to improve their life.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:07.950
But it depends on
what people need most.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:11.660
KAI WULFF: The learning is
there's no one size fits all,

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:16.500
and you can't use the same
blueprint of development

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:21.910
all over Africa, not even
within two Maasai communities

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:25.200
you would be able to
just replicate what

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.790
one has been doing because
the need in the other

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:33.440
might be wild [INAUDIBLE]
killing the fields,

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.736
or a fence might be more
useful than a water well

00:12:36.736 --> 00:12:37.610
in another community.

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.520
SABORE OLE OYIE:
And that is true.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.780
KAI WULFF: So that is what
we discussed last time

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.190
as well is about let
the community decide

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.100
what has the most benefit.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.110
How would it, in
your opinion, work

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:59.240
if, after the first
philanthropic-driven

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:03.090
approaches, now if you see
the need in the community,

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:07.400
need for businessmen is
always equal to income.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.120
So if you have after a
certain incubation phase,

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.210
do you see that the
whole Model of 8

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.610
of incubating this could
be-- sooner or later--

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:21.365
be turned around into loans
and funding of businesses.

00:13:21.365 --> 00:13:24.640
So rather than
funding the borehole

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.040
as a donation, which you
have to do in the beginning

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.200
to incubate the whole
thing, long term, funding

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.090
other boreholes and
infrastructure as a loan, which

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:37.540
is payable back so which
gives the community more power

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.940
to say what I want
to do with the money

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:44.410
that I'm borrowing rather than
having to live with, I get

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.690
money and because I give
you the money for free

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:50.830
I can dictate what
you're supposed to do.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.420
Do you think that's a
model that could work?

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.944
SABORE OLE OYIE: For now,
we are still a very young,

00:13:56.944 --> 00:14:01.400
starting to be growing up as a
community-based organization.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.780
And I think in
the future, as far

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.570
as we go-- because my
recent past of my vision

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.670
was to build two wells.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:12.040
But after attending a
program in Santa Clara

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.730
about global leaders
for justice sponsored

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:19.450
by an organization called
GLWN, Global Women Leadership

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:23.190
Network, I changed my
vision into 400 wells.

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:29.530
So to be able to do that, this
will take up some time for me

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:33.920
and the community to be able
to grow, and be able to sustain

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:38.080
themselves in
maintaining the wells,

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.690
and how much money
comes out of the wells.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:46.290
Because eventually we'll have to
chart a certain amount of money

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:50.440
to be able to maintain it
and do other needed stuff

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.270
within the borehole.

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:57.940
So anything that comes out
of there is the fast priority

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.740
will pay a school
fee for a girl.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.980
And this girl will
believe if she

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.090
goes to school she can
bring back to the village

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:07.540
and give it back to the village.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:11.020
So it's something that
eventually in the future

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.790
we will work, depending
on how much income we'll

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:15.780
get from getting the borehole.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:20.900
If it is enough to sustain
the borehole, pay the school

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.160
fees for a certain number of
girls, and then the remaining

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.800
we can ask the women to do
what they want with the money.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.420
If they want to
start a women group,

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.930
if they want to do
an irrigation scheme,

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.330
it depends on what they will do.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.360
KAI WULFF: So to
summarize it, it's

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.640
basically like venture capital.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.360
Just that you don't expect
the return in two years,

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.150
but you're looking at
the generation of change

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:48.860
in a society that then
has all the business

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.340
cases attached to it.

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:53.360
So people can pay for the
services they're receiving,

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.110
people can see them as business
cases, can roll out themselves.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:00.050
Because I'm always saying
there is not enough money

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.290
even if you collect
all the surplus money

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:05.100
that people have
to do everything

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.810
as a philanthropic exercise.

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:12.770
It needs to be ultimately driven
by the principals of service

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:15.560
rendered, service paid.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:19.310
SABORE OLE OYIE: So
this is something

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:22.870
that is, no, we're not looking
to do it just right now.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:28.530
We're looking on a sustainable
project that if I'm not there

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:32.000
somebody else will be able to
see that something was done

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.369
here, and we need to continue
with what Sabore or other women

00:16:38.369 --> 00:16:39.910
have been doing, we
need to continue.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:44.720
So it's a long-time project.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.500
KAI WULFF: OK and
then, hopefully, it

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:51.840
will be replicated in other
communities in their flavor.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.430
SABORE OLE OYIE: Correct.

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.690
It's not only going
to be in my community.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:59.480
As time goes and we
have the resources,

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.990
we will expand it because
this is not my last one,

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:05.055
I'll have to keep going.

00:17:05.055 --> 00:17:06.680
KAI WULFF: I just
hope you are not then

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.599
going to the other community
and say, you need a borehole,

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:10.240
you need to--

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.930
SABORE OLE OYIE:
No, no, no, no, no.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.640
It's all up to them.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.470
I'll propose to them that,
do you guys need water.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:21.730
Because the places
that I'm thinking

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:25.660
that need water is
a wide area, and I

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.270
know what they're going through.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:29.372
The same thing that
we are going through

00:17:29.372 --> 00:17:31.080
is also what they are
also going through.

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.930
So if I propose to them
and that is what they want,

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:36.700
you go with them.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:42.240
it's good to throw an idea and
tell people that, you guys,

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.380
this is what you need, and, I
know, they're very critical,

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.662
they need them.

00:17:46.662 --> 00:17:49.110
KAI WULFF: And you know my
passion, where there is water,

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.710
the next step would be how
do we generate energy that

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:55.210
is sustainable,
that's is not running

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:57.610
on diesel that needs
to be imported.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:00.900
How do we create communication
around such a location

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.800
to make it even more
compelling to go there,

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.470
to push more content.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:08.240
This is what I see as a
shared infrastructure.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.080
It's not only just
for water, it's

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.380
a new community center
that's hopefully

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.034
going to be generated.

00:18:17.034 --> 00:18:18.700
SABORE OLE OYIE: I
really like your idea

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:22.510
of bringing on the
technology to there to where

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:26.320
the [INAUDIBLE] so that
[INAUDIBLE] that communication

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:32.070
with that because I think
we have to have both things.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.720
We have to keep
our culture, which

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:40.720
is something that has been
lost in some societies.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.740
And we like to have
it, but we also

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:49.000
have to have
technology and learn

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.500
what's going on in the world.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:56.060
Because, for example, if
I go back to the village

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:59.120
I can now use my computer,
I can use my phone.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.120
And I would like
any other person

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.370
to be able to do
that in my village.

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:07.280
So that we can also know what
is going on around the world,

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.780
and help people
understand what are

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:18.210
the importance of having
education as a way

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:21.006
to progress their life.

00:19:21.006 --> 00:19:24.245
KAI WULFF: I'm always saying
if you connect the community,

00:19:24.245 --> 00:19:29.370
it's usually the world
learning more about out

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:32.820
of the community than
actually the other way around.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:37.730
So the diversity of ideas,
the diversity of cultures

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.540
makes everybody's life richer.

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:44.180
So if you contribute as a small
community with 1,000 people

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:49.200
through the internet society,
which is 2, 3 billion,

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.210
the trade balance
should be in a way

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.540
that you are
actually contributing

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:55.700
more to the
ecosystem that you're

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.310
taking out of the ecosystem.

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:58.566
SABORE OLE OYIE: Correct.

00:19:58.566 --> 00:20:00.560
KAI WULFF: And that's
very encouraging

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.650
to see that you want
to keep the culture.

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:05.340
That you're saying , no, no, no,
the first thing we want to do

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.970
is once we have the borehole
and once we have internet,

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:13.390
we are going to dress in
designer jeans and just want

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:16.740
to sit and write applications
for mobile phones.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:20.600
As much as I love people writing
applications for mobile phones,

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.560
but it can't be--
in my opinion--

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.930
the ultimate outcome that
everybody in the world

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:28.240
only writes applications.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.380
So the application needs
to serve something.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.850
And I had a discussion
this morning with somebody

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:37.340
about how he would invest
in your business case

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.780
in rural Africa.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:44.320
Now, of course, I usually
don't speak about rural Africa.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:49.130
I'm very confident that
within a five-kilometer radius

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:52.950
you might have three different
cultures clashing together

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:58.990
in Africa, but I was
asking and everything

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:02.710
was driven about
organization, and those people

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.630
should move into the city.

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:06.710
And my challenge
was, and who's going

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:10.410
to feed the world if
everybody lives in the city?

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:12.560
Where is the food
going to come from?

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.202
From rooftops?

00:21:14.202 --> 00:21:18.390
SABORE OLE OYIE: That is true
because we have people back

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:24.710
at home who have got education,
and they go to the city

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:29.080
and become big people, lawyers
and working in companies,

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.600
but they still come
back to the village.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.830
I think you can hold
both things in one.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:36.100
You can hold your
spear on the left hand

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.640
and you can hold a
pen on the right hand.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:43.416
And that means you
can be in both worlds.

00:21:43.416 --> 00:21:47.705
KAI WULFF: Not as you
go through a TSA check.

00:21:47.705 --> 00:21:49.644
SABORE OLE OYIE: No.

00:21:49.644 --> 00:21:51.560
KAI WULFF: Very challenging,
very challenging.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:55.000
I think they think this
way worse than a pocket

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.691
knife or a nail clipper.

00:21:56.691 --> 00:21:59.670
SABORE OLE OYIE:
So I think this is

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:01.930
what the people
should understand.

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:03.920
That you need to have both.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.210
You don't have be in the city.

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:08.160
If you go to school, you
don't remain back in the city

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.500
and work in the city.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.920
Like you said, who is
going to feed the world?

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.440
They need to go
back in the village

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:19.600
and be able to be there, and
also be able to contribute back

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:23.000
to the community for
what they have learned.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.860
KAI WULFF: That's
very encouraging.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:28.240
I think we open the floor
for a few questions,

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.820
and then if I have any
crazy questions for you

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:31.844
I will just interject.

00:22:31.844 --> 00:22:33.510
SABORE OLE OYIE: I
want to say thank you

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:38.600
to [INAUDIBLE], who is actually
the person who helped me out

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.870
with my vision.

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:43.920
I had the vision for the
proposal for about four years.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.330
I didn't know what to
do until I met her,

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:53.241
and I can see now my vision
is becoming to a reality.

00:22:53.241 --> 00:22:55.350
KAI WULFF: And if you
need a business advisor,

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:56.570
in terms of fund counseling--

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:57.180
SABORE OLE OYIE: Definitely.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:57.905
Thank you.

00:23:00.695 --> 00:23:03.050
AUDIENCE: Could you speak
about the challenges

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.270
of drilling wells in Kenya?

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:07.187
In particular, what
type of material

00:23:07.187 --> 00:23:08.270
do you need to go through?

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:11.110
How difficult is the
material to penetrate?

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:13.907
How deep do you
typically have to go?

00:23:13.907 --> 00:23:14.990
How large are these wells?

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:18.520
And what kind of water flow
can you expect out one?

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.192
So what are those challenges?

00:23:20.192 --> 00:23:22.400
SABORE OLE OYIE: According
to the hydrological survey

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.980
that we have done,
because we have

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.570
to go through a
hydrological survey,

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:29.150
and the hydrological
survey has to be approved

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:35.000
by the government as
a registered engineer.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.980
And we went through that
and we got the report.

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.460
And the maximum-- the
deepest maximum we can go

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:49.310
is 250 meters, and the
minimum is 120 meters.

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:51.820
And, according to his
report, that there

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:56.980
was enough water that it can
produce around 8,000 liters

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:57.640
in one hour.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:58.572
AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:23:58.572 --> 00:24:00.980
SABORE OLE OYIE: So
there was enough water.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.450
And the other challenge
is also to be approved

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:10.380
by the government to be
able to get an organization

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:12.040
to drill the boreholes.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:17.070
And, as we don't have our own
company that drills the well,

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:19.890
we have to find out
the companies that

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:23.550
are really experienced--
there are a lot of shady work

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:25.250
that you can find everywhere.

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:30.040
So we have to be very keen
on looking for the best

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.030
company that can
drill the boreholes.

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:35.770
And we just pay them, they bring
all the material that we need.

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:37.355
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:24:37.355 --> 00:24:38.730
KAI WULFF: Maybe
I can add, there

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:44.670
were a lot of challenges in
people digging wild boreholes.

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:47.810
especially affluent
people within the city.

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:51.740
Like in Nairobi, the
groundwater levels for this

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.290
have dropped tremendously
because everybody

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:56.970
was drilling a wild borehole.

00:24:56.970 --> 00:25:00.080
And people were drilling
boreholes for irrigation

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.700
purposes, but went
into what's called

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.920
the ice in the salt layers.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.910
So after awhile the
fields become unusable.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:14.350
So I have to give kudos
to the Kenyan government

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:18.730
to be now very
restrictive in not

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:23.110
just every NGO or every
farmer or everybody

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:26.790
coming up and just
digging a borehole.

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:29.910
And there are other areas
where 120 meters is not

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:32.820
a wild borehole,
that's difficult to do.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:35.950
But you have other areas where
the groundwater levels are

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:41.060
much lower, and you
don't want a scenario

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:45.730
that the fields get spoiled
by salt content in the ground

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:48.830
or that the water you
pump out gets contaminated

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.710
by the graveyard next door.

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:55.260
And these were all cases,
actual cases, that happened.

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:58.560
And, hopefully,
with the involvement

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.460
of the communities,
the community,

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:05.080
itself, if it's educated
will push governments there

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:09.360
and in other countries
to say, wait a minute,

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:13.410
it's a good thing, it needs
to be handled in a proper way.

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:16.600
And if everything happens
transparently and there

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:22.560
is no, what we call
[? kitu kidogo ?],

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.970
a little something
that needs to be paid,

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:28.770
then this is a very
positive development.

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:32.900
And, as I said, I'm
usually very skeptical when

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.940
it comes to giving
kudos to government

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.130
regulations
overregulating, but when

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:41.670
it comes to water sanitation,
natural resources that

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:44.760
can easily backfire,
that's a very good thing.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.050
And I have to say, I
looked at the project

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:50.480
and there was a lot of
due diligence done on

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.662
not to create those problems.

00:26:52.662 --> 00:26:54.280
AUDIENCE: A follow-up
question to that

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:58.140
is Kenya has lots of
wonderful resources--

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:01.350
beautiful oceanfronts,
lakes, it's

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:03.360
the number one
safari destination

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.530
for tourists who come there.

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:09.530
Anyway, along those lines,
has any consideration--

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:11.560
I know that the population
doesn't typically

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.470
exist in those
areas, but is there

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:17.467
any consideration going forward
to desalinization plants that

00:27:17.467 --> 00:27:20.490
could draw from the oceans
or water treatment plants

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:24.027
could draw from the lakes, or is
this strictly a well endeavor?

00:27:24.027 --> 00:27:25.610
SABORE OLE OYIE:
First of all, I think

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:32.310
we live about-- to
where I live, I'll

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:37.160
say 6 or 700 kilometers away
from the sea, very far away.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.890
And we don't have
a lake around us.

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:47.190
There are a few lakes in Kenya
-- Lake Naivasha, Lake Nakuru,

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:49.000
Lake Victoria Lake Turkana.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.130
There are a few lakes in Kanya,
but we are totally far away.

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:56.410
We have a river, which is
called the Ewaso Ng'iro.

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:58.054
There are two Ewaso Ng'iros.

00:27:58.054 --> 00:28:00.470
There is North [INAUDIBLE]
Ewaso Ng'iro and there is South

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:01.930
[INAUDIBLE] Ewaso Ng'iro.

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:04.360
And we are in the
South [INAUDIBLE] Ewaso

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:11.480
Ng'iro, and from where I live
it's about seven kilometers

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.060
away from the river.

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:15.600
So drawing that
water from the river,

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:20.890
it will take a lot of
resources, and cleaning it,

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:23.680
and trying to purify the water
will take a lot of resources.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:29.014
So the best thing to
do is the boreholes.

00:28:29.014 --> 00:28:29.958
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:28:29.958 --> 00:28:31.666
SABORE OLE OYIE: And
thank you very much.

00:28:31.666 --> 00:28:34.090
I'm a cultural ambassador
from my country

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:35.910
so I'm really happy
when you say it's

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:37.210
one of the best destinations.

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:39.260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
is important--

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:40.850
KAI WULFF: He said
it's the best--

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:41.933
SABORE OLE OYIE: The best.

00:28:41.933 --> 00:28:44.428
KAI WULFF: --We could never
say that because we're biased,

00:28:44.428 --> 00:28:48.220
but he says it's the best.

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.535
AUDIENCE: I just wondered,
how do you find the world?

00:28:50.535 --> 00:28:53.060
I know in Northern
California they often

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:56.441
bring these mystical people
out, dowsers with the rod

00:28:56.441 --> 00:28:57.932
and they'll pull
you up and down,

00:28:57.932 --> 00:28:59.920
because they say half the
time the company comes out,

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.162
they can't find it,
they're drilling blind

00:29:01.162 --> 00:29:03.232
even though they've
done some kind of study,

00:29:03.232 --> 00:29:05.280
but these witch
doctors or whatever

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.088
can actually half
the time find it.

00:29:08.088 --> 00:29:10.447
How do they find where the
well is in the first place,

00:29:10.447 --> 00:29:13.300
and where to drill?

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:18.365
SABORE OLE OYIE: Honestly, I'm
not really sure how they do it

00:29:18.365 --> 00:29:21.140
and how they sense it,
but they have metal.

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.620
They use a kind of metal.

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:26.820
This engineer was using a kind
of metal near the machine,

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:30.790
that he was reading
some numbers,

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:33.295
and that's how he said that--

00:29:33.295 --> 00:29:37.080
KAI WULFF: Ground electricity
resistance levels.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.580
You can measure
out magnet fields

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:43.530
that are giving you an
indication where underground

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:47.150
there should be a flow because
it doesn't help you if you just

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:50.530
drill down and you
have stale groundwater.

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:52.250
You need to have
some kind of flow.

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:56.590
So you need earth
underneath with stones

00:29:56.590 --> 00:30:02.310
that allow the movement of
water, because it's a bipole,

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:03.820
it creates a magnet field.

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.600
And that's the same
principle those guys are

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:10.180
using because they're
very sensible to this.

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:14.990
My dad and myself we
could do this as a game.

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:19.900
I wouldn't do it professionally,
but we had a pretty good hit

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:20.500
rate.

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.900
It's a subconscious thing.

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:26.710
People or animals
react to magnet fields.

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:29.070
It's no magic involved with it.

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:31.870
It's simply that you
have to believe in it,

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:34.668
and you have to be
loose enough to do it.

00:30:34.668 --> 00:30:37.945
AUDIENCE: In followup,
are there any issues

00:30:37.945 --> 00:30:40.344
with the well going dry?

00:30:40.344 --> 00:30:42.774
How do you know that there's
enough water there every year

00:30:42.774 --> 00:30:47.148
for 100 years, will there be
water, or is that an issue?

00:30:47.148 --> 00:30:51.036
If the well goes dry [INAUDIBLE]
do something like that?

00:30:51.036 --> 00:30:53.920
SABORE OLE OYIE: I think that
one will depend, actually,

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:57.290
on the usage of water.

00:30:57.290 --> 00:31:00.560
And how much is the
water being used,

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:06.210
and how much you have gone deep
to the where the source is.

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:08.660
Because, according to
the report, he said

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:12.890
there are 8,000
liters in one hour.

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:14.140
I think that is enough for us.

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:18.440
So we believe in-- you
never know about nature.

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:21.570
You cannot predict
when it's going to end,

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:25.283
but we believe it's going
to last for a long time.

00:31:25.283 --> 00:31:27.782
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering,
considering this a community

00:31:27.782 --> 00:31:31.618
effort, what kind of
individual participation

00:31:31.618 --> 00:31:33.980
are you looking
at for people that

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.328
are not based in the community?

00:31:39.442 --> 00:31:41.950
SABORE OLE OYIE:
Mostly what we like

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:48.680
is we will appreciate the
advise, like people like Kai,

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.730
to be able to come and give
us an advice on what can we

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:53.450
do in the future.

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:57.720
And I think when you're also
constructing the borehole,

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:02.840
we also need people to come and
help volunteer and do something

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:08.490
to be able to help us building
the structure of the house,

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:19.620
and also giving us advice
on how to maintain.

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:23.520
And mostly is on how
we can get the fundings

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:26.260
for the next project.

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.250
KAI WULFF: I would give
you a business case.

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:32.720
Open a little tent camp
for volunteers to come over

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:36.790
and help with the work, and
sell the spaces in the tent camp

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:40.110
and then be a moving
camp and a builder.

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:43.470
So you never know.

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:46.120
Everything is driven
by business in the end.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:47.515
AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:32:47.515 --> 00:32:50.340
KAI WULFF: I would
like to say thank you

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:54.740
for everybody that's worked
very, very hard on the project.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.980
I think Sabore has
a few things to sell

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:01.730
that support the cause as well.

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:05.110
And I'm very, very happy
to be aligned with it

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:07.790
and to help with
advice and whatever

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:10.075
else I can do for
my old home, Kenya.

00:33:10.075 --> 00:33:11.200
SABORE OLE OYIE: Thank you.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.033
Thank you very much.

00:33:12.033 --> 00:33:15.040
Thank you very much
for coming, and we also

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:19.870
have some stuff that we support
women widows because they're

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:21.430
not supposed to remarry again.

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:25.490
So we also support them to
take their children to school.

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:27.670
So I bring the beadword
for them that they

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:30.690
make that I can take
something back to them.

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:32.100
Thank you very much.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:37.279
[APPLAUSE]
