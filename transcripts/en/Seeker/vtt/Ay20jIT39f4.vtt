00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.859
Cool scars were like a huge part of childhood,
like one scar on that one dudes forehead,

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.620
or that scar on that mean lion.. what’s
his name?

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.340
But like, what are scars?

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.650
Why do we get them?

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.539
Hey guys, julia here for DNews

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.349
Last week we got a great question from Richard
Colinge asking How do scars form?

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:22.081
And why do they have a different texture and
look?

00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:25.300
Well Richard you’ve got some great questions
and we’ve got some answers!

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.609
So in your skin and other tissues, your cells
are all connected by what’s called an extracellular

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.609
matrix.

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.870
This ECM as it’s called helps cells exchange
nutrients and share information.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.310
It’s mostly made up of collagen, a strong
fibrous kind of material, secreted by cells

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.550
called fibroblasts.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.230
Usually the ECM is in a random basket weave
type formation.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.420
Scars form when there’s a wound.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.019
When your body is wounded, white blood cells
surround the area to stave off any infection.

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.680
Your body tries to hold together the edges
of the wound by producing collagen from the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.680
fibroblasts.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.820
And white blood cells also help with the production
of collagen.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.249
This collagen quickly forms to support the
wounded area.

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:02.699
Unfortunately, fibroblasts often produce too
much collagen after a wound.

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.920
And it isn’t in the same basketweave pattern,
it’s more in straight lines facing one direction.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.560
With an excess of collagen in a weird pattern,
the tissue isn’t able to do the normal things

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.560
it’s supposed to.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.560
Like sweat or grow hair.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.860
And yes, skin cells do replace themselves
periodically, but while individual cells are

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.560
replaced, the underlying collagen is not.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.840
So that’s why scars persist.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.360
While scars can be helpful and supportive
in wound healing, they can also be damaging.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.909
Collagen isn’t very flexible, so sometimes
a buildup of scar tissue leads to serious

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:30.909
health problems.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.869
All tissues scar as they repair themselves,
not just your skin.

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.520
This includes internal tissues like ligaments
and organs.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.430
If scar tissue in your organs forms, it’s
called fibrosis, even if it’s not caused

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.189
by a wound but by an autoimmune disorder or
illness.

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.289
Such a build up can cause chronic health problems
like cystic fibrosis causes damage to the

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.000
lungs and sometimes other organs like kidneys
and liver.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.549
So besides being slightly unsightly, scars
can mess things up.

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.689
So scientists are working on ways to stop
scar production.

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.640
One study published in the journal Nature
Cell Biology found a way to turn down fibroblasts

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.640
activity.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.520
The researchers discovered that after a while,
fibroblasts enter a state of senescence, meaning

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.700
they don’t reproduce.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.640
The senescent cells stopped making collagen
and even contributed to breaking it down.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.200
The researchers also discovered a specific
protein called CCN1 that actually induced

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.110
the senescent state in fibroblasts.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.480
So they created a topical cream that contained
that protein, and lo and behold actually stopped

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.780
scars from forming… in mice.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.819
So more research is needed on that front.

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.310
Anyway I hope that answers your questions,
Richard!

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.120
Switching gears for a second, GUYS GUYS GUYS.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.709
We’re having a space hang out!

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.599
As NASA is about to fly-by Pluto, we're doing
a live Google Hangout with our awesome space

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.739
producer Ian O'Neill and a special guest INSIDE
MISSION CONTROL!

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:39.739
WHAT CRAZY RIGHT?!

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:40.739
I’m so stoked.

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.790
It’s all happening July 14 at 1pm Pacific
4pm Eastern.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.200
SO be there or be square!

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.050
RSVP on the event page for a reminder!

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.780
Theres a link down in the description too!

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.200
Alrighty, so do you any of you guys have a
cool scar?

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.610
One that looks like a perfect map of the london
underground perhaps?

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:00.370
Tell us about it down below!
