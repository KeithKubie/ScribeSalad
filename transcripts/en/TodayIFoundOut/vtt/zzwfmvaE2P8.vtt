00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.670
Long before the bonsai art form of creating
miniature trees came to Japan, the wealthy

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.550
in China were perfecting their craft known
as “penzai” and “penjing.”

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.160
The former means “tray plant” and the
latter “tray scenery.”

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.680
It is from the Japanese pronunciation of “penzai”
that the word “bonzai” ultimately derives-

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.230
“bon” meaning “tray-like” and “sai”
meaning “planting.”

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.300
(The Japanese equivalent of penjing is bonkei,
meaning “tray landscape.”)

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.230
In the earliest form of penjing, first emerging
as a developed art form around 600-700 AD

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.040
in China, people would collect native trees
and grow them in small containers as a part

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.450
of elaborate miniaturized landscapes.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.390
Those tiny landscapes were often given as
gifts among China’s elite.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.590
While Buddhist monks and delegations sent
from Japan to China had been bringing back

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.510
to Japan miniaturized crafted landscapes as
souvenirs starting not that long after the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.150
art of penjing had been established in China,
it wasn’t until the Kamakura period in Japan

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.149
(1192-1333 AD) that the Japanese seem to have
adopted this craft.

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.920
The catalyst for this widespread adoption
was the introduction of Zen Buddhism to Japan.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.759
Around the same time in Japan, penjing was
distilled down to single, miniature trees,

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.649
rather than miniature landscapes being the
focus, with famed Zen master Kokan Shiren

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.880
being particularly influential in the spread
of Zen Buddhism and defining bonsai as an

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.030
art form.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.329
Besides not strictly being “invented”
in Japan, another common misconception about

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.340
bonsai trees is that they are genetically
dwarfed.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.390
Instead, they are regular tree and shrub species,
traditionally pine, maples, and azaleas, which

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.399
are manipulated using pruning techniques,
including extensive root pruning, to dwarf

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.889
and shape the plants.

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:59.509
While there are many different styles of bonsai,
keeping everything balanced is key for whatever

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.899
type and shape of bonsai tree that is grown,
hence Mr. Miyagi’s lessons to Daniel-san

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.350
about balance in The Karate Kid and using
the “baby trees,” as Daniel put it, as

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.350
a tool for it.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.640
For instance, if a leaf or a branch is disproportionately
large given the size of the tree, throwing

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.819
the whole thing out of balance, it should
be removed.

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.160
One should also hide any signs of pruning,
so that the resulting tree looks just like

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.410
it was naturally grown that way and a perfect,
to scale, miniature of what the full size

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.269
version of the tree would look like if it
had the same shape.

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.000
Once Japan adopted the craft from China, it
began to spread among all classes of Japanese

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
society.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.990
According to bonsai historian Robert Baran,
by the late 18th century a show for “traditional

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.769
pine dwarf potted trees” was held annually
in Kyoto where, ”Connoisseurs from five

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.959
provinces and the neighboring areas would
bring one or two plants each to the show in

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.920
order to submit them to the visitors for ranking
or judging.”

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.650
After Japan ended its over two centuries of
isolation in the 19th century, the bonsai

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.549
tree would be popularized outside of the country
at fairs and expos around the world, including

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:10.290
the Paris Expositions (1878, 1889) and the
St. Louis World’s Fair (1904).

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.439
WWII proved both a blessing and a curse to
the growth of the bonsai art form.

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:19.980
On the major downside, many growers did not
continue in this line of work after the war

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.340
and numerous extremely old bonsai trees were
destroyed.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.110
Some effort was given to preserving them,
however, such as workers at the Tokyo Imperial

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.829
Palace continually pouring water over and
ultimately rescuing some of the remarkable

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.629
Imperial Collection as the Palace was burning
around them after the allied bombing of Tokyo

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.200
on May 25, 1945.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.049
On the positive side, at least in terms of
helping to continue the popularization of

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.040
the bonsai tree outside of Japan, many Allied
troops occupying Japan admired the art form

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.860
and even took classes in it, bringing it back
with them to their respective homes.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.540
More recently, the art form has been popularized
in cinema with, of course, The Karate Kid

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.739
leading the way.

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.560
oldest-bonsai-treeToday, there is a World
Bonsai convention that takes place every four

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.150
years to showcase the best bonsai masters
and their work internationally.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.900
Washington D.C. also houses the National Bonsai
&amp; Penjing Museum dedicated to the miniaturized

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.299
trees and landscapes.

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:18.209
And if you visit the Tokyo Imperial Palace
and tour their bonsai collection, you can

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:25.020
spy some of the finest specimens in the world,
including one of the oldest known bonsai trees,

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.289
the Third Shogun (pictured right), which is
a five-needle pine that has been steadfastly

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:35.080
maintained for an astounding five and a half
centuries.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.100
You’ll often see people confusing “bonsai”
and “banzai,” using the words interchangeably,

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.190
but this isn’t correct as illustrated by
Mr. Miyagi, “Miyagi: Banzai!

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.190
Daniel: To baby trees.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.229
Miyagi: Not bonsai, BANZAI!”

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.389
The former, of course, is more or less the
“baby trees,” as Daniel stated.

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:00.100
The latter is simply an exclamation not unlike
“Hurrah!” or more aptly, “long live!”

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.430
though literally means “ten thousand years.”

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.750
Like the art of bonsai, this expression was
adopted by the Japanese from China, where

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:31.719
it was originally just an expression used
to wish long life to the emperor of China.
