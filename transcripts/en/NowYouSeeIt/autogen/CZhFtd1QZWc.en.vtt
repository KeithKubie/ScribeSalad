00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.820
 Welcome to Now You See It 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.140
 The opening scene of the movie is the most important part of the movie. 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.059
 It may not be the most memorable or the most complicated lens, but it is the first lens we saw. 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.470
 It’s as important as our first impression of a person 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.530
 Opening shots are often overlooked, especially when they are not so cool 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.939
 But the director will use the opening lens to convey the theme of the movie, the premise of the story, 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.180
 Or character arc. It’s like introducing a scene to us, 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.380
 The opening lens introduces the whole movie to us. This introduction may be a scenery. 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.399
 a character, even a computer screen, but no matter what it is, this is the most worth mentioning 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.579
 Aspect. The opening shot is the information that the viewer initially received, so the director 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.670
 It will make him meaningful. I want to focus on what we can do from the next 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.240
 What was found in the opening shots of these movies. If you have seen this, it’s good, 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.369
 If you haven't already, it's better, because you can watch these movies after watching this short film. 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.560
 See how their opening shots present the entire movie. Let's start with an epic start: 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.899
 2001 Space Roaming This shot begins on the back of the moon. The first one caught our eyes 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.480
 It is this desolate and dead space that is far from the earth. 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.520
 We can see the earth from behind the moon, and the sun rises on the side. This lens also symbolizes the dawn of mankind. 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.610
 The opening lens is not a person or a group of people, it is the entire human civilization. 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.220
 It shows that this movie is not just about people, but about human beings as a whole. 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.800
 The sun, symbolizing life, slowly rises into our vision. Our eyes are the beginning of the cycle of life. 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.360
 At the same time, the soundtrack of this lens has a thick sense of epic scale. 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.540
 And this rising sun, the home we live in, the earth 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.700
 Tell us that the center of this story is the creature on earth. We also know that we look out of this space from the perspective of an outsider. 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.080
 The title tells us that we are on the way. 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.320
 Therefore, we can learn from this opening shot that this film is about human beings, about life above the earth. 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.340
 And the journey of life on earth 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.220
 From this shot, we have a clear understanding of what the plot will be. 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:12.220
 The opening shot of "2001: Space Roaming" is an amazing shot that we can remember, let's take a look 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.700
 A simple opening shot can also account for a lot of information. 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.510
 According to the composition of the movie in the opening shot, the position of the camera, and the action of the actor 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.000
 We can find a lot of information in the movie. 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.400
 In the movie "The Line of Happiness Behind the Dark Clouds", we first look at him from the back of the protagonist, and the other part we can't see. 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.260
 Slow zoom pulls his head towards us, his head in the opposite direction 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.700
 He said in the other direction that he wanted to apologize. He is from the position facing away from the camera 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.700
 It also implies that this character is in a weak position. In this shot, we can see 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.780
 The protagonist’s goal is the wrong direction, and we know that this movie will focus on him. 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.460
 And what is happening to him 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.820
 Take a look at this shot from "Little Miss Sunshine". What can we find? 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.500
 We saw Miss Louisiana’s beauty contest in her glasses. 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.440
 We soon realized that this movie is about dreams and pursuing dreams. 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.780
 From her desire to become a beauty contest champion, our desire is a beauty pageant, and we have a certain impression of this dream. 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:37.460
 It may be superficial and only focus on the surface. Because of the close-up of her eyes, Miss Louisiana is the map of her dreams. 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.880
 From her lens, she can see what she wants to be. 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.400
 I like the opening shot of Silent Lamb. 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.999
 Because this is a very informative lens 

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:58.159
 Let's take a look at what you can find at the very beginning. 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.060
 She is climbing up the rope in the middle of the picture. 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.480
 This shows that we have started from her journey. She is pulling herself out of the squat 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.240
 Soon we discovered that our hero is trying to break through its predicament. 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.879
 I like the placement of this rope next to her. 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.280
 It seems that not everyone can pull so far like her, she continues to train, pull herself 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.700
 Once she got to the top, she stopped and we could hear the sound of the birds flying. 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.740
 She spent a while trying to see them. 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.060
 The flying bird symbolizes that our hero has achieved freedom by pulling himself up. 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.560
 If you want more movies about the symbol of flying 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.660
 You are very lucky, because I have done this episode before. 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.960
 Our hero continues her journey, she has been training to escape the frame. 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.400
 From the opening lens, we learned 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.920
 Our hero is determined to save myself from the metaphorical groove that she fell into during training. 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.840
 Later we saw that her training was trained at the FBI in order to save those who could not pull themselves out. 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:21.220
 When our hero can't save those who can't save themselves, she is trapped in a ditch. 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.780
 She tried to get the lamb not to call her to get help. 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.340
 Every great movie has a great opening shot 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.920
 The director always tells a lot of content in a short time in the opening shot. 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.430
 If you want to know more about the opening lens, 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.509
 You can choose to look at the angry bull, great white shark, she, but not limited to these 

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:50.509
 Because there are countless movies waiting to be opened there, being explored 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:52.289
 Thanks for watching
