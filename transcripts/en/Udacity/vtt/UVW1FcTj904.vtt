00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.390
How is one program, let's say an

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.740
email, protected from the misbehavior of another program,

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.760
say the web browser. This is where memory

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.230
related operating system abstractions come into play. In

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.440
particular, the operating system provides address space as

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.640
an abstraction for each process that is distinct

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.870
from one another. So the data and the

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.920
code that corresponds to a particular program is

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.320
contained in a container which is

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.150
called the address space. That's the abstraction

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.730
provided by the operating system. And

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.120
this address space abstraction of the operating

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.040
system is implemented by whatever hardware

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.530
capabilities that the underlying processor architecture provides

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.300
you. Processor and memory are the most

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.940
precious resources. And, what we've done is

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.660
a quick review to understand the abstractions

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.550
in the operating system for managing these resources.
