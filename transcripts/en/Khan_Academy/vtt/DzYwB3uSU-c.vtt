00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.790
 

00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.790
Let's say Pete over
here thinks that he's

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.570
a pretty good investor.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.110
So what he does is, he has
an idea that says, look,

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.810
I'm going to create
a corporation.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.393
And I'm going to get
a bunch of people

00:00:10.393 --> 00:00:12.130
to contribute money
to that corporation.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.180
And then I'll manage that
money, and maybe I'll

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.040
take a little fee for
myself, so that I can maybe

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.230
hire some analysts,
or get some computers,

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.040
or get some office space.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.490
What he does is he
sets up a corporation.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.030
Let's say he sets up a
corporation right over here.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.010
And let's say the way he
first sets up the corporation,

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.540
let's say it just
has four shares.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.480
And I'm making the
number really small

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.735
just to make the drawing
and the math easy.

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:36.860
This wouldn't be realistic.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.660
Normally it would be something
in the hundreds or thousands

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.500
of shares, or maybe
even more than that.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.110
But let's say it
has four shares.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.620
And let's say all the four
shares are owned by Pete

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.720
initially, just to
simplify the explanation.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.859
And he puts in $400
into this corporation.

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.400
So another way to think about
it, in exchange for him putting

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.390
$400 into this corporation,
he gets four shares,

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.720
or each share is
worth $100, each

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.670
of these shares right over here.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.420
And so what he does is he
registers this corporation--

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.370
and I'm talking about
a US-specific case,

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.410
but there's similar
types of organizations

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.640
in other countries-- he
registers this organization

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.950
right over here with the US
SEC, Securities and Exchange

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:25.640
Commission.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.030
And he also registers
himself with the SEC.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.860
Or even better, he registers
a management company

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.360
that he runs with the SEC.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.930
So let's call it Pete Inc. It's
a corporation he starts off

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.522
that he also registers
with the SEC.

00:01:40.522 --> 00:01:41.980
And when he registers
with the SEC,

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.710
he tells them that look,
this company right over here,

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.270
we're going to issue more
shares for more people

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.580
to contribute money.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.900
And I'm going to manage
this money right over here,

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.620
and I'm just going to take a
percentage of the total assets

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.510
under management.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.240
Sometimes you'll see AUM used.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.450
That just means assets
under management.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.560
That will go to
Pete Inc. every year

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.320
for figuring out the best
place to invest this money.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.830
And it's usually on the
order of about 1%, sometimes

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.800
a little bit less,
sometimes a little bit more.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.340
So 1% per year.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.870
So right now, with only
$400 under management,

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.550
it would only be
about $4 per year.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.070
But since he registered
with the SEC,

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.630
he can call himself
a mutual fund,

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.170
and he can solicit
funds from the public.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.830
So it is a mutual fund, he has
jumped through all the hoops

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.660
that the SEC sets up for him.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.140
So he can market himself as
some type of great fund manager.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.640
We don't know if
that's true or not.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.015
And he can also solicit
funds from the public.

00:02:41.015 --> 00:02:44.690
 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.480
And we're going to
see in future videos,

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.580
there other funds, especially
hedge funds, that one,

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.444
they can't market, and
they can't take funds

00:02:51.444 --> 00:02:52.110
from the public.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.010
Those can only take
funds from certain types

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.512
of sophisticated investors.

00:02:56.512 --> 00:02:58.220
And what happens in
Pete's fund, and this

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.687
is going to be an open
ended mutual fund that we're

00:03:00.687 --> 00:03:02.770
showing here, and most
mutual funds are like that.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.030
Let's say that Sal comes along,
he likes Pete's marketing

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.290
materials, and he
says hey, I want

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.110
Pete to manage my money too.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.720
So Sal goes and he
gives $100, and says,

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.770
Pete, give me a share.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.620
So Pete creates another
share right over here,

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.170
he creates another share
he gives it to Sal.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.200
So he gets one share, that's me.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.480
I get one share.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.850
And in exchange, I
gave $100 to the fund.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.990
So now the fund has $500.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.590
So this is another
$100 right over here.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.350
And now Pete's
annual fee is going

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.530
to be 1% of this whole
thing, or $5 a year.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.550
And if this whole
thing grows, let's say

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.960
this whole thing
doubles from $500,

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.660
let's say it doubles to
$1,000, then that $1,000

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.460
is essentially split amongst
these five shares now.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.190
So all of the people
will essentially

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.860
have their money doubled, minus
whatever Pete's expenses are.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.110
In the next few videos, I'll
go over a little bit more

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.670
of the mechanics of an
open ended mutual fund.
