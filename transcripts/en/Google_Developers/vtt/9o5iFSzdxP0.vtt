ED: Hi, I'm Ed, and I'm from
the Google Maps API Team

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.420
and we're here in Hamburg
today to hack on solutions

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.970
for newly arrived refugees.

MICHAEL PLETZIGER: Ubilabs
and Google teamed up

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.330
to come up with this project
idea called Refugee Maps

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.100
and this was kind the moment
when the idea for the hackathon

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.649
was born.

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.315
MARTIN KLEPPE: We
want to have something

00:00:43.315 --> 00:00:48.450
where we put in related points
of interest for refugees.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.380
THOMAS STEINER: So what
is the actual problem

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.830
that refugees are facing
while they're on the road?

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.401
The most needed thing
is local information.

MALE SPEAKER: We're working on
the passion project for Google

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.250
Maps and it's my job to optimize
it for Arabic languages.

00:01:09.928 --> 00:01:11.553
MALE SPEAKER: What
we're planning to do

00:01:11.553 --> 00:01:15.870
is to add the functionality
to actually propose

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.730
new points of interest so
the volunteers don't have

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.682
to do all the work with
finding out the places that are

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:23.890
interesting for the refugees.
