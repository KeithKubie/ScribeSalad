you're young it's somewhere along that

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180
you're young it's somewhere along that
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.510
you're young it's somewhere along that
distribution with some range around it

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520
distribution with some range around it
 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.210

you develop your skills as you expand
that range but your set the place at

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689
that range but your set the place at
 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.270
that range but your set the place at
which you're set doesn't move that much

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280
which you're set doesn't move that much
 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.870

about them as frames of reference so
 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.300
about them as frames of reference so
frame of reference would be something

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310
