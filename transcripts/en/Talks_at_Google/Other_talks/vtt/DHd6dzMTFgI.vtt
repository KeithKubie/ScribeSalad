00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.220
&gt;&gt;Female presenter: Welcome, everyone and
welcome to Google. We're happy to have you

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.310
here with us for the Speaker Series for our
second exhibit. This is part of the Digital

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:18.220
Arts Exhibit that we're holding at Google
in collaboration with The Project Room at

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:30.160
the Chelsea Art Museum. So, initially, the
idea behind the exhibition was an idea by

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:39.220
Josh Schmitterlin, a colleague of ours, who
thought that Google should be more involved

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.020
in the local art scene; especially in the
local digital arts scene and maybe that the

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.100
effort would eventually lead to a collaboration
between digital artists and Google. So, this

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.070
is our second exhibit and we're very happy
to be holding the Speaker Series with two

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.780
great speakers today. Our first speaker today
was gonna be Rachel Armstrong and I'll have

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:59.280
to read this because it's a long list. Too
many qualifications. She's a medical doctor,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:09.850
a multimedia producer, a science fiction author,
an arts collaborator, so we have an exceptional

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.350
person here. And her current research is on
architectural design and mythologies about

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:24.649
new technology. And you've probably heard
about living architecture, so she's gonna

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:39.829
be giving us a talk and you guys can ask her
some questions towards the end and after our

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:46.820
talks end, you could also look at the exhibit
outside.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.830
&gt;&gt;Rachel: Thank you very much. All right,
so it's been a great pleasure for me to be

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:50.830
here in New York today. Particularly as I
had to walk 40 blocks in the rain--

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:51.830
[laughter]

00:01:51.830 --> 00:02:00.109
and realized after about block ten, that New
York drain engineers don't appear to know

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:07.729
how to build drains. Secondly, that made me
realize, also, that architecture really is

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.180
about dryness and that no matter what city
that you're in, rain is always a surprise.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.250
Which leads me, actually, to the materials
that I'm working with cause actually, they

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:24.209
are designed to work with wetness. And I don't
know if anybody has managed to go around the

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.250
exhibition just now. I haven't had a chance
to look so I can't tell you exactly where

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.540
it is, but my contribution here are some black
and white films, which I did with Michael

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:41.189
Simon Toon. And essentially, they are synthetic
agents made from simple oil and water, but

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:47.330
have life-like properties. And so, the talk
I'm gonna do now really relates to why I'm

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:54.890
interested in life as a technology and how
that is applied in a design and specifically

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.670
architectural context. The examples I'm going
to use is a work that I've been doing around

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:06.370
the city events, which, as you know, is rather
an interesting and tempestuous relationship

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:16.270
with water. So essentially, I'm designing
living materials for the built environment.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.989
I'm gonna start with a quote, written in 1771,
that starts, "According to Mr. Blainville,

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.239
who usually is trustworthy, one can predict
that in less than a hundred years will Venice

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:33.099
be totally united with the rest of Italy and
you can walk dry-shod from Italy to the city."

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:46.209
What we're really bad at is predicting the
future and what we're really good at is somehow,

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:53.030
surviving it. According to scientists, life
was extinguished many times on early Earth,

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:02.120
before it finally established itself 4.5 billion
years ago. The Earth's environment is not

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:12.170
kind and for any structure on its surface
to persist requires a huge amount of energy.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:22.370
In nature, even mountains are moved. So, what
makes life so resilient? Well, the answer

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:33.160
is we don't exactly know, but it's embodied,
it's robust, it's flexible and it's able to

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:40.210
change with environmental fluctuations so
that it keeps its contingency at every moment

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:49.130
because when it doesn't, it no longer possesses
that special quality of life. Life has this

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:57.560
ability to persist, which is unlike any other
persistent structure on the Earth's surface.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:04.759
For example, the City of Venice, and I know
I'm personifying madly here, but this is to

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:10.289
get my point across. For Venice to persist
against the forces of nature, the environment,

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:17.150
the change in climate, it's standing there
in opposition to all this and it's had to

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:24.009
ally itself with the contemporary technologies
of the time, not because of its living properties.

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:30.400
So, Venice, when it was first established
as a city-state between the 12th, I'm sorry,

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:37.139
the 9th and the 12th century, was dependant
on agrarian technologies. Essentially, this

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:43.620
meant land drainage because of the resources
of the sea. And with the settlement and it

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:52.060
needed the construction of canals for transport
and the use of woodpiles to shore up the foundations

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:57.550
of the developing settlement. And these, of
course, form a large part of the city even

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:04.199
today. Now, with the advent of industrial
technologies, great wealth and power came

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:15.949
to Venice. And it came with a price. In order
for the Industrial Revolution to create opportunities

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:23.860
for growth and proliferation and wealth creation
for the population of Venice, and also the

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:32.130
surrounding countries with which Venice was
trading, required top down intensive energy

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:42.090
expensive processes that gave atomic precision
control over matter. And that had huge environmental

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:48.840
cost; one that Venice is still paying today.
This is an industrial park set just north

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:57.250
of Venice on the mainland, called Marghera.
I sometimes work in the laboratory there in

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:07.020
the rather tube shaped tower. It's situated
between an oil refinery and a ship building

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:14.130
yard. So, when you leave the lab at night,
one is confronted with Tunis that are set

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:20.319
alight with toxic gases and the impression
of buildings that are moving as these ocean

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:28.860
liners are being assembled and constructed
on moving frameworks; it's very, very surreal.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:35.360
So then, is it any wonder that environmentalists
are protesting wildly about the proposition

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:42.500
of the Moses Project. Here's some graffiti
on one of the walls on a house in Venice,

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:50.680
protesting about the Moses Gates, the 78 mechanical
gates that are set to be installed in the

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:58.210
lagoon of Venice and rather like the Danish
king, Kanut, are there to drive back the tides,

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:07.731
because the aqua alta, very much like the
shoreline environment, is not kind. As you

00:08:07.731 --> 00:08:13.220
walk around the city, you start to see the
damage that the sea water, and particularly

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:19.930
the salt, ravages on the brickwork. You actually
start seeing the very material substances

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:26.770
within the city of Venice, the very fabric
of being digested away by the giant stomach

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:31.699
of the elements and the lagoon substances.
You can see effervescence here; quite liberally,

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:39.360
it's like the icing that's been dusted over
the walls. You can also see how very much

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:46.029
the marble and even the concrete that's been
stuffed in the holes in the brickwork is suffering

00:08:46.029 --> 00:08:54.250
as the city fabric tries to retain integrity
at this very destructive interface. And you

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:59.261
see all kinds of architectural desperation
as you walk along the city. Here, you see

00:08:59.261 --> 00:09:07.640
lion-like claw marks in the fabric of the
marble. And you also see odd bits of concrete

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:13.769
pasted in these holes that can take the fist,
the size of a fist, like someone's fired cannonballs

00:09:13.769 --> 00:09:20.970
into the brickwork. And you'll see them also
filled with rubble and sand and rubbish and

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:29.290
even chewing gum. But there is hope. In the
oddest place, perhaps, in a public garden

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:36.800
to the east of Venice, is an oak tree. No
ordinary oak tree, this is a very special

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:44.240
oak tree. It's at the center of a very special
building, The Canadian Pavilion, which was

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:51.290
constructed by Enrico Peresutti. Now, the
oak tree is special because it stands right

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:56.170
in the middle of this building, which is wrapped
around it, according to the shell of a nautilus,

00:09:56.170 --> 00:10:03.040
which is a mollusk, a squid-like mollusk that
has this banded structure. And under the natural

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:10.240
canopy is another canopy, an artificial canopy,
a cybernetic canopy, constructed by architect

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:16.031
Phillip Beasley with his collaborator, Rob
Gorbet. And the golden fruits that you see

00:10:16.031 --> 00:10:19.980
within that canopy are fruits of my own enterprise,
some special chemical fruits, which I'll talk

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:29.810
to you about in a minute. But this is the
Hylozoic Ground Project. Essentially, it fills

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:37.040
the entire building and this cybernetic forest
literally responds to fluctuations within

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:43.860
the environment. The passage of air causes
the feather-like filters to flicker and shed

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:50.070
showers of dust into the atmosphere so you
can actually visualize the passage of the

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:56.089
air movement through the gallery space. Those
long tube-like structures in the center of

00:10:56.089 --> 00:11:04.440
the gallery are actually swallowing tubes.
And what they do is they extend and contract

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:10.399
with hydraulics that are connected to the
cybernetic sensory systems, distributed throughout

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:14.720
this forest of senses and affecters. Also,
under investigation, of course, is the presence

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:21.790
of people and these swallowing tubes actually
are fitted with hairy tongues and you approach

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:26.270
them, the senses detect your presence and
they raise their hairy tongue-like structures

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:32.519
up to lick and tickle you. There were also
artificial crickets, which are those grape-like

00:11:32.519 --> 00:11:38.541
structures which are just to one side, above
the light structure that you can see to the

00:11:38.541 --> 00:11:45.860
left of the swallowing tubes. And they actually
scratch against each other and they make this

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:55.370
sound that's a bit like a cicada. So, in this
rich, synthetic ecology, are the fruits. Now,

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:59.930
this is one type of fruit. There are many
types of fruit and this one is a self-evolving

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:08.460
chemistry based on the properties of inorganic
substances, impregnated into a gel-like matrix.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:15.250
And this is called the Liesegang reaction.
It's a precipitation diffusion reaction, which

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:23.339
is a load of jargon, but essentially what
it is; it's an embodied form of fractal reductions.

00:12:23.339 --> 00:12:31.630
These chemistries gradually distribute themselves
through space and time and form a very elaborate

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:37.440
pattern structures that have been driven by
the forces of gravity and fueled by their

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:44.020
chemical interactions in which they're contextualized.
But this is the particular fruit that I want

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:49.889
you to have a look at. As you can see, there's
some opacities within its structure. And of

00:12:49.889 --> 00:12:55.540
course this is all fueled by the, and speeded
up by the LEDs that are placed underneath,

00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:02.480
under these fruits. And as we go closer, we
can actually see it's created of two layers

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:09.020
of oil. Within them are cell-like structures
that are highly colored. In fact, those colors

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:16.480
are there as indicators to show the public
that something is happening. And something's

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.550
happening at a very, very, very slow rate,
because actually, I've have to slow this all

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:25.300
down. Because believe it or not, and this
is one that's been shown by its reaction or

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:31.579
its response to the LED, cause believe it
or not, this is actually a very rapid process.

00:13:31.579 --> 00:13:36.290
So, here is a film taken by my chemistry supervisor,
Martin Hanczyc, who actually invented this

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:41.899
technology. It's called a dynamic oil and
water droplet system. What you're going to

00:13:41.899 --> 00:13:48.480
see is a qualitively new kind of technology
that's been called living technology. What's

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:56.740
new about it is that it's inherently complex.
It is not controlled by push button technology.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:04.120
It does not respond according to the same
laws of operation that we've been accustomed

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:10.360
to over the 19th and 20th century, with mechanical,
digital technologies. Essentially, this simple

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:20.620
oil droplet in a medium of water, a little
bit of soap, and a lot of wriggling is a complete

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:27.529
technology. You can't take, you can't break
it up into components. It exists as a whole

00:14:27.529 --> 00:14:34.360
from its essence; from the time of its birth.
What I find really amazing about this particular

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:39.830
sequence is that for me, this is not only
technologically a birthing process, but I

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:49.350
think also metaphorically it is heralding
a new age in computation. This is a form of

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:56.500
material computation, in which the material
itself is actually able to make decisions

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:02.660
and take actions depending on its environmental
context. So there are two ways of programming

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:10.600
this agent. One can either program it according
to its environment, so it behaves in a life-like

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:16.050
way. It can move around its environment, as
you can see here. It can sense it, so it can

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:21.199
follow a great inter-, operates through a
primitive form of kinictaxis. It undergoes

00:15:21.199 --> 00:15:29.389
complex reactions, such as the shedding of
the skin, or even the production of a shell.

00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:33.199
Not only that, it likes other protocells,
so it doesn't just operate as a lone agent,

00:15:33.199 --> 00:15:38.279
but also in colonies. And in the video that
I've got installed here, you'll actually see

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:44.190
some of these populations' scaled-like phenomena,
which actually have not been described using

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:51.389
computational modeling. They are exhibiting,
in populations, phase-like phenomenon, so

00:15:51.389 --> 00:15:57.120
that it's almost like quorum sensing in bacteria,
if anybody knows what that is. It's essentially,

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:01.620
bacteria operate according to their own little
set of rules and then when they're working

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:04.709
in a population, they all start talking to
each other. And when there's a quorum present,

00:16:04.709 --> 00:16:10.230
whether it's six, whether it's eight, whether
its six thousand, suddenly there's a population

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:15.540
scale signal that is passed amongst these
primitive bacteria, actually some them very

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:22.550
sophisticated, too, and it causes a huge movement
of other bacteria towards this population.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:29.790
We just found something interesting, normally
food, and then it creates this mass scale

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:34.060
migration towards the signaling center. So,
when these bacteria have reached the quorum,

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:39.759
they're able to make a new product that they
don't make when they're less than a quorum.

00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:47.360
These protocells seem to be able to communicate
along those lines, even though they do not

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:52.850
possess any DNA. So, we can engineer them.
So we can either change their surroundings,

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:59.180
so they can follow different traces in the
environment, or we can actually load up the

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:04.940
body of the agents themselves with some chemical
information. And so, this is the final species

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:11.680
of fruit that I've created. And this is one
that can take carbon dioxide out of solution,

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:17.560
which is dissolved both from the Venice water
in which this agent has been placed and also

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:22.300
in the respiratory gases it breathes out by
the gallery visitors. And what you're seeing

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:27.930
is copper carbonate being dissolved in a halo-like
structure around the protocell that's worked

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:34.690
its way down to the bottom of the pear-shaped
flask in which it's being housed. So, what

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:38.800
could this be used for in an architectural
context? Well, I showed you some of the buildings

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:46.370
along the canal sites in Venice. Well, what
I've been able to do is to actually program

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:54.210
oil droplets using this chemistry to actually
create shell-like structures, made of carbonate,

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:59.620
which is like limestone, that bridge the gaps
between brick rubble. So, this is brick rubble

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:05.890
that was collected from a walk around the
city, I've scooped it up, put it into a Petri

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:11.460
dish, took it back to the lab, and then create
a paint-like substance, a watery paint. So,

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:16.160
this material, unlike the architecture around
New York, which dumps all its water onto the

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:21.570
street, wasting valuable resources, is actually
conducive to watery environments. So, you

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:28.990
can actually start seeing that these blob-like
structures are starting to produce milky deposits

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:35.720
as they repair the gaps between the brickwork,
but not only that, they actually create a

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:40.430
shell around the brickwork itself, which is
fixing carbon dioxide and also producing a

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:48.020
protective layer that delays, perhaps, the
corrosive effects of the highly saline and

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:56.250
corrosive environment in which these buildings
are situated. And really, if you keep applying

00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:05.310
this, this paint, then you build up a form
of carbon dioxide capture an accretion around

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:11.980
the wall substance itself. And so, literally,
with various paint applications, you can build

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:18.170
this artificial shell-like structure around
the masonry. Within the next ten years, certainly

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:25.450
maybe even within the next five, it is likely
that these agents will be able to reproduce.

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:33.330
Currently, I've seen it done on an ad hoc
basis, so essentially, what DNA seems to do

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:39.050
is to stack up the chances of cell division.
However, even without any DNA, these protocells

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:48.670
actually divide and they fuse. It's a random
process. So, one can wonder whether or not

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:54.620
this actually constitutes a form of synthetic
life, which is being created using a bottom

00:19:54.620 --> 00:20:00.980
up approach. So, it makes us wonder what it
is that we're thinking about when we're thinking

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:06.510
about life-like processes. Technically though,
this is not a life and this remains a living

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:13.400
technology. Really, really interestingly,
there are no more than about three or four

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:20.200
chemicals being used in this particular substance
here. Its fat, water, a bit of surfactant,

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:27.720
which like a soap just to break down the very
high pressures form surface tension around

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:33.650
the oil droplet because of the reaction between
oil and water. Of course, oil has this schizophrenic

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:42.280
relationship with water; it loves it on one
hand and hates it on the other hand. And any

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:51.140
disturbance in populations of oil molecules,
in relationship to a water interface, causes

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:59.801
great amount of movement and this actually
accounts for these physical phenomena that

00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:07.710
we see with these dynamic oil and water droplets.
So, what could we do with a system that's

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:14.460
able to accrete a little bit of carbon dioxide?
And same, this is not geoengineering scale;

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:21.420
literally this builds a crystalline layer
around it. And how could we use this in architectural,

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:24.250
or even a design device? Well, propositionally,
we've come up with an idea that may provide

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:28.010
a way that illustrates how living technology
is qualitively different to the industrial

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:31.550
and digital technologies that we currently
know. So, in contrast to the Moses Gates,

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:37.640
which propose to keep back the tide, what
we've decided was that the protocells could

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:42.230
actually be released into the lagoon and programmed
to move away from the light-filled canals,

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:49.310
where they'd make their way to the darkened
foundations of Venice, which, as you probably

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:55.700
know, are built upon woodpiles. On reaching
this low energy threshold, they can then produce

00:21:55.700 --> 00:22:03.950
their carbonate and create these little synthetic
shells around the woodpiles and gradually,

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:14.490
they accrete and form a reef-like structure
underneath the city. And so, the city of Venice

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:18.880
is currently standing on soft delta soils
with stilettos. By creating a form of accretion

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:24.510
underneath the city, we're changing those
stilettos into platform boots. And therefore,

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:30.990
we're attenuating the gradual sinking of the
city of Venice into the soft delta soils.

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:35.810
Obviously, Venice's problems and its relationship
with the environment is complex and certainly

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:42.790
accretion and the spreading of the point load
of the city is not going to be enough to solve

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:50.690
all its problems. But in some ways, it does
demonstrate how these living technologies

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:56.910
might actually engage with the environment
and create outcomes in a qualitavely different

00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:02.720
kind of way to the industrial and digital
technologies that we're used to. And this

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:08.850
is a future Venice scenario where the reef
has accreted underneath the city and, as you

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:13.180
can see by capillary action through evaporation,
it's starting to form this protective layer

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:21.550
around the city. And you can see under the
Rialto Bridge there that they're actually

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:26.920
rather beautiful stalactite structures, which
I'm sure tourists will be breaking off these

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:34.200
lovely souvenirs as they pass underneath them
in their gondolas. So, what else could these

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:40.260
kinds of technologies do in the built environment?
This is a drawing; a speculatively being able

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:47.730
to create carbon fixing surfaces on future
cities. We don't need to create new architectures.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:55.630
We could actually use this as a new form of
retrofitting, where we can create embodied

00:23:55.630 --> 00:24:04.930
energy, return the positive impact of architecture
or allow our architecture to impact positively

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:12.190
on environments, rather than negatively. We
could also use these surfaces to trap carbon

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:17.720
dioxide and use sunlight to create biofuels.
And we're actually working with the Cronin

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:22.450
Group at the University of Glasgow to do exactly
this. So, we're really, this gives rise to

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:29.930
the next generation of solar panels, which
don't produce electricity, but biofuels directly

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:37.090
from sunlight and atmospheric carbon dioxide.
What's also very neat about these technologies

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:42.800
is because they're based on the properties
of life, they're ubiquitous, which means that

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:49.810
every community, providing it can, providing
it has cooking ingredients of oil and water

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:56.100
and maybe some inorganic chemistry, could
actually engage in exploration of this technology.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:01.510
And ideally, we're not quite there with the
recipe yet, but what we'd like to do is actually

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:08.480
use mobile phones in developing countries
and SMS the recipes so that people can actually

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:15.040
make these materials for themselves and experiment
on them because, as I've demonstrated, they're

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:20.710
very environmentally contextualized. So, for
example, a protocell system made of exactly

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:27.450
the same ingredients is going to perform very
differently in Norway to an equatorial country.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:34.880
And it will also vary differently on levels
above the sea. And one of my ambitions is

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:39.890
to send some of this protocell technology
into space because I know that it's driven

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:46.550
by chemical and physical forces. And of course,
microgravity is going to change the performance

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:51.570
of these droplets. And I think this would
be very useful information for us when we're

00:25:51.570 --> 00:26:01.680
actually trying to design these on a larger
scale. What we're currently developing is

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:06.460
a manufacturing platform for these protocells.
We're working with people with 3D printing

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:14.120
expertise to literally create a birthing platform
through which our little protocells are released

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:21.640
into a watery tank, into their uterine environment,
and then we'd use 2D ink jet technology to

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:26.480
actually then give them specific chemistries.
And that way, we're going to actually be able

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:34.240
to quantify and be much more specific about
exactly how much chemistry is required in

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:38.150
a particular droplet of a particular size
in order to create a particular kind of outcome.

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:45.920
At the moment, all these experiments are done
by hand. So, I'm just, I'm-- yeah. I'll just

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:50.760
wind up now. So, essentially, I think really
from the perspective of living technology,

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:59.060
I think it's really relevant today. I think
in the context of architectural and environmental

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:04.630
uncertainty, what that value is is that they
can actually respond to one predictability

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:13.280
as a real-time event, rather than relying
on models in order to anticipate future events

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:20.060
that may or may not take place. And, in other
words, it responds to immediate changes in

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:30.120
the environment just like life does itself.
Thank you.

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.360
[applause]

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:37.550
Has anyone got any questions?

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:40.020
&gt;&gt;presenter: No.

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:49.930
&gt;&gt;Armstrong: I was-- there was a question,
there.

00:27:49.930 --> 00:28:06.020
&gt;&gt;Male member #1: I heard you using words
like "rapid process is random."

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.500
&gt;&gt;Armstrong: Mm-hmm.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:25.640
&gt;&gt;member #1: I was wondering what's the predictability
of they have hands, not feet? Cause it sounds,

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:36.890
I was wondering, would there be like a maintenance
issue or fallback boost that would be taken

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:40.910
into account once it gets going, what's the
[inaudible]?

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:47.930
&gt;&gt;Armstrong: I think it's a really good question
about control of the technology. Living systems,

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:57.240
I think, and the control of living systems,
I think is something that we're already familiar

00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:06.200
with. And the way I describe this is its really
like cooking, ok? You, my grandmother used

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:14.310
to make cakes, ok? If she had some eggs and
some butter and some sugar and some flour,

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:21.710
she was gonna make a cake. Now, whether she
put chocolate in there or rum and raisins

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:32.420
or whipped it up with her great, big forearms
that she could strangle geese with, each time

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:43.970
she make a cake, it was cake, but it had different
flavors. And it depended how hot the oven

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:51.370
was, whether there was a change in the atmospheric
pressure, all these complex factors came into

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:58.290
play when she was actually making cake. They
were always delicious and essentially, through

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:08.560
her art and her practice and her expertise
and her familiarity with working with materials,

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:14.580
she actually understood, intuitively, the
parameters. Now, this particular technology

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:22.610
is actually much less complex than making
a cake. So, my point is that the way that

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:37.000
we engage with it is based on the principles
of complexity, but that doesn't mean that

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.030
it's unknowable. What we can do is we have
a good idea by creating these systems through

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:45.130
which we're going to evaluate them much more
specifically; we create conditions in which

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:52.700
the probability of a particular outcome is
likely. We can never say 100% certain, but

00:30:52.700 --> 00:31:01.030
that doesn't mean that the technology itself
is out of control. Also, these are very dependent

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:06.770
on resources in their environment, so when
they run out of food, they just stop; they

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:14.330
go to sleep. One of the nice things about
the solar panels is that unlike green roofs,

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:20.970
say for example, which actually respire at
night, so when plants, they photosynthesize,

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:30.300
great, they fix carbon dioxide, but when the
lights go down, they're eating the same stuff

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:35.840
as we are and they're actually creating carbon
dioxide. So, a solar panel in the dark is

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:46.770
actually just gonna go to sleep and wait till
the sun rays come up again. It won't be using

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:54.370
any of the oils that it's been making during
the day when it wakes up again. So, I think,

00:31:54.370 --> 00:32:01.050
I think that the techniques of control are
much more like agrarian practices. Cooking,

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:10.270
this kind of stra-, dealing with animals,
herding cats, that kind of thing. Obviously,

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:15.080
some-some chemical relationships are gonna
be more awkward and tricky to get working

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:22.580
then others, but I think the risk is actually
the precarity of actually working, not in

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:34.660
the fact that it's actually gonna go mad and
take over the world and turn it into grey

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:41.630
goo. But obviously, nothing is 100% certain
within a system like this, however, this is

00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:57.460
something that we know and I think that, obviously,
one would do lots of field tests before doing

00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:06.130
a Venice-scale project. But I don't think
this is something that we've never come across

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:28.450
before and therefore, I feel fairly confident
that my grandmother's recipe never turned

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:35.480
a cake into a sausage roll and that this kind
of approach would never really create a degree

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:56.020
of surprise that was totally unmanageable.
And what's quite interesting in parts of the

00:33:56.020 --> 00:34:06.680
film that's on display is that there's a population-scale
event. Just watch for this, but it's about

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:17.590
two-thirds of the way through the film. What
you get is a home team of protocells that

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:24.100
are just building these long, stringy-like
structures. There are probably about ten of

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:31.340
them and they're all just minding their own
business, having a chat amongst each other,

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:38.380
wa-, you can see this little chemical bridges
forming between them and they're just gradually

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:52.090
creating these long tails. And over to the,
on the film its over to the right of the film,

00:34:52.090 --> 00:35:01.900
you get a few waiting protocells wondering
what's going on, but they're very social.

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:08.450
Just have a look there, but, and I'm personifying,
and I know this anthropomorphizing and I know

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:15.870
it's all wrong scientifically, but this is
the best way to describe it. So, home team,

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:23.990
away team, away team comes to check out home
team, there's some kind of scuffle. What's

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:31.740
going on? All of a sudden, they all part and
they shed these long plume-like structures

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:41.400
after them. I have no idea why or how that
happens. I know that it is based on principles

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:50.970
of physics and chemistry. I know that there's
some form of exchange between them because

00:35:50.970 --> 00:36:02.030
there was no information within these agents
to start with to actually, specifically ask

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:14.660
them to do that. So, I think with complex
technologies, we will actually get very interesting

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:25.710
phase changes that are extraordinary phenomena,
but not necessarily means that it's out of

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:35.080
control. I think it's more to do with the
capacity for surprise, but surprise within

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:48.560
a very predictable solution space. The lady
over there had a question.

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:56.600
&gt;&gt;Femalemember #2: I have one question that's
related to his, it's practically the same,

00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:01.570
but now that you've elaborated systematically
[inaudible ]. One of the things that strikes

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:04.641
me as you mentioned [inaudible] technology
might develop here.

00:37:04.641 --> 00:37:10.150
&gt;&gt;Armstrong: Oh. That will never have DNA?
No, that they'll be able to reproduce themselves.

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:16.030
Which is, yeah, which is, which is different.
In other words, it won't, they won't have

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:19.830
agents that are vectors to exchange with biological
systems.

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:25.340
&gt;&gt;member #2: For me, that's the reason that
I [inaudible]

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:31.960
&gt;&gt;Armstrong: Well, what's quite interesting
about them, though, is that they are very

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:37.770
alien. They, despite possessing an organic
body, they are actually quite alien to biological

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:42.130
systems. So, they are an alternative form
of biology. Lee Cronin describes it as an

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:44.350
artificial biology as opposed to a synthetic
biology, which is the modification of a known

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:53.730
biological system. So, they work in a qualitively
different way. Yes, I think they will have

00:37:53.730 --> 00:38:00.200
medical implications. So, for example, currently
one of the biggest killers today is heart

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:05.710
disease and arterial disease. What's really
neat about protocells is that they're little

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:11.610
slow-release capsules and if we put in them
an agent that can digest cholesterol, which

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:16.770
we can't remove through mechanical means,
which is the way that we scrape out arteries

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:22.230
at the moment, we can actually introduce these
agents into the heart, very specifically,

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:29.100
through radiographic control guided mechanisms,
so you can cardiac cath to the point of the

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:36.540
blockage or if you see a throwing up of the
artery. And they'll release these agents and

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:41.530
they will literally digest away the chewing
gum on the inside of your heart vessels, even

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:46.510
before you've had a heart attack. See, cause
we can digest out clots using streptokinase,

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:50.920
which is great. We can do that chemically.
But if you've actually got coronary artery

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:54.190
disease, then you literally have to create
a bypass or a mechanical, mechanical thing

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:57.690
through it and that's risk of destroying your
arteries. So, it, so essentially, we will

00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:00.360
use them inside the body, but in alien areas,
where biological systems have not been able

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:03.170
to create cure, so can you image no more heart
disease cause we're putting arterial deposits

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:06.410
into our bodies around about the age of 21.
So, you, it, we could manage to engineer these

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:08.910
so we can actually also whistle would call
them back. That would be the other thing.

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:14.260
Also means that people with kidney and liver
damage, we currently have a lot of problems

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:20.430
with treatments because they can't metabolize
or move drugs introduced into their bodies

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:26.170
through their urine systems, they can also
benefit from these kinds of things.

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:32.090
&gt;&gt;Female presenter: Ok, sorry to interrupt,
but we have to move to our second speaker.

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:37.010
We'll take the rest of the questions at the
end. So this, our second speaker--

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:38.010
[mic drops]

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:42.720
our second speaker tonight is Mitchell Joachim.
He's a leader in ecological design and urbanism.

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:48.030
He's a co-founder of Terreform ONE and Terrefuge
and he's an associate professor at the NYU.

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:51.890
And one bit of trivia I really liked is that
he has been chosen by Wired magazine in 2008

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:56.650
to be as one of the 15 people the next president
should listen to. So, let's listen.

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:58.930
[Mitchell and man speaking]

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:03.700
&gt;&gt;Mitchell: I run an organization in Brooklyn,
New York, called Terreform ONE. My co-founder,

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:09.340
Maria Aiolova, is here and I see some of our
students and some friends. So, you may be

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:15.900
familiar with the work, so this is going to,
I guess, be a description to those who haven't

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:22.860
seen it before and maybe slightly skeptical
of the work we do. And I'm certainly looking

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:25.230
forward to the part where Rachel and I can
have a conversation here, together with many

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:26.750
other minds because we've talked about what
it is that we do and the alliance that we

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:33.910
have and the kind of commonalities that we've
been working towards. And it seems to be very

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:36.480
extremely interesting, very exciting, but
a new field and we're not sure, exactly, what

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:45.620
that is just yet so maybe some of you can
chime in and let us know. So, the work at

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:52.510
Terreform ONE falls under these three metathemes,
which is the idea of the city, ecology and

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:55.990
mobility, which leads to a new theory of design,
which is ecotransology. Which is come from

00:40:55.990 --> 00:41:00.980
a long history, standing on the shoulders
of giants, previously, Buckminster Fuller

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:04.510
would be one of them, about looking holistically
at the design of a city, doing everything

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:10.980
we can, from the doorknob to the democracy,
all right? The designer thinks about all aspects

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:22.060
of the city. So, it's not limited to scale.
It's not limited to some kind of silo of design,

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:29.620
but thinking about design from all aspects
and fighting this thesis, or this current

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:37.060
crisis, of the climate change. So, here is
a drawing by one of my favorite artists; a

00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:42.350
curmudgeonly guy named R. Crumb, who's thinking
about the environment, in this case, in one

00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:48.530
particular drawing. And it sums it up quite
elegantly, I think. The first part about the

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:53.330
environmental debate, here, I've listed as
zero, is the idea that the world will end,

00:41:53.330 --> 00:42:00.690
all right? There's some feat of acid in the
ocean or acids in the sky or temperature changing,

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:06.970
etc., we're not gonna make it. And we usually
have some sort of an association of time,

00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:12.680
which is we've got about 20 years to fix the
problem or we all die. And, I think this has

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:22.260
been a big message in the sustainable movement.
And I'm not a supporter of the message, whatsoever.

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:28.490
I think the first thing you do if you tell
average Americans which, I'm sure no one in

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:34.320
this room would be considered an average American,
and I don't think any American would consider

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.150
themselves average, thus the problem.

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:37.150
[laughter]

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:41.280
But we start telling that we're gonna die
because of the energy we consume. The first

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:46.860
thing they're gonna do is leave the lights
on, use the air conditioner all day long just

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:55.760
for their cat and buy the biggest possible
cars so they can speed up and down to live

00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:06.170
life to its fullest before they die. Cause
they don't want to be like those other folks

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:10.800
who are very responsible. So, that's, I think
a big part of the American mindset and its

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:15.000
prompted by this theory of eschatology; the
apocalypse. So, I don't go there. The technological

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.850
fix and the ecotopic is something that we
do find our work falling in. It's somewhat

00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:22.630
of a merger between those two metathemes;
technological fix being through some silver

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:27.100
bullet, some act of geoengineering, right?
We will solve our problems. John F. Kennedy

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:32.220
said it best, "If man created problems, man
can solve problems." So, this is the kind

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:39.830
of, the science will save us idea, and with
policy backing it up, of course. And the ecotopic

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:46.400
is this return to the ways and traditions
of nature; a kind of vernacular. Learn from

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:53.650
nature and we can dwell again on the Earth
peaceably. So, I think that's great, but I

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:56.680
think we can't ignore 100 to 150 years of
industrial progress and technology. So, the

00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:02.920
work that we do, like I said, incorporates
everything about the city, and it's been done

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:09.990
before. So, here's a drawing. It's over 102
years old. It's King's Dream of New York by

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:15.210
Harry Pettit and this is where a designer
has holistically reconsidered the city. And

00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:20.700
this is a proposition about the future of
New York and here, you can see dirigibles

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:26.220
connecting into skyscraper ports, or docks,
on the terminus of skyscrapers, moving in

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:31.760
to circulatory cores bridged clusters of skyscrapers
and then below, you can see a cannonaded system

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:37.730
of mobility where pedestrians are on arcaded
walkways, horses and buggies, fast moving

00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:40.640
transportation, slow moving transportation
are all separated; designed holistically by

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:47.890
one designer. We do this, I guess professionally
as a non-profit at Terreform. Here is us on

00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:58.380
the cover of Popular Science last month. This
was a big deal for us; we were very happy.

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:06.030
We're not sure what semiotic pulse this is
sent out. If you read it on the blogsphere,

00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:12.660
there's all sorts of angry folks saying that
this can't possibly be the green city of the

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:19.260
future. And they start saying X, Y and Z and
there's consistent argument. And through one

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:25.600
image, it's very hard to communicate what
the future might be like. I think what's important

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:31.850
here is for them to talk about many of these
different technologies and ideas that are

00:45:31.850 --> 00:45:36.250
involved in this drawing and I'll unpack them
slowly, but the most important thing about

00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:42.260
this image is that we want the future, if
it happens, we want the future to be fabulous

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:48.280
and I think that's what we're trying to get
at. At some point, it's gotta, not only an

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:55.650
aesthetic driver, but it's gotta be a place
that we've always wanted to get to. And, of

00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:59.600
course, that's a collective mind, a collective
mindset. So, we do some real research. We

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:07.410
do some real numbers, we do the back of the
envelope equations, we make a lot of mistakes,

00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:13.580
we screw up a lot of experiments. I will show
you none of those mistakes here, but I'll

00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:21.080
show you the end results of some of that research.
Here is a drawing looking at the entire history

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:27.260
of, for instance, mobility in the city of
New York, and how that relates to ecology

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:34.090
and energy. So, you can see somewhere on this
chart, and I didn't bring a laser pointer,

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:40.600
so I guess we can use this one here, but you
can see somewhere at the end of the chart,

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:46.120
they were looking at vehicles that are networked,
vehicles that are human powered, soft vehicles,

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:53.120
vehicles that talk to one another, and stacking
vehicle systems, all right? So, at MIT, where

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:59.790
I did my doctoral research, we were charged
with designing a car of the future. Thought

00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:05.070
that was, well, a crappy idea because the
future eventually happen and they'll look

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:13.610
at our car ten years from now and it'll be
slightly anachronistic or laughable. So, we

00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:17.280
wanted to design technologies. There were
a lexicon of ideas that would fit into every

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:24.520
vehicle everywhere. So, here is an example
of a wheel. The wheel is the car. You add

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:33.850
three of them together, and you get that--
a three-wheeled vehicle. We have drive train

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:41.940
suspension, motoring, and a modicum of intelligence
in that particular wheel. Here's one of many

00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:47.320
iterations that we performed, looking at taking
those wheels and applying it to various kinds

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:52.680
of structural systems, canopy systems and
network systems. So, here we have what we

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:56.680
call, something called the city car. It is
a stackable car, it is a shared ownership

00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:03.570
model so you don't own it; you buy into it
like the utility or zip car. The frame articulates,

00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:07.610
or stands up, reducing its footprint by 33
percent. The next car comes in and it interlocks

00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:11.950
with that vehicle, all right? And you can
stack about 330 of these on a New York City

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:17.330
block, as opposed to 34 SUVs. It's a facebook
on wheels, it's a drive by wire technology,

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:22.820
there's no mechanical linkages. You can take
the middle car if you so desire it because

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:25.900
the stack can part in the center if you need
it. And it doesn't have any information, like

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:29.570
the speed that you're going in. It just likes
to find out where your friends are, you tell

00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:35.140
it and that's where you wanna go and off it
goes. And it solves what we call the last

00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:38.940
five kilometer problem. Here's rethinking
the skin of these vehicles, making them soft

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:43.340
and sending out a message, something about
maybe if you're in Boston, the best thing

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:48.630
you can do is have a car that says, "The Yankees
rock," and I'm sure that would certainly bring

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:54.369
a lot of friends on the street, but you could
give a social-like posture to your vehicle.

00:48:54.369 --> 00:49:00.220
And a kind of city of these soft-like cars
moving around. And we have over, or I did

00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:04.260
at least over 40-something variations. Here,
in those soft shells with air quilt technology,

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:09.450
you can have an aperture that traces the drivers
viewpoint, creating a kind of hole, or the

00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:16.670
entire car could be naked and you can have
a visor that tracks the sun, in this case.

00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:24.430
Or here, you can add just a simple armature
to these wheels and the car can go vertically,

00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:31.380
or spin on a dime. So, now we're designing
cars to fit cities, not the 20th century designed

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:35.820
around the car, but forms of mobility to fit
specific context. In this case, the city.

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:43.490
And it can enter the z-axis and I'll show
that. And that they'd be cluster of these

00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:48.830
smart, soft, intelligent cars. Today, a vehicle
is a shiny, precious metal box; don't touch

00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:56.490
me, don't look at me when I'm driving in them,
certainly don't get too close cause I'll get

00:49:56.490 --> 00:50:02.020
scared. It's the opposite form of mobility.
This is called gentle congestion. The idea

00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:09.360
is it's ok to rub up against the person next
to you, say "Chow," and continue on your way,

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:15.400
all right? And here's how you phase them in
the city so the red vehicles are the hard

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:20.730
Hummers and the blue are eventually these
series of translating soft cars, that are

00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:26.150
intelligent, that move in a flock and communicate
to one another, so when they find one of these

00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:31.960
Hummers on the road, they cluster around it
and move it off to the side while these intelligent

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:34.520
cars take over the road.

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:35.520
[laughter]

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:40.680
Here's Omni Bub. This one is using soy-based
plastics as its solution for its canopy. And

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:44.660
here they are, separating passenger conditions
from freight conditions; going vertically

00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:50.740
up a building. Here you can see in the cluster,
connecting to the skyscraper cores and connecting

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:58.480
office space to office space. We also wanted
to make a car that you could eat; an edible

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:03.970
car. And we thought, "Wow. Great idea. Finally
something original." No, much to my chagrin,

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:10.640
the research that I found out, Henry Ford
did it. He produced a vehicle that was made

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:17.350
out of soy-based plastics, grown in an experimental
lab. He wanted to merge America's grand agricultural

00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:24.480
economy with its automobile economy. And here
he is, testing it out with an axe. Car grown

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:31.600
from soy. And it bounces off the vehicle,
right? The body of the car, for the press,

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:39.060
does not leave any kind of a scratch because
the coloration is impregnated in the material.

00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:45.980
It's pretty fantastic. So, we use all different
types of starch foams, air bladders, air quilts,

00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:52.450
to make the car soft as possible. In fact,
the first principle of our designs, which

00:51:52.450 --> 00:52:01.020
is something that you can do when you're in
academia, not necessarily working for a big,

00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:08.210
corporate place. Oh, I think there are many
corporate places that have different attitudes.

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:09.210
[laughter]

00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:15.869
Here, the idea would be, our first principle,
our first signal of human intention, would

00:52:15.869 --> 00:52:25.540
be that no one will ever die in a car accident
again. So, let's make cars go at a certain

00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:32.120
speed, right? Thirty miles or less. Let's
make every part of these materials that go

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:38.380
into them something that considers others
on the road. This is a vehicle. It's basically

00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:46.090
a big Nerf ball. That's not actually my term,
but Colbert came up with that and I'm gonna

00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:54.380
use it and I think its right, these are Nerf
cars. So, if they hit your sister, they tickle

00:52:54.380 --> 00:53:01.280
her; they don't kill her and that's the point.
And they have radically new systems applied

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:08.670
to them to think about breaking, to think
about proximity, to think about a grammar

00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:19.630
of moving in flux, all right? So, here is
what we call the contact patch that's just

00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:27.240
below where the wheel touches the road and
we have the, in this case, that creates friction

00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:35.060
to stop a car. This case, this vehicle, the
entire belly of the car hits the road, increasing

00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:41.610
that friction by ten thousand fold; so, a
big soft car just like a beach ball would

00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:50.170
fall on top of you if it doesn't completely
stop. They go flaccid, you, because they're

00:53:50.170 --> 00:53:55.280
mostly made out of pneumatics, or air-based
systems, you can stack them like pancakes,

00:53:55.280 --> 00:54:00.520
pull them out like a surfboard, with an attendant
you've got your car. Here, this vehicle, I

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:06.630
was thinking of, well, we had a new sponsor.
In this case, Reebok. They want to get into

00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:13.100
making the bodies for these very smart, omnidirectional
intelligent wheels, so we present the shoe

00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:19.470
car and we thought they would be pretty fantastic.
Here, it's got a, what's most noticeable is

00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:28.070
the zipper to get in and out of the vehicle.

00:54:28.070 --> 00:54:29.070
[chuckles]

00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:35.350
Thank you, Europe, here is a smart car. We
don't use them enough here. Eighty-six inches

00:54:35.350 --> 00:54:40.070
in length. Pretty fantastic, can park perpendicular
to the curb. Here's another version of our

00:54:40.070 --> 00:54:44.670
car. Same, same footprint, but remember, these
two wheels articulate and the frame stands

00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:48.400
up, so we're smaller than the smart car by
33 percent. You can park perpendicular to

00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:53.150
the curb and get off direct onto the sidewalk.
It considers the young and the old. There's

00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:59.340
a lip to get in and out of the vehicle. We
considered ingress and egress, a canopy to

00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:06.300
protect you from the elements and then fitting
them into the street and this no longer becomes

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:11.050
a talk about cars. At this point, this is
when we start thinking, "It's not about vehicles.

00:55:11.050 --> 00:55:15.730
In fact, vehicles are nowhere near as important
anymore. These are very big batteries on wheels."

00:55:15.730 --> 00:55:22.080
And if you have a certain critical mass of
them, you can absorb peak demands and distribute

00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:29.410
loads of electricity, or energy, in a new
kind of city grid. A city grid that's always

00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:32.830
updatable and adaptable. So, it's no longer
the antiquated system that we have now, but

00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:38.250
a new system that's alive and fully integrated
with something like mobility. So, this is

00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:44.570
here showing that most of it would hopefully
be culled from alternative sources, or renewable

00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:48.310
sources, eventually that would happen. And
thinking about not only the energy coming

00:55:48.310 --> 00:55:52.460
from the vehicles being completely renewable,
but other energy sources that we carry ourselves.

00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:56.610
Now, for moving around, these soft cars that
are powered ultimately by electricity, batteries,

00:55:56.610 --> 00:56:00.820
people will always say, "Well, what about
human health and the environment?" Well, we

00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:04.510
have other versions. In this case, it's the
New York City river gym. It is powered by

00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:11.260
the human buttocks. As you work out, that
power is harnessed, trickles down to the drive

00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:19.760
train, and you move on a loop between let's
say Brooklyn and Wall Street, from locker

00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:25.690
room to locker room. So, there are ways to
use human mobility for specific methods of

00:56:25.690 --> 00:56:32.000
transportation. And then here, another form.
And this was a fantasy of air-based transportation.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:38.020
This was thinking about the Thanksgiving Day
parade, which you guys must know about here

00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:46.730
in New York. As a kid, it was surely startling.
I was in love with Spiderman. Now, I see SpongeBob,

00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:54.110
etc., but you see about 50 people, sometimes
40 trying to hold down these balloons as they

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:58.250
march endlessly through the streets and then
it stops after a couple of hours. And I'm

00:56:58.250 --> 00:57:03.340
thinking, "Why stop it? Let's just keep it
going. All day long, every day, down 5th Avenue,

00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:07.950
down 10th, whatever you wanna do. Let's harness
that and use it as a transportation system."

00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:13.550
You hop on, you hop off, go five blocks, go
forty blocks in these gently tendrils with

00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:19.990
soft, ski lift like chairs and maybe an attendant
to help those folks who can't get on it, but

00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:25.310
constantly moving at about 13 miles an hour.
Another thing about these same air-based systems

00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:30.460
where they can also help support cleaning
the atmosphere. And this is looking at docking

00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:38.150
stations, etc., and this narrative goes on
for a long time. And then all of these combined

00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:46.250
into something that we call soft mobs and
smart dots. It, not only are all these things

00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:53.450
talking to one another and connected and radically
new, but we privileged the most important

00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:59.910
thing about a city and movement, which is
the pedestrian, the alpha position of a foot,

00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:06.290
it's the best interface for a city, and bicycling.
It's also a phenomenal invention; doesn't

00:58:06.290 --> 00:58:11.880
need much more. So, we privileged that and
we also give the road a bit of intelligence

00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:18.750
as well. In this case, the road would have
a RFID tag system. If it senses a little girl

00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:25.730
who drops her ball in the street, the road
can renegotiate traffic around that little

00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:31.230
girl and she can pick up her ball, but if
you know anything about kids, once they know

00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:38.140
that they can do that, they'll disrupt traffic
all the time. So, none of these systems are

00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:41.410
perfect, but we are certainly, folks, thinking
about them.

00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:42.410
[chuckles]

00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:46.980
And now the jet pack. The jet pack, and I
told this story and its absolutely true, I

00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:53.430
sat in a room with a bunch of folks like yourself
and some other folks who are experts in urbanism,

00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:57.730
and someone, someone said, "My kid brother
said, 'Look, you've studied urbanism your

00:58:57.730 --> 00:59:03.090
entire life and city planning. I think that's
great, but what happens when someone invents

00:59:03.090 --> 00:59:09.140
the jet pack? Right? Doesn't all that knowledge
and all the things you've done just simply

00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:15.050
go away?'" And my colleague, who was on the
panel, dismissed that and said, "Hahahaha.

00:59:15.050 --> 00:59:19.500
That's whatever, not gonna happen." And I
thought, "Well, of course it's going to happen.

00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:23.940
At some level, sometime it will eventually
happen. Who's thinking about it and what are

00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:28.360
the ramifications?" And certainly we can't
allow jet pack designers to design them. Why

00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:35.370
not architects and urbanists and scientists
think about what that jet pack should be?

00:59:35.370 --> 00:59:46.150
And, of course, we want it to be soft. We
want it to move in flocks and herds and be

00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:49.660
fairly intelligent, and there are jet packs
that you can buy today. Jetpack International,

00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:55.440
Martin Jetpacks, they're a hundred thousand
dollars, you can buy a jet pack, it runs on

00:59:55.440 --> 01:00:01.250
hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by a metal. It
can go for about 20 minutes maximum travelling,

01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:08.600
but you can get from Newark, New Jersey to
Wall Street in minutes, as opposed to almost

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:16.400
an hour in an SUV and you don't have to park.
And they move like this, like a paaa, they

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:21.880
float and another one can move and paaaa,
they can bounce into one another and paaaa,

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:22.980
and you land.

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:23.980
[laughter]

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:30.329
And you unzip yourself and out you go to work.
And we thought about let's think what kind

01:00:30.329 --> 01:00:38.390
of a society or what kind of a form of mobility,
what was this form of mobility do to the city?

01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:43.620
And thinking that way, we must need long range
systems, so here's a sky tub that would take

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:49.790
groups of them from let's say, Boston to New
York and then you attenuate; you break off

01:00:49.790 --> 01:00:56.140
to get to your local destination. And then
thinking about what Obama meant by the smart

01:00:56.140 --> 01:01:01.540
grid and what he could be doing that is the
100%, self-sufficient, radically green solution

01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:09.390
when it comes to this smart grid fantasy that
we all have for the United States of America?

01:01:09.390 --> 01:01:17.130
So, we start thinking about what's the problem
with the grid in the first place? Well, that's

01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:23.060
what you see, I think, on your left, which
is sprawl. Sprawl deals with going into green

01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:28.150
fields, spreading issues of energy, waste,
food, water, etc., and rethinking sprawl into

01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:34.150
a linear urban model and how we could use
that linear urban model, retool essentially,

01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:40.930
the suburbs and put them on our existing pieces
of infrastructure; our existing arteries of

01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:50.930
mobility. Use them and fit them out with waste,
food, water, energy, data, etc., and this

01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:59.270
would be the smart grid or radical smart grid
where populations are connected to our arteries

01:01:59.270 --> 01:02:04.650
of mobility, all right? So, I don't care how
people move in this particular kind of fashion.

01:02:04.650 --> 01:02:11.200
We are actually rebranding white trash, because
with the trailer is a phenomenal way to live,

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:18.650
especially if you look at the lifecycle analysis,
it's radically green. So, here you would see

01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:25.420
a series of trailers or combines moving, or
any way you want to get your house moving

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:31.119
and here is geothermal wind, photovoltaic
areas for food, data, high-speed transportation,

01:02:31.119 --> 01:02:36.390
and you move from city core to city core.
You're always within a 45 minute loop and

01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:43.200
you get the suburbs moving and moving and
moving. And the idea here is actually not

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:49.619
novel, either. I had Margaret Crawford, head
of Theory at Harvard tell me at dinner that

01:02:49.619 --> 01:02:54.500
she's actually seen this before. It's actually
been a serious proposal in 1917, the Soviets,

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:57.680
the disurbanists, decided that they wanted
to do the exact same thing. Their populations,

01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:02.099
outside of the peri-urban condition, needed
to be constantly moving, constantly mobile.

01:03:02.099 --> 01:03:06.250
The reason for that is they wanted to avoid
nuclear holocaust. So, they wanted to keep

01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:10.130
those populations going. They didn't do it
for reasons of the environment. So, this has

01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:16.530
been a proposition that's been around. To
pimp your house out like this with some kind

01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:22.930
of wheels, cost about one-fourth the price
of your home. So, for about a 400 thousand

01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:29.070
dollar home, another hundred thousand you
can get it moving in any kind of fashion and

01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:40.800
that's showing the suburbs leaving, and we
built these just giant models that express

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:44.810
this form of movement. We call this project
Homeway: The Great Suburban Exodus, and here

01:03:44.810 --> 01:03:55.300
we move from the linear suburb model to a
city core and you can see this kind of thing

01:03:55.300 --> 01:04:02.540
happening here, again, with areas that are
meant to be fit out for density and intensity

01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:12.000
and energy, food, etc., places to rest for
a few months. So, if you like Florida, you

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:19.380
hang out there. You get bored of Miami because
there's maybe not too many libraries and too

01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:23.080
many bathing suits, you go to New York.

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:24.080
[laughter]

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:31.020
And here you are moving in these homes along
these streams. This would be an example of

01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:38.109
a house party, so if you don't like your neighbor,
you can confront him for just a couple of

01:04:38.109 --> 01:04:40.340
days, have a party then slowly drive away.

01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:41.340
[laughter]

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:45.750
And then another project that's also has been
around. This was called the Fab Tree Hab.

01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:51.990
This is also thinking radically about how
we can be completely green. This is looking

01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:58.800
at a technology that's 2500 years old. It
is called pleaching, its grafting trees together.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:07.090
Actually, woody plants because you don't have
to do it to tree scale. You can use vines

01:05:07.090 --> 01:05:14.080
and other matter that grows quicker, and I'll
talk about that in a second. But essentially,

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:21.420
the trees are grafted whether it's the same
species or interspecies, into one contiguous,

01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:27.109
vascular system. And this is our contribution
to this is we use computer geometry to make

01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:32.530
scaffolding, weave the plants through it while
they're wet or while they're root taps, and

01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:38.790
we gently guide them into a very specific
shape; a shape that's meant for dwelling.

01:05:38.790 --> 01:05:45.240
Then they're in-filled with horsehair or cob
or something, or clay. And you make a kind

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:52.070
of home. We have been experimenting with this,
off and on, since 2002. Here's one version

01:05:52.070 --> 01:05:58.040
on the roof in Brooklyn, looking at willows,
looking at issues of infestation from insects,

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:05.869
lack of solar income, capillary activity and
water, etc. And this would be a kind of fit-out

01:06:05.869 --> 01:06:14.020
of one of the entire homes. It doesn't have
to be in a shape; it can be in any shape.

01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:22.530
But this is a home that is the landscape.
It is fitted into the metabolism of its local

01:06:22.530 --> 01:06:27.740
environment. It is a contributor to our atmosphere,
not something that takes away, not a compromise,

01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:33.970
not a zero model, right? I'm not big on zero
impact things. It's kind of like Switzerland.

01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:37.810
It doesn't do good or bad, it's just kind
of there.

01:06:37.810 --> 01:06:38.810
[laughter]

01:06:38.810 --> 01:06:41.310
Any Swiss people here? Yeah, all right, well.

01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:42.310
[laughter]

01:06:42.310 --> 01:06:45.990
This is not a neutral model. This is a positive
ecological model. It is responsible and accountable

01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:52.770
for 100 years of industrial pollution and
it scrubs and cleans the air. That's the point.

01:06:52.770 --> 01:06:58.480
You can pre-grow a village of these homes,
within seven to ten years. And I think that's

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:03.349
fantastic. And that's been one of the criticisms.
You actually, there's plants that are available

01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:10.040
now, and trees. A company called ArborGen
in Wisconsin who can give us trees that will

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:17.869
grow 80 feet in a year. This is interesting,
but I'm not sure in the, about doing that,

01:07:17.869 --> 01:07:21.470
especially in practice. We use the precautionary
principle in science. We don't wanna release

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:26.640
genetically modified trees into the environment;
we think we can do it with a piece of nature

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:33.619
as it is, as it works just fine. Guide it
and shape it and that's it. It takes seven

01:07:33.619 --> 01:07:41.040
to ten years. And people complain, "I don't
wanna wait that long for a house." Well, I'd

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:49.640
say, "You wait 12 years for a bottle of scotch?
I think we can wait seven years for a home."

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:50.640
[laughter]

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:57.420
So, here's one of our, well, enough of the
vegetable home. We have been working in, in

01:07:57.420 --> 01:08:06.590
a completely different home, which is an experiment
in a series of questions. And this is where

01:08:06.590 --> 01:08:13.810
we, just like Rachel, have been taking on
biology as a much deeper topic in architecture

01:08:13.810 --> 01:08:22.630
and design. This is actually not a photo of
the entire lab; the lab is tripled in size

01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:29.270
now. There are seven biologists, Do-It-Yourself
Biology New York, GenSpace and Dr. Alva Medvedic,

01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:34.990
who is over here leading this, we decided
to experiment with cells, molecular cell biology,

01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:40.200
and work on creating new geometries for industrial
design uses. In this case, you can imagine

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:43.609
making leather belts or leather shoes from
cells that you print, where no creature is

01:08:43.609 --> 01:08:47.650
harmed, no sentient being is hurt. It's a
victimless industrial design procedure. One

01:08:47.650 --> 01:08:51.880
way to do it is modified ink jet printers,
printing a geometry from the computer clumps

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:57.420
of cells, and form shapes that you fold up
around a polyglycaic acid scaffolds, here,

01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:01.839
Princeton's forming a bladder. This has been
around in regenerative medicine since 2001.

01:09:01.839 --> 01:09:07.359
This is essentially for folks who've got cancer
and you replace their bladder with this particular

01:09:07.359 --> 01:09:11.960
element. You can replace esophagi, cartilage
in knees, etc. You can also use keratin cells,

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:16.380
like fingernails and all different types of
materials to make other things. When we heard

01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:20.620
we could control geometry and make shapes,
we went for it. We started a proposition of

01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:27.069
doing it at the house scale. Performing acts
of synthetic biology at this scale has not

01:09:27.069 --> 01:09:31.350
been done before, and we were looking at the
limitations of our equipment producing a grammar

01:09:31.350 --> 01:09:38.640
for dealing with those limitations, and making
a home that would be grown out of meat cells,

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:41.590
or in this case, pig cells.

01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:42.590
[laughter]

01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:49.180
So, this is what you'd see; a typical stud
wall in any home in America and then our meat

01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:54.540
house proposition, which is a very different
kind of tectonic solution. Here, looking at

01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:59.260
fatty cells as insulation, cilia for wind
loads and we, I think, we've known this before,

01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:07.070
but sphincter muscles for doors and windows.
Felt that seems to be the best possible solution

01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:11.970
if we're gonna make a house of meat. And yes,
it would cleaned and we'd bleach the door,

01:10:11.970 --> 01:10:14.489
I guess, before you get in.

01:10:14.489 --> 01:10:15.489
[laughter]

01:10:15.489 --> 01:10:22.360
And it's, this is one possible shape. It could
be any shape, making it a Victorian or a English

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:32.210
Tudor would just be wrong, so this thing that
seemed to make a spectacle of the anus entryways

01:10:32.210 --> 01:10:39.890
and windows; we're all for it. And this is
the version that we have for the lab. It is

01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:44.910
essentially, if you think of the cost of doing
something like this from regenerative medicine,

01:10:44.910 --> 01:11:15.980
you can't keep it alive, you're producing,
printing pig cells out of, into a specific

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:33.261
geometry and then you saturate them in nitrates
and sulfates and preservatives, cause you

01:11:33.261 --> 01:11:40.390
can't keep it alive. It has no immunological
system, it has no skeletal system, it has

01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:47.870
no kind of a blood vessels to keep it healthy.
As soon as it, that it's exposed to the atmosphere,

01:11:47.870 --> 01:12:00.460
it dies. So, we wanted it to be constantly
preserved just like beef jerky and it's very

01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:11.260
expensive to do something like that and we're
very happy with what we got. It's been alive

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:24.590
for, I guess, three were dead for about three
years; it hasn't rotted. It's like a Twinkie,

01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:26.211
it's got a--

01:12:26.211 --> 01:12:27.211
[laughter]

01:12:27.211 --> 01:12:31.989
shelf-life forever. And we know about the
issues that it brings up. The point is experimentation.

01:12:31.989 --> 01:12:47.360
The point is to find some questions and attack
them; look for more of those answers. So,

01:12:47.360 --> 01:13:20.420
we had a big show in Prague and we put the
meat house in front of the cathedral so religion,

01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:25.280
you could confront this monster. And then
finally a thing about cities and city scale.

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:29.680
This is something my daughter, is completely
in love with this robot, the most affable

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:33.850
robot on Earth. He's a nonstop nebacunezzar,
piling trash all day long, to these specific

01:13:33.850 --> 01:13:37.660
shapes, throughout the same thing; automate
a puzzle-fitting system for waste. Instead

01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:41.930
of cells, it would be waste bay systems. So,
we looked at the city of New York. Again,

01:13:41.930 --> 01:13:48.590
more research. Here, going from 1613 when
Indians were around, zero tons of trash per

01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:56.420
day, at least that we know of, to today, 36
thousand tons of trash a day produced in the

01:13:56.420 --> 01:14:06.640
city of New York. If I was an alien race peering
down at Earth with some kind of telescope,

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:10.670
I would think that the city, especially New
York, was invented to make waste. That's what

01:14:10.670 --> 01:14:17.300
we do. So, we're looking at this as a kind
of a resource; waste as a resource, waste

01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:20.469
as a nutrient, to be automated and controlled
to produce new architecture, new civic spaces,

01:14:20.469 --> 01:14:24.480
new ways of thinking about the city. Here's
a chart of the research. You can't possibly

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:30.200
unpack all of that very quickly, but we've
looked at the policies that have been in place

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:33.730
from ocean dumping to McDonald's stopping
hamburger boxes, or Styrofoam clamshells.

01:14:33.730 --> 01:14:37.190
And looking at off the shelf technologies,
they are basically just like Wall-E. These

01:14:37.190 --> 01:14:40.560
are bale makers, or crushers that can take
all sorts of things from plastics to cardboard,

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:45.860
and make them into dumb boxes. We're thinking
modify their jaws ever so slightly, make them

01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:48.680
into puzzle fitting shapes that can produce
archways or corbelled domes new kinds of architecture;

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:52.010
puzzle fitting bricks. Kind of a Legos made
from waste. And here's a drawing that, I think,

01:14:52.010 --> 01:14:57.050
tries to explain, or show visually, to the
everyday American the amount of waste we produce

01:14:57.050 --> 01:15:07.719
in an hour in the city of New York. It's more
than the Statue of Liberty. This is the amount

01:15:07.719 --> 01:15:13.920
of compacted waste in one hour in the city
of New York. I did a model for the MoMA, also,

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:18.860
I, showing the same thing. And thinking about
separating the uses of that waste from here,

01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:23.920
plastics or clear based waste, can be used
for fenestration. Organic matter can be used

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:28.550
as temporary scaffolds to hold up the inorganic
matter and then it rots away. And here we'll

01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:34.710
be mining it with all sorts of processes and
then looking at doing an entire skyscraper

01:15:34.710 --> 01:15:39.810
made out of compacted waste. So, here's a
53-story tower that we call Oneday Tower,

01:15:39.810 --> 01:15:48.950
because it takes 24 hours of waste in the
city of New York, it makes a 53-story skyscraper.

01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:56.670
So, here we're showing the waste being delivered,
constantly produced. We've got all sorts of

01:15:56.670 --> 01:16:03.030
interesting things; vertical gardens, jet
pack ports, etc. And this is our kind of rapid

01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:09.710
refuse tower. And then this becomes a theory
of a new kind of city. A city that moves from

01:16:09.710 --> 01:16:16.040
the age of industrialization to the age of
consumerism to an age of recovery, where we

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:19.780
mine our waste and use it to retrofit our
buildings and then finally, a city where there

01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:26.500
is no waste. Waste has gone away, right? Gertrude
Stein said it best, "A way has gone away."

01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:30.020
If you wanna make a city where nothing is
tossed out, everything is constantly created

01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:37.740
and upcycled. So, you go to a city of industrialization
to a city of creation to creation to creation.

01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:43.950
And focusing that specifically on one area
in New York, the Lower East Side, or Lower

01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:50.950
East Side-a, and we're looking at many other
aspects besides waste, but all of these things

01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:55.290
confronting one another: waste, food, water,
energy. All thinking about the city in a finer

01:16:55.290 --> 01:17:02.270
kind of detail. We did this for The History
Channel. The base principle here, for this

01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:05.350
kind of a city, is over a period of time,
a hundred years, we'll reverse the figure

01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:09.380
ground and do something that we haven't actually
done, which is make green space. But not dumb

01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:14.040
and naive green space, productive green space.
Green space that deals with our energy needs,

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:20.070
deals with the things that we need to survive.
Make a city that's 100% self-sufficient within

01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:36.860
its political boundaries; a city with no inputs
or outputs, a city that's entirely self-contained.

01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:57.250
Here we are rethinking Kentucky Fried Chicken
in some type of vertical farm/space to sell

01:17:57.250 --> 01:18:21.010
food. And then the entire figure ground of
the city of Manhattan switched over. Where

01:18:21.010 --> 01:18:24.150
buildings used to be, replace them with productive
green spaces and where the streets are, we'd

01:18:24.150 --> 01:18:27.920
place them in with the buildings. Here, you
can see some of those details. And here's

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:28.920
a view of Central Park, in the future, dealing
with food and changing Central Park so that

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:29.920
we'd be able to feed the nine million people
that we cap the population in. And then looking

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:31.300
at the energy use of this particular city
and we'd move this over to Brooklyn and this

01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:32.300
is, and if you've probably heard this argument
before, if New York City was the 51st state

01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:34.200
in the United States, it would be the greenest,
most sustainable state in the entire continent.

01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:38.870
Period. All right? This is the amount of megawatts
per hour that the average person uses in the

01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:40.040
United States. It's 63 and in New York City
today, it's at 42, which is pretty great.

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:44.240
It's mostly due to the lack of petroleum and
moving around in cars and shared stack effects

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:49.310
in energy. If you heat your apartment, the
guy above you, Vinny, gets some of that heat

01:18:49.310 --> 01:18:53.510
and when he heats an apartment, etc. If you're
in the suburbs and you heat your building,

01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:58.750
it goes out into the atmosphere. So, we had
looked at the energy systems, the food systems,

01:18:58.750 --> 01:19:04.120
the waste systems and the mobility systems
that make up the city of Brooklyn and I guess

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:06.660
this is our last project these last few images
that I'll show you, I'll just describe what

01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:31.310
Brooklyn would look like in a future that
is 100 percent self-sufficient, where there

01:19:31.310 --> 01:20:05.500
are no inputs and outputs and it's a radically
green city inside there. So, you can see here

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:06.500
there are some statistics about making it
run completely on solar, for instance. That

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:15.660
would mean all of Staten Island and 18% of
the land area of Brooklyn would be all solar

01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:29.100
cells, running at 23% efficiency, we'd meet
the megawatt usages that we would need. All

01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:41.610
right? But that would absurd just to use solar
cells in that faction. There are three thousand

01:20:41.610 --> 01:20:59.320
acres of unshaded roof space in the city of
New York where we could fit those solar panel

01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:13.990
to. And we don't just have to use sun. We
certainly can use wind, geothermal, water-based

01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:24.090
energies to rethink of our city as a city
that runs on pure renewables. So, we're doing

01:21:24.090 --> 01:21:40.001
this to get, basically, I love Blumberg's
plan for a green New York. I think that it

01:21:40.001 --> 01:21:49.540
has some things that are impossible to argue
with in that plan, like everyone will be ten

01:21:49.540 --> 01:22:08.170
minutes from a park in about 50 years from
now in the city of New York. And I think that's,

01:22:08.170 --> 01:22:18.730
that's great, but what does it mean to be
radically green in the city of New York? What

01:22:18.730 --> 01:22:26.050
does it look like? What are the numbers? And
how do you fit it out and it must be kind

01:22:26.050 --> 01:22:27.050
of fabulous. So, I'm gonna end on this particular
view of us urbaneering Brooklyn to be completely

01:22:27.050 --> 01:22:28.050
green and I think it's, I'll take some questions.
So, thanks. Thanks very much. Thank you.

01:22:28.050 --> 01:22:29.050
[applause]

01:22:29.050 --> 01:22:30.050
[pause]

01:22:30.050 --> 01:22:31.050
&gt;&gt;presenter: Questions? Questions?

01:22:31.050 --> 01:22:32.050
&gt;&gt;Male member #3: I just had a little question.
Just, I don't want to seem to be picking,

01:22:32.050 --> 01:22:33.050
but just on that slide, just a couple back,
you said something about 22 megawatts per

01:22:33.050 --> 01:22:34.050
person per day?

01:22:34.050 --> 01:22:35.050
&gt;&gt;Mitchell: Per hour.

01:22:35.050 --> 01:22:36.050
&gt;&gt;member #3: Per hour?

01:22:36.050 --> 01:22:37.050
&gt;&gt;Mitchell: Yeah.

01:22:37.050 --> 01:22:38.050
&gt;&gt;member #3: When is that actually being used
for? That's a lot of energy.

01:22:38.050 --> 01:22:40.510
&gt;&gt;Mitchell: Yeah. That's taking into account
everything. So, that's commercial uses, that's

01:22:40.510 --> 01:22:44.719
industrial uses, that's, that's taking the
population of the entire United States and

01:22:44.719 --> 01:22:51.090
the amount of energy that we use and cutting
it up, exactly like that. And then capping

01:22:51.090 --> 01:23:00.800
the population of New York, knowing the entire
energy the city of New York uses, cutting

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:01.800
it up per population.

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:02.800
&gt;&gt;member #3: So there's probably some folks--

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:03.800
[speaking in background]

01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:04.800
It's like 300 million people.

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:05.800
&gt;&gt;Mitchell: Yeah.

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:06.800
&gt;&gt;member #3: And then the population of the
United States uses about thousands of terawatts?

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:07.800
&gt;&gt;member #4: We don't have that energy or
capacity.

01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:08.800
&gt;&gt;member #3: That kind of energy, it doesn't
fit. There's something wrong.

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:09.800
&gt;&gt;member #4: [inaudible]

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:10.800
&gt;&gt;Mitchell: Oh well. I'm pretty sure that's
the exact number. I don't, I can't--

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:11.800
&gt;&gt;member #3: It seems to be off by like, multiples
of magnitude.

01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:12.800
&gt;&gt;member #4: Its a few orders of magnitude--

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:13.800
&gt;&gt;member #3: How could you possibly get the
energy out from the sun?

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:14.800
&gt;&gt;Mitchell: Yeah, it's true. Maybe, maybe
it is per day. I don't know. I think that

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:15.800
that's pretty much the numbers that we got,
but now that I'm doing it, I mean, I'll refer

01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:16.800
back to the slide, but let's look here.

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:17.800
&gt;&gt;member #3: Maybe that one's like a future
prediction.

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:18.800
&gt;&gt;member #4: An order of magnitude--

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:19.800
&gt;&gt;Mitchell: No, no. It's, it's--

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:20.800
&gt;&gt;member #3: [inaudible]

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:21.800
&gt;&gt;Mitchell: we just did it this summer, so
it looks a little bright and I don't wanna

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:22.800
screw it up. Yeah, oh, per year. Sorry, ok,
that's my fault.

01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:23.800
&gt;&gt;member #3: Ahh.

01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:24.800
&gt;&gt;member #4: What does it say?

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:25.800
&gt;&gt;presenter, member #3, Rachel: Per year.

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:26.800
&gt;&gt;member #4: Oh, ok.

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:27.800
&gt;&gt;member #3: That's more like it.

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:28.800
[laughter]

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:29.800
&gt;&gt;Mitchell: Brain fart. It happens.

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:30.800
[laughter]

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:31.800
&gt;&gt;member #3: That's ok.

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:32.800
&gt;&gt;member #3 and #4: That's what we get.

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:33.800
&gt;&gt;Mitchell: Good. Good question. Thank you.

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:34.800
[laughter]

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:35.800
&gt;&gt;member #4: Didn't work, you're just taking
it.

01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:36.800
&gt;&gt;member #5: Is it because of the sky, or
[inaudible] that's actually implementing [inaudible]

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:37.800
permission--

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:38.800
&gt;&gt;Mitchell: Umm. Well, so, we certainly do
advise companies and help them on problems

01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:39.800
that they, if they've had difficult, difficulties
creating solutions for. We take on any particular

01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:40.800
subject. Between the group of us, it doesn't
really seem we have any limits per se. We

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:41.800
would take on, for instance, FedEx would have
a problem with parking tickets in the city

01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:42.800
of New York and they needed to deal with issues
with mobility, issues with urbanism, issues

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:43.800
with technology and they certainly have a
great staff working for them, but they needed

01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:44.800
somebody to figure out some answers on their
own. So, we looked at their problem, parking

01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:45.800
tickets in the city of New York, and thought,
"Well, why not add these FedEx trucks, hire

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:46.800
one or two more people on the truck and never
stop. Constantly keep them moving and never

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:47.800
make a left turn in the city of New York."
So, not only does it get more employees, but

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:48.800
it solves the problem in the simplest possible
way. And we don't always look for radically,

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:49.800
out of the box, kind of solutions. We've been
asked before from the Obama Administration,

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:50.800
"What can we do right now, right now, that's
an off the shelf technology, to deal with

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:51.800
the energy suck in the United States?" And
it's simple. Change the light bulbs. Go out

01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:52.800
and change the light bulbs. You can save 45%
of the energy usage. That doesn't mean people

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:53.800
do it. It's been known for years. There's
now policy about changing those light bulbs

01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:54.800
and I know there's some issues about mercury,
but they're not as bad as you think. The bottom

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:55.800
line is that why aren't American doing it?
Are they simply not excited about going out,

01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:56.800
changing some light bulbs? That might be it.
There's probably a whole host of other issues,

01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:57.800
but it's certainly available. We use ten thousand
lumens per square foot on a desk in an office.

01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:58.800
There's no reason for something like that.
So, a lot of the solutions we look towards,

01:23:58.800 --> 01:23:59.800
we actually go for the easy answer, maybe
the kind of hack answer if you wanna say it,

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:00.800
but those work. And some of the things that
we look at are about desire lines. Proppositions

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:01.800
or reification of the city, we'd like to see
in the near future that are based on technologies

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:02.800
that we find available today. I don't think,
more or less, anything that we've shown doesn't

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:03.800
exist in some fashion. I think it's the kind
of narrative that we find in science fiction

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:04.800
that we're actually in love with. Science
fiction used to be slightly pooh-poohed. I

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:05.800
think if you'd mentioned that before, people
would get psyched or upset, but if you look

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:06.800
at the history of science fiction, its contribution
to humanity is immense. You can go all the

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:07.800
way back to Jules Verne, right? Hundreds of
years ago, he was, he wrote a narrative, not

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:08.800
a promissory narrative, he didn't make any
promises, he just said, "Here's a narrative

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:09.800
about getting to the moon." And he got into
the entire culture of how that would happen.

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:10.800
And he imagined it would be a staged rocket
that would leave from Florida, that would

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:11.800
drop off elements, land on the moon, return
with a different capsule that would go through

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:12.800
the atmosphere and would land in the water.
And you can imagine a hundred years later,

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:13.800
the engineers at NASA, directed by Kennedy
to go to the moon. They said, "Well, what

01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:14.800
are some ideas?" They probably read Jules
Verne and said, "Let's see if this works out."

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:15.800
Did some numbers and started being more and
more convinced that that's the way to do it.

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:27.460
I think that that's, it stays in our hearts
and our minds and our imagination. The more

01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:44.070
popular it is, actually, the probably more
likely it is to find itself reaching fruition.

01:24:44.070 --> 01:25:20.010
That's also in telecommunications. As a kid
watching Star Trek, I never believed I would

01:25:20.010 --> 01:25:25.670
have a hand held computer that I can talk
to anyone in the world with. Well, actually,

01:25:25.670 --> 01:25:26.670
I sort of did believe that. So I wasn't so
surprised--

01:25:26.670 --> 01:25:27.670
[laughter]

01:25:27.670 --> 01:25:28.670
when we got them. So, so, some of the technologies
that we show, like the cars, which are off

01:25:28.670 --> 01:25:36.800
the shelf and readily available, it's a matter
of it being exciting and fabulous and leapfrogging

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:37.800
the previous technology. It's the first adopters
buy it, when they do, people see that its

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:38.800
cool, radical and different and the log jam
opens up and it just starts to flow and many

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:39.800
other people jump on board with these kinds
of things. I mean, Apple's a company that's

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:40.800
been very successful with that pattern. Do
you have a question, sir?

01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:41.800
&gt;&gt;presenter: We have to exit the space by
7:30, so for people who wanna look at the

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:42.800
exhibit, you have seven minutes.

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:43.800
[laughter]

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:44.800
So, you can pick, either ask questions or
look at the exhibit, but we have to be out.

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:45.800
&gt;&gt;Female member #6: Can I ask my question?

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:46.800
&gt;&gt;Mitchell: Yeah.

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:47.800
&gt;&gt;member #6: I'm wondering what happens to
a sense of history? It seems like culturally,

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:48.800
we're attached to things and like, your proposal
you preserve it hopefully and it seems like

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:49.800
in your proposition, it's destruction and
constructor of everything and in a green way,

01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:50.800
but like one is the destruction of the transformation
to the [inaudible] and what about the nostalgia

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:51.800
and the idea of memory and history that, culturally,
people have.

01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:52.800
&gt;&gt;Mitchell: Right. What I didn't have time
to say is that we do preserve a history of

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:53.800
architectural typology in anything that we're
changing. Historic preservation is essential.

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:54.800
And we do keep a lot of buildings. For instance,
in the Lower East Side project, if they're

01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:55.800
gonna be around in 300 years from now, their
structures are that robust, we keep them.

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:56.800
If it's something that was built in the 70s
and looks like it's gonna rot away tomorrow

01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:57.800
and is also a major energy polluter, we'll
take it down. So, we've got to do a kind of

01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:58.800
audit of what's gonna be worth preserving
and what's not gonna be worth preserving.

01:25:58.800 --> 01:25:59.800
A sense of history, I mean, is actually super
important. I think Rachel has achieved that

01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:00.800
in her work as well. I think that there's
no doubt that we have to keep it preserved

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:01.800
as long as possible. But, and that's something
that I have to communicate directly when I'm

01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:02.800
talking about it. It's just so much I can
say at the moment.

01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:03.800
&gt;&gt;member #7: I have a question for Rachel.
Do we have the mic anymore? You had mentioned

01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:04.800
protocells [inaudible]. And I was wondering
if you could elaborate on that? Is it a matter

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:05.800
of just conditions and ingredients?

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:06.800
&gt;&gt;Rachel: So, unpublished work, but essentially
you can produce fusion and fission of protocells

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:07.800
with really, really simple ingredients. In
fact, what I haven't shown you is some of

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:08.800
the work going on with another group of synthetic
agents, which is based on inorganic chemistry,

01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:09.800
so the team of the work, we've got the University
of Glasgow, the Cronin Group. I'm determined

01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:10.800
to get a Nobel Prize for creating the first
inorganic chemistry as a life form and essentially,

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:11.800
there are these species that NASA designed
from this, a bottom up set using lots of ingredients

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:12.800
to create different outcomes. But essentially,
because we're planning them to build them

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:13.800
up you can pretty much control, within the
realms of how far you can control a complex

01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:14.800
system that's very simple, whether or not
we can thread more of them. I mean, obviously,

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:15.800
the technologies are young. We can do it.
We can do it. At the moment, we're relying

01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:16.800
on issues of printing, 3D printing, 2D printing
in order to be the birthing agents because

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:17.800
we'll want to specifically have them in time
and space. Once we start getting the manufacturing

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:18.800
platform that we can then get data off, we'll
have a lot more information about exactly

01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:19.800
what we need to do to create them.

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:20.800
&gt;&gt;member #7: So then you can have a self-sustaining
colony?

01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:21.800
&gt;&gt;Rachel: You'd could be providing the nutrients
there, but also you can get colonies that

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:22.800
do different things, but connected in different
ways so that metabolism and waste products

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:23.800
of one becomes the food for the next, which
might stimulate growth or repair in another

01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:24.800
one, so at the moment a lot of synthetic biology
is following the principles of biology, or

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:25.800
biomimicry, is very strong there. So, other
groups working with these protocells are actually

01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:26.800
trying to take receptors from existing biological
cells and stick it into the membranes of these,

01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:27.800
well not the membranes but the [inaudible]
water droplet systems. So you will get biological

01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:28.800
synthetic hybrids and I mean that these agents
actually, I think, take off where nanotechnology

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:29.800
didn't quite get it. In other words, it's
got a matrix, and one of the things that I

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:30.800
would need, so it's got the software to communicate
across distance between elements that are

01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:31.800
part of the complex ecology. So, essentially,
the kinds of things that you want it to do

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:32.800
is to actually use the old system and put
nanostructures in there and see whether or

01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:33.800
not actually you get dynamic dialogues going
on between engineered nanostructures.

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:34.800
&gt;&gt;member #7: Great. But then--

01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:35.800
&gt;&gt;Rachel: Yes.

01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:36.800
&gt;&gt;member #7: As somebody else put it, you
responded that, I think, that somebody brought

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:37.800
the idea that if things get out of hand, say
you brought up there's no DNA--

01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:38.800
&gt;&gt;Rachel: Yeah, no genetics.

01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:39.800
&gt;&gt;member #7: But nevertheless though, one
can see that theoretically could have a situation

01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:40.800
where it gets out of hand because if, if the
environment changes and well, not only the

01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:41.800
environment, protocells change then their
demands on the environment and their change

01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:42.800
and your ability then to control them needs
to change in response to that. And everybody's

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:43.800
gotta keep up.

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:44.800
&gt;&gt;Mitchell: Test environment.

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:45.800
[Rachel laughs]

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:46.800
&gt;&gt;member #7: Unless I'm just not articulating
it right.

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:47.800
&gt;&gt;Rachel: No, I understand what you're saying--

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:48.800
&gt;&gt;member #7: Like you did say, this is proposed
to be a completely different form of life.

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:49.800
&gt;&gt;Rachel: Correct. And also it's wired to
be right at the origins, right at the origins

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:50.800
of life. So, a bit like early Earth, it's
probably going to be extinguished many, many,

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:51.800
many times before we actually get systems
that are integrated--

01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:52.800
&gt;&gt;member #7: Take home.

01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:53.800
&gt;&gt;Rachel: especially to yeah, to weather a
lot of environmental variation. Right now,

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:54.800
they've been incredibly unruly environments.

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:55.800
&gt;&gt;member #7: Or they could be just extremely
lucky.

01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:56.800
&gt;&gt;Rachel: They could be extremely lucky. So,
I mean, engineered and I think the key principle

01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:57.800
here is about design. So, finding the right
context for these to exist, actually is one

01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:58.800
of the things that we try to do quite early
on with choosing the site of Venice has been

01:26:58.800 --> 01:26:59.800
meaningful when you start articulating a possibility
before then kind of saying this is the technology,

01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:00.800
it helps to produce an agent that's disembodied,
that's alien and has these life-like properties;

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:01.800
it's immediately a scary proposition. So,
really think of it as being a material proposition

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:02.800
that can be designed. At the moment, the next
scale is gonna be really small, it's incredibly

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:03.800
fragile. It's gonna need considerations to,
and lots of monitoring the development in

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:04.800
order to get to the next stage. But we'll
get there and I think it does raise a form

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:05.800
of questions about control, about what we
think life is and about our relationship and

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:06.800
responsibility to the environment. I see a
neo [inaubile] coming back as opposed to this

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:07.800
idea that the inhabitants of the earth are
quite separate from everything else. I think

01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:08.800
that these technologies are actually start
