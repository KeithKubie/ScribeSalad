the introduction to each chapter is

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370
the introduction to each chapter is
 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.420
the introduction to each chapter is
basically a a narrative piece often

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430

personality but it could be more
theoretical than that and it should be

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850
theoretical than that and it should be
 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.050
theoretical than that and it should be
something like let's say 200 words long

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060
something like let's say 200 words long
 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.850

you pay for war now you do that and you

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:29.720
you pay for war now you do that and you
 

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:33.130
you pay for war now you do that and you
can go back to the pretty much the

then you probably go back before you can

but let's stick here with the ones that
are fought with the notion that the

so you would have an inflation this is

the price of the goods you were
exporting became more difficult for

would bring in a fewer of your products

would bring in a fewer of your products
 

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:17.060
would bring in a fewer of your products
and your wealthy people would buy you

modest inflation then it was the other
 

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:35.750
modest inflation then it was the other
way around and you you imported more

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760
way around and you you imported more
 

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.910
way around and you you imported more
than you exported then that would mean

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920
than you exported then that would mean
 

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:40.460
than you exported then that would mean
that you were losing gold and when you

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:40.470
that you were losing gold and when you
 

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:42.590
that you were losing gold and when you
lost gold the quantity of money that you

would go down and therefore you would

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:46.710
would go down and therefore you would
 

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:50.480
would go down and therefore you would
deflate the economy and everybody would

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:50.490
deflate the economy and everybody would
 

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:51.620
deflate the economy and everybody would
suffer from a certain amount of

austerity until things even out your
 

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:58.180
austerity until things even out your
prices go down making your goods more

00:41:58.180 --> 00:41:58.190
prices go down making your goods more
 

00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:01.130
prices go down making your goods more
more affordable in international trade

more affordable in international trade
 

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:04.790
more affordable in international trade
and therefore your trade balance comes

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800
and therefore your trade balance comes
 

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:07.640
and therefore your trade balance comes
back into equilibrium so the gold
