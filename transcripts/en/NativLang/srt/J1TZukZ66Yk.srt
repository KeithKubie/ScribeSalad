00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,950
Today to updates and to vote for you
first. I suggested it in the last video,

2
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:07,140
but I'm announcing it here. Yes,

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,200
we're going on an animated journey
through the history of writing.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,480
It'll be fun and honest to the concepts,

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,230
but it may take its share of historical
liberties to put you into the role of

6
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:17,070
the main character.

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,210
I'm hoping that the resulting videos will
be watchable back to back as a single

8
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:24,720
story. Tune in to see how
it all pans out. Second,

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,640
a conundrum for some of you.

10
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:31,080
The very first time we met was an
animated wonderment and then down the line

11
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:34,470
maybe that suggested older
videos with me lecturing at you.

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,950
Other people came in the other
way, looking for good information.

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,310
Dumping then got puzzled at me
wandering through a land of linguistic

14
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:42,144
curiosities.

15
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,650
This setting up of expectations in
marketing gets called a brand promise.

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,820
What I'm worried about is that this
disconnect leaves some of you disoriented.

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,710
It's like a broken brand promise.

18
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,030
I don't have a solution for this yet
other than making you aware of this change

19
00:00:57,031 --> 00:01:00,450
over time and refreshing old thumbnails
to make those old videos look more like

20
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:02,820
a backup library of
resources for us to draw on.

21
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,790
So it's a very matchmaker
that brings us together.

22
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,100
Also stacks me up against other channels,

23
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,130
partly based on how many of my
videos you watch in a single sitting.

24
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,520
This discontinuity in your viewing
experience can hurt me too.

25
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,180
Speaking of your viewing experience,

26
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:20,110
which day of the week would
you most like to see me?

27
00:01:20,111 --> 00:01:24,480
A blow new videos still Friday
or Tuesday or a different day?

28
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,450
Click to vote for your favorite
day and stick around for language.
