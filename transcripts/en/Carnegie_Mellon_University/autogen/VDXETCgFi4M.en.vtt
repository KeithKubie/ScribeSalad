coming in he's going to need some

01:16:25.150 --> 01:16:25.160
coming in he's going to need some
 

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:27.730
coming in he's going to need some
programming assistance and he seems like

01:16:27.730 --> 01:16:27.740
programming assistance and he seems like
 

01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:29.470
programming assistance and he seems like
he's gonna try and get in trouble so see

01:16:29.470 --> 01:16:29.480
he's gonna try and get in trouble so see
 

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:31.150
he's gonna try and get in trouble so see
if you can keep him from getting into

01:16:31.150 --> 01:16:31.160
if you can keep him from getting into
 

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:34.060
if you can keep him from getting into
much trouble and one of the things

01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:34.070
much trouble and one of the things
 

01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:36.070
much trouble and one of the things
that's Randy really wanted to do was to

01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.080
that's Randy really wanted to do was to
 

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:38.380
that's Randy really wanted to do was to
collect data on the Aladdin's magic

01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:38.390
collect data on the Aladdin's magic
 

01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:39.970
collect data on the Aladdin's magic
carpet mark one that had been installed

01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:39.980
carpet mark one that had been installed
 

01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:41.980
carpet mark one that had been installed
down in Disneyworld and this meant that

01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:41.990
down in Disneyworld and this meant that
 

01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:44.170
down in Disneyworld and this meant that
we had to it was an already running

01:16:44.170 --> 01:16:44.180
we had to it was an already running
 

01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:46.680
we had to it was an already running
attraction that had zero analytics on it

01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:46.690
attraction that had zero analytics on it
 

01:16:46.690 --> 01:16:50.230
attraction that had zero analytics on it
so I was tasked with writing an analytic

01:16:50.230 --> 01:16:50.240
so I was tasked with writing an analytic
 

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:52.180
so I was tasked with writing an analytic
system that we could integrate into it

01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:52.190
system that we could integrate into it
 

01:16:52.190 --> 01:16:54.460
system that we could integrate into it
so that we could collect huge amounts of

01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:54.470
so that we could collect huge amounts of
 

01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:55.810
so that we could collect huge amounts of
data which would be necessary for the

01:16:55.810 --> 01:16:55.820
data which would be necessary for the
 

01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:58.570
data which would be necessary for the
paper that he was talking about and I'd

01:16:58.570 --> 01:16:58.580
paper that he was talking about and I'd
 

01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:01.510
paper that he was talking about and I'd
been at this company like you know six

01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:01.520
been at this company like you know six
 

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:02.920
been at this company like you know six
weeks eight weeks something like that

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:02.930
weeks eight weeks something like that
 

01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:06.160
weeks eight weeks something like that
and I was terrified of going in trying

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:06.170
and I was terrified of going in trying
 

01:17:06.170 --> 01:17:07.750
and I was terrified of going in trying
to change this attraction then we might

01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:07.760
to change this attraction then we might
 

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:10.210
to change this attraction then we might
accidentally crash and break and really

01:17:10.210 --> 01:17:10.220
accidentally crash and break and really
 

01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:11.710
accidentally crash and break and really
could we collect this terabyte of data

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:11.720
could we collect this terabyte of data
 

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:14.830
could we collect this terabyte of data
and what's this going to work and and I

01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:14.840
and what's this going to work and and I
 

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:17.350
and what's this going to work and and I
was telling him I'm like Randy I I am

01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360
was telling him I'm like Randy I I am
 

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.900
was telling him I'm like Randy I I am
not at all sure that this is going to

01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:19.910
not at all sure that this is going to
 

01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:21.640
not at all sure that this is going to
work I'm not at all sure that I can I

01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:21.650
work I'm not at all sure that I can I
 

01:17:21.650 --> 01:17:24.130

can do this and he just looked at me and

01:17:24.130 --> 01:17:24.140
can do this and he just looked at me and
 

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:26.860
can do this and he just looked at me and
he said well you know you can do more

01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:26.870
he said well you know you can do more
 

01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:30.760
he said well you know you can do more
than you think and he was right we went

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:30.770
than you think and he was right we went
 

01:17:30.770 --> 01:17:32.410
than you think and he was right we went
down there we did it and it was very

01:17:32.410 --> 01:17:32.420
down there we did it and it was very
 

01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:34.330
down there we did it and it was very
tricky to integrate it while the thing

01:17:34.330 --> 01:17:34.340
tricky to integrate it while the thing
 

01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:35.940
tricky to integrate it while the thing
was running but we got it all working

01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:35.950
was running but we got it all working
 

01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:39.040
was running but we got it all working
and and it worked out and we collected

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:39.050
and and it worked out and we collected
 

01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:40.360
and and it worked out and we collected
this huge amount of data it made the

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:40.370
this huge amount of data it made the
 

01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:42.910
this huge amount of data it made the
collecting made the the paper possible I

01:17:42.910 --> 01:17:42.920
collecting made the the paper possible I
 

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:44.170
collecting made the the paper possible I
don't think that amount of date had ever

01:17:44.170 --> 01:17:44.180
don't think that amount of date had ever
 

01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:46.240
don't think that amount of date had ever
been collected on a virtual reality app

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:46.250
been collected on a virtual reality app
 

01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:48.280
been collected on a virtual reality app
up until that point because who else had

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:48.290
up until that point because who else had
 

01:17:48.290 --> 01:17:50.920
up until that point because who else had
a virtual reality app that was having I

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:50.930
a virtual reality app that was having I
 

01:17:50.930 --> 01:17:52.360

that's that that had worked out and the

01:18:40.570 --> 01:18:40.580
that's that that had worked out and the
 

01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:42.250
that's that that had worked out and the

same thing when I had an opportunity to
 

01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:44.980
same thing when I had an opportunity to
write that I was approached about

01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:44.990
write that I was approached about
 

01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:46.570
write that I was approached about
writing this book the art of game design

01:18:46.570 --> 01:18:46.580
writing this book the art of game design
 

01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:48.790

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:26.610
and I say you know what you can do more
than you think and it turns out they can

01:19:26.610 --> 01:19:26.620
than you think and it turns out they can
 

01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:29.370
than you think and it turns out they can
Thanks

01:19:29.370 --> 01:19:29.380
Thanks
 

01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:37.770
Thanks
[Applause]

01:19:37.770 --> 01:19:37.780
 

01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:39.879
so I thought I'd give you a little bit

01:19:39.879 --> 01:19:39.889
so I thought I'd give you a little bit
 

01:19:39.889 --> 01:19:42.160
so I thought I'd give you a little bit
of context about what we were thinking

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:42.170
of context about what we were thinking
 

01:19:42.170 --> 01:19:43.899
of context about what we were thinking
about at the time the last lecture was

01:19:43.899 --> 01:19:43.909
about at the time the last lecture was
 

01:19:43.909 --> 01:19:47.470
about at the time the last lecture was
delivered I flew back from vacation to

01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:47.480
delivered I flew back from vacation to
 

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:49.209
delivered I flew back from vacation to
be there as you saw a lot of his

01:19:49.209 --> 01:19:49.219
be there as you saw a lot of his
 

01:19:49.219 --> 01:19:51.280
be there as you saw a lot of his
colleagues from around the country came

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:51.290
colleagues from around the country came
 

01:19:51.290 --> 01:19:53.590
colleagues from around the country came
in so we knew it was a big deal but I

01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600
in so we knew it was a big deal but I
 

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:55.750
in so we knew it was a big deal but I
but we really thought he was talking to

01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:55.760
but we really thought he was talking to
 

01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:57.790
but we really thought he was talking to
us and we thought he was gonna tell

01:19:57.790 --> 01:19:57.800
us and we thought he was gonna tell
 

01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:00.430
us and we thought he was gonna tell
stories to his friends and to his

01:20:00.430 --> 01:20:00.440
stories to his friends and to his
 

01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:02.800
stories to his friends and to his
colleagues and then we had no clue that

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:02.810
colleagues and then we had no clue that
 

01:20:02.810 --> 01:20:04.530
colleagues and then we had no clue that
it was for the whole world at that time

01:20:04.530 --> 01:20:04.540
it was for the whole world at that time
 

01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:07.419
it was for the whole world at that time
and I look back today during to some my

01:20:07.419 --> 01:20:07.429
and I look back today during to some my
 

01:20:07.429 --> 01:20:09.129
and I look back today during to some my
email that I was exchanging with Jay and

01:20:09.129 --> 01:20:09.139
email that I was exchanging with Jay and
 

01:20:09.139 --> 01:20:12.640
email that I was exchanging with Jay and
Randy at that time and a couple days

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:12.650
Randy at that time and a couple days
 

01:20:12.650 --> 01:20:14.439
Randy at that time and a couple days
after the last lecture Jay and I were

01:20:14.439 --> 01:20:14.449
after the last lecture Jay and I were
 

01:20:14.449 --> 01:20:17.020
after the last lecture Jay and I were
worried because we thought the publicity

01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:17.030
worried because we thought the publicity
 

01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:18.879
worried because we thought the publicity
would all die down quickly and we were

01:20:18.879 --> 01:20:18.889
would all die down quickly and we were
 

01:20:18.889 --> 01:20:20.859
would all die down quickly and we were
worried that that might leave a void and

01:20:20.859 --> 01:20:20.869
worried that that might leave a void and
 

01:20:20.869 --> 01:20:22.959
worried that that might leave a void and
Randy's life and then just about four

01:20:22.959 --> 01:20:22.969
Randy's life and then just about four
 

01:20:22.969 --> 01:20:24.700
Randy's life and then just about four
weeks later we were still worried about

01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:24.710
weeks later we were still worried about
 

01:20:24.710 --> 01:20:26.890
weeks later we were still worried about
that and then of course about six weeks

01:20:26.890 --> 01:20:26.900
that and then of course about six weeks
 

01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:28.660
that and then of course about six weeks
after that the book contract was signed

01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:28.670
after that the book contract was signed
 

01:20:28.670 --> 01:20:31.000
after that the book contract was signed
and it's sort of all history from there

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:31.010
and it's sort of all history from there
 

01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:33.340
and it's sort of all history from there
so we were clueless we had no idea about

01:20:33.340 --> 01:20:33.350
so we were clueless we had no idea about
 

01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:37.030
so we were clueless we had no idea about
things going viral but we did know that

01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:37.040
things going viral but we did know that
 

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:39.100
things going viral but we did know that
that you know this was very important

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:39.110
that you know this was very important
 

01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:40.870
that you know this was very important
and we recognized all those wonderful

01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880
and we recognized all those wonderful
 

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:43.990
and we recognized all those wonderful
stories that we'd heard Randy tell so

01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:44.000
stories that we'd heard Randy tell so
 

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.439
stories that we'd heard Randy tell so
many times over the years I thought I

01:20:47.439 --> 01:20:47.449
many times over the years I thought I
 

01:20:47.449 --> 01:20:51.490
many times over the years I thought I
would tell one story that maybe put some

01:20:51.490 --> 01:20:51.500
would tell one story that maybe put some
 

01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:53.609
would tell one story that maybe put some
of Randy's perspective on efficiency

01:20:53.609 --> 01:20:53.619
of Randy's perspective on efficiency
 

01:20:53.619 --> 01:20:57.220
of Randy's perspective on efficiency
into perspective so Randy used to often

01:20:57.220 --> 01:20:57.230
into perspective so Randy used to often
 

01:20:57.230 --> 01:21:00.129
into perspective so Randy used to often
have oatmeal for breakfast and this

01:21:00.129 --> 01:21:00.139
have oatmeal for breakfast and this
 

01:21:00.139 --> 01:21:04.419
have oatmeal for breakfast and this
required 2/3 of a cup of water so if you

01:21:04.419 --> 01:21:04.429
required 2/3 of a cup of water so if you
 

01:21:04.429 --> 01:21:06.310
required 2/3 of a cup of water so if you
use a normal set of measuring cups then

01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:06.320
use a normal set of measuring cups then
 

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:09.250
use a normal set of measuring cups then
you need to do 1/3 of cup of water twice

01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:09.260
you need to do 1/3 of cup of water twice
 

01:21:09.260 --> 01:21:11.649
you need to do 1/3 of cup of water twice
in order to get 2/3 of a cup of water

01:21:11.649 --> 01:21:11.659
in order to get 2/3 of a cup of water
 

01:21:11.659 --> 01:21:13.570
in order to get 2/3 of a cup of water
so Randy thought this was incredibly

01:21:13.570 --> 01:21:13.580
so Randy thought this was incredibly
 

01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:16.600
so Randy thought this was incredibly
inefficient so he spent a huge amount of

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:16.610
inefficient so he spent a huge amount of
 

01:21:16.610 --> 01:21:18.490
inefficient so he spent a huge amount of
time looking around on the web until he

01:21:18.490 --> 01:21:18.500
time looking around on the web until he
 

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:21.760
time looking around on the web until he
found a 2/3 of cup of water measuring

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:21.770
found a 2/3 of cup of water measuring
 

01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:23.890
found a 2/3 of cup of water measuring
device and then he could of course use

01:21:23.890 --> 01:21:23.900
device and then he could of course use
 

01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:27.220
device and then he could of course use
that and have this efficiency I never

01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:27.230
that and have this efficiency I never
 

01:21:27.230 --> 01:21:28.720
that and have this efficiency I never
mind that he had wasted you know

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:28.730
mind that he had wasted you know
 

01:21:28.730 --> 01:21:31.180
mind that he had wasted you know
probably a hundred times more time than

01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:31.190
probably a hundred times more time than
 

01:21:31.190 --> 01:21:33.280
probably a hundred times more time than
he would ever save not having to do that

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:33.290
he would ever save not having to do that
 

01:21:33.290 --> 01:21:35.320
he would ever save not having to do that
extra step finding it but it was really

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:35.330
extra step finding it but it was really
 

01:21:35.330 --> 01:21:37.300
extra step finding it but it was really
important to him to have those little

01:21:37.300 --> 01:21:37.310
important to him to have those little
 

01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:41.680
important to him to have those little
bits of efficiency so thank you

01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:41.690
bits of efficiency so thank you
 

01:21:41.690 --> 01:21:51.459
bits of efficiency so thank you

01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880
I had been working with Jane Segal who
 

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:35.959
I had been working with Jane Segal who
was an HDI person who field evaluation

thought well it's kind of intriguing

01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:39.239
thought well it's kind of intriguing
 

01:22:39.239 --> 01:22:42.229

take an engineer and learn about social

01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239
take an engineer and learn about social
 

01:22:42.239 --> 01:22:44.209
take an engineer and learn about social
science learn about fine arts and so

01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:44.219

you're the obvious guy you should do it

01:22:50.899 --> 01:22:50.909
you're the obvious guy you should do it
 

01:22:50.909 --> 01:22:54.410
you're the obvious guy you should do it
and Randy has this way of telling things

01:22:54.410 --> 01:22:54.420
and Randy has this way of telling things
 

01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:56.810
and Randy has this way of telling things
like it is and things like you'd like to

01:22:56.810 --> 01:22:56.820
like it is and things like you'd like to
 

01:22:56.820 --> 01:23:02.080
like it is and things like you'd like to
think about but you find out that he's

01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:02.090
think about but you find out that he's
 

01:23:02.090 --> 01:23:05.870
think about but you find out that he's
already beyond that and so I asked him

01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:05.880
already beyond that and so I asked him
 

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:09.050
already beyond that and so I asked him
about that and he said well we've had a

01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:09.060
about that and he said well we've had a
 

01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:11.780
about that and he said well we've had a
search committee and it failed we're on

01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:11.790
search committee and it failed we're on
 

01:23:11.790 --> 01:23:13.879
search committee and it failed we're on
our second search committee the search

01:23:13.879 --> 01:23:13.889
our second search committee the search
 

01:23:13.889 --> 01:23:15.590
our second search committee the search
committee says Randy you find somebody

01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:15.600
committee says Randy you find somebody
 

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:18.410
committee says Randy you find somebody
or you're in and I don't want to do it

01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:18.420
or you're in and I don't want to do it
 

01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:21.890
or you're in and I don't want to do it
and so that's when I started thinking

01:23:21.890 --> 01:23:21.900
and so that's when I started thinking
 

01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:24.830
and so that's when I started thinking
about it but but he also did struck me a

01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:24.840
about it but but he also did struck me a
 

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:27.229
about it but but he also did struck me a
deal you said if you ever need a bad guy

01:23:27.229 --> 01:23:27.239
deal you said if you ever need a bad guy
 

01:23:27.239 --> 01:23:30.050

I'll do it just don't make you come to

01:23:30.050 --> 01:23:30.060
I'll do it just don't make you come to
 

01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:32.270
I'll do it just don't make you come to
any of the faculty meetings so the

01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:32.280
any of the faculty meetings so the
 

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:34.399
any of the faculty meetings so the
second thing is just before the last

and one of the things that really stuck

01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:33.750
and one of the things that really stuck
 

01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:35.840
and one of the things that really stuck
with me was the idea that experience is

01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:35.850
with me was the idea that experience is
 

01:28:35.850 --> 01:28:37.250
with me was the idea that experience is
what you get when you don't get what you

01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:37.260
what you get when you don't get what you
 

01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:39.680
what you get when you don't get what you
want and I think that mentality allowed

01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:39.690
want and I think that mentality allowed
 

01:28:39.690 --> 01:28:42.320
want and I think that mentality allowed
me to start my freshman year and embrace

01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:42.330
me to start my freshman year and embrace
 

01:28:42.330 --> 01:28:44.120
me to start my freshman year and embrace

the mentality of the first penguin yeah
being able to think outside the box and

01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:46.470
being able to think outside the box and
 

01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:48.290
being able to think outside the box and
risking failing and that helped me on a

01:28:48.290 --> 01:28:48.300
risking failing and that helped me on a
 

01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:50.030
risking failing and that helped me on a
broad scale but also just on a day to

01:28:50.030 --> 01:28:50.040
broad scale but also just on a day to
 

01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:52.820
broad scale but also just on a day to
day to day basis as well so that's a

01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:52.830
day to day basis as well so that's a
 

01:28:52.830 --> 01:28:54.560
day to day basis as well so that's a
message that I've really thought was

mentioned before we had no idea that
 

01:37:44.790 --> 01:37:47.089
mentioned before we had no idea that
this was going to be such an enormous

01:37:47.089 --> 01:37:47.099
this was going to be such an enormous
 

01:37:47.099 --> 01:37:50.870
this was going to be such an enormous
worldwide hit but but I remember it was

01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:50.880
worldwide hit but but I remember it was
 

01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:52.580
worldwide hit but but I remember it was
extremely moving and I actually think

01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:52.590
extremely moving and I actually think
 

01:37:52.590 --> 01:37:55.010
extremely moving and I actually think
some of the most moving moments were

01:37:55.010 --> 01:37:55.020
some of the most moving moments were
 

01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:57.500
some of the most moving moments were
actually edited out of the video that we

01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:57.510
actually edited out of the video that we
 

01:37:57.510 --> 01:38:01.370
actually edited out of the video that we
saw today which which was the part

01:38:01.370 --> 01:38:01.380
saw today which which was the part
 

01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:03.319

initially where he talked about the

01:38:03.319 --> 01:38:03.329
initially where he talked about the
 

01:38:03.329 --> 01:38:05.030
initially where he talked about the
elephant in the room which I thought was

01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040
elephant in the room which I thought was
 

01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:09.080
elephant in the room which I thought was
moving and even more so when he invited

01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:09.090
moving and even more so when he invited
 

01:38:09.090 --> 01:38:12.229
moving and even more so when he invited
his wife on the stage so so it actually

01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239
his wife on the stage so so it actually
 

01:38:12.239 --> 01:38:15.290
his wife on the stage so so it actually
moved me to tears but the funny thing

01:38:15.290 --> 01:38:15.300
moved me to tears but the funny thing
 

01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:17.359
moved me to tears but the funny thing

together you know these two halves of
 

01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:09.800
together you know these two halves of
campus that were are absolutely stellar

01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:09.810
campus that were are absolutely stellar

bit in making bringing those two parts

01:39:21.050 --> 01:39:21.060
bit in making bringing those two parts
 

01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:22.189
bit in making bringing those two parts
of campus together yes we have the

01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:22.199
of campus together yes we have the
 

01:39:22.199 --> 01:39:23.510
of campus together yes we have the
bridge where you have the figurative

01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520
bridge where you have the figurative
 

01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:25.040
bridge where you have the figurative
connection but what can we be doing

01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:25.050
connection but what can we be doing
 

01:39:25.050 --> 01:39:26.479
connection but what can we be doing
better to bring those two sections of

01:39:26.479 --> 01:39:26.489
better to bring those two sections of
 

01:39:26.489 --> 01:39:32.180
better to bring those two sections of
campus together we've actually done a

01:39:32.180 --> 01:39:32.190
campus together we've actually done a
 

01:39:32.190 --> 01:39:34.610
campus together we've actually done a
lot of things since then I'll take issue

01:39:34.610 --> 01:39:34.620
lot of things since then I'll take issue
 

01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:37.400
lot of things since then I'll take issue
I guess a little with this so the ID 8

01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:37.410
I guess a little with this so the ID 8
 

01:39:37.410 --> 01:39:40.250
I guess a little with this so the ID 8
program didn't exist at that point the

01:39:40.250 --> 01:39:40.260
program didn't exist at that point the
 

01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:42.459

01:48:36.750 --> 01:48:41.330
are just less efficient at crushing
their imaginations and so I often think

01:48:41.330 --> 01:48:41.340
their imaginations and so I often think
 

01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:43.460
their imaginations and so I often think
that in order to kind of get more people

01:48:43.460 --> 01:48:43.470
that in order to kind of get more people
 

01:48:43.470 --> 01:48:45.020
that in order to kind of get more people
like Randy it's not so much that we need

01:48:45.020 --> 01:48:45.030
like Randy it's not so much that we need
 

01:48:45.030 --> 01:48:48.140
like Randy it's not so much that we need
to encourage people to be more like that

01:48:48.140 --> 01:48:48.150
to encourage people to be more like that
 

01:48:48.150 --> 01:48:50.000
to encourage people to be more like that
I think we just have to do a less

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:50.010
I think we just have to do a less
 

01:48:50.010 --> 01:48:54.950
I think we just have to do a less
efficient job of grinding them down the

01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960
efficient job of grinding them down the
 

01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:57.170
efficient job of grinding them down the
flipside of that in the sense that I

01:48:57.170 --> 01:48:57.180
flipside of that in the sense that I
 

01:48:57.180 --> 01:49:00.290
flipside of that in the sense that I
think CMU has got a very unique culture

01:49:00.290 --> 01:49:00.300
think CMU has got a very unique culture
 

01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:03.920
think CMU has got a very unique culture
as a university and we accept all kinds

01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:03.930
as a university and we accept all kinds
 

01:49:03.930 --> 01:49:04.830
as a university and we accept all kinds
of different

01:49:04.830 --> 01:49:04.840
of different
 

01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:08.820
of different
metrics for success and we're not making

01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:08.830
metrics for success and we're not making
 

01:49:08.830 --> 01:49:11.490
metrics for success and we're not making
cookie cutter molds you know if you go

01:49:11.490 --> 01:49:11.500
cookie cutter molds you know if you go
 

01:49:11.500 --> 01:49:13.260
cookie cutter molds you know if you go
to promotion meetings and things like

01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:13.270
to promotion meetings and things like
 

01:49:13.270 --> 01:49:18.090
to promotion meetings and things like
that I remember we had a faculty member

01:49:18.090 --> 01:49:18.100
that I remember we had a faculty member
 

01:49:18.100 --> 01:49:19.890
that I remember we had a faculty member
from Fine Arts in the School of Computer

01:49:19.890 --> 01:49:19.900
from Fine Arts in the School of Computer
 

01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:22.380
from Fine Arts in the School of Computer
Science and we went up to Randy Bryant

01:49:22.380 --> 01:49:22.390
Science and we went up to Randy Bryant
 

01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:23.760
Science and we went up to Randy Bryant
and said well how do we get this person

01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:23.770
and said well how do we get this person
 

01:49:23.770 --> 01:49:27.570
and said well how do we get this person
to become a tenured full professor in a

01:49:27.570 --> 01:49:27.580
to become a tenured full professor in a
 

01:49:27.580 --> 01:49:29.030
to become a tenured full professor in a
school computer science when they have a

01:49:29.030 --> 01:49:29.040
school computer science when they have a
 

01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:32.190
school computer science when they have a
Master of Fine Arts is their degree and

01:49:32.190 --> 01:49:32.200
Master of Fine Arts is their degree and
 

01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:34.110
Master of Fine Arts is their degree and
he said to find it to find the metric

01:49:34.110 --> 01:49:34.120
he said to find it to find the metric
 

01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:37.080
he said to find it to find the metric
find the yardstick show me where that

01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:37.090
find the yardstick show me where that
 

01:49:37.090 --> 01:49:39.480
find the yardstick show me where that
person is on yardstick and I think being

01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:39.490
person is on yardstick and I think being
 

01:49:39.490 --> 01:49:42.770
person is on yardstick and I think being
able to accept all different types of

01:49:42.770 --> 01:49:42.780
able to accept all different types of
 

01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:45.750
able to accept all different types of
excellence long as we can keep

encouraging that the new Randy's will

01:49:49.050 --> 01:49:49.060
encouraging that the new Randy's will
 

01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:54.090
encouraging that the new Randy's will
emerge I think it's also very important

01:49:54.090 --> 01:49:54.100
emerge I think it's also very important
 

01:49:54.100 --> 01:49:56.550
emerge I think it's also very important
that we make sure we build the sand

01:49:56.550 --> 01:49:56.560
that we make sure we build the sand
 

01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:00.510
that we make sure we build the sand
boxes that are whatever the the next DTC

01:50:00.510 --> 01:50:00.520
boxes that are whatever the the next DTC
 

01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:04.200
boxes that are whatever the the next DTC
will be or the next whatever I think we

01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:04.210
will be or the next whatever I think we
 

01:50:04.210 --> 01:50:06.000
will be or the next whatever I think we
have to build these spaces in which

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:06.010
have to build these spaces in which
 

01:50:06.010 --> 01:50:07.920
have to build these spaces in which
people can do these new and different

01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:07.930
people can do these new and different
 

01:50:07.930 --> 01:50:10.650
people can do these new and different
and out-of-the-box creative things and

01:50:10.650 --> 01:50:10.660
and out-of-the-box creative things and
 

01:50:10.660 --> 01:50:12.570
and out-of-the-box creative things and
then they will do that right if we don't

01:50:12.570 --> 01:50:12.580
then they will do that right if we don't
 

01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:15.390
then they will do that right if we don't
break them but they will do it but we

01:50:15.390 --> 01:50:15.400
break them but they will do it but we
 

01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:17.730
break them but they will do it but we
have to give them the tools and the

01:50:17.730 --> 01:50:17.740
have to give them the tools and the
 

01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:20.730
have to give them the tools and the
sandbox to do it and I definitely agree

01:50:20.730 --> 01:50:20.740
sandbox to do it and I definitely agree
 

01:50:20.740 --> 01:50:22.470
sandbox to do it and I definitely agree
with that I think a big part of it is

01:50:22.470 --> 01:50:22.480
with that I think a big part of it is
 

01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:24.480
with that I think a big part of it is
just kind of creating these environments

01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:24.490
just kind of creating these environments
 

01:50:24.490 --> 01:50:26.010
just kind of creating these environments
where it's possible to combine

01:50:26.010 --> 01:50:26.020
where it's possible to combine
 

01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:29.910
where it's possible to combine
interdisciplinary disciplines but uh-huh

01:50:29.910 --> 01:50:29.920
interdisciplinary disciplines but uh-huh
 

01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:33.780
interdisciplinary disciplines but uh-huh
just I think that's a newer idea that I

01:50:33.780 --> 01:50:33.790
just I think that's a newer idea that I
 

01:50:33.790 --> 01:50:35.370
just I think that's a newer idea that I
was really surprised almost really

01:50:35.370 --> 01:50:35.380
was really surprised almost really
 

01:50:35.380 --> 01:50:37.020
was really surprised almost really
hearing the talk today hearing him talk

01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:37.030
hearing the talk today hearing him talk
 

01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:39.120
hearing the talk today hearing him talk
about those courses where he was cross

01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:39.130
about those courses where he was cross
 

01:50:39.130 --> 01:50:40.650
about those courses where he was cross
registering it with other colleges I

01:50:40.650 --> 01:50:40.660
registering it with other colleges I
 

01:50:40.660 --> 01:50:42.870
registering it with other colleges I
think that's something that CMU does

01:50:42.870 --> 01:50:42.880
think that's something that CMU does
 

01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:45.480
think that's something that CMU does
uniquely a lot of universities don't do

01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:45.490
uniquely a lot of universities don't do
 

01:50:45.490 --> 01:50:47.400
uniquely a lot of universities don't do
and that's where the innovation happens

01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:47.410
and that's where the innovation happens
 

01:50:47.410 --> 01:50:51.540
and that's where the innovation happens

so we needed to set up the right

01:52:02.570 --> 01:52:02.580
so we needed to set up the right
 

01:52:02.580 --> 01:52:04.550

challenges so that people could grow and

01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560
challenges so that people could grow and
 

01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:06.410
challenges so that people could grow and
foster and I think that's how you can

01:52:06.410 --> 01:52:06.420
foster and I think that's how you can
 

01:52:06.420 --> 01:52:07.550
foster and I think that's how you can
make the next Randy's is like

01:52:07.550 --> 01:52:07.560
make the next Randy's is like

and I see you out there and I see some
 

01:52:11.640 --> 01:52:13.940
and I see you out there and I see some
alums too so I thought that's stuck with

01:52:13.940 --> 01:52:13.950
alums too so I thought that's stuck with
 

01:52:13.950 --> 01:52:15.020
alums too so I thought that's stuck with
me is something I think a lot of the

01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:15.030
me is something I think a lot of the
 

01:52:15.030 --> 01:52:17.180
me is something I think a lot of the
e.t.c faculty think about is how do we

01:52:17.180 --> 01:52:17.190
e.t.c faculty think about is how do we
 

01:52:17.190 --> 01:52:18.440
e.t.c faculty think about is how do we
raise the bar every year we're doing

01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:18.450
raise the bar every year we're doing
 

01:52:18.450 --> 01:52:20.690
raise the bar every year we're doing
well each is he's gonna be 20 years old
