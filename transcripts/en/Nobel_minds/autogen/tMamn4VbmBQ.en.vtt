hello my name is Linus Peterson and I'm

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970
hello my name is Linus Peterson and I'm
 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.120
hello my name is Linus Peterson and I'm
a student at lien stripping some

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130
a student at lien stripping some
 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.000
a student at lien stripping some
residents in biotechnology and my

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010
residents in biotechnology and my
 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.100
residents in biotechnology and my
question has to do with what happened

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110
question has to do with what happened
 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.860
question has to do with what happened
before the Big Bang will we ever know

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870
before the Big Bang will we ever know
 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.020
before the Big Bang will we ever know
what happened before the Big Bang and

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030
what happened before the Big Bang and
 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.330
what happened before the Big Bang and
what will it take for us to figure that

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340
what will it take for us to figure that
 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.189
what will it take for us to figure that
out

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:18.199
out
 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.560
out
that's question I really like to be very

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570
that's question I really like to be very
 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.870
that's question I really like to be very
thank you

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880
thank you
 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.700
thank you
hi I'm Agnes I think your question is

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710
hi I'm Agnes I think your question is
 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.259
hi I'm Agnes I think your question is
one of the most popular questions what

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269
one of the most popular questions what
 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.970
one of the most popular questions what
happened before the Big Bang and of

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980
happened before the Big Bang and of
 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.470
happened before the Big Bang and of
course the short answer is we don't know

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480
course the short answer is we don't know
 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.810
course the short answer is we don't know
and we might never know but your bigger

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820
and we might never know but your bigger
 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.450
and we might never know but your bigger
question is well what could we learn to

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460
question is well what could we learn to
 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.119
question is well what could we learn to
find out so I think there are two parts

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129
find out so I think there are two parts
 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.280
find out so I think there are two parts
of it one is observational would we ever

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290
of it one is observational would we ever
 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.920
of it one is observational would we ever
discover something that's in the sky or

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930
discover something that's in the sky or
 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.290
discover something that's in the sky or
in some other way that was not expected

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300
in some other way that was not expected
 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.560
in some other way that was not expected
that would tell us what was there is

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570
that would tell us what was there is
 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.779
that would tell us what was there is
some left over from previous material

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789
some left over from previous material
 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.119
some left over from previous material
and the other one is theoretical can the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129
and the other one is theoretical can the
 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.880
and the other one is theoretical can the
mathematicians make a theory and that

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890
mathematicians make a theory and that
 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.220
mathematicians make a theory and that
can be that survives test that explains

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230
can be that survives test that explains
 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.959
can be that survives test that explains
everything we know about say elementary

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969
everything we know about say elementary
 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.240
everything we know about say elementary
particles that we get from the Large

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250
particles that we get from the Large
 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.010
particles that we get from the Large
Hadron Collider and everything else we

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020
Hadron Collider and everything else we
 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.170
Hadron Collider and everything else we
know and still tells us something

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180
know and still tells us something
 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.420
know and still tells us something
definite about what happened before the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430
definite about what happened before the
 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.640
definite about what happened before the
Big Bang now will this happen it's

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650
Big Bang now will this happen it's
 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.380
Big Bang now will this happen it's
calling the kind of a guess but I think

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390
calling the kind of a guess but I think
 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.330
calling the kind of a guess but I think
there will be a time when we have a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340
there will be a time when we have a
 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.570
there will be a time when we have a
theory of everything many people are

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580
theory of everything many people are
 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.539
theory of everything many people are
working for this theory this would

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549
working for this theory this would
 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.090
working for this theory this would
probably require unifying the quantum

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100
probably require unifying the quantum
 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.130
probably require unifying the quantum
mechanics of ordinary particles with the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140
mechanics of ordinary particles with the
 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.810
mechanics of ordinary particles with the
quantum mechanics of gravity that we are

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
quantum mechanics of gravity that we are
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.060
quantum mechanics of gravity that we are
only guessing about so we don't have a

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070
only guessing about so we don't have a
 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.640
only guessing about so we don't have a
quantum gravity theory now when we do

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650
quantum gravity theory now when we do
 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.530
quantum gravity theory now when we do
have one it will probably change our

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540
have one it will probably change our
 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.620
have one it will probably change our
understanding of space and time and so

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630
understanding of space and time and so
 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.359
understanding of space and time and so
it's possible that space and time are

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369
it's possible that space and time are
 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.999
it's possible that space and time are
actually a phony structure that they're

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009
actually a phony structure that they're
 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.499
actually a phony structure that they're
discrete in some way and that ideas of

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509
discrete in some way and that ideas of
 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.819
discrete in some way and that ideas of
things coming before other things may

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829
things coming before other things may
 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.580
things coming before other things may
even be changed when we come to quantum

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590
even be changed when we come to quantum
 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.980
even be changed when we come to quantum
gravity so when that happens and if we

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990
gravity so when that happens and if we
 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.810
gravity so when that happens and if we
ever get a theory that we like maybe

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820
ever get a theory that we like maybe
 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.229
ever get a theory that we like maybe
we'll be able to answer your question
