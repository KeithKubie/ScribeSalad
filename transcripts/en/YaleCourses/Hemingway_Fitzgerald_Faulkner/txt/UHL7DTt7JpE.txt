Speaker 1:          00:10          Um, so I was able to, um, uh, come to an intersection, uh, last week and I really enjoy the discussion very much. So I look forward to coming to all the sections and just, um, you know, managing the faces to the names and just hearing your voice and your ideas. So it was a, it was a great experience last masters there. Um, and um, uh, once again just can't stress enough how important it is to take advantage of the writing center. Um, so today we're going to go back, uh, and I just want to refresh your memory about some of the things that we've been seeing about for whom the bell tolls. Um, those kinds of seven permutation that we're looking at. In fact, pretty much all semester. So individual entitled voluntary versus involuntary foreign was just not foreign literate or not literate. Um, and on Thursday we were talking about, um, the distant home versus the onsite environment.

Speaker 1:          01:13          And it turns out that, um, they really are, are two very distant homes and maybe just two homes for rather when there's Paris, uh, which isn't really a real home, but it is a home in the sand. The stat is something that he can, he has the luxury of taking completely for granted. Um, and um, so that's one definition of home, the place where you can work. Unselfconsciously. Um, and the other home is a more complicated place, um, in the sense that maybe it's not even a geographical locale where the kind of emotional shelter that is given to him, um, bestowed upon him and really by his grandfathers, very heroic, um, presence in his civil war. So it's 19th century home for him and he needs that very much because of the non home that is the 20th century. Um, I think that is really a very sad fact about Robert.

Speaker 1:          02:20          And maybe it's true of some people, you know, sometimes it's true or some authors, um, that they really should have that I've loved that, you know, I feel that they really should have existed in different century and then things would have been so much easier for them. Um, rubber, there's an exactly that kind of person, but there is a sense that the 20th century has been very, very hard on him and it's especially hard on him because of the fact of his father and really there's no more central fact then what your parent was. So this is the moment that clears up a lot of things for us. Why his own home is in some sense a non home for him. Um, so he got this gun by that he, his pistol, uh, there was his grandfather's pissed off from the civil war, um, that was misused by his own father.

Speaker 1:          03:12          And this is what Robert does with that pistol. He climbed out on a rock and leaned over and saw his face in the Stillwater and saw himself holding the gun and then he dropped it, holding it by the muscle. And so I'd go down making bubbles until it was just as big as a watch charm in that clear water. And then it was out of sight. This is the best that he can do for his father is to make his father disappear. The extent of the contamination that his father has brought upon the memory of his grandfather can be wash clean only when he becomes, um, no more than the bubble. And then now even the bubble anymore in that clear water. Um, it clearly goes back to Hemingway's conception of clan in of how one clears out one's life and in our time and, uh, the big 200 river.

Speaker 1:          04:12          Um, but I think that it also, uh, within for whom the bell tolls, it also looks forward to the moment, a traumatic moment, uh, when someone else is looking at something like a mirror and seeing his own reflection and they just want to call your attention to the very, uh, deliberate, uh, composition of this particular visual. Tableau. Robert isn't just dropping the gun. He has to go up there. He used to see his own face. He has to see himself holding the gun. And it's that kind of, um, almost narcissistic, uh, observation of himself that Hemingway is really fascinated by and the psychological meaning of that. So we can read all kinds of meaning, um, into this particular scene and we'll see it repeated by another person, um, in equally traumatic moment. But here, um, it seems that Robert Really has no parent. Um, he looks at the world and the only thing that he can see his himself is almost as if he's really an often has always been an often all the time, uh, because his father is really can really be a father to him.

Speaker 1:          05:29          And so the act of dropping the gun, um, is in some sense only a real description of what has long been a psychological fact for Robin. Um, so all of this, um, highlights the fact of how important it is to die. Well not just for yourself, but also for other people for whom you're deaf would also be consequential in here. The biography of Hemingway really becomes quite important. Hemingway's on father Doctor Clarence Hemingway died by his own hand. Um, and we know that Hemingway himself also died by his own hands. So in many ways for whom that belt hose is because of the meditation head of time to that moment when Hemingway would have to decide what to do with his own life. Um, and so this was a front page news in the New York Times, June 3rd, 1961 front page news Chicago should be in, um, and on July, but 1961, the interpretation of the death of Hemingway was that it was accidental.

Speaker 1:          06:43          There was cleaning his gun and the gun just went off. Um, and this fiction lasted for five years until 1966 when his widow, Mary Hemingway, finally admitted that no, actually the heat, it just put the gun into his own mouth and blew out his own brains. Um, so it took five years for their truth to come out. And now they're are all kinds of, um, theory. And that just last summer, um, I think it was July, there was a lot of speculation that Hemingway might have died because he was under such close surveillance by the FBI. Um, so that's just a new theory that would be still be coming up, uh, in, uh, 2011, um, so many years after the death, um, people will still continue to have conjectures about why it was bad Hemingway killed himself. But I think that once the WHO has been the Asian, um, is that he was just in very, very poor health and he was not able to write.

Speaker 1:          07:41          Um, and I think that for rather department is nothing more painful than that. Something that would make life more meaningless than not being able to write. So this is a picture of him, uh, fairly close to the end. And this was a public appearance, so he wasn't looking too bad, but we can sort of see that he really wasn't looking well. And he was there. It was a fishing competition in Castro. Apparently one, lots of trophies that Hemingway was there to give him the trophies. Um, but he really wasn't looking well. So I think that that probably is the simplest explanation that he no longer is with he once was. And he simply couldn't accept the fact that there is this kind of a sharp decline in, in, in, in his mental abilities and physical abilities. Um, so this is the last image that I like to show you of Hemingway is just we used to write, um, and that is the most important, uh, place for him really in the WHO.

Speaker 1:          08:42          Well, um, and today, uh, we'll talk about, um, thinking about that, about how he ended his life. We think about the varieties of dying, um, and then numerous ways by which people and what's useful not to end the lives. So Hemingway actually covers the entire spectrum. People who choose to die as well as people who choose not to die, um, and seeing what it means in each case. So we'll begin by looking at, um, the central event in about hose, the execution of the fascist. Um, and then we'll look at the personal and or non and, uh, various individuals beginning with the neato whose name obviously is upon. Um, and then the all women in the Madrid market and then bombing, which is a new phenomenon, um, in the early 20th century. Um, and then Robert's father again and then Pablo, someone who refuses to die.

Speaker 1:          09:42          Um, but first of all, the execution of the fascist. Um, this, we should remember this whole very long episode is narrated by Palazzo. Um, I hope that you guys will talk about this in section, what it means for a woman who's on the Republican side to the recounting this story, the execution of her political enemies. Um, and how she feels about us and why it is the having chooses to have a woman tell this story. So anyway, this is [inaudible] speaking. Um, and how, um, they are the, the gorillas, a Republican gorillas have, um, taken the town so they are going to execute all the fascist. And this is all engineered by Pablo. He placed them in two lines as you would place men for rope pulling contest or as they stand in this city to watch the ending of a bicycle road race with just room for the cyclist to pass between or as many as two to allow the passage of a holy image in the procession.

Speaker 1:          10:51          Two meters was left between the lines and they extended from the door of the [inaudible] to mental clear across the plaza to the edge of the cliff. So that from the doorway of the unit to Manto looking across the plaza, one coming out with C, two solid lines of people waiting for PLR. This formation, this particular visual tableau and was against highly visual is emphasizing what one would see coming out of our unit to me until, um, is two solid lines that people vary all the way, um, not inflamed by passion, just doing what needs to be done. And so all the metaphors that Hemingway uses, um, uh, actually rich ritualistic metaphors, um, something that is extremely well defined were very well defined rules of the game, like rope pulling contests or better yet a bicycle race. Uh, not consider the violent event, either of those, um, or better, still more intensive.

Speaker 1:          12:00          Find a degree of ceremonious. Snus. Um, is the procession with the whole image of an icon going through. So the three metaphors highlight the fact that there is the equivalent of those rituals, a civic and religious rituals that would be a political ritual of execution at his most utopian, the execution of your opponents, which is a necessary thing. In some cases, the execution of your political opponents should be as ritualistic as ceremonious, as free of passion as all those other ritualistic events. So this is very utopian moment in for whom the bell tolls and if it could be held at this level, then the Spanish civil war willing to Calavo, they in fact be a good war or beautiful war. And she tends to think of those terms. And sometimes in alums we'll talk about that. But in any case, this is [inaudible] very utopian description of what a war could be and what you could do to your enemies without debasing them, without abusing them, even though you do kill them.

Speaker 1:          13:17          Um, and I try to find an image of the two lines of people with the people who have been executed passing of group. Um, and I just couldn't find an image. I guess it's not surprising new having nobody will be taking pictures at that moment. Um, but as it turns out, one major art is actually has numerous paintings. Um, they seem to be alluding to that kind of information. And is Robert Motherwell, um, major 20th century artists. And not only does he want, he actually has numerous, from the fifties to the seventies, he produced numerous paintings all call Lsu to the Spanish with her, like with his two low inflammation. So this is an early one that was done in I think it was 1954. Um, and this one is much later. He numbers of them. This one is in the Metropolitan Museum. Um, and uh, this one is one or two and I don't remember what date it was, but obviously later.

Speaker 1:          14:14          Um, and this one is quite late in the 70s, um, one 10 now in the series and is in the Guggenheim Museum. So, uh, clearly, um, Hemingway's talking about something that is also recognized by other people. Um, as in many ways the kind of the Utopian moment, uh, of the war when violence is both a executed, uh, but not allow to go to get out of hand. But um, having way also shows us that in fact that that is not a sustainable, you told here that that violence kept within limits. Violence kept within bonds, um, is not likely to last for the whole duration of the war. So, um, PLR refers to this as drunken this coming into allies, the people of this time aura as kind as they are, as they can be cruel and they have a natural tendency, they have natural sense of justice and a desire to do that, which is right.

Speaker 1:          15:24          But cruelty had entered into the lines and also in drunken is what the beginning of drunkenness and the lines were not as they were when Donald Benito had come out in Spain. Drunken is when reduced, but other elements than wine. It's a thing of great ugliness. So already we're beginning to see the language of beauty and ugliness coming into the situation where it seems that moral judgment is in play. So polite is referring to real drunk people who asked for people who are drunk drunks in the, in that episode. But she was also referring to another kind of drunk in is, um, which is to be drawn with maybe in the desire vendors, um, drunk with your own sense of momentary power, absolute power over someone drunk. Would you ability to bring about absolute deep basement, um, in your opponent. All those things can make people in new created.

Speaker 1:          16:26          And so Hemingway is really talking about him. [inaudible] he's taught me about different forms of inebriation, um, and how they can all work to break down this stability, all otherness as their loneliest lists of work. Really odd to be, you know, more than the ritual. So, you know, this is a breakdown of ritual that for Pella marks the beginning of the chaos and the modifier thems, um, that takes over the scene. And, um, so it just, because we're talking so much about, she just talks about early news. Um, and in many ways she's inviting us to think about the, both the ethics but also the aesthetics and killing, um, a book that is a person into that kind of thinking is still scariest book on beauty and being just in her argument is that beauty is actually very important consideration. Justice, um, that the sense of proportion, the sense of balance, the sense of symmetry, all those ideas that we associate with you.

Speaker 1:          17:27          They should also be concepts that we consider when we think about crime and punishment, whether the punishment is commensurate with the time. So it's very interesting argument. Um, and not really just about, you know, not just about execution of political prisoners, but thinking about justice in general. Um, so just keep that in mind as we go with a laugh. Um, to talk more about the breakdown of the line. There's some drunken yeah. Guillermo from the Lions imitating the high cracked boys of his wife. And Dawn Guillermo rushed to what the man, the blindingly with tears now running down his cheeks and the man hit him hard and tries to phase, which is Flowjo. And Angelia Mo sat down from the force of the blow and sat there crying, but not from fear while they're drunk, had speed and when drunk had jumped on top of him Australia shoulders and beaten with the bottle.

Speaker 1:          18:29          Um, I, my reading is not even doing justice to just how horrendous the scene is. Um, and I think that the reason that Hemingway released singles out this moment, um, is in fact that incommensurability between the punishment and the prime. We know in fact and philosophy, very careful to tell us that Guillermo is not the worst or the fascist. In fact, he is not rich. He doesn't own anything he owns within those shop. Um, he's, um, he is a fascist because of his wife because his wife is religious and so he just comes a fast as to humor her. Um, so he really is, is the last person who ought to be executed under those circumstances. And these also the last person who are today in Malawi in this particular way, um, this various kinds of execution that doesn't have to be this kind of very brutal, um, kind of, uh, debasement of the person that just very groovy mockery.

Speaker 1:          19:29          This is really one pillar means that these people are naturally kind, but they also capable of great crows. Hey, and this is the moment when we see that crow to dramatize. So it's, it's not even the killing of Guillermo is the making fun of him. Um, and um, and just the whole treatise, the, Eh, the scenario engineer, um, in such a way as to bring about the maximum degradation on the part of glory, Yam or this is what makes this thing so unbearable. And so for Pella, this is the absolute vote point, um, of the, of, of the whole, uh, maybe over the whole Spanish that will, up to that point. Although she doesn't, she can look into infusion. She doesn't know it's the come, uh, but in any case, um, this is the moment when all of a sudden everything seems to be going the wrong way and it is a turning point for the worst for Hila.

Speaker 1:          20:33          I myself have felt much emotion at the shooting of the Guardia, so they'll buy Pablo polasse. It was a thing of great ugliness, but I had thought if this is how it must be, this is how it must be. And at least there was no cruelty, only the depriving of life, which as we all have learned in this year as is the thing of ugliness, but also a necessity to do if we are to win and to preserve the republic. So it's a very complex bit of reasoning here and it seems that a lot is actually disagreeing with scary, so scary things. Then there's almost a kind of a perfect match between Billy and justice, um, that work. We, you know, mine's, I not so much in the physical eye, but in our minds eye in our mind. Um, what we recognize now Myers ISB beautiful would also be just that there's that kind of balance and symmetry but is making a distinction between something that is ugly and something that is morally represent heritable and something that is pooled.

Speaker 1:          21:45          Are they calling necessary. So those are the three clans, concepts that are in play in her head and for her, something that is political, politically necessary can also be ugly. And Dennis, okay, so she can take ugliness. She doesn't welcome, she doesn't love it, but she can take it. It is the quality as she can take. Um, and so based on bad distinction, it is the fact that the [inaudible] had entered the lines, um, that cruise he had enter into a vice for her. That is the measure of just how much the Spanish civil war has been corrupted from within that basically it has gone bad. And that is a phrase that had been way uses quite a bit as well in foamed about hose Pablo is someone who has gone bad and the Spanish civil war, the Republican cause is something that has gone back.

Speaker 1:          22:49          So the final reflection, uh, from PLR bill, I could not sleep that night. And I got up and sat in a chair and looked out the window and I could see the square in the moonlight where the lines had been and across the square, the tuition money in the moonlight and the darkness of the shadows and the benches bright too in the moonlight and the scandal bar, those shining and beyond the edge of the cliff where they had all been thrown and there was no song, the splashing of the water and the fountain. And I sat there and I thought, you have the gun badly. So she's arriving at that work, which for her is to Altoona where the judgment, not ugly but bad, um, that this is her verdict on her own psi. Um, so hello, of course is not speaking for Hemingway. Um, but I think that she has a lot of authority.

Speaker 1:          23:47          Um, and so, um, somebody who pin is something that, um, we should take very seriously, um, at work. Um, those cruelty in any war, you know, not just suspend this a whirl, but first of all, war, second world war, especially as a warm up. I agree. Cruisy um, at what point does cruelty rented that side not justifiable, and it actually isn't winning side, maybe not justifiable. So, uh, from there, um, from this kind of large scale meditation on the Justice of war, whether there could be a just war or at what point, uh, this ball was become unjust, um, from that Nasco macro, uh, meditation. Um, let's move on now to thinking about dying, um, as a much more personal, uh, phenomenon. Uh, and also, uh, choice quite often. Um, having ways for interested in both in people dying in voluntarily, uh, but also in people. Um, choosing to live on voluntarily even though living on might not be a very beautiful thing, uh, might not even be actually an ethical thing.

Speaker 1:          25:03          Whether that is a kind of a funny thing to say. Uh, but, um, the, he's only seems to be really thinking about looking forward to his own and all this, uh, episodes, but beginning with the ball, Fido, uh, finito so this is someone who is already, um, his career is over at this point. He's gone. His last car, the last bull fight, and this is the ceremony, uh, celebrating the end of his career and his retirement and his glorious career. Up to this point, finito did not eat much because here we see if Apollo taxo a blow from the flat of the Horn when he had gone in to kill in this last corridor of the year is our hoser. So the president of the club, which at the end of the speech and then everybody cheering him, he stood on a chair and reached up and anti the court, the bound purple shroud over the head and the head of the ball was as though he were alive, his far, it was curly as Enlive and his nostrils were open and his eyes were bright and he was there looking straight as finito.

Speaker 1:          26:25          Everyone shouted and applauded and Finito some further back in the chair in. And everyone was quiet and looking at him and he said, oh no, and looking at the ball and pull further back. And then he said, no, very loudly and if big blob of blood came out and he didn't even put up the Napkin and a slit down his chin and he was still looking at a goal. There's a lot of looking in Hemingway, we can write up, you guys can write a great paper just by looking at the dynamics of looking, the, the soothing, the gaze that we cast upon someone else. And sometimes the gaze that they cast back at us. Um, quite often there's a kind of a reciprocal process and here it is indeed a reciprocal process for NATO is looking at the ball and the ball is looking at him.

Speaker 1:          27:20          Um, even though was a dead, it doesn't matter that boom walk and look back at Youtube and it seems that here Ashley, um, it is not with the Ido. This thing is not a mirror image. And that's what's so heartbreaking about it. It would have been great if it had been a mirror image because what he sees in a ball, it's actually a board and a full vigor of life. This ball, even though it's dead, um, he's more alive than when he was alive, it seems, um, his, for his curly hair, um, his nostrils are open, his eyes are bright. He's just a great spectacle. Um, and more than that, his element, he seems to be in doubt with live even after death. And so if this were a mirror image, this ought to have been through needle in his prime with life when he was a great the door when he wouldn't be coughing glove, when he will be able to eat instead of now and he can eat anything because of the damage that's been done to this.

Speaker 1:          28:29          So if this were a mirror image, vanilla would have been young again. But we all know that that's not going to happen. And so Hemingway is clearly punning on the worth and you know, this is a man who was finished when the man is finished in this particular way. Um, is it better or worse for him to be still alive when it have been better? If he had been killed earlier, just like the ball, then he would have been preserved and at the maximum height, high point of his life. So I mean I think that is not the kind of thinking that actually we want to intelligent all the time. Um, but it is, um, something that I think that Hemingway has to, it takes very serious seriously, obviously. Um, and so for him this was a kind of a comic tragic comic moment of survival.

Speaker 1:          29:23          Yes. I mean Nathan Ito is hanging on there. He's not about to this fashion itself voluntarily. It's going to hang on. Um, but it's a very dubious kind of hanging on. And the only redeeming thing that we can say about it is that it's funny. It's conical. So once again, the only way that we can take this, we can swallow their stomach. It is by saying it is a comical moment. Um, and for whom and about hose. And there's another equally tragic comic, I would say mostly comic moment, um, in formed about those, about something hanging on with using the die even though they had finished as Finito is awesome finish. Um, this is PLR talking to um, to uh, Robin about some old about the smell of death and then he doesn't know what that smells like and she tells him to go to the market and you must go down the hill imagery to the planting the two lado early in the morning to method era and stand there on the web paving where there's a fog for the mercenaries and wait for the old women who go before they like to drink the blood of the bees that are slaughter.

Speaker 1:          30:36          When such an old woman comes out of the two Darrow holding her shawl around her with her face, gray and an eyes hollow and the whiskers of age on a Chin and on her cheeks sat in a Wetson wider foo phase as the Sprouse grow from the seed of the bean, not bristles, but pails, routes, sprouts in a death of a phase. Put your arms ties around her English and holder to you and kiss her on the mouth. And you will know the second part, that voter isn't made up. Um, I definitely think this is in this quite a bit of he ain't going on. I mean, you know, oh, people, male and female kind of look bad. Um, but Hemingway seems completely fixated. Um, how bad or women look. Um, and especially the bean sprouts growing on the face. Um, it's sort of, you know, and I think that that's why it sort of comic and it's okay because of that, um, that, um, that actually lots of very well known all the women have this kind of whiskers on the phases.

Speaker 1:          31:51          Um, and it's, you know, it's just a fact. And, but for Hemingway it seems to be kind of a reproach on the go women that they should have this rove on, on the faces, um, and that in many ways, um, are going against nature. Then suddenly they have come men rather than women who have whiskers on the phases and so on. Um, and so they really ought to have died earlier. Um, instead of allowing this unnatural phenomenon to happen to them. Um, I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's really very small incident, but nonetheless, the count of female counterpart to the Finito story. Um, and it just wanted to stop here for a moment and talk a little bit about in the connections between Hemingway and Fisher, because in fact, used seeing this phenomenon before, uh, of a kind of unnatural grove that is almost a parody of nature.

Speaker 1:          32:46          So we've just had this tragic, um, calming being Sprouse on a human face. And, um, actually in Fitzgerald, uh, we have a kind of non comic version of that in the great Gatsby in the Valley of the ashes with the ashes growing. Like we've now you the passage of the moment. Um, but Hemingway also has the kind of non comic hello to the Fitzgerald version, which is also kind of the preparer they have nation that we'll look at. But first, um, something that is almost like the Marcus thing of the bean sprouts in the great gas Gatsby. This is a valley of ashes, a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and quote has gotten right. So if his Gerald's was talking about some kind of grotesque vegetation that is made up of the animate and inanimate. And in many ways Hemingway is talking about exactly the same thing that bean sprouts.

Speaker 1:          33:48          Um, the women are almost inanimate. They really ought to be in that mood is a, uh, is a caricature of the animal. They are animate. Um, but in any case it is the two will couldn't mingling of the elements and the inanimate they he's talking about and that Fitzgerald is also talking about. So I'm just really curious that the organic inorganic mixed in this way for both authors, um, for, I would say that for, for Fitzgerald is, is, is very hard to see this as comic and all on me didn't try very hard, but this is just not that funny is, is um, is dominance is, was to a tragedy. Um, but Hemingway also has, um, a completely non comic, uh, parallel to that of something that is almost a parody of nature. Except that it doesn't take the form of bean sprouts in is a human invention that looks like the work of nature.

Speaker 1:          34:52          That's something else. So this is about the bombing of the El Sordo band on the top of the hill. They'd been a chase to the top of the hill and they basically kept their bio firing power the enemy, and they on the top of the hill. So there being just being bombed, the maximum, one of the efficiency for the bonds. Then through the hemorrhaging of the gun, there was the whistle of the air splitting of the, and then the red black roar to Irv rode under his knees and then waste up to hit him in the face and then do it and bits of rock with falling all over and the nausea was lying on him and the gun was lying on him. But he was not bad because the whistle came again and to go of wrote on the him with the roar. Then they came again and earth lodge under his valley and one side of the hilltop grows into the air and fell slowly over them.

Speaker 1:          35:54          Why did they, supposedly it is bombs dropped by all those bombers that we saw, right? The Hind Co's and the fear that's the German hung clothes, Italian and dropping the bombs. Um, in this case, I think there's just the Italian bombers. Um, but the way that this moment of bombing is described three times in this passage is that to earth is wising up and hitting the gorilla band who are, uh, everyone from miss killed in this bombing. Um, it is the fact that the earth seems to be conspiring with the bombers and hitting the human beings that it has nurtured artist's time. That is the outlet in so, and as the ultimate injury, um, that the Spanish Patterson's, they live on the Earth Day thing that earth is on their side and to have the earth suddenly joining the side of the enemy. It's about the worst thing that could happen.

Speaker 1:          36:59          Um, and so this is the cruelty of the description of that study. Included is very much coming from Hemingway himself. He didn't have to describe the bombing as the action of the earth, the earth rising up and hitting all these human being. He doesn't have to describe them in his way. He's describing the incident in this way deliberately to highlight the fact that in which nature has been perverted by human action, the modern technology has proved really nature so that nature is no longer a place where human beings can be [inaudible] is that nature is something of itself, is a weapon that can be used against human beings. Um, and what is also true about this particular who realignment of the Earth with the anime is that it reaches back and retrospectively and retro actively we rice and ionizers and earlier moment because this is not the first time that we hear about earth rolling or moving up.

Speaker 1:          38:03          In fact, one of their most famous little detail from, um, the phone about houses that when you have good stats, supposedly the earth move under your, um, and this is what Pella wants to get the information that allows us to get from Maria to make sure that, um, that everything is fine. Um, that this, that this in fact happened over move. Maria said, not looking at a woman, truly it was a thing I cannot tell the for you in glaze. The law looked at Robert Jordan. Don't lie. Yes, he said truly good. [inaudible] good. That's downtime. So this is back in page one 74, um, the earth moving, it's all on the human side. And for someone who is a very short life, everyone seems to know that Robin Meyers, we have a very short life. For someone who's going to have a furniture life, having that experience is very important.

Speaker 1:          39:01          So on one 74, [inaudible] 74, um, the earth moving has one connotation and the cruelty of what happens on page three 21 is that it completely, we rice that earlier scene and the size of a completely different, in fact the opposite meaning to the movie. So this is worth having ways of, that's quite brutal narrative, um, can do is that even something that seems to be safely concluded, um, you know, that earth moving for, um, Robert and uh, Maria, even though that is safely conclude it in the past, it is actually not safe from a subsequent where you're writing and a reassignment of meaning. Um, so, um, that, that the meaning of the earth moving clearly is in flux. Maybe, uh, maybe it's, it could be either way or maybe later event. Ashley can completely erased early. Meaning I think we have to decide for ourselves to what extent page, truthfully one can undo that earlier, uh, Utopian moment, uh, but want to talk about now talk about two other things that are associated with dying and not dying.

Speaker 1:          40:30          Um, both hinting on the work called body Howard. Um, the first actually goes back to Robert's father. Um, and for a long time, I mean, not for a long time, but when we're looking at the sea with is just dropping the pistol, um, in the, in the water, um, this node scription of how he feels about his father. Right? It's just that he wants to get rid of the gun. He never wants to see the gun again. That's it. It's managed to get rid of the gun. Um, but actually there is, um, uh, upfront description of how Robert feels about his father and also a clarification of what he needs his grandfather, uh, how I wish grandfather are hell, I wish my father was here. He thought for about an hour anyway, maybe he said the low I have through the other one that misused the gun.

Speaker 1:          41:26          Maybe that is a bit lonely, the communication that we have, but damn it, I'll never forget how sick it made. The first time I knew he was a cold body. Go on. Say it in English. Coward is easier when you have a set and there's never any point in referring to a son of a bitch by some foreign term. He wasn't in his son of a bitch though he was just a coward and that was the worst luck. And then, um, it's actually, if it is interesting for multiple reasons, um, one is that, um, Robert really hosted, he's the grandson of his grandfather. Rather than the son of his father. And that's really clear. And because both at the, uh, describe him, he has both his grandfathers when's on and his father's son, um, if he had the choice in much rather be the phone.

Speaker 1:          42:20          So he's certainly hoping for the basket, which is that his father would just disappear and that one link will be invalid, would be an invalid like, um, but the way that he thinks about his father, um, is first of all that this is a moment when Spanish tends to come in handy. That maybe it's easy just to ease your way into that way you're thinking about your father. So you go by way of a foreign language, but then you really have to say it in your, in your own town. Um, but then the way that he thinks about that where there's actually, um, two f emptied of any moral judgment, I think they will use the word coward. We'd had to attach a lot of moral significance to that term, right? It lack of bravery, um, is a kind of moral failing or the polio, the person, um, who you know, who is lacking in that quality.

Speaker 1:          43:14          Um, but finally Robert is just emptying that have that moral judgment and the saying, there's some people were just unlucky. Some people would just born not very brave and it's not up to them. If they are born author engrave it is too much to expect absolute bravery from them. They just, they're not meant to be brave. And when they try it on a certain thing is when they can meet that test of bravery, then they go into break. Um, so this is his way of accounting for the fact that his father can live on stubbornly, um, doesn't have the will to live, to keep them going. Just to make sense of that in his own mind. So in this incident, um, how was the decision to die? Is rendered acceptable? Is not still not a great thing, but he can wrap his mind around it.

Speaker 1:          44:15          And that's really one who wants to do, is to be able to wrap his mind around the fact of his father's suicide. Um, but I think that Hemingway actually, um, and this really speaks to how far he is able to imagine a position that in the end we know that will be the opposite of his own. How far is able to imagine, um, and give all dignity, uh, or maybe a kind of emigration, um, to someone's decision not to die. The stubborn decided to hang on and not just to be, not just to go right now. Um, and so parallel to that's the method symmetrical to this, but also antithetical to his father's action, um, is the cold bothers will to survive. Um, and the person who embodies that will to survive is Pablo, who might argue is actually one of the most interesting characters, arguably more interesting than Robert, um, in this novel.

Speaker 1:          45:17          Um, because he's, he's so much goes on inside his head and also through him that we actually don't see represented represented in the novel. So this is one area where Hemingway even versus the fact that this is some information not getting and that information, that lack of information or that nondisclosure of information. Ashley Mix a problem with the fair and steal his person that he is. Anyway, Pablo is close to being killed at Esmo. One [inaudible] hit him again, hot in the mouth and Harlow laughed at and showing the Yellow Bat broken chief in the red line and the smell of leave it alone. Pablo said, and rich the cup to scoop some wide from the boat. Nobody here has Kohona is to kill me and this head is silly. Khobar the Augustan said no, no words either. Pablo said and made a swishing noise. Rinsing the one in his mouth.

Speaker 1:          46:15          He spat on the floor. I'm fat, I'm far pass was Goossens stood there looking down at him and cursed and speaking slowly, clearly, physically and contemptuous late and cursing as steadily as though he were dumping the newer on their field, lifting it with a Dung for our wedding and Dow and doubt against turn from a door and spoke to him putting all his contempt into this thing. Go to yes, me set Pablo. I will lead a life when you are dead. So Augustan is trying his best to get into a fight so he could do killed right then and there. And Pablo is doing everything he can to stay alive and he's succeeded. So no question about it is an absolute how. And you know he's going to be stand there and bacon salad maybe for as long as as boosting his breath and south and he's not going to be great.
