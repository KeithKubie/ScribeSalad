00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.400
People do a very good job at defining patterns in things,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.600
especially things that they're not familliar with.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.800
And today, since it's Valentines day,

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.700
we're looking at astronomical objects,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.000
that have a shape of a heart.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.000
You might not think it, but on the surface of Mars, 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.400
we've actually found quite a few hearts.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.000
These are images that were taken from the Mars Global Surveyor.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.700
In each of these you can actually see clearly the shape of a heart.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.100
Most of them are dips. They're actually depressions in the surface.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.700
In this one you can see clearly this heart structure,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.000
and it's a depression in the ground.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.300
With the light coming from the left, you can see the cliff right here

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.000
has a dark side, and it's illuminating this side of the cliff.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.800
This one I particularly like, because it's a crater with a heart

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.900
that's in the middle of the crater.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.300
So the crater goes down into the surface,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.300
and then the heart actually pops up from the center.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.400
This is an example of how human beings love to find patterns

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.100
in anything that they can, just like when we stare up at the sky

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.400
on a sunny day trying to find patterns in the clouds.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.100
In astronomy the same thing kind of happens.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.500
Interesting looking objects tend to get nicknames.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.200
One class of interesting objects are called nebulae,

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.700
and these are big clouds of gas in our galaxy.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.100
They're where stars are born.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.200
We often call these nebulae by interesting nicknames,

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.000
based on what they look like,

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.600
there's the hourglas, the catsign, the owl,

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.600
the lagoon, the boomerang,

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.000
but today for valentines day we're showing you the heart-nebula.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.200
So you can see this beautiful heart-shape pattern here,

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.700
which is glowing hydrogen gas.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.500
It is glowing because in the middle of this nebula is a knot of stars.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.900
This is one of my favourite galaxy pairs.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.700
This is the antennae galaxy,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.800
and these are actually two separate galaxies

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.250
that are coming together in a marriage, 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.500
of two galaxies to become one.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.400
So maybe a billion years ago these were actually separate galaxies,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.300
and they've been orbiting each other

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.900
and getting closer and closer

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.700
you can see now that the two are really coming together to form one.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.500
You can see these wings of stars and gas.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.600
It's called antennae galaxy because

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.500
these are looking like bugs antennae.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.400
A more updated version of this, made with the Hubble telescope,

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.600
is this image.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.500
It zooms in on that central region

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.000
and you can really this nice romantic heart-shape.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
We're gonna move away from hearts for the moment,

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.300
but I am going to show you an image

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.000
 that has something to do with Valentines day.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.600
This is probably one of the most romantic images made,

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.000
if you think of romance not just being about love,

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.600
but about big ideas.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.200
The connection with Valentines day is that twenty years ago

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.700
a little spacecraft called Voyager I,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.300
shooting out to the outer reaches of the solar system,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.400
it's mission finished to explore the planets,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.500
was commanded to turn around and

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.300
take a family portrait of our solar system.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.200
And ofcourse the connection with Valentines day

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.900
is that on 14th of februrary 1990,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.300
twenty years ago,

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.300
that this little spacecraft was sent the instruction

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.800
to turn around, it's mission completed,

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.200
and start taking a picture of our solar system family.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.400
And this is the picture it took,

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.700
it was four billion miles away from the sun,

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.800
and it went and took 60 different pictures,

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.500
stiched together here in this panorama,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.600
that captures almost all of the members of the solar system family.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.800
So you see the Sun in the center,

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.900
Earth and Venus very close by.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Unfortunately it missed out on Mars and Mercury,

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.600
but it got all the rest of the planets,

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.900
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.500
Aside from the grandeur of this whole picture put together,

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.400
it's really one particular frame of this

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.900
that captured the publics imagination.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.200
And that is ofcourse the portrait of earth,

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.800
because that's our home.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.200
If we zoom in on that one little picture,

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.600
you're seeing a picture of earth from four billion miles away.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.000
Earth is this little tiny dot, right in the center.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.900
So the remarkable thing about this particular image is that

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.500
it really gives us a perspective on our place in the solar system,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.800
and just how small and insignificant our precious little home is.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.600
This is a tiny little dot in this one little picture

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.200
and that's earth,  that's our home.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.100
But really I'm just paraphrasing a great scientist  Carl Sagan here.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.200
Because he had some much more profound words to say about this:

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.900
&lt;i&gt;Look again at that dot, that's here, that's home, that's us.&lt;/i&gt;

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.800
&lt;i&gt;On it, everyone you love, everyone you know,&lt;/i&gt;

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.900
&lt;i&gt;everyone you ever heard of,&lt;/i&gt;

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.700
&lt;i&gt;every human being who ever was, lived out their lives.&lt;/i&gt;

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.800
He goes on to call it a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.400
And that's absolutely true, because

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.000
it is this little dot that happens,

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.500
purely by chance,

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.100
to be caught on some reflected light within the camera,

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.700
coming from the sun.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.800
