00:00:10.192 --> 00:00:10.900
DAVID: All right.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.950
I think it is time
to get started.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.120
Thanks everybody for coming.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.328
My name is David [? Multz ?].

00:00:15.328 --> 00:00:17.640
I get the privilege
of introducing the two

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.630
founders of Ninkasi Brewery.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:20.745
We have Jamie and Nikos.

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:22.370
So thank you guys
for joining us today.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.786
NIKOS RIDGE: Thanks
for having us.

00:00:23.786 --> 00:00:25.922
DAVID: So, yeah, let's
do a round of applause.

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:27.746
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.630
To kick it off, everybody
look under your seat.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.890
There are five golden coins
that have been shot up

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.380
to space and back, and you
might be the lucky recipient.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.130
If it's not under
yours, please do not

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.680
go through all the other seats
right now, we can do a later.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.180
AUDIENCE: Is it
physically attached?

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.596
DAVID: It is
physically attached--

00:00:49.596 --> 00:00:50.720
taped to the underneath.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.690
Hopefully there's--

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.650
NIKOS RIDGE: They were used
as ballast for the rocket.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.920
So we made commemorative
coins to use instead

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.594
of just straight weights.

00:00:58.594 --> 00:00:59.760
DAVID: Has anyone found one?

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.884
Or it was an April Fools' joke.

00:01:05.884 --> 00:01:07.300
JAMIE FLOYD: Yeah,
we're just see-

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.880
you're checking to see
if there's gum under any

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.240
of those seats for Google.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.489
So we appreciate
keeping it tidy.

00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:14.030
DAVID: Great.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.529
All right.

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:16.060
Well, we'll talk
about that later.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.893
We also have trivia at
the very end of this,

00:01:17.893 --> 00:01:20.290
so pay attention to the
talk because there might

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.180
be some prizes coming later.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.550
So all right, so
let's start us out.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.820
Ninkasi Brewery-- what
does Ninkasi mean?

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.260
NIKOS RIDGE: So Ninkasi
was the ancient Sumerian

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.420
goddess of fermentation.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.620
So Sumerians were
the first culture

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.810
that we know of
that brewed beer.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.860
And they worshipped
different gods and goddesses,

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.010
and Ninkasi was the
goddess they worshipped

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.030
for what-- at the
time-- they believed

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.739
was the miraculous
process of fermentation.

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:44.530
And if you want to get
really deep into it,

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.120
it's even speculated that
beer and fermentation were

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.160
part of the reason
that they settled

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.530
into a sort of more
stable agrarian society--

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.320
so a foundational
element in beer.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.710
JAMIE FLOYD: Yeah, just to add
to that-- the oldest living

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.440
recipe in human existence
is the prayer of Ninkasi,

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.080
which is an explanation of
not just a praise of her,

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.740
but an explanation
of how beer was made.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.300
And it's an important aspect
that we like to point out

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.194
is that beer is food.

00:02:14.194 --> 00:02:15.902
We're kind of lucky
as a civilization not

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:18.586
to have to count on
that all the time,

00:02:18.586 --> 00:02:20.460
and so a lot of times
people chuckle at that.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.180
But beer originally
served as a way

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.550
to unleash nutrients from grains
that were not understood better

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.050
at the time as far as how to get
nutrients out of cereal grains,

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.210
and also made for potable water,
which is why we didn't have

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.622
to hunt and gather anymore.

00:02:37.622 --> 00:02:38.330
DAVID: Very cool.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.720
And expanding on
that, can you give us

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.790
a background of your
brewery, how it came to be,

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.740
how you two met, et cetera?

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.607
JAMIE FLOYD: Sure.

00:02:45.607 --> 00:02:47.690
I'll start just real quick
to give some background

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.250
because I'm the founding
brewer-- part of the situation

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.530
that-- I started brewing when
I was 17 years old as a college

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.030
student.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.220
And it was one of the
nerdy sort of side projects

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.260
I did, and hobbies.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.870
And when I graduated
from college

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.950
I had a sociology degree.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.790
And I got a job
pretty much right

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.550
afterwards as a kitchen
manager of a brewpub in Eugene

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.830
called Steelhead.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.610
And I was just paying some
college bills and sort

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.330
of sorting myself out
when, about a year later, I

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.480
got asked to be an assistant
brewer at Steelhead.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.760
And that's when I realized that
my dream of being an educator,

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.895
opening my own business,
and supporting our community

00:03:28.895 --> 00:03:30.700
could come real
through making beer.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.100
And I spent 11
years at Steelhead

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.560
building the skill sets that
I needed to start Ninkasi.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.280
At which point, I took the
leap and decided to leave.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.550
And Nikos and I were
actually acquaintances

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.760
through a mutual friend
who works with us

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.510
and does-- all the
amazing tap handles

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.360
and metal artwork we do
it's inspired by him.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.219
And basically, Nikos
actually applied

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:58.510
to be my assistant brewer
when he moved back to Eugene.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.590
And--

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.360
DAVID: Not hired.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.318
JAMIE FLOYD: Not hired.

00:04:01.318 --> 00:04:03.440
I was quitting and
I didn't really

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.484
actually want to hire the people
that were going to replace it

00:04:06.484 --> 00:04:08.150
because they were
hoping to work with me

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.336
and I knew I was quitting.

00:04:09.336 --> 00:04:11.460
But I put that little seed
in the back of the head.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.420
And one fateful day after work,
we were all at the Bier Stein,

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.039
a local bottle store in Eugene.

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:19.920
And Nikos and our
friend [? Jaz ?]

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.060
asked me what I'd do if
I ever started a brewery.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.960
And I sort of ranted
on at a time which

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.320
I wasn't telling
anybody because I

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.320
would have been fired
from my company right away

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.111
and all that stuff.

00:04:30.111 --> 00:04:32.867
But it kind of started that
inspiration-- the spark

00:04:32.867 --> 00:04:33.450
started there.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.220
And Nikos and I got together and
started working on the project.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.080
And we open doors in 2006.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.110
July 1, 2006 is was we
count as our birthday,

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.062
and have done quite a bit
in nine years almost here.

00:04:49.062 --> 00:04:49.770
DAVID: Very cool.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.014
And what was the first
beer you guys brewed?

00:04:52.014 --> 00:04:54.180
NIKOS RIDGE: First beer we
made was Total Domination

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.280
IPA, the beer you're
drinking right now.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.710
So it was at a time when it
wasn't as common to have IPAs

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.830
everywhere like we have today.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.400
It's definitely caught
on as the top beer

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.140
style in the craft industry.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.120
But at that time,
there are very few that

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.570
were commercially available
from packaging breweries.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.402
And so it had been a beer style
that Jamie had been making

00:05:17.402 --> 00:05:18.610
for a long time at Steelhead.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.820
And it was the first beer that
we wanted to make as Ninkasi.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:22.570
JAMIE FLOYD: Yeah.

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.564
And IPA was the second
style of beer I ever made.

00:05:26.564 --> 00:05:28.980
I made a stout first with my
long-term homebrewing friend,

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.790
Russ, and then
started IPAs as well.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.460
IPAs have been coming
out of the Pacific

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.172
Northwest since the early
'90s, just like San Diego.

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:39.880
DAVID: Very cool.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.110
And so you guys
are based Eugene,

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.529
distribute all over Oregon,
we see here in California.

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:47.070
Can you talk about
your distribution?

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.560
Like what's your biggest market?

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.820
Where did you start?

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:50.731
And go from there?

00:05:50.731 --> 00:05:51.480
NIKOS RIDGE: Sure.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.400
We started just in Eugene.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.330
And we self-distributed
our products there.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.329
And we still self-distribute
our products there.

00:05:57.329 --> 00:05:59.350
And then we just
sort of expanded out,

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.910
concentrically more or less.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.460
And still Oregon and
the Pacific Northwest

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.860
are our biggest markets.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.240
In Oregon now, Portland,
as a single market,

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.180
is our biggest single market.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.360
But definitely now, spreading
into some new territories.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.930
We're excited for
the opportunities

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:21.614
that we have in California, and
now Arizona, Nevada, and Utah,

00:06:21.614 --> 00:06:22.542
Idaho--

00:06:22.542 --> 00:06:23.470
JAMIE FLOYD: Colorado.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:23.940
NIKOS RIDGE: Colorado.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:24.725
JAMIE FLOYD: Alaska.

00:06:24.725 --> 00:06:25.825
NIKOS RIDGE: Alaska,
British Columbia.

00:06:25.825 --> 00:06:26.325
So--

00:06:26.325 --> 00:06:27.956
JAMIE FLOYD: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:27.956 --> 00:06:28.672
NIKOS RIDGE: Yup.

00:06:28.672 --> 00:06:29.380
DAVID: Very cool.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.260
And according to
RateBeer, there's

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.960
almost 200 breweries
and brewpubs in Oregon.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.690
So how do you compete with
so many breweries around you?

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.920
JAMIE FLOYD: A lot of the craft
beer movement changed shortly

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.060
after we started.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.820
And we're not trying to take
credit for all that change,

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.810
although we made some decisions
early on that certainly helped

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.404
a lot of other
breweries sort of get

00:06:50.404 --> 00:06:51.820
into the market
in a different way

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.830
as far as taking some risks
with some distribution,

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.390
and really supporting some folks
that were trying to come up

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.920
themselves in that range.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.320
But a lot of it for us
is we did get kind of

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.600
out in front kind of early on.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.890
I'd also started brewing
at a really young age.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.690
And we got into the business
in 1995, which was still

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.070
relatively young at that point.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.690
Steelhead was the number 10
brewery in the state of Oregon.

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:22.590
And as you say now, just
nine years-- well, excuse me,

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.840
more like 15 years later,
there's almost 200.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.970
So we got in front
of that a little bit.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.090
Because of that as well,
we were able to get

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.130
a good chunk of
market share upfront,

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.770
and really provided
opportunities

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.270
for other breweries to get int
and compete against us, which

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:40.730
has always been fine with us.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.510
And I also started, as part
of getting the skill sets

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:45.960
needed to open my own
brewery, I started early

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.707
on serving as a board member
of the Oregon Brewers Guild,

00:07:48.707 --> 00:07:51.040
and really spent a lot of
time networking with everybody

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.450
in the industry as much
as I possibly could.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.630
So I was the first president
of the Oregon Brewers Guild

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.930
that wasn't an
owner of a brewery,

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:02.960
and sort of was look at as one
of those up-and-coming young

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.639
leaders, and represented
sort of the small brewery.

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:07.180
It's changed a little
bit, obviously,

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.090
with us being the
third largest as far

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:16.166
as sales for Oregonians--
brewers in Oregon.

00:08:16.166 --> 00:08:17.790
But we still lead
with that leadership.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.081
And I spend a lot of time in
the homebrewing community.

00:08:20.081 --> 00:08:22.862
And so people know us to
be real and authentic,

00:08:22.862 --> 00:08:24.570
which is an important
part of who we are.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.270
And I think that that
really helps the cause.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.080
I mean, there's still
going to be some haters

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.038
out there in the world.

00:08:29.038 --> 00:08:31.940
And whether it's jealousy
or just not knowing us,

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.537
or whatever it is.

00:08:33.537 --> 00:08:35.370
We just keep plugging
along and be friendly.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.635
And a lot of the
principles that we do,

00:08:38.635 --> 00:08:40.510
we work a lot of with
the Brewers Association

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.164
and another trades to really
help support other breweries

00:08:44.164 --> 00:08:44.830
as they come up.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:49.860
I spend time on the Brewers
Association technical committee

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.870
and helping create the
quality subcommittee.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:58.070
Because with now upwards
of 3,700 breweries,

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.487
and when we started I think--
what was there, 1,100 maybe?

00:09:00.487 --> 00:09:01.653
NIKOS RIDGE: 1,600, I think.

00:09:01.653 --> 00:09:03.410
JAMIE FLOYD: 1,600
when we started.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.769
So 2,000 breweries have
started in the last nine years.

00:09:06.769 --> 00:09:09.310
So there's going to be quite a
difference in level of quality

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:09.700
out there.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.616
And those of us that
have been in the industry

00:09:11.616 --> 00:09:13.770
don't want to see
other breweries have

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.710
to make some of the
mistakes that some people

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:16.780
have made as they grew.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:20.160
And we're really concerned
about the total flavor profile.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.030
I think it's definitely
a branch of crap that's

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:25.270
different than the old
sort of school of brewing

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:28.162
with fierce competitiveness
and hatred of each other.

00:09:28.162 --> 00:09:31.630
You don't hear as many people
who worked at Budweiser for 20

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:35.090
years jump over to Miller,
as you seen breweries

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.400
within the craft community
jump around like that.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.770
NIKOS RIDGE: Yeah, it's still a
really collaborative industry,

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.469
which is a great thing.

00:09:40.469 --> 00:09:41.510
It makes it a lot of fun.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:42.910
JAMIE FLOYD: Lots
of collaboration.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:43.590
DAVID: Absolutely.

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.173
And so we're actually here today
to talk about their new beer.

00:09:46.173 --> 00:09:47.610
So we will open with a video.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.338
VOICEOVER: Mars--
T-minus 30 seconds.

00:09:56.338 --> 00:09:57.832
The vehicle is armed.

00:09:57.832 --> 00:10:00.154
CROWD: Three, two, one.

00:10:00.154 --> 00:10:00.820
VOICEOVER: Fire.

00:10:04.804 --> 00:10:08.788
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.892
VOICEOVER: We're going
to [INAUDIBLE] first.

00:10:17.892 --> 00:10:18.392
CROWD: Yeah!

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:24.860
DAVID: Wow.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.200
So you decided to
send yeast into space

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.760
and create a space
beer-- the first ever.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.240
And you called it
Ground Control.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.170
So can you talk about how you
got the crazy idea to do that?

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.900
JAMIE FLOYD: Yeah, I had--
about two years ago--

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.730
the really wonderful
sort of happenstance

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:47.150
of a mutual friend,
someone who works

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:50.930
with our wholesale
distributorship up in Portland,

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:55.110
who knows some of the
amateur rocket enthusiasts

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:57.020
that we worked with
on the first mission.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.850
And at an even I
was doing, Chip,

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:05.750
who was a part of Team Hyperdyne
came, and brought his computer,

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:09.490
and sat down with me, and
started to show me past rocket

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.050
missions, part of what was
going on, explained the program.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:16.300
And I grew up with a very
serious determination to be

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.574
an astronaut, and not sort of
just in the boys', I want to be

00:12:19.574 --> 00:12:20.740
an astronaut sort of stance.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.760
I was really prepared to join
the Navy, and be an officer,

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.030
and become a pilot, and go
through the whole program,

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:30.550
and say I'd be willing
to strap to a rocket

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.045
and get launched into space
and see what happened.

00:12:33.045 --> 00:12:36.590
And obviously, I chose a
different lifestyle and course.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.470
But I'm still a nerd.

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:40.950
Most people that
know me know that my

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:44.470
love Star Wars, and sci-fi,
and space, and astronomy

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:45.690
in general.

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.264
So I was obviously
really intrigued.

00:12:48.264 --> 00:12:50.180
John, he was there, said
it was the first time

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.736
he's been-- and
still to this day--

00:12:51.736 --> 00:12:54.110
that I've been to an event in
which I was kind of blowing

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:57.360
everybody else off at the event
because I was just too focused

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.070
on the nerdydom at hand.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.350
About six months later,
they re-approached us.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.100
They were looking,
obviously, for support

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:07.950
for an amateur launch where it
didn't have government support.

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:09.680
Thankfully, Nikos
is as nerdy as I

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:14.030
am and loves the creative spirit
of the frontier-ship and sort

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.610
of who we are as humans.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:19.770
And we kind of got involved.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.430
We support lots
of awesome things,

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.984
and I don't necessarily
participate in a deeper way.

00:13:23.984 --> 00:13:26.400
But we sort of were like, well,
if we're going to do this,

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.590
let's do something.

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:30.270
And what we decided to do
so that really in the end

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.990
we be closer to the
whole process was,

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:35.840
let's try to send yeast
to space and create

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.460
the environment and the controls
that are there so that we can

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.810
defy the gravitational
challenges,

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:45.600
and the extreme G-Forces of
leaving Earth's atmosphere,

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.410
the extreme cold of space,
the solar radiation that's

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:51.600
emitted outside of our
atmosphere that were protected

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.780
from, and then, of course,
the intense heat of return.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:59.395
And that took a lot of work,
and obviously, two tries.

00:13:59.395 --> 00:14:01.270
And that's kind of the
approach that we took.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:04.030
So it just sort
of came together.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:05.530
It was the right
rhythm and feel.

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:09.430
And it kind of comes down to
when Chip asked our friend

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:12.469
John, hey, we thought about
talking to a brewery, what

00:14:12.469 --> 00:14:13.010
would you do?

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:14.718
And he said, oh,
there's only one brewery

00:14:14.718 --> 00:14:17.290
that I could think of that
could possibly want to do this.

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:18.880
Maybe that's a stretch
in terms of I'm

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.296
sure there's some other people
that wish they could do it,

00:14:21.296 --> 00:14:23.210
but we recognized
the opportunity

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:25.380
to be part of
something that was way

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.680
outside of our general
sphere and something

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.360
as exciting as what turned out.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.502
So it's been really awesome.

00:14:31.502 --> 00:14:32.210
DAVID: Very cool.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:34.220
Yeah, I was reading
online, and a lot of people

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:34.990
are super excited.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.541
It's a crazy brand new idea.

00:14:37.541 --> 00:14:38.915
But then there
were some skeptics

00:14:38.915 --> 00:14:41.310
that were kind of questioning,
like is there really

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:42.310
a benefit to doing this?

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:44.200
Or is it a way to
sell more beer?

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.750
So how do you
respond when people

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:46.990
ask these sort of questions.

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:52.029
NIKOS RIDGE: There's really no
good reason to do what we did.

00:14:52.029 --> 00:14:53.820
I mean, I guess I have
to be like, I agree.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:54.319
Yeah.

00:14:54.319 --> 00:14:58.780
But it was a really fun
and exciting adventure.

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.180
It was a lot harder
than I thought

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.540
it was going to be when
we first were like, yeah,

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:04.290
that sounds great.

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.130
Let's make it happen.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.710
It took a lot--
yeah, two missions,

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:10.760
and a lot of involvement,
and a lot of energy.

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.040
But it was really,
really cool to learn

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.610
about what was going on, kind of
be in a fringe area of science

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:18.140
like that.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.270
I mean, rocketry, especially
at the amateur level

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:24.550
or the sort of non-governmental
level, is-- it's really hard.

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:27.380
And it's something that is
really cool to see people

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.610
that they're so into it
that they can actually

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:31.781
make it happen.

00:15:31.781 --> 00:15:33.940
And watching something
launch into space

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:37.620
is also a lot more visceral
than you might think

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:38.870
if you haven't seen it happen.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.286
I thought it would
be cool to see.

00:15:40.286 --> 00:15:43.510
But actually being there for
it was really, really awesome.

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:44.880
JAMIE FLOYD: Yeah.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.829
I like to use the
example of most people

00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:51.120
turn on the TV at night, and
then probably at least one

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.620
out of the five TV
shows they really

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.460
like is based on a spaceship
where people are cruising

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.010
around and beaming
themselves everywhere,

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:00.039
and just having normal
conversationss-- let's

00:16:00.039 --> 00:16:01.830
go to the mess hall
and hang out and stuff.

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.620
And really, this process
really brought it home.

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:07.390
I mean, you can
really-- empirically,

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:09.370
we know that that's
not the case.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:12.180
But the reality is, we're way
behind the gun of anything

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.190
close to that.

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:16.160
And every space mission is
fraught with the potential

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.140
of failure.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:21.050
And everything about it is
contingent upon calculating

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:24.050
everything precisely, and making
sure that nothing went wrong,

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:25.620
and making sure the
weather is right,

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.744
and making sure there isn't
a satellite in the way,

00:16:27.744 --> 00:16:29.830
and just all kinds
of amazing stuff.

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:32.040
And so it was really
meaningful for us

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.830
to be a part of
something where we

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:38.540
could see the real
intensity of what it takes

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.640
to put something into space.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:45.080
For me, it's a lifetime
sort of value for me

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.412
just to experience watching it.

00:16:46.412 --> 00:16:47.370
I mean, it really does.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:50.170
If you watch-- people
watch fireworks and all

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:53.270
that, but there is
something just primordial,

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:55.082
which sounds weird,
but it just takes

00:16:55.082 --> 00:16:56.790
you all the way to
the sort of soul level

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:59.210
when you watch just
how crazy we are

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:04.329
that we decided at some point we
would try to just bail gravity.

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:07.839
It was pretty--
kind of put us back

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:10.329
for a while when we first
realized what gravity was.

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:11.870
We were like, well
I guess that's it.

00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:13.720
But with airplanes
and then other things

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.069
now, we're crazy enough
as a human populous

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:19.207
to just really take that
exploration further.

00:17:19.207 --> 00:17:19.915
DAVID: Very cool.

00:17:19.915 --> 00:17:23.249
And so why did you decide
to make an imperial stout

00:17:23.249 --> 00:17:25.540
verse other styles you could
have made with that yeast?

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:29.300
And then, how did you decide
on the name, Ground Control.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.955
JAMIE FLOYD: As far
as the beer goes,

00:17:30.955 --> 00:17:32.830
we really wanted to
create-- this is a really

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:35.430
special project, and we really
wanted to create something

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.510
to back it all the way up.

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:41.250
And so we wanted to make a beer
that would-- with the artwork

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:45.140
and with the story, it's surely
going to be a collectible item.

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.230
And so it is going to
get put into cellars.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.280
So we didn't to brew
like a blonde ale,

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.870
or like American standard
light lager, or something

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:56.035
that would be not that
drinkable four months later.

00:17:56.035 --> 00:17:58.696
So we wanted to brew a
beer that was like that.

00:17:58.696 --> 00:18:00.320
We've made a number
of imperial stouts,

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.700
and we want to make something
that was unique to itself.

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.616
I mean, you can make a
lot of different stouts

00:18:04.616 --> 00:18:06.410
and a lot of different IPAs.

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.087
So we sourced some
local hazelnuts

00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:09.170
that were grown in Oregon.

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:14.900
And we got some cocoa nibs from
a chocolate creator in Seattle,

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:18.640
and then star anise that
we were able to get locally

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.690
from an herb wildcrafter
that was there.

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:25.180
So we decided to create sort
of a desert-oriented imperial

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.990
stout that would
cellar well and sort of

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.480
be worth the total value
and price of the excitement

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.915
of the rest of the experience.

00:18:31.915 --> 00:18:37.629
And of course, we used
Apollo and Comet and--

00:18:37.629 --> 00:18:38.420
NIKOS RIDGE: Bravo.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.390
JAMIE FLOYD: And
Bravo hops in it.

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:41.740
And we kind of--

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:42.430
NIKOS RIDGE: Tied
it all together.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:43.370
JAMIE FLOYD: We
tied as much of it

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:45.520
as we could together into
a beer that we thought--

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.150
and of course, space
is pretty dark.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:51.737
It's black and dark and
heavy in a really light way.

00:18:51.737 --> 00:18:54.070
NIKOS RIDGE: And the name
Ground Control-- obviously, it

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:57.360
relates to space and relates to
launching rockets and all that.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.860
And we had a lot
of different names.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.856
And it's actually
kind of the way

00:19:00.856 --> 00:19:02.980
you have to name beers
these days in the craft beer

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:03.480
industry.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:08.895
Because really with 3,000
plus, 3,500 breweries,

00:19:08.895 --> 00:19:11.270
there's a lot of names that
are already in use out there.

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:14.337
So you kind of make a list of
names that you'd like to use,

00:19:14.337 --> 00:19:16.920
and then you kind of go through
that list, and narrow it down,

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.850
and then you look and see
which ones have or have not

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:21.500
been used, and go from there.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.480
So we were happy that we
were able to find something

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.480
that we can relate to the
process of launching--

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.800
DAVID: Very cool.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.100
JAMIE FLOYD: Yeah, and we also
have a huge tie to music as far

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.420
as our brewing culture goes.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.130
We have a recording
studio inside our brewery,

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:38.410
and actually work with a lot of
bands, and do a lot of music.

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:40.370
So obviously, the
"Major Tom" sort

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:44.150
of ground control reference
too is part of it as well.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.301
So it has that old sort
of '70s retro feel to it,

00:19:47.301 --> 00:19:49.300
which I think really goes
in line with the space

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.254
program as a whole.

00:19:51.254 --> 00:19:51.795
DAVID: Right.

00:19:51.795 --> 00:19:53.234
And so a lot of
people in the room

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:54.900
are wondering where
they can pick it up.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.960
Are you distributing
to local-- like BevMo!,

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.589
Whole Foods-- what's your
distribution looking like?

00:19:59.589 --> 00:20:01.880
NIKOS RIDGE: So it's pretty
limited in it's production.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.970
But it will be available
throughout our territory.

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:08.560
And not exactly sure
yet every location.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.180
And it won't be
broadly distributed.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.430
But a lot of specialty bottle
shops and specialty beer

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:15.290
retailers will be getting
it through our network.

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:19.650
So I would say check those
out, and call around,

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:20.874
and see where it's at.

00:20:20.874 --> 00:20:22.040
Or you can call the brewery.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.570
Or you can check on our
Beer Finder on the website

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:26.220
and see where it's
being delivered to.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.303
JAMIE FLOYD: Yeah, either
through the Beer Finder,

00:20:28.303 --> 00:20:30.610
or if you contact us,
then we can put you

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:33.447
in touch with our team down
here and they can sort of

00:20:33.447 --> 00:20:34.280
share that with you.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.352
So we do think that,
given it's limited supply,

00:20:37.352 --> 00:20:38.810
that it can go away
pretty quickly,

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:40.356
so definitely want
to search it out.

00:20:40.356 --> 00:20:40.750
DAVID: Nice.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:42.374
And speaking of that--
are you planning

00:20:42.374 --> 00:20:46.210
on making more, doing this
again and making another style

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:47.470
of beer with the yeast?

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:49.810
Or is this a one-time thing?

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:52.010
NIKOS RIDGE: Well, we were
able to-- the first time,

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:54.210
we sent up 16 test
tubes of yeast

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:57.760
and it took 27 days
to find the rocket.

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.960
And we had built the
conditions to keep the yeast

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.670
alive for about 12 hours.

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:03.700
They had two tracking
devices that failed.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.450
So it took a long time.

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:08.950
And at that 12th hour, it
was actually 108 degrees out

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:11.180
at the Black Rock Desert.

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.650
So we knew that the yeast was
not going to totally survive.

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:15.990
And they came back-- there were
some cells that were alive,

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:17.198
but not enough to rejuvenate.

00:21:17.198 --> 00:21:18.960
And we learned a lot
from the process.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:23.740
The second time, we sent six
different test tubes of yeast

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:24.240
up.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.810
It had three different
strains involved.

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:28.764
And we were able to get
four test tubes back

00:21:28.764 --> 00:21:30.930
that were viable with three
different yeast strains.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:35.070
So we use our house ale strain
to create Ground Control.

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:37.890
We have a lager strain
that we use for the Lux--

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:40.090
those of you that had
Lux, we sent that yeast

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:41.580
to space and back.

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.944
And then we have an alt
strain that we use in Slayer

00:21:43.944 --> 00:21:45.110
and some of the other beers.

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:47.950
So we have the potential
to culture up and continue

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.364
to do this a little
bit here and there.

00:21:50.364 --> 00:21:52.030
And then one of the
other things that we

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:54.440
plan to do down the road
is to release the yeast

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.070
to some of the yeast banks
that are out there that

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.324
want to be able to
maybe get it out

00:21:59.324 --> 00:22:01.240
into the hands of
homebrewers and other stuff.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.320
We're not trying to be the
proprietary owner too long

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.200
over the whole deal.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.866
Of course we want to
do our run with it,

00:22:06.866 --> 00:22:10.700
but we even have one
of our-- we're actually

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:13.012
really good friends with
the crew over at Falling Sky

00:22:13.012 --> 00:22:14.720
Brewery, which is a
much smaller brewery.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.510
But they make all their
own foods and stuff there.

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:21.130
And their baker, who I used to
cook with a million years ago,

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:22.930
requested to see if
he could get the yeast

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:25.165
to do a sourdough starter even.

00:22:25.165 --> 00:22:27.830
So like we said earlier,
we're a sharing community.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:31.360
So we want to-- it's
about sharing the yeast,

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.630
but it's also about
inspiring the imaginations--

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:35.064
just the creativity in brewing.

00:22:35.064 --> 00:22:36.480
I mean, there is
a similarity kind

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.280
of with that fringiness
you were talking

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.830
about between the extreme
passion of a homebrewer

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:45.956
over versus someone who's an
amateur rocket enthusiast.

00:22:45.956 --> 00:22:48.205
The only difference is the
amateur rocket enthusiastic

00:22:48.205 --> 00:22:51.120
gets to watch it go down
about once every two years,

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.679
versus every weekend
or when you have time.

00:22:54.679 --> 00:22:55.220
DAVID: Right.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:57.636
And going through this whole
process, what sort of lessons

00:22:57.636 --> 00:22:59.800
have you learned on
doing such an expedition?

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.640
Like, rather than
just brewing a beer

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.300
and distributing,
doing this whole

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:08.150
phased approach of a major
initiative, a marketing

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:10.300
strategy, et cetera.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.440
NIKOS RIDGE: I'd say, yeah.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.030
I think, tying to
Jamie's point, I

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:16.439
can kind of see things out
there that make you think that,

00:23:16.439 --> 00:23:17.980
oh yeah, we've been
to space forever.

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:18.480
It's easy.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.690
It's something we're going
to set out and do it.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.735
And I think that's kind
of normally the experience

00:23:23.735 --> 00:23:25.835
that you have-- at least
that I've had generally

00:23:25.835 --> 00:23:26.752
in my day-to-day life.

00:23:26.752 --> 00:23:29.001
You kind of do things that
are kind of tried and true.

00:23:29.001 --> 00:23:30.425
And yeah, we started a brewery.

00:23:30.425 --> 00:23:32.144
But there's a
mechanism for that.

00:23:32.144 --> 00:23:33.185
And there's distribution.

00:23:33.185 --> 00:23:35.710
And there's a pathway
to success there,

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:37.630
and you can make that happen.

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:41.330
So getting involved with
something that was not so

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:44.000
cut and dry, and then actually
failing the first time

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:44.890
around-- because I
mean, honestly, I

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:46.993
went into it thinking,
oh, well these guys know

00:23:46.993 --> 00:23:47.420
what they're doing.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:48.690
We'll get the yeast in
there, we'll get it up there,

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:51.330
we'll get it back, we'll make
the beer-- nice and clean.

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:53.300
And then it was definitely
this roller coaster

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.680
through the whole thing of
being involved and doing

00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:00.220
all these activities with
the teams to make it happen.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.179
And then not having
it work out, and then

00:24:02.179 --> 00:24:03.720
trying to figure
out what to do next.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.990
So I guess the lesson for
me was more in the idea

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:09.610
that there's a lot of
really cool things going on

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:13.294
out there that we're
not able to just do

00:24:13.294 --> 00:24:14.460
whenever we want to do them.

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.395
And so that's a good
lesson to keep in mind.

00:24:17.395 --> 00:24:19.020
You'd got to keep
pushing the envelope,

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.925
and taking things
out to the edge.

00:24:20.925 --> 00:24:23.050
And it's a different place
to be when you're there.

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:23.900
DAVID: Right.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:24.822
JAMIE FLOYD: Yeah.

00:24:24.822 --> 00:24:26.280
One of the things
that I learned is

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.780
that you have to--
even if you think

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.009
you know your supply
for something,

00:24:30.009 --> 00:24:31.550
that you have to
check ahead of time.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.880
The second launch happened
at Spaceport in New Mexico.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.310
We were staying in
Truth Or Consequences,

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:42.300
which is a funny name.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.540
I don't know why it's not
True And Consequences.

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.600
But it's still a
really cool spot.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:51.850
And we needed to use dry
ice to pack around the test

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:54.004
tubes so that when
it was reentering,

00:24:54.004 --> 00:24:55.920
that that intense heat
could be on the outside

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.810
and protect the yeast.

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:01.270
First, the second
launch-- the first day

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:03.770
that the launch was supposed
to happen, the weather was bad.

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:07.111
So they postponed it, like
you hear a lot on television.

00:25:07.111 --> 00:25:09.360
They're not going to send a
rocket up into a lightning

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.240
storm, which is good.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.170
But we had to come
back a few days later.

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:16.380
And James, who's in
our marketing team,

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:17.130
came back with me.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:19.530
He was a part of the
first launch site

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:20.920
and was willing to come with me.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.860
And we checked
into our hotel, we

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:24.200
were going to go eat some food.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.430
And then go get
the last supplies

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:31.280
that we needed at the Walmart
that was there in town.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.810
And in the three days
that we weren't there--

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:36.910
because we had been there and
check the dry ice supply--

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:37.985
hunting season started.

00:25:37.985 --> 00:25:39.860
And a group of hunters
came in and bought all

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.680
of the dry ice that was there.

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.700
All of it.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:43.800
Not a single drop.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.160
And we discovered that
at 10:30 at night.

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.860
And we were supposed to
meet the rocketeers at 3:00

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:53.130
in the morning to be able to
load our part of the rocket

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:55.820
before NASA and some of the
other scientists showed up.

00:25:55.820 --> 00:26:01.334
And it just shows the
ingenuity that it takes,

00:26:01.334 --> 00:26:02.750
and the sort of
struggle that goes

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:06.200
on with all of this stuff
in that we basically call--

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.180
I think we made 40 phone calls.

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:10.250
We realized that
most of the Walmarts

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:13.730
around that area did not have
dry ice anymore-- the Roth's

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:16.530
chain-- or, the Smith's
chain, excuse me, had it.

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:18.010
But they closed at 11.

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:21.490
We were 10:30 at night, and
we were at least 45 minutes

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:23.194
from the closest one.

00:26:23.194 --> 00:26:24.360
So things got kind of crazy.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.068
And we'd put a lot of
time and resources.

00:26:26.068 --> 00:26:28.780
And so I basically went back
to Walmart, just my typical,

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.374
I don't fail, not going to fail.

00:26:30.374 --> 00:26:32.790
And was trying to look for
chemical cold packs or anything

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:34.956
that probably still wouldn't
work, but just anything

00:26:34.956 --> 00:26:37.020
for me not to feel like a loser.

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:40.310
And the general manager's like,
oh, there's a new [INAUDIBLE]--

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:44.610
I mean, there's a new
Walmart over in Alamogordo,

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:49.070
which is 165 miles away
from where we were.

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:52.070
So James and I popped into
the convertible Camaro

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:54.300
that we had rented for our
Thelma and Louise moment

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.700
together, and took off
into the desert at midnight

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.220
to drive all the way around
White Sands Missile Range

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:03.640
to get to the Texas border,
basically, to buy dry ice

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.830
and get back.

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:09.540
And we were able to move
our stuffing time to 4 AM.

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.390
But that included
two border patrols,

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:15.170
in which I had to tell
boarder police that we

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:16.710
had dry ice in the
trunk because we

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:18.730
were trying to
pack a rocket that

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.580
was being launched into space.

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:24.110
And what was so awesome about
it is that they believed us

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:26.700
because they work next
to White Sands Missile

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.570
Range, where rockets happen.

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:32.440
So learn that that is
part of the human spirit,

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:35.580
that we don't quit, we
just look for options.

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:37.110
And I'm really glad
James was there.

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:38.651
That would have been
a real tough gig

00:27:38.651 --> 00:27:40.750
by myself-- or for anybody
to do by themselves.

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:44.390
But through that creative
spirit and just not giving up,

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:45.810
you can achieve a lot.

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:49.590
And it really does equate to
a deeper satisfaction to it.

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:52.455
So when people ask us how much
submission costs, and does

00:27:52.455 --> 00:27:54.210
it have a payback,
and all that stuff.

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:58.560
I mean, I have a lifetime of
total memories and satisfaction

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.007
from being a part of
it, and really getting

00:28:01.007 --> 00:28:03.340
to know these people who've
dedicated their entire lives

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:05.548
to this and don't get the
share this with many people

00:28:05.548 --> 00:28:06.506
more than once.

00:28:06.506 --> 00:28:08.880
I mean, they have different
clients that come in and out.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.350
And they might know some
colleagues and stuff.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:12.183
But they're kind of out
there in the fringe.

00:28:12.183 --> 00:28:15.280
And it's wonderful to see people
that just love what they do

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.860
as much as we love what we do.

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:20.160
And I think that that's a
really heavy lesson for me, is,

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.490
we all do what we love, and
especially if we're lucky.

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:26.380
And to the degree that we
can share those experiences

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:30.290
with each other, we can really
bolster each other up and help

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:31.420
us see new perspectives.

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.564
And it's an experience
that I'll never forget.

00:28:33.564 --> 00:28:34.980
NIKOS RIDGE: And
I don't know what

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:36.605
it is about rocket
launches, but that's

00:28:36.605 --> 00:28:39.970
the second time we stayed up all
night before a rocket launch.

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:42.104
The first time, we actually
were driving around

00:28:42.104 --> 00:28:44.520
in the Black Rock Desert,
which, if you've been out there,

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.450
you can basically drive
and drive and not stop.

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:47.920
JAMIE FLOYD: It's where the
Burning Man project happened.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.210
NIKOS RIDGE: Because
it's totally flat.

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:50.793
And we ended up
getting lost, and then

00:28:50.793 --> 00:28:53.486
ended up having to also be
at the rocket launch at 4 AM.

00:28:53.486 --> 00:28:55.152
So we ended up just
staying up all night

00:28:55.152 --> 00:28:57.592
and waiting for the launch.

00:28:57.592 --> 00:28:59.800
JAMIE FLOYD: And it was two
days after the supermoon.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.810
So it was a pretty amazing
night on the Playa.

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:04.710
And we were doing a little
roof surfing and we got lost.

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:07.772
So it was a good night thought.

00:29:07.772 --> 00:29:08.480
DAVID: Very cool.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.525
So we have a few more
questions by request.

00:29:10.525 --> 00:29:12.260
And then we're going
to open up to Q&amp;A.

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.850
So one of the first
questions was canning.

00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:18.730
So traditionally it's
been a lot of macrobrews

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:19.810
that have canned beers.

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:21.650
And it's been associated
with cheaper beers.

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:23.780
And now there's a movement that
a lot of the craft breweries

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:25.660
are starting to can their
beers-- it's lighter,

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:27.130
it doesn't allow
as much light in.

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:28.770
Can you talk about that?

00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:30.520
Is that something you
guys would consider?

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.840
Or--

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.590
NIKOS RIDGE: Yeah, I
think it's definitely

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:36.460
we'd consider for
us at our scale

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:39.930
and with our focus on quality.

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:41.685
It's just a pretty
big investment

00:29:41.685 --> 00:29:45.030
to move into a whole
new packaging line.

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:48.155
And we just actually
built a new brewery,

00:29:48.155 --> 00:29:50.390
so we're sort of working to
get that filled up first.

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:51.330
But it's not off the table.

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:52.195
It's probably not
something that's

00:29:52.195 --> 00:29:53.778
going to happen in
the next few years.

00:29:53.778 --> 00:29:56.330
But it's definitely a direction
that the industry's moving

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:58.780
and there's a lot of great
beer out there in cans now.

00:29:58.780 --> 00:29:59.660
JAMIE FLOYD: Yeah.

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:01.980
Living in Oregon, there's
a lot of outdoor pursuits--

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:04.590
not that there isn't in
California or whatnot.

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:09.010
But so most of us are hikers,
or hikers, or kayakers,

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.630
or outdoor pursuits.

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:13.970
So the can has
that benefit to it,

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:16.580
but our bottling line
is capable of doing

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:19.555
a lot more than our
annual production will

00:30:19.555 --> 00:30:20.530
reach for a long time.

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:24.272
So we're rather focusing to
upgrade and make that system

00:30:24.272 --> 00:30:25.480
better than to add a new one.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.620
When we started, we had
to use a mobile bottler.

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:32.261
And then we bought a
small, similar machine.

00:30:32.261 --> 00:30:34.510
And then we had to use the
mobile bottler in our cells

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:35.450
to keep up.

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:38.520
And the variance in quality
just doesn't meet the standards

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:39.300
that we're at now.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.341
And so for a lot of people
that are starting out,

00:30:41.341 --> 00:30:44.060
they may be using mobile
canning devices, or people

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:47.530
come in and can it for them, or
buy smaller machines and stuff

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:48.060
like that.

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:50.100
And we've just really
reached that level

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:53.270
where we task ourselves too hard
to want to put ourselves back.

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:55.585
Why would we sell
a canned beer that

00:30:55.585 --> 00:30:57.210
isn't going to have
the same shelf life

00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:59.065
as a bottled beer of our own.

00:30:59.065 --> 00:31:01.440
But to Nikos' point, it's
definitely not off the shelf.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.340
It's just sometimes Nikos
and I are a lot more patient

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.950
than our fans want us to be
about some of the things.

00:31:08.172 --> 00:31:08.880
DAVID: All right.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.850
And so you mentioned
Total Domination's an IPA.

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:14.440
You mentioned all the
IPAs that are nowadays.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.950
It seems like that's been
the recent trend, IPAs.

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.840
Do you see that staying
here for a while?

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.490
Or what do you think is the
next big trend in craft beer?

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:24.900
NIKOS RIDGE: I think so.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.280
I mean, IPAs are delicious.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.280
And I still drink
more IPAs myself,

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:30.580
or IPA style beers
than anything else.

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:35.100
But I view our brewery sort
of as a microcosm possibly

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:38.410
of future beer drinking
trends, because we, as brewers,

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:39.410
drink in dog years.

00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:42.210
So one year at a brewery is
like seven years of regular--

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:43.126
JAMIE FLOYD: Drinking.

00:31:43.126 --> 00:31:45.070
NIKOS RIDGE: Drinking out there.

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.930
Volumetric guide.

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:49.950
So starting to see a lot of
people internally starting

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:52.360
to move into some of the
lager beers and lighter beers

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.250
that we're making now just as
a nice sort of easy drinking,

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:57.930
sessionable, kind
of classic beer.

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:02.390
And if you look to kind
of developed brewing

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:04.910
regions in Europe and
things like that, I mean,

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:07.290
they've kind of
historically gravitated also

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:08.390
in the lager direction.

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:11.087
So I'm guessing that IPAs
will always be there to stay.

00:32:11.087 --> 00:32:13.170
And then there's going to
be some other beers that

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:16.575
also start to sort of take up
another portion of the drinking

00:32:16.575 --> 00:32:17.910
experience for people.

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:18.660
JAMIE FLOYD: Yeah.

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:22.970
I think that we're really
fortunate in Oregon.

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:26.240
50% of the beer that's consumed
in Oregon is craft brewed.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:31.600
And 40% of that-- or, excuse
me, 40% percent on draft.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.350
That's specifically in the
Portland and Eugene areas

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:37.470
for the most part, which
still make up over 2/3

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:38.320
of the population.

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.780
So that's a pretty amazing
achievement for a small state.

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.890
And that's really where
the world is going.

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:47.310
And to Nikos' point, we live it.

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:48.480
It's kind of a natural part.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.710
It's not hard for us to find.

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:50.820
It's everywhere.

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:54.640
And a six pack of Lux
or a lighter lager

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.650
is just as happy next
to an IPA six pack

00:32:57.650 --> 00:32:59.840
when you're heading
to a barbecue.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.690
I think people
are less specific.

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:03.680
Yes, I'm a total hophead.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.280
I've been using
hops my whole life.

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:06.780
I love it.

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:09.260
But I also fell in love
with brewing because

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:10.850
of imports like German lagers.

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:13.700
And it's always been an
important part of who I am.

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:17.040
And I think as
other demographics--

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.260
ex-military, people
who have spent time

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:22.490
in Europe in their formative
years serving the military,

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:23.730
they all discover beer.

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:26.100
Their love of beer is
centered around things

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:29.320
like Bavarian beers, and
other styles of beers

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:33.020
than we're familiar with as
young beer drinkers in the US.

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.450
And so as those
demographics open up,

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:37.520
we're creating products
that please them.

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:41.420
So it's not about trying
to get the vet who

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.640
wishes they could drink
a helles to love IPA,

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.860
it's about making them a helles.

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:50.550
And I heard some other things
about whether-- is sour beer

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:52.960
one of the next things?

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.580
Yes, in the terms
that it's a trend.

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:57.580
But does it have
long-term marketability?

00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:00.170
Is it something
that-- ask yourself,

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:03.920
do you think about drinking
a gallon of vinegar

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.340
every time you
sit down to drink?

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:08.389
I mean, it does similar
things to your body.

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:10.600
So again, it's a complement.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.650
Someday we'll start
doing some sour beers.

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:15.850
We're looking at doing a
Berliner Weisse style beer,

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:17.960
which is a lot easier to do.

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.270
But we're really patient.

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:21.719
So we're not as attached
to that end prize.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:24.230
And I'm not sure that
people that-- unless you

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:26.515
have a smart business
plan, that people that

00:34:26.515 --> 00:34:29.590
focus on more esoteric
styles as their core brand,

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:32.239
they'll have to see
how beneficial it is.

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:33.860
There's been a
definite resurgence

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:36.310
of creativity in terms of the
ingredients used in beers.

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:39.179
And so a lot of the cool stuff
being thrown in beer that maybe

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:40.570
people didn't think about.

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:42.820
And I think that that really
comes to the authenticity

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:43.320
piece.

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.580
So if the consumer
thinks that it's

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:48.389
a great idea for real and
not just something cheesy

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:52.219
and marketable, then that's
where trends can start

00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:53.139
and stuff like that.

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:56.782
But I think that's
the real deal.

00:34:56.782 --> 00:34:58.240
The future trends
of beer are going

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.970
to be more about the
beer itself and what

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:03.020
goes behind it and the
breweries that do it

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:06.540
than the specific beer or
gimmick that might be there

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.719
for some other
breweries as well.

00:35:08.719 --> 00:35:09.260
DAVID: Great.

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.110
And then last
question for me is,

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:13.450
so you mentioned 2,000 new
breweries have opened up

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:14.390
over the years.

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:16.770
And there's almost
500 in California.

00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:19.470
Do you think the beer
market is saturated?

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:22.020
Do you think it's a bubble?

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:23.900
Just more and more
keep opening up.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:26.670
NIKOS RIDGE: Yeah, I don't
think it's saturated, for sure.

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:30.370
I mean, the craft consumption
in the United States

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:32.785
still under 20% of
total beer consumed.

00:35:32.785 --> 00:35:35.150
There's a lot of
opportunity there.

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:38.580
I think like any
bubble scenario--

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.160
there might be people
getting into the industry

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:46.230
right now that maybe think it's
easier than it is because it

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:48.750
has been a growing industry,
or maybe coming into it

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:52.215
for different reasons than
wanting to make great beer,

00:35:52.215 --> 00:35:55.360
and put in all the work that
it takes to get to that point.

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.919
So I think we'll definitely get
to a point where some of that

00:35:57.919 --> 00:35:59.710
will kind of work itself
out of the system.

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:01.918
And I know you guys have
probably never seen anything

00:36:01.918 --> 00:36:02.780
like that in tech.

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:08.230
But yeah, I think there's a
lot of room for a lot more beer

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:11.090
to be made in the United
States as people start

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:13.630
and continue to move
into drinking craft.

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:14.380
JAMIE FLOYD: Yeah.

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:18.710
I had a technical committee
meeting earlier this week

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:20.590
for the Brewers Association.

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:22.880
And one of the members of
the Brewers Association

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.420
said that there is
900 and, I think,

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:29.980
56 breweries in planning
currently in the United States.

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:33.670
So we're about to go 25%
more than we currently are.

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:37.080
So the reality of it is it's
like a restaurant or anything

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:37.580
else.

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:39.705
Restaurants have a one in
three chance of survival.

00:36:39.705 --> 00:36:41.810
I think, depending on
what your goals are,

00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:45.260
breweries have a good
chance of survival.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.690
But if you're a homebrewer
that doesn't really

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:50.970
have a lot of experience
in owning a restaurant,

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:54.040
or selling alcohol, or
knowing the industry

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:57.050
and your goal is to see your
beer on a Safeway shelf,

00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:58.950
it's going to be a tough
ride because there's

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:01.730
a lot obstacles in the
way of that goal based

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:04.310
on what your experience or
maybe your resources are.

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:06.986
But say you're a homebrewer
that's worked in a restaurant,

00:37:06.986 --> 00:37:08.610
your family owned a
restaurant, and you

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:11.410
want to open a little
local brewpub that

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:14.927
allows for your neighborhood
to come and really support you,

00:37:14.927 --> 00:37:16.510
and most of your
beer is sold on sight

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:19.470
so you're not behoven to
wholesale or distribution

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:23.420
chains, chain acquisitions
over large stores.

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:24.670
It just all depends.

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:27.210
Some people are prepared for
one style, and one for another.

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:29.630
The craft beer industry is huge.

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:31.220
James in our
marketing department,

00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:33.740
that I mentioned before, said
one of my favorite things,

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:38.710
which is that craft beer is one
of the last punk rock movements

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:40.072
left the United States.

00:37:40.072 --> 00:37:41.530
And I think a lot
of that has to do

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:44.430
with the amount of government
regulation that we have,

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:47.142
that there's a certain
aspect to who we are that has

00:37:47.142 --> 00:37:48.725
to be a very specific way.

00:37:48.725 --> 00:37:50.100
But outside of
that, we're really

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:54.330
open in a way that
original American spirit

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:56.570
entrepreneurship or
capitalism, whatever you want,

00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:58.860
in which people get to be
themselves and really create

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:01.490
business plans that are
marketed towards their passions

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:02.850
and drives.

00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:07.060
And I think that the
more that people resonate

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:09.397
with the stories and the
qualities of the beers

00:38:09.397 --> 00:38:11.230
that are made, then the
more that that story

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:12.570
keeps perpetuating itself.

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:15.670
So there's going to
be a continuance.

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:18.270
And I don't think it's much the
chagrin of some of the larger

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:19.360
breweries in the world.

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.590
It's not going to
go back that way.

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:23.840
Those macrobreweries
had prohibition

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:28.370
on their side, in which
there were, I think,

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:31.790
20 years, 15 years before
prohibition there were 3,000

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:34.030
breweries in the United States.

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:36.530
Right before prohibition,
it had been reduced to 1,000

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:41.570
through what we see these days,
of conglomerations and people

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:43.620
buying each other out.

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:46.520
But when it came back, a
lot of breweries flourished

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:51.470
and a dramatic few
wrangled them all up

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:53.060
and created a
pretty small amount,

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.330
and basically
created the culture

00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:58.280
that drinking beer in
the US means one thing,

00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:59.310
and it's our beer.

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:01.170
And the difference is
between our branding

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:03.336
and the subtle differences
in the ingredients we use

00:39:03.336 --> 00:39:06.170
is the difference between beer.

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:08.730
And we're just a
different culture now.

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:10.730
Millennials don't care
what their parents drank.

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:12.150
And that's just a reality.

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:18.620
My dad spent seven years in
the Air Force, almost six of it

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:19.350
in Alaska.

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:21.730
He drank a lot of Rainier
and played a lot of cards,

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:23.850
and he, back then,
smoked cigarettes.

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:24.780
And I think of that.

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.605
My uncle drank Coors when he
made steaks in the backyard.

00:39:27.605 --> 00:39:30.320
And I have resonance
with that as a kid.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.430
But I also own a brewery.

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:33.430
So of course it's going
to have resonance to me.

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:36.290
But for the young drinking
community, and the people

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:39.700
as they come of age and decide
to get involved with beer,

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:40.930
they have different desires.

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:44.220
And it's going to be really
difficult for the macro world

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:45.370
to sort of take that out.

00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:48.920
So as long as we all love
creativity and craft beer

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:51.290
and sort of that
sense of independence,

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:52.600
it's going to go a long way.

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:54.500
And I really hope that
craft beer continues

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:55.610
to market itself that way.

00:39:55.610 --> 00:40:00.510
Because Sam Adams
isn't even the largest

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:02.680
US owned brewery because
it's publicly traded.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:05.580
So we don't really know even
what percentage of ownership

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:06.790
is-- or at least I don't.

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:07.640
I'm sure they do.

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:11.710
But we're the last
US owned breweries.

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:15.680
And the more that we get behind
that and think in that terms,

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:18.739
the more that it's a
success for everybody.

00:40:18.739 --> 00:40:19.280
DAVID: Great.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.580
So we have time for
three audience questions.

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:25.070
So if three people want
to come to the microphone

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:27.499
right here if you don't
mind and ask a question.

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:38.030
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:39.530
It's been really
interesting to hear

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:40.696
you talk about your brewery.

00:40:40.696 --> 00:40:45.160
I was wondering how many
different kinds of beer

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:47.280
are you brewing at any
given point in time?

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.960
And is it a continuous process?

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.580
So you're constantly
canning-- brewing and canning

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:52.970
and brewing and canning.

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:56.862
Or do you take
breaks in between?

00:40:56.862 --> 00:40:58.320
NIKOS RIDGE: We
brew 24 hours a day

00:40:58.320 --> 00:40:59.944
when we're brewing
within a given week,

00:40:59.944 --> 00:41:01.432
but it's not seven days a week.

00:41:01.432 --> 00:41:03.380
It depends on the brew
schedule for that week.

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:10.600
And typically between 7 and
12 beers going at a time.

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:14.200
And then throughout the year,
maybe 20 and 25 total beers,

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:17.180
depending on special projects
and single batch beers

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:18.480
and things like that.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:23.760
So we have a variety of
different things at a given

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:26.220
point-- yeast management,
different strains, all

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:29.130
that stuff plays into it.

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:32.521
We have a pretty flexible team
and a pretty flexible brewery

00:41:32.521 --> 00:41:33.020
setup.

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:35.545
So it allows us to be creative
and do a lot of things

00:41:35.545 --> 00:41:37.750
throughout the year.

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:39.820
JAMIE FLOYD: And we
have two brewhouses.

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:44.420
So neither one of the brewhouses
is functioning all week long.

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:47.240
So we split the
batchings between it

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:48.927
to keep for efficiency's sake.

00:41:48.927 --> 00:41:51.260
Although we were playing a
little bit with some of that.

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.790
But in general, we do
have two brewhouses.

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:58.860
So in addition to 24 hours
for a limited time period,

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:01.410
it's also separated between two
brewhouses across the street

00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:03.339
from each other.

00:42:03.339 --> 00:42:03.880
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:08.140
So you spent-- so
the yeast to space,

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:11.165
which is really cool--
I mean, we all-- I

00:42:11.165 --> 00:42:13.290
think we all would love to
do such a similar thing.

00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:16.100
But is there anything
different about the yeast?

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:19.030
Did it mutate from all the
extra radiation in space?

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:22.530
Or is there anything-- I
mean, you make a lot of beer.

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:25.570
So do you taste anything
different about this yeast

00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:27.750
than the yeast
before it went up?

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:30.970
Or is it just like, it's fun
because it went to space.

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:33.660
JAMIE FLOYD: Well, I mean, to be
clear, the goal of the project

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:35.785
was to send the yeast up
and have it back the same.

00:42:35.785 --> 00:42:38.350
As scientists, what we do
when we propagate yeast,

00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:39.980
we're not trying
to create mutants.

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:43.129
We're not trying to turn
people into lizard alien folks

00:42:43.129 --> 00:42:44.170
when they drink our beer.

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:44.820
NIKOS RIDGE: That'd be sweet.

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.194
JAMIE FLOYD: I
mean, it's be fun.

00:42:46.194 --> 00:42:48.200
That would be cool.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:51.890
But what we did do when we
got the yeast up and back is

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:54.730
that we made a batch
of IPA-- the beer

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:57.300
that we make that
makes up 50% to 55%

00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.530
of what we make in a
given period of time.

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:03.070
But we took a batch of that and
we diverted some of the wort

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:07.850
that we made into a separate,
basically 10 gallon, homebrew

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:08.590
batch size.

00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:11.210
And we had cropped up
the yeast and made beer

00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:15.592
with the same wort, with yeast
in space, yeast that we had

00:43:15.592 --> 00:43:16.800
so that we could check on it.

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.780
And it was the same,
as far as that goes.

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:23.460
I will say though, that second
ride was a cold one for it.

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:27.045
And the yeast was actually
cryogenic in a way.

00:43:27.045 --> 00:43:30.010
It froze while it
was up in space.

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:30.800
And it worked.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:34.850
But it was a big trip and it
took a little culturing up.

00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:38.710
So to that degree, the
yeast tastes the same,

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:41.610
but it took a lot of work to
get it back when it came back.

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:44.060
AUDIENCE: How high did it go
and how long was it up there?

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:45.410
JAMIE FLOYD: That's
a good question.

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:46.595
AUDIENCE: It was
suborbital, right?

00:43:46.595 --> 00:43:48.358
NIKOS RIDGE: 77 miles--
yup, suborbital.

00:43:48.358 --> 00:43:51.780
So 77 miles and about four
minutes outside of the--

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:54.680
JAMIE FLOYD: Yeah, so a 15
minute rocket cycle basically,

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:58.810
where it launches up, spends
about four minutes in space,

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:01.060
and then it takes
a good 10 minutes

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:05.250
to get back between the
different levels of return

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:07.870
so it slows down and doesn't
hit at maximum impact.

00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:08.960
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:09.501
DAVID: Great.

00:44:09.501 --> 00:44:11.019
And last audience question.

00:44:11.019 --> 00:44:11.852
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:44:11.852 --> 00:44:14.230
Yeah, sorry-- two
quick questions.

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:18.020
So one, what do you make of
the trend in hard ciders?

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:21.280
And two, are you doing
anything about the drought?

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:23.362
Or has the drought affected you?

00:44:23.362 --> 00:44:24.820
NIKOS RIDGE: Hard
ciders are great.

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:26.617
It seems to be growing.

00:44:26.617 --> 00:44:28.450
And I think there's a
lot of cider drinkers.

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:29.160
I'm excited.

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:32.040
We have a couple new
cideries in our area

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.268
that are focusing on more
traditional European styles

00:44:35.268 --> 00:44:37.455
of cider, which are
a little dryer, which

00:44:37.455 --> 00:44:39.160
I'm not a big sweet cider fan.

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.834
So I think that's
going to continue.

00:44:40.834 --> 00:44:42.917
I think it's a great, sort
of new, creative avenue

00:44:42.917 --> 00:44:45.860
for a lot of people.

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:48.454
And then-- second question?

00:44:48.454 --> 00:44:49.620
AUDIENCE: About the drought.

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:50.828
NIKOS RIDGE: Oh, the drought.

00:44:50.828 --> 00:44:54.982
So Oregon has less snow
pack than a lot of years,

00:44:54.982 --> 00:44:56.440
but where we live,
in Eugene, we're

00:44:56.440 --> 00:45:00.900
fortunate to have access to
consistent and one of the best,

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:03.810
actually, water sources in
the country via the Cascade

00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:05.240
Range and the McKenzie River.

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.800
And so Oregon's
topography and geology

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.050
are different than California.

00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:12.875
So even if we don't get snow,
our ground's a lot more porous.

00:45:12.875 --> 00:45:15.168
So we get a lot more
collection, versus the granite

00:45:15.168 --> 00:45:17.126
you guys have here, which
if you don't get snow

00:45:17.126 --> 00:45:18.970
that it runs directly
out into the ocean.

00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:20.930
So where we're at
in Oregon, we're

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:27.440
really fortunate to have access
to a consistent and future

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.107
supply of water.

00:45:28.107 --> 00:45:30.190
But it is going to be a
challenge for the industry

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:31.920
in a lot of places
and so it's definitely

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:35.250
a topical question in the
conversation that's going on.

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:36.000
JAMIE FLOYD: Yeah.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.450
To follow up with that.

00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:39.220
I used to make
cider at Steelhead.

00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:42.030
And we actually have
a winery license.

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:46.960
And we'll make a little bit
of cider on-site to honor that

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.327
and to be able to sell
a little bit of cider

00:45:49.327 --> 00:45:50.160
at our tasting room.

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.630
It's sort of a
gluten free option.

00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:53.930
We work with some of
the local cideries

00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:55.900
already to have
cider for people who

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:57.250
visit that are in that state.

00:45:57.250 --> 00:46:00.510
But I will say with
the cider boom,

00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:03.520
new apple trees take five
years to produce fruit.

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:07.720
So with the huge run of
what's going on in cider,

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.920
your access to apples
is very limited.

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:12.150
So I'm currently working
with a farmer, who

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:15.520
is local in Eugene,
who has a press

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:18.450
and is looking for a place
to sell his apples in a very

00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:21.630
direct way, which is what I used
to have back in the Steelhead

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:27.760
days with a farm whose owner
sold the farm basically.

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.604
But we've now found
a new source to be

00:46:30.604 --> 00:46:31.770
able to do a little of that.

00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:34.890
But I don't really-- well,
every input good into a brewery

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:35.860
is a commodity.

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:39.660
And getting into the apple trade
would be a pretty hard thing

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:41.520
right now.

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:43.149
And then--

00:46:43.149 --> 00:46:44.190
NIKOS RIDGE: The drought.

00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:45.231
JAMIE FLOYD: The drought.

00:46:45.231 --> 00:46:47.750
Well, we're making a lot
more beer for you guys

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:52.180
in preparation-- I think
is a good way to put it.

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:56.100
But we're very
concerned for that.

00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:58.696
Nikos and I are not interested
in building breweries

00:46:58.696 --> 00:47:00.070
on the East Coast
or the Midwest.

00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:01.830
And we've seen some
of our older friends

00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:04.160
step up and do those
sorts of things.

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.490
And I will say, I got to
give them a little credit

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:08.870
for-- I wouldn't have
thought about a big drought

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:12.580
and being told that you had
to produce 25% than last year.

00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:15.410
They can put that into capacity
in their new facilities

00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:19.270
that have had, in some cases,
really giant snow years.

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:22.536
So I don't know if that was part
of their plan, but good on them

00:47:22.536 --> 00:47:24.660
because they're going to
be less effected than some

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:27.319
of the other breweries
that are local.

00:47:27.319 --> 00:47:27.860
DAVID: Great.

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:29.340
So we have a few
trivia questions.

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:33.140
If you win trivia, you
get a poster from John.

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:34.810
So let's see who was
paying attention.

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:36.720
You don't have to go to the
mic, you can just shout it out.

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:37.980
JAMIE FLOYD: Can I just
talk about that real quick--

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:38.700
about the poster?

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:39.350
DAVID: Oh, yeah.

00:47:39.350 --> 00:47:40.766
JAMIE FLOYD: Neil
Williams is what

00:47:40.766 --> 00:47:44.900
we call a gig artists, in
which he does concert posters.

00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:48.880
He's worked with Dave
Matthews, and, boy,

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:53.220
Interpol, Trombone Shorty,
Galactic-- all kinds of bands.

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:55.290
And he recently moved
to Eugene and worked

00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:57.760
on the project for us-- for
all the artwork that's here.

00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:01.130
So these are all hand screen
printed by the artist.

00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:04.450
And they also glow in the dark
because we're rad like that.

00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:07.610
And anyway, I just wanted
to give a little plug

00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:09.390
to the artwork because
that's another fun

00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:10.931
and giant piece of
this whole project

00:48:10.931 --> 00:48:13.080
was putting it all
together that way.

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:15.307
There it is, Vanna White.

00:48:15.307 --> 00:48:15.890
DAVID: Oh yes.

00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:16.730
So feel free to shout it out.

00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:18.688
