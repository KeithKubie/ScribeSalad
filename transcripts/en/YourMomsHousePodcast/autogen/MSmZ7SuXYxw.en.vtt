me I've thought a lot about it you know
 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.070
me I've thought a lot about it you know
I think of it like um you know in the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080
I think of it like um you know in the
 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.020
I think of it like um you know in the
Bible they say that Moses went up to

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030
Bible they say that Moses went up to
 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.899
Bible they say that Moses went up to
Mount Sinai mm-hmm and he received the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909
Mount Sinai mm-hmm and he received the
 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.520
Mount Sinai mm-hmm and he received the
Ten Commandments from God

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
Ten Commandments from God
 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.580
Ten Commandments from God
and when he came down he had to wear a

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590
and when he came down he had to wear a
 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.840
and when he came down he had to wear a
mask mm-hmm because the information that

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850
mask mm-hmm because the information that
 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.539
mask mm-hmm because the information that
he had received in the proximity to God

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549
he had received in the proximity to God
 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.020
he had received in the proximity to God
was so intense that he had like crazy

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030
was so intense that he had like crazy
 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.840
was so intense that he had like crazy
beams of light like shooting out of his

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850
beams of light like shooting out of his
 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.670
beams of light like shooting out of his
countenance and that if he had come down

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680
countenance and that if he had come down
 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.160
countenance and that if he had come down
with his regular face that they would

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170
with his regular face that they would
 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.359
with his regular face that they would
have blinded the people they wouldn't

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369
have blinded the people they wouldn't
 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.440
have blinded the people they wouldn't
been able to see him so he came down

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450
been able to see him so he came down
 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.940
been able to see him so he came down
with a mask with the ten commandments so

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950
with a mask with the ten commandments so
 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.139
with a mask with the ten commandments so
it's kind of an interesting image like

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.230

table yeah and it's like you know so so
in this analogy putting the money on the

00:27:55.359 --> 00:27:55.369
in this analogy putting the money on the
 

00:27:55.369 --> 00:27:57.669
in this analogy putting the money on the
roulette table is developing a skill set

00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679

lot of money a lot of cash a that you
 

00:28:08.509 --> 00:28:10.149
lot of money a lot of cash a that you
can put down on the table and bet you

00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159
