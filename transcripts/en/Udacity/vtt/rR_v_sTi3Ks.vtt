00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.852
Even though a piecewise functions probably feel unfamiliar at this point.

00:00:03.852 --> 00:00:06.903
You've actually met a function before which can be written as a piecewise

00:00:06.903 --> 00:00:11.053
function. It's the absolute value function, remember that it has this V shape

00:00:11.053 --> 00:00:15.851
Now how can we define this as a piecewise function? Fill in the function that's

00:00:15.851 --> 00:00:19.328
obeyed when x is less than 0 and the one that's obeyed when x is greater than

00:00:19.328 --> 00:00:24.882
or equal to 0. Just a hint, you cannot get away with putting the absolute value

00:00:24.882 --> 00:00:29.213
of x in both of these boxes. I want to know what different functions show up in

00:00:29.213 --> 00:00:30.860
these two different regions.
