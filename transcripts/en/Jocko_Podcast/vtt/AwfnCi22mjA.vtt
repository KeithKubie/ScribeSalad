00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.900
What's the best approach to managing people that outperform you?

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.210
Okay.
I think this is a simple question as well.

3
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.260
What you do in this situation is you give them all the support you can and let

4
00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:14.500
them run.
I'm,
I'm happy if someone's outperformed me.
That's great.

5
00:00:14.501 --> 00:00:16.840
You know what else I'll do?
Try and learn from them and see what they're doing.

6
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.040
Try and spread the word.

7
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.430
If I'm in a leadership position and someone's doing outperforming everyone,

8
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.250
great.
How can we take that?
How can we teach to everyone else?

9
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.330
How can I give them supports?
They can run even faster.
This is no factor to me.

10
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.040
I love it.
You should be surrounding.

11
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.200
The more people you can bring on your team that outperform you,

12
00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:34.390
the better you're going to do.
True

13
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.910
check.
Easy money.
Next question.
Next.
Yeah.

14
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.570
It's hard though.
You know,
and I know you're going to say,
oh,

15
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.310
am I going to say it?
That voice,
is it not true?
We know it's your ego.

16
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.510
It's a hundred presenting ago.

17
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.430
When you can't support somebody that's doing better than you.
It's 100% ego.

18
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.890
Why else would you not support them?
They're helping the team win.

19
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.040
You're helping everyone do better.
Why would you not support them?

20
00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:03.970
Because your ego,
because you're like,
Ooh,
that hurts.
Yeah,
I want to be the guy.

21
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.170
And you know what you look like.

22
00:01:05.171 --> 00:01:10.171
Then you look like a jealous baby little baby or the day baby.

23
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.020
You literally look jealous little baby because you're trying to hold them back

24
00:01:14.021 --> 00:01:18.890
and everyone can see it and everyone can tell it.
Just don't be that person,
man.

25
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.870
That's a good point right there.
Everyone can tell that.

26
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.080
Everyone can see what's going on.

27
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.120
It's one of those dichotomies is,

28
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.220
is that people can be so ignorant to things and yet so perceptive to things.

29
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.720
So,
and the things like that,
they're so perceptive to echo,

30
00:01:37.721 --> 00:01:39.700
doesn't like to see Jocko out shine him.

31
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.790
That's why he's trying to hold them back.
Oh,
he's not sending him on that trip.

32
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.260
We're just going to wait and when that deal,
oh,
he's going to go instead.
Yeah.

33
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.520
Hey,
I won the deal guys.
Yeah,
I'm great.
No wrong.

34
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.020
And even down to the smallest little things like that,
you know,
hey,
um,
you know,

35
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.040
I don't know.
We'll see.
John is the guys your subordinate,
right?

36
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.000
You're jealous level cause he's cause he's dope.

37
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.990
And when someone gives John a compliment about how good he did,

38
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.440
just the little looking on your face.
So obviously you don't know,

39
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.420
you know how you say some people are or people are so ignorant of some things

40
00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:14.254
and still perceptive.

41
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.940
They're ignorant about this stuff when it places them [inaudible] somebody else

42
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.430
is like,
yeah,
you know,
I'll point those out all day.
Good points.

43
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.280
Like when people need,
I got this Sam Harris,
he pointed,

44
00:02:24.281 --> 00:02:28.000
he had this example where name dropping when you're,
you know,
when you,

45
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.110
when you do some name dropping,
not everyone,
but most people,
it's like,

46
00:02:32.111 --> 00:02:35.260
it's easier to recognize it when other people need a job done when they do

47
00:02:35.261 --> 00:02:39.280
themselves.
You know,
so funny.
It's all true.
And there's,

48
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.850
if I name drop I immediately feel like a flush of just disgust.

49
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.750
Oh my God,
I just did that.
Oh that's so bad.
Yet it's true.

50
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.410
So bad.
But it's hard to kind of,
you know,
you know,
speaking of that,

51
00:02:53.411 --> 00:02:56.920
I was just texting back and forth with Tim Ferris and Joe Rogan the other day

52
00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.880
named job.
I'm just kidding.
That's how you know that's a,

53
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.290
that's um,
excessive name drop.
When you say their first and their last name,

54
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:07.770
that's it.
You know,
and then we'll,
I don't know what's worse.

55
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.420
Hey knows I was just texting.
I just got a text from Tim.

56
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:13.450
He was letting me know about that.
Yeah,
you're right.
Tim.
Who?
Tim Ferris.

57
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.460
Joel Hogan,
my boy.
We were kicking it old school that's like,

58
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.550
I'm like pseudo advanced name dropping where,

59
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.640
where you say the first name like that but like,

60
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.830
like amateur name dropping his first and last name.

61
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.090
So I was actually black belt name dropping first name.

62
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.310
First name base.
Yeah.
Actually more like one straight white belt.
You know,

63
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.260
it's just a little bit more advanced.
It's still name dropping is,

64
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.380
what's the height?
Is there a way to appropriately name drop somehow?

65
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.040
How do you do that?
I,
I'm sure there is,
say their name.

66
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.460
I was talking to someone the other day,
so this is a similar situation.

67
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.530
I was talking to,
you know,
met some people the other day and,
and,

68
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.610
and the girl says,
you will,
you know,
oh yeah,

69
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.390
we were talking about the east coast and she said,
Oh yeah,
I went to college,

70
00:03:57.391 --> 00:04:00.100
I went to college in Cambridge and it was,
you know,
it's a good place.

71
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.320
And I was thinking myself,
I didn't,
I,
you know,
Oh,
where'd you go to school?
No,

72
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.400
we'll leave it at that.
But that was sort of a high level job.

73
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.990
I lived in Cambridge.
That's where I went to college.
Yeah.
Yeah.

74
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.380
One fruit and crawling.
Just talk about going on out there.
Right,
right.

75
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.520
So I'm just,
you know,
oh,
what's that?
A high level.

76
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.300
Was it or was that just an honest conversation?
It might've been,

77
00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:26.560
just might've been just her not wanting to sound like,

78
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.910
you know,
hey,
you know,
right.
She didn't want to,

79
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.630
she didn't essentially want to name drop for the reason that people normally

80
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:37.330
named job.
But here's,

81
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.190
I think there is a weighted at like effectively in like legitimately if,

82
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:46.150
for lack of better term name drop.
And that's like if you,

83
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.390
if you cause name dropping,
typically speaking,
you know,

84
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.260
it's almost like a weak attempt at breezing over,
you know,

85
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.810
I'm fixing with Joel Rogan,
you know,

86
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.620
or they'll like say their little credentials,
you know?

87
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.650
But I think if you say,
you know,

88
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:05.830
I was texting with my friend and he was actually Joe Rogan,
you know that.

89
00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:09.420
And you make it like a point and concise like that,
not the,

90
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.520
this wasn't just anyone who was Joe,
you're actually excited about it.
Yes.

91
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:16.050
You know?
Exactly.
So that,
I think that's an effective way,
cause it Kinda,

92
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.230
you kinda can maintain your humility there.
But you know,
when people were like,

93
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.810
you're just texting with my boy,
Joe Rogan,
whatever kind of thing,
we're like,

94
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:24.550
I'm just no deal.
No big deal.

95
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.990
It'd be deeper.
