the Nobel box thank you very much
 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.440
the Nobel box thank you very much
it must be it must be an amazing

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450
it must be it must be an amazing

environment I tell you and we are

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920
environment I tell you and we are
 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.000
environment I tell you and we are
nobody's prepared for that kind of I

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010
nobody's prepared for that kind of I
 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.759
nobody's prepared for that kind of I
must say it sounds quite calm around you

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769
must say it sounds quite calm around you
 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.920
must say it sounds quite calm around you
now yeah in the background it sounds

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930
now yeah in the background it sounds
 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.660
now yeah in the background it sounds
calm the background yeah because I've

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670
calm the background yeah because I've
 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.450
calm the background yeah because I've
been put in a home you know so nobody

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460
been put in a home you know so nobody
 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.620
been put in a home you know so nobody
can bother me going back to that

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630
can bother me going back to that
 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.250
can bother me going back to that
breakthrough in 1985 mm-hmm was there a

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260
breakthrough in 1985 mm-hmm was there a
 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.319
breakthrough in 1985 mm-hmm was there a
Eureka moment when you suddenly realized

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329
Eureka moment when you suddenly realized
 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.709
Eureka moment when you suddenly realized
how you could improve the the pulse

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719
how you could improve the the pulse
 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.549
how you could improve the the pulse
length so shortened the pulse length

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559
length so shortened the pulse length
 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.990
length so shortened the pulse length
became you know in different steps you

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000
became you know in different steps you
 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.260
became you know in different steps you
come in different steps and in fact he

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270
come in different steps and in fact he
 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.319
come in different steps and in fact he
can very very kind of naturally with

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329
can very very kind of naturally with
 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.840
can very very kind of naturally with
what I was doing so we wanted to amplify

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850
what I was doing so we wanted to amplify
 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.380
what I was doing so we wanted to amplify
there a very short pulses you know in

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390
there a very short pulses you know in
 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.109
there a very short pulses you know in
order to get more fit power okay because

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119
order to get more fit power okay because
 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.080
order to get more fit power okay because
you know power is energy divided by time

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090
you know power is energy divided by time
 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.929
you know power is energy divided by time
and so if you want to get lots per peak

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939
and so if you want to get lots per peak
 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.320
and so if you want to get lots per peak
power then you you try to get pulses

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330
power then you you try to get pulses
 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.429
power then you you try to get pulses
shorter and shorter and shorter okay

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439
shorter and shorter and shorter okay
 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:30.200
shorter and shorter and shorter okay
so trying to do that you know you so you

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210
so trying to do that you know you so you
 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.800
so trying to do that you know you so you
when you amplify your pulse you come to

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810
when you amplify your pulse you come to
 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.569
when you amplify your pulse you come to
a point where in you know battier oil is

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579
a point where in you know battier oil is
 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.660
a point where in you know battier oil is
breaking down on the laser yes so you

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670
breaking down on the laser yes so you
 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.120
breaking down on the laser yes so you
have to reduce the power but not change

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130
have to reduce the power but not change
 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.490
have to reduce the power but not change
the energy right I mean you have to

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500
the energy right I mean you have to
 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.679
the energy right I mean you have to
reduce the power without changing the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689
reduce the power without changing the
 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.240
reduce the power without changing the
energy without changing well your total

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250
energy without changing well your total
 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.310
energy without changing well your total
energy of the pork okay because you want

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320
energy of the pork okay because you want
 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.060
energy of the pork okay because you want
to do that efficiently so I you know I

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070
to do that efficiently so I you know I
 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.719
to do that efficiently so I you know I
just can say well maybe we can stretch

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729
just can say well maybe we can stretch
 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.650
just can say well maybe we can stretch
the pause we stretch the pulse and I we

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660
the pause we stretch the pulse and I we
 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.750
the pause we stretch the pulse and I we
knew how to do that because we were

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760
knew how to do that because we were
 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.110
knew how to do that because we were
working on

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120
working on
 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.530
working on
Leon very short pulses and you knew how

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540
Leon very short pulses and you knew how
 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.170
Leon very short pulses and you knew how
to stretch pulses by using diffraction

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180
to stretch pulses by using diffraction
 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.449
to stretch pulses by using diffraction
gratings and so on so we stretch the

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459
gratings and so on so we stretch the
 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.089
gratings and so on so we stretch the
pause and of course immediately the peak

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099
pause and of course immediately the peak
 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.520
pause and of course immediately the peak
power decreased and and then we could

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530
power decreased and and then we could
 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.270
power decreased and and then we could
amplify the post much better much much

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280
amplify the post much better much much
 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.420
amplify the post much better much much
better and and then we we had to

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430
better and and then we we had to
 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.119
better and and then we we had to
compress it back so he came he came you

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129
compress it back so he came he came you
 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:44.190
compress it back so he came he came you
know by by step you know yes sir and

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200
know by by step you know yes sir and
 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.559
know by by step you know yes sir and
what do you give me an example of the

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569
what do you give me an example of the
 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.000
what do you give me an example of the
one of the most exciting things we can

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010
one of the most exciting things we can
 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.940
one of the most exciting things we can
do with these ultra-fast lasers well

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950
do with these ultra-fast lasers well
 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.880
do with these ultra-fast lasers well
what we can do is to instant accelerate

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890
what we can do is to instant accelerate
 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.479
what we can do is to instant accelerate
particles yeah we can accelerate the

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489
particles yeah we can accelerate the
 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.750
particles yeah we can accelerate the
particle with a really stunning

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760
particle with a really stunning
 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.009
particle with a really stunning
efficiency so instead of using

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019
efficiency so instead of using
 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.009
efficiency so instead of using
kilometers don't work zero it particles

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019
kilometers don't work zero it particles
 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.330
kilometers don't work zero it particles
right like it's you know we could use

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340
right like it's you know we could use
 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.099
right like it's you know we could use
systems with laser which will already

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109
systems with laser which will already
 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:18.599
systems with laser which will already
take only centimeters and you know

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609
take only centimeters and you know
 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.509
take only centimeters and you know
accelerators as a lot of applications

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519
accelerators as a lot of applications
 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.379
accelerators as a lot of applications
you know in the medical world okay

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389
you know in the medical world okay
 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.409
you know in the medical world okay
because they boat you want to create

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419
because they boat you want to create
 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:31.050
because they boat you want to create
Solferino for therapy okay there are t

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060
Solferino for therapy okay there are t
 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.729
Solferino for therapy okay there are t
you like try to maybe use radioisotopes

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739
you like try to maybe use radioisotopes
 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.979
you like try to maybe use radioisotopes
you know but every time one you want to

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989
you know but every time one you want to
 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.909
you know but every time one you want to
do that you have you know you have some

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919
do that you have you know you have some
 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.939
do that you have you know you have some
time to go outside

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:43.949
time to go outside
 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:50.960
time to go outside
so this is all poisons are made you know

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970
so this is all poisons are made you know
 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.599
so this is all poisons are made you know
by reactors which are far away and so on

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609
by reactors which are far away and so on
 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.479
by reactors which are far away and so on
so it's difficult to bring them back at

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489
so it's difficult to bring them back at
 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.080
so it's difficult to bring them back at
the patient's bed but now if you really

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090
the patient's bed but now if you really
 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.979
the patient's bed but now if you really
make this actually a very compact you

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989
make this actually a very compact you
 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.520
make this actually a very compact you
can put that then in hospitals and

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530
can put that then in hospitals and
 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.280
can put that then in hospitals and
because they are compact you know you

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290
because they are compact you know you
 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.159
because they are compact you know you
can multiply them you know and you can

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169
can multiply them you know and you can
 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:15.110
can multiply them you know and you can
have one

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120
have one
 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.000
have one
there are fit all very possibly

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010
there are fit all very possibly
 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.270
there are fit all very possibly
described it's a most lovely example of

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280
described it's a most lovely example of
 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.480
described it's a most lovely example of
a such a successful interaction between

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490
a such a successful interaction between
 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.490
a such a successful interaction between
basic science and applied science the

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500
basic science and applied science the

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389
and and how utterly codependent they are
 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.420
and and how utterly codependent they are
you cannot do it without the basic rules

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430
you cannot do it without the basic rules
 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.540
you cannot do it without the basic rules
yeah yeah and it's so exciting that

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550
yeah yeah and it's so exciting that
 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.980

this is not a PhD I don't know of

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409
this is not a PhD I don't know of
 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:07.439
this is not a PhD I don't know of
another example where somebody's first

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.449
another example where somebody's first
