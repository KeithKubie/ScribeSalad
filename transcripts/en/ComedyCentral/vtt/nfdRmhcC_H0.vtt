Mr. Bobby Lee,
everybody!

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.360
I used to be on a show
called MADtv.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.160
[cheers and applause]

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.000
It was kind of like SNL 
but for Mexicans.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.440
12 Mexicans
watched that show,

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.260
so if you're a fan,
Hola, que tal?

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.480
So I was really excited
getting booked on a TV show

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.840
because I'm a fat
ethnic guy, right?

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.700
I didn't think
that could happen,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.520
and so maybe I'll get laid.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.240
You know, who knows?
You know?

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.940
So I show up to MADtv, 
and they didn't use me at all.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.280
I'd play, like,
Chinese Waiter Number Two.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.720
They gave me one word to say,
like, "Hello."

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.780
"Cut.
Bobby, you're a wrap."

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.540
"Thank you so much.
I'm gonna kill myself."

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.580
So over the months,
I developed an eating disorder.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.340
I couldn't stop
eating Vicodin.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.360
That shit is delicious.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.440
And it started out
with, like, five a day, right?

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.340
I eventually took 40 a day,
and I'm a small dude,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.760
and the reason
why it didn't kill me,

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.720
because Asians
are evolved.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.820
We have a stronger core
than all of you,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.340
and we're smarter.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.820
I've never met an Asian guy
with Downs Syndrome,

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.280
but if I did, I bet you money
he's just as smart

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.480
as the average white guy.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.080
Instead of straight As,
he gets straight Bs.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.540
He only knows
one instrument.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.720
40 a day, and, you know,
it was a disease,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.040
and it got worse
and worse.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.460
Like, we would have table reads
at 9:00 in the morning,

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.920
right, on Fox,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.420
and I'd be in a strip club
in Tijuana,

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.440
like, onstage dancing like--

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.980
"[bleep] yeah."

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.720
And so after
about two years of this,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.660
they--like,
it drove them crazy, right,

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.320
so they gave me an intervention,
right, which they're nice.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.200
They're nice,
good people, right?

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.240
So I sat in an office.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.460
They say, "You're doing
too many drugs,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.560
"and we want you to stop,

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.660
"and we'll give you
one more shot.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.120
"And we wrote you
a Connie Chung sketch.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.980
Can you do it?"
I go, "[bleep] yeah.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.780
I'm gonna [bleep] do it."

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.460
So that was
on a Wednesday.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.420
On a Thursday, a comedian
by the name of Duncan Trussell--

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.900
he's very talented--
came to my house.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.040
Yeah, he's very talented.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.860
He took all my Vicodin
and just ran away.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.400
What an ass[bleep].

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.800
And so all was fine
for about five minutes,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.420
but then all of a sudden,
I got the shakes for 12 hours.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.440
So on Friday, I show up,
and I'm shaking,

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.540
but in front of the producers,
I'm fine.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.720
My face--completely fine,
because I'm a good actor.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.100
Would you not agree?
Yeah.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.580
So I'm in makeup, right?
And I'm sitting in makeup.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.040
And I'm sweating so bad
the Connie Chung makeup

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.440
is dripping off my face.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.340
So I'm sitting there,
and all of a sudden,

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.940
I hear a noise
in my stomach.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.200
It went like this.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.260
[slurping noise]

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.940
And then I told the makeup--
"No, I just ate a banana.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.120
I'm really hungry,
you know?"

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.040
But it was really the Vicodin,
the detox, right?

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.520
So I show up onstage.
There's 400 people.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.060
I'm sitting there
with the Connie Chung.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.940
Now, I have three pages
of dialogue

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.240
I was supposed to memorize.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.820
I knew six words,
all right?

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:56.900
So I hear this:

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.660
"Five, four, three,
two, one, action."

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.340
I said, "Good evening.
I'm Connie Chung,"

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.260
and then I shit my pants.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.820
Down my stockings.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.400
The audience went...

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.560
[gasping]

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.000
Which is what you do
when somebody shits their pants.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.820
And I knew
right then and there

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.060
my career was over.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.600
From one night,
it's over.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.780
Ten years of hard work, okay?

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.620
But I was fine with it,
'cause I wanted to get sober.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.980
The producer Dick came up
and goes,

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.320
"Pack your stuff,"
so I went to the dressing room.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.640
I packed all my stuff.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.300
I was literally crying,
and I was so sick, guys.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.840
I was about to die.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.540
And I went to a rehab
the next day,

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.180
and then a couple
of months later,

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.720
they found out
that I was sober, right,

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.540
so they hired me back
on the show.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.520
And I stayed on the show--
thank you--

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.700
for six more years,

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.660
and I just celebrated
12 years of sobriety.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.160
Clap your [bleep] hands.
Clap your hands.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.660
[cheers and applause]

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.730
Thank you so much, guys.
Thank you so much.
