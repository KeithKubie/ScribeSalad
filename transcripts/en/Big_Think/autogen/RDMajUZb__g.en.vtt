00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:04.640
first is a DNA vaccine which is called

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650
first is a DNA vaccine which is called
 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.379
first is a DNA vaccine which is called
ad vax which is we first tested I'm 2003

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389
ad vax which is we first tested I'm 2003
 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.310
ad vax which is we first tested I'm 2003
2004 and DNA vaccines are wonderful in

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320
2004 and DNA vaccines are wonderful in
 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.920
2004 and DNA vaccines are wonderful in
that they are very safe they're cheap

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930
that they are very safe they're cheap
 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.109
that they are very safe they're cheap
they don't require a cold chain they

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119
they don't require a cold chain they
 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.480
they don't require a cold chain they
work great in mice and they don't work

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490
work great in mice and they don't work
 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.790
work great in mice and they don't work
very well in people so we tested that

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800
very well in people so we tested that
 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.580
very well in people so we tested that
and it was modestly immunogenic which is

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590
and it was modestly immunogenic which is
 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.009
and it was modestly immunogenic which is
as good as one might hope for DNA

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019
as good as one might hope for DNA
 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.560
as good as one might hope for DNA
vaccines but the idea was that would be

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570
vaccines but the idea was that would be
 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.100
vaccines but the idea was that would be
combined with at mva which is based on

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110
combined with at mva which is based on
 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.110
combined with at mva which is based on
the smallpox vaccine its modified

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120
the smallpox vaccine its modified
 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.630
the smallpox vaccine its modified
vaccinia ankara so we know that the

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640
vaccinia ankara so we know that the
 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.520
vaccinia ankara so we know that the
smallpox vaccine induces good immunity

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530
smallpox vaccine induces good immunity
 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.560
smallpox vaccine induces good immunity
so the idea like what the adenoviral

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570
so the idea like what the adenoviral
 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.319
so the idea like what the adenoviral
vector is to use the smallpox vaccine as

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329
vector is to use the smallpox vaccine as
 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.690
vector is to use the smallpox vaccine as
a vector and so that's what we did and

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700
a vector and so that's what we did and
 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.600
a vector and so that's what we did and
we conducted a trial of that alone and

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610
we conducted a trial of that alone and
 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.049
we conducted a trial of that alone and
then a small trial of the two together

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059
then a small trial of the two together
 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.490
then a small trial of the two together
those are being moved forward by dr. ho

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500
those are being moved forward by dr. ho
 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.860
those are being moved forward by dr. ho
and his team in China and they're moving

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870
and his team in China and they're moving
 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.779
and his team in China and they're moving
into advanced development so you have

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789
into advanced development so you have
 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.369
into advanced development so you have
phase 1 trials which is what we

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379
phase 1 trials which is what we
 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.800
phase 1 trials which is what we
conducted which are largely safety we

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810
conducted which are largely safety we
 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.359
conducted which are largely safety we
also of course looked at immunogenicity

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369
also of course looked at immunogenicity
 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.320
also of course looked at immunogenicity
because we're not going to give

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330
because we're not going to give
 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.390
because we're not going to give
something to people and not figure out

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400
something to people and not figure out
 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.370
something to people and not figure out
if it's doing something and then they

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380
if it's doing something and then they
 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.830
if it's doing something and then they
move into larger trials and in order to

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840
move into larger trials and in order to
 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.929
move into larger trials and in order to
move into larger trials you have to move

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939
move into larger trials you have to move
 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.280
move into larger trials you have to move
into a population of people who are

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290
into a population of people who are
 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.440
into a population of people who are
getting infected because you're starting

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450
getting infected because you're starting
 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.330
getting infected because you're starting
to look for efficacy so these vaccines

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340
to look for efficacy so these vaccines
 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.039
to look for efficacy so these vaccines
were always designed to move forward for

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049
were always designed to move forward for
 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.410
were always designed to move forward for
efficacy trials into China because of

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420
efficacy trials into China because of
 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.780
efficacy trials into China because of
the number of infections in the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790
the number of infections in the
 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.399
the number of infections in the
developing world versus the United

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409
developing world versus the United
 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.490
developing world versus the United
States most efficacy trials have been

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500
States most efficacy trials have been
 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.590
States most efficacy trials have been
and will continue to be conducted in the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600
and will continue to be conducted in the
 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.260
and will continue to be conducted in the
south of the developing world so I I

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270
south of the developing world so I I
 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.020

stay in New York you know I've been to
 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.940
stay in New York you know I've been to
China a couple of times but my work is

but we are developing a vaccine that

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290
but we are developing a vaccine that
 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.680
but we are developing a vaccine that
directly targets dendritic cells so i

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690
directly targets dendritic cells so i
 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.090
directly targets dendritic cells so i
think i mentioned earlier that for any

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100
think i mentioned earlier that for any
 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.860
think i mentioned earlier that for any
vaccine to work we know it has to get to

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870
vaccine to work we know it has to get to
 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.350
vaccine to work we know it has to get to
dendritic cells and you know you can

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360
dendritic cells and you know you can
 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.730
dendritic cells and you know you can
demonstrate with a lot of them that they

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740
demonstrate with a lot of them that they
 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.280
demonstrate with a lot of them that they
due to greater or lesser degrees but we

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290
due to greater or lesser degrees but we
 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.570
due to greater or lesser degrees but we
sort of decided to take the bull by the

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580
sort of decided to take the bull by the
 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.060
sort of decided to take the bull by the
horns and make a vaccine that knows how

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070
horns and make a vaccine that knows how
 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.890
horns and make a vaccine that knows how
to find dendritic cells so it's what's

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900
to find dendritic cells so it's what's
 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.500
to find dendritic cells so it's what's
called rational vaccine design and it's

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510
called rational vaccine design and it's
 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.630
called rational vaccine design and it's
I think it's brilliant and I can say

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640
I think it's brilliant and I can say
 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.010
I think it's brilliant and I can say
that because I didn't think of it I get

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020
that because I didn't think of it I get
 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.370
that because I didn't think of it I get
to conduct it but I didn't figure it out

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380
to conduct it but I didn't figure it out
 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.750
to conduct it but I didn't figure it out
the idea is we have a monoclonal

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760
the idea is we have a monoclonal
 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.390
the idea is we have a monoclonal
antibody that's directed against what's

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400
antibody that's directed against what's
 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.390
antibody that's directed against what's
called deck 205 and deck 205 is on

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400
called deck 205 and deck 205 is on
 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.490
called deck 205 and deck 205 is on
dendritic cells it's a marker it's

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500
dendritic cells it's a marker it's
 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.320
dendritic cells it's a marker it's
special on dendritic cells that was

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330
special on dendritic cells that was
 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.330
special on dendritic cells that was
discovered by Ralph and my friend and

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340
discovered by Ralph and my friend and
 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.860
discovered by Ralph and my friend and
colleague Michelle Knussen's like many

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870
colleague Michelle Knussen's like many
 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.110
colleague Michelle Knussen's like many
years ago so they made an antibody to it

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120
years ago so they made an antibody to it
 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.640
years ago so they made an antibody to it
so that antibody goes into the body and

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650
so that antibody goes into the body and
 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.730
so that antibody goes into the body and
immediately finds that receptor and so

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740
immediately finds that receptor and so
 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.580
immediately finds that receptor and so
then we've hooked up to that monoclonal

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590
then we've hooked up to that monoclonal
 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.870
then we've hooked up to that monoclonal
antibody genes are the antigen for HIV

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880
antibody genes are the antigen for HIV
 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.400
antibody genes are the antigen for HIV
the one we're starting with his gag

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410
the one we're starting with his gag
 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.560
the one we're starting with his gag
which is the core which is conserved in

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570
which is the core which is conserved in
 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.760
which is the core which is conserved in
there lots of reasons that's a good one

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770
there lots of reasons that's a good one
 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.440
there lots of reasons that's a good one
to start with so we have a monoclonal

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450
to start with so we have a monoclonal
 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.970
to start with so we have a monoclonal
antibody that knows how to find

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980
antibody that knows how to find
 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.750
antibody that knows how to find
dendritic cells hooked up to our HIV

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760
dendritic cells hooked up to our HIV
 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.790
dendritic cells hooked up to our HIV
antigen and this is a protein and so

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800
antigen and this is a protein and so
 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.590
antigen and this is a protein and so
we've been moving that concept forward

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600
we've been moving that concept forward
 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.530
we've been moving that concept forward
in small animals and now we are going to

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540
in small animals and now we are going to
 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.390
in small animals and now we are going to
be moving into the clinic and so we have

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400
be moving into the clinic and so we have
 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.950
be moving into the clinic and so we have
our first conversation about this with

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960
our first conversation about this with
 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.290
our first conversation about this with
the FDA in August and I'm hoping that

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300
the FDA in August and I'm hoping that
 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.450
the FDA in August and I'm hoping that
we'll be in the clinic by year's end so

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460
we'll be in the clinic by year's end so
 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.000
we'll be in the clinic by year's end so
the idea is we have to be smarter than

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010
the idea is we have to be smarter than
 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.540
the idea is we have to be smarter than
nature we can't because natural

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550
nature we can't because natural
 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.610
nature we can't because natural
infection doesn't confer protection we

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620
infection doesn't confer protection we
 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.160
infection doesn't confer protection we
have to figure a way around what the

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170
have to figure a way around what the
 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.920
have to figure a way around what the
virus that causes AIDS HIV has learned

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930
virus that causes AIDS HIV has learned
 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.350
virus that causes AIDS HIV has learned
how to do and to do that we want to

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360
how to do and to do that we want to
 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.390
how to do and to do that we want to
directly target dendritic cells the

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400
directly target dendritic cells the
 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.809
directly target dendritic cells the
cells that we know orchestrate immunity

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819
 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.879
