00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.130
I got a comment on the
video where we first

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.360
introduced parallax,
especially relative to stars.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.320
Essentially asking,
how do we know

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.700
that this angle and this
angle is always the same?

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.290
Or how do we know
that we're always

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.970
looking at an isosceles
triangle, where

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.430
this side is equal to this side?

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.820
It worked out for this example
that I drew right here.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.710
But what if the
star was over here?

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.100
What if the star was over here.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.800
Then if you just
look at it this way.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.170
If you take at this point,
the triangle is no longer,

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.900
it's clearly no longer,
an isosceles triangle.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.720
It looks more like a
scalene triangle, I guess,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.370
where all of the
sides are different.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.340
And so a lot of that
trigonometry won't apply.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.964
Because we won't be
able to assume that

00:00:43.964 --> 00:00:46.140
this is a right
triangle over here.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.100
And what I want to make
clear is that that is true.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.770
You would not be able
to pick these two

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.670
points during the year.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.500
These two points in our
orbit six months apart,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.210
in order to do the same math
that we did in the last video.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.110
In order to calculate
this and still

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.660
have an isosceles triangle,
what you want to do

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.590
is pick two different
points six months apart.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.860
So you want to do is if
this is the sun, you want

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.370
to pick two different
points six months apart,

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.580
where it does form an
isosceles triangle.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.220
So if this is the distance
from the sun to this other star

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.410
right over here,
you want to pick

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.040
a point in Earth's orbit
around the sun here.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.140
And then another point in
the orbit six months later,

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.980
which would put us
right over here.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.460
And if you do that, then we
are, now all of a sudden,

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.500
we are looking at
two right triangles,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.160
if we pick those
periods correctly.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.850
And the best way to think about
whether this is a perpendicular

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.450
angle, is you're going to try
to find the maximum parallax

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.050
from center in each
of these time periods.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.740
Here it's going to be maximally
shifted in one direction.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.690
And then when you go to
this six months later,

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.106
it's going to be maximally
shifted in the other direction.

00:02:00.106 --> 00:02:02.880
So to answer that question,
the observation is right.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.710
At exactly the middle of
summer in the middle of winter,

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.000
all stars will not form
an isosceles triangle

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.050
with the sun and the earth.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.730
But you could pick
other points in time

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.560
around the year six
months apart where

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.130
any star will form an
isosceles triangle.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.860
Hopefully you
found that helpful.
