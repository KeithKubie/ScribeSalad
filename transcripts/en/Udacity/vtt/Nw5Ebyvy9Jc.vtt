00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Well let's see. This is a right angle. This height is 1 m and this side over here is opposite the 30Â° angle.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We want to know about this distance, which is the hypotenuse like.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Why not that the sin 30 must be equal to the opposite side over the hypotenuse.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We call this unknown side while this is called x and look what we find.

00:00:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This distance d is equal to 2 m. We're on the verge of something amazing here.
