This episode of CrashCourse is brought
to you by SquareSpace.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.800
Hello. My name's Craig, and this is
CrashCourse Government and Politics, and today

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.520
we're gonna really figure out why the President
is the most powerful man in the world. Okay,

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.710
not really, I guess, obviously, the reason
he's the most powerful person in the world

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.949
is he leads what's currently the most powerful
nation in the world, and he can't really take

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.509
credit for America's global position.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.600
Besides, there's a good case to be made that
the richest man in the world is the most powerful,

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.180
and if we're talking cultural influence, then
who's more powerful than Kanye? According

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.539
to Kanye, no one. But rather than go down
the rabbit hole of power and the secret Cabal

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:40.100
that actually runs the world, let's talk about
the powers of the President that are not in

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.200
the Constitution, at least, not literally.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:51.140
[Theme Music]

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.160
So the Constitution lays out a specific limited
number of expressed powers, but the President's

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.660
able to do a lot more than what the Constitution
says. Expressed powers are sometimes called

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.089
'formal powers', but the President also has
informal powers that do not appear within

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:05.670
the written text of the Constitution. Sometimes
the powers he has are implied by the wording

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.470
of the Constitution, while sometimes, they're
considered inherent in the office of the Presidency,

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.380
which means that they flow logically from the ideas
in the Constitution. A little confusing, right?

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.260
Well, maybe the Thought Bubble can explain.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.560
Let's start easy with an expressed power,
which is not the same as an espresso power,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.750
which is what I'm currently running on. The
Constitution says right here in the text that

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.090
the President is the commander in chief of
the army and the navy. This also implies that

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.770
he can and perhaps will lead the armed forces
when the nation is at war. It also implies

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.259
that he can command the Air Force, even though
it only mentions the Army and Navy. So far,

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.950
so good, but what about when the nation is
not technically at war?

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.770
Remember that the Constitution gives Congress
the power to declare war as a check on Presidential

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.219
power, but the President still has the inherent
power to use troops even when Congress hasn't

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:45.729
actually formally declared war. Logically,
if there's an immediate threat to the US and

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.509
Congress doesn't have the time or the opportunity
to declare war, the Commander in Chief must

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.049
be able to use force. So this power is said
to be inherent in the office. The problem

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.390
is that once you grant that the President
must have the power to use troops, how do

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.570
you limit him? What sorts of threats are so
immediate and dangerous that the President

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.689
should have free reign to send troops? Other
than Martian invasions or Taco Tuesday riots,

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.619
obviously. If you look at most of the times
America has sent troops into conflict, especially

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.100
during the 20th and 21st centuries, it's been
done with him acting as Commander-in-Chief

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.720
without a formal declaration of war. We sent
troops to Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.560
twice to Iraq without Congress declaring war, and
these are just the big ones. We're not even gonna

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.720
talk about Grenada and Panama and all the other small
interventions, so is there any check on this power?

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.550
After Vietnam, Congress tried to put on the
brakes by passing a War Powers Resolution,

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.599
which requires the President to get authorization
to use troops within 60 days of when he first

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.659
commits them, or else he has to bring the
troops back. This sounds like a pretty powerful

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.759
check, but in practice, Congress always authorized
the President to use force. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.379
Sometimes I use force without being authorized.

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.620
The President has informal powers in foreign
policy, too. Formally, the Constitution says

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.450
the President has the power to make treaties, receive
foreign ambassadors, and appoint ambassadors

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.090
and ministers. The President has developed
the power to negotiate executive agreements,

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.150
which are nowhere in the Constitution. Executive
agreements are, well, they're agreements between

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.159
the US and foreign nations that look like
treaties but aren't formally treaties. They

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:05.220
can come with treats, though. Brownies. Cookies.
Trade concessions.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.670
The most important difference between an executive
agreement and a treaty is that the agreements

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.180
don't need to be ratified by 2/3rds of the
Senate, but they become valid with only a

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.659
majority of vote in both houses. This makes
them easier to pass than a formal treaty and

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.409
explains why Presidents prefer executive agreements
to treaties.

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.720
Lately, there have been some very important
executive agreements, like the general agreement

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.080
on tariffs and trade or GATT that has morphed
into the WTO, and the North American Free

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.620
Trade Agreement, better known as NAFTA, 'cause if it
were a treaty, it'd be NAFTT, and that would be NAFTY.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.480
Although it isn't mentioned in the Constitution,
the President is effectively the Chief Executive

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.349
Officer or CEO of the US. Where does this
power come from? Formally, it's in the faithfully

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.280
executed clause in the Presidential Oath of
Office, but more practically, it comes out

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.519
of his power to appoint judges, ambassadors,
and other ministers. Sorry, judges and ambassadors,

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.999
but when it comes to executive power, it's the
other ministers that matter here, because they're the

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.900
cabinet secretaries and other heads of administrative
agencies that make up the bulk of the government.

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:59.370
The President chooses agency heads that agree
with his policies- at least he hopes they

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.900
do. So his appointments shape the political
agenda. But more importantly, in appointing

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.870
the ministers, the President assumes an inherent
power to direct them and their agencies on

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.470
how to implement laws. This makes since. As
anyone who's ever worked for a boss knows,

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.560
once you're hired you're sort of expected
to know what your boss wants and to do it.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.400
This power to direct agencies and how to execute
laws is enormous. It basically directs the way the government acts.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.130
The President has pretty limited formal powers
over Congress. Other than convening special

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.320
sessions, and the veto, and the State of the
Union Address, maybe, he can't do all that

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.780
much to influence them. I mean Congress usually
meets without the President telling them to

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.490
and he almost never vetoes bills. But that
doesn't mean that the President doesn't have

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.950
a big informal role to play in the legislative
process.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.590
The President can attempt to set the legislative
agenda by making recommendations for laws

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.890
that he'd like to see passed. This is sometimes
called the Legislative Initiative, and in

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.800
practice it usually means that executive branch
officials will actually draft the legislation

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.180
they want and give it to Congress to refine
into something they can pass. This is what

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.050
happens with big agenda items like the Affordable
Care Act. You may know it as ObamaCare. Or

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.040
the Dodd-Frank Act, which, despite being named
for its two Congressional sponsors was actually

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.860
written with a lot of input from the White
House.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.010
I should note here that even though it might
look like the President is usurping legislative

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.670
power, Congress often gives its power to the
President willingly, because it wants to avoid

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.450
responsibility for unpopular policies. He
said it. I didn't say it. He said it. Also

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.340
this is pretty limited power for the President
because he can't force Congress to pass anything,

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.540
even if he wrote it and says "Please, please,
please, please, please." And because a President's

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.880
ability to move the agenda decreases as his
popularity decreases.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.660
There's another legislative power that the President
has that is probably the most important one.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.240
He can give executive orders. These are
presidential directives, or rules, that have

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.710
the force of law. Executive orders can be
overturned by actual Congressional lawmaking,

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.410
or by Supreme Court decisions. These executive
orders allow the President to circumvent the

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.110
legislative process and act unilaterally.
Ideally the President and Congress should

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.350
work together, but c'mon! Sometimes the President
decides to go it alone. 'Cause they're...

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.680
they don't work together that often. These
days anyway.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.150
Some really important policies have been made
by executive orders, including desegregating

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.210
the military and the creation of the Environmental
Protection Agency. But executive orders may

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.990
not be as durable as a law passed through
the normal channels. If the next president

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.180
in office disagrees with the order as a president
put in place, he or she can get rid of them

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.740
just as easily as his or her predecessor put
them in place.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.150
The other informal power the President has
is kind of obscure, but also pretty important.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.270
The President can impound the funds that Congress
has appropriated for certain programs or projects

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.480
if he doesn't want them implemented. More
generally, under his power to execute the

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.550
laws, he can order the bureaucracy to implement
policies in a certain specific way. Or sometimes

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.380
not at all. Although this can get him in to
trouble

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.620
There's one last inherent power I'll mention
that the President currently has and that's

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.370
executive privilege. There's probably more,
but no president has asserted them yet. Basically

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.130
this is the President's ability to keep information
secret by claiming that it's too important

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.220
to be revealed, usually for reasons of national
security. There's a check on executive privilege

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.580
though. It can be overturned by a court order
as happened in the landmark Supreme Court

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.750
case U.S. vs. Nixon. There they court ordered
Nixon to turn over tapes of his conversations

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.150
with aids that might have related to the Watergate
Scandal.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.780
So even though the President isn't given a
ton of power in the Constitution, the President

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.770
is pretty powerful. This is especially true
during war. Even if that war hasn't been declared.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.130
And this is a point you should remember. You
should remember everything I say, but you

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.020
should remember this too. Congress and the
American people are usually willing to defer

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.020
to the President on military matters and the inherent
powers of the Commander in Chief are enormous.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.920
Often increased presidential power has been
the result of a president seizing the initiative

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.470
and expanding his own inherent or implied
power. And once a president has established

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:13.830
an implied power, the next president's very
unlikely to do away with it. Oh, please, more

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.980
power? No thank you. But just as often as presidents
imply their own powers, Congress willingly hands

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.540
over more power. And that's what we're going to
talk about in the next episode. Thanks for watching.
