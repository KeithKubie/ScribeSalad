00:00:00.427 --> 00:00:01.384
- [Instructor] What we're going to do

00:00:01.384 --> 00:00:03.306
using our powers of calculus

00:00:03.306 --> 00:00:07.196
is find the area of this yellow region

00:00:07.196 --> 00:00:09.233
and if at any point you get inspired,

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:11.374
I always encourage you to pause the video

00:00:11.374 --> 00:00:14.126
and try to work through it on your own.

00:00:14.126 --> 00:00:15.963
So, the key here is you
might recognize hey,

00:00:15.963 --> 00:00:18.063
this is an area between curves.

00:00:18.063 --> 00:00:20.025
A definite integral might be useful,

00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:22.979
so I'll just set up the
definite integral sign

00:00:22.979 --> 00:00:24.761
and so, first we're gonna
think about what are left

00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:27.468
and right boundaries of our region?

00:00:27.468 --> 00:00:28.996
Well, it looks like the left boundary

00:00:28.996 --> 00:00:31.391
is where the two graphs
intersect right over here

00:00:31.391 --> 00:00:32.313
and the right boundary

00:00:32.313 --> 00:00:34.468
is where they intersect right over there.

00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:36.353
Well, what is this point of intersection?

00:00:36.353 --> 00:00:39.344
It looks like it is
negative one, negative two.

00:00:39.344 --> 00:00:40.763
We can verify that.

00:00:40.763 --> 00:00:43.492
In this red curve, if X is negative one,

00:00:43.492 --> 00:00:45.475
let's see, you square that,
you'll get one minus three.

00:00:45.475 --> 00:00:48.129
You do indeed get Y is
equal to negative two

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:49.254
and in this blue function

00:00:49.254 --> 00:00:50.596
was X is equal to negative one,

00:00:50.596 --> 00:00:53.029
you get one minus four plus one.

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:56.798
Once again, you do indeed get
Y is equal to negative two

00:00:56.798 --> 00:00:57.698
and the same thing is true

00:00:57.698 --> 00:01:00.234
when X is equal to one.

00:01:00.234 --> 00:01:02.710
One minus three, negative two,

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.010
one minus four plus one, negative two.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.955
So, our bounds are
indeed, we're going from X

00:01:07.955 --> 00:01:11.291
equals negative one to
X equals positive one

00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:13.966
and now let's think about
our upper and lower bounds.

00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:16.606
Over that interval this blue graph

00:01:16.606 --> 00:01:18.272
is our upper bound

00:01:18.272 --> 00:01:21.018
and so, we would subtract the lower bound

00:01:21.018 --> 00:01:22.372
from the upper bound,

00:01:22.372 --> 00:01:24.319
so we would have X to the fourth,

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:27.418
minus four X squared plus one

00:01:27.418 --> 00:01:31.480
and from that we will subtract X squared

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.647
minus three DX

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.640
and in many other videos we have talked

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.450
about why you do this,

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.677
why this makes sense to just subtract

00:01:39.677 --> 00:01:42.805
the lower graph from the upper graph

00:01:42.805 --> 00:01:45.046
when you're finding the area between them

00:01:45.046 --> 00:01:47.750
but now we just have to
evaluate this definite integral,

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.386
so let's just get down to business.

00:01:50.386 --> 00:01:54.380
Alright, so we have the integral
from negative one to one,

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.878
and so, we have X to the
fourth, X to the fourth,

00:01:58.878 --> 00:02:01.408
and now we have minus four X squared

00:02:01.408 --> 00:02:03.657
and then when you distribute
this negative sign,

00:02:03.657 --> 00:02:06.232
you're gonna subtract another X squared,

00:02:06.232 --> 00:02:09.867
so you're gonna have minus five X squared

00:02:09.867 --> 00:02:11.696
and then you have plus one

00:02:11.696 --> 00:02:14.273
and then you're gonna
subtract a negative three,

00:02:14.273 --> 00:02:16.150
so it's gonna be one plus three,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.650
so it's gonna be plus four DX,

00:02:20.681 --> 00:02:22.058
DX and just to be clear

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:24.317
I should put parentheses right over there

00:02:24.317 --> 00:02:26.335
because it's really the
DX is being multiplied

00:02:26.335 --> 00:02:28.652
by this entire expression

00:02:28.652 --> 00:02:31.158
and so, let's see, let's find
the antiderivative of this.

00:02:31.158 --> 00:02:33.139
This should be pretty straightforward.

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:34.788
We're just gonna use
the reverse power rule

00:02:34.788 --> 00:02:37.946
multiple times, so this is
going to be the antiderivative

00:02:37.946 --> 00:02:41.265
of X to the fourth is X
to the fifth over five.

00:02:41.265 --> 00:02:42.734
We just incremented the exponent

00:02:42.734 --> 00:02:45.275
and divided by that incremented exponent,

00:02:45.275 --> 00:02:46.612
minus, same idea here,

00:02:46.612 --> 00:02:49.112
five X to the third over three

00:02:50.097 --> 00:02:51.014
plus four X

00:02:52.212 --> 00:02:54.641
and then we are going to evaluate it

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:56.926
at one and then subtract from that

00:02:56.926 --> 00:02:59.204
and evaluate it at negative one.

00:02:59.204 --> 00:03:02.745
So, let's first evaluate it at one.

00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:05.018
We're gonna get 1/5

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:07.518
minus 5/3 plus four

00:03:11.095 --> 00:03:14.678
and now let us evaluate
it at negative one,

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.464
so minus, let's see, if
this is negative one,

00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:21.955
we get a negative 1/5, negative 1/5

00:03:21.955 --> 00:03:25.812
and this is gonna be plus 5/3,

00:03:25.812 --> 00:03:30.204
plus 5/3 and then this is
going to be minus four,

00:03:30.204 --> 00:03:32.155
minus four but then when you distribute

00:03:32.155 --> 00:03:36.200
the negative sign, we're
going to distribute this

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.039
over all of these terms,

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:39.751
and so this is going to be,

00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:42.194
if we make this positive,
this will be positive,

00:03:42.194 --> 00:03:43.658
this one will be negative

00:03:43.658 --> 00:03:45.458
and then this one will be positive,

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:48.035
so you have 1/5 plus 1/5

00:03:48.035 --> 00:03:51.880
which is going to be 2/5, that and that,

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.135
and then minus 5/3, minus 5/3,

00:03:54.135 --> 00:03:55.968
so minus 10 over three

00:03:56.832 --> 00:03:58.880
and then four plus four,

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.434
so plus eight

00:04:00.434 --> 00:04:02.414
and so, we just need to simplify this.

00:04:02.414 --> 00:04:04.123
This is going to be, let's see,

00:04:04.123 --> 00:04:05.746
it's going to be eight

00:04:05.746 --> 00:04:08.827
and then if I write, so plus,

00:04:08.827 --> 00:04:11.807
I'm gonna write these two
with a denominator of 15

00:04:11.807 --> 00:04:14.612
'cause that's the common
denominator of three and five.

00:04:14.612 --> 00:04:19.541
Let's see, 2/5 is 16/15,
yeah, that's right,

00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:20.963
five times three is 15.

00:04:20.963 --> 00:04:22.887
Two times three is six

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:25.455
and then 10/3, let's see, if we multiply

00:04:25.455 --> 00:04:26.630
the denominator times fives,

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.179
we have to multiply the
numerator times five,

00:04:28.179 --> 00:04:30.548
so this is going to be 50/15

00:04:30.548 --> 00:04:35.236
and so, what's 6/15 minus 50/15?

00:04:35.236 --> 00:04:38.650
So, this is going to be equal to eight

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.233
minus six minus 50 is minus 44,

00:04:43.758 --> 00:04:45.091
minus 44 over 15

00:04:48.601 --> 00:04:50.341
and so what is 44 over 15?

00:04:50.341 --> 00:04:54.341
44 over 15 is equal to two and 14/15,

00:04:57.898 --> 00:04:59.167
so that's really what we're subtracting.

00:04:59.167 --> 00:05:02.405
We're gonna subtract two and 14/15,

00:05:02.405 --> 00:05:05.136
so if you subtract two from this

00:05:05.136 --> 00:05:07.969
you would get six minus 14 over 15

00:05:10.302 --> 00:05:12.462
'cause we still have to subtract the 14/15

00:05:12.462 --> 00:05:14.997
and then six minus 14/15

00:05:14.997 --> 00:05:19.080
is going to be equal to five and 1/15.

00:05:19.966 --> 00:05:22.150
So, just like that, we were indeed

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.495
able to figure out this area.
