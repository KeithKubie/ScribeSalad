00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
More than 800 cases nationwide, 300 plus of those fatal, and every day three more

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.460
cases are identified, and yet still
surprisingly few people are familiar

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.600
with the acquired immune deficiency
syndrome

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.520
or the acronym by which it's frequently identified AIDS.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.140
Federal health officials consider it an epidemic yet you rarely hear a thing about it.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.640
At first it seemed to strike only one segment of the population.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.180
Now our Barry Peterson tells us this is no longer the case.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:48.320
In the mid-80s the magnitude the AIDS
crisis really started to hit home.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:58.340
We saw some of our most creative people taken away from us by this terrible disease.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:07.910
I just became increasingly convinced
that I had to do something.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.560
But unfortunately at the time people didn't
believe in combinations for viruses.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.460
We had already combinations of course for TB and for cancer.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.320
But nobody believed you really need the combination for viral infections.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.380
In fact some people, famous scientists, came to me when they saw my work,

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.540
and said great work, but you know we'll never see any combination chemotherapy for antivirals.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.480
On the very first shot, we saw something absolutely amazing.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.100
The synergy between AZT, in those
patients, and lamivudine or FTC

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.680
was an enormous breakthrough and led to the first combination drug Combivir.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:02:01.120
That was the first time looking through
CDC's weekly morbidity &amp; mortality reports

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.620
where there was a downward deflection in the death line.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.860
It was absolutely correlatable.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.700
Short of my wedding and the birth of my children, this was the most euphoric moment in my entire life,

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.740
is when I saw the data presented that showed that the majority of people who were started

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.420
on a three drug regimen their viral load felt undetectable

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.080
and their t-cell counts actually came up.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:32.120
I was on Combivir, which was AZT and 3TC, or AZT and lamivudine with crixivan.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.540
I showed a remarkable recovery.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.740
I became undetectable and had my t-cells above 200.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.240
Right now, I don't know, they're in the 600 range. I've been undetectable ever since.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.400
The therapy that came out at that time was literally a lifesaver.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.080
I'm 35 years old and I've been living
with HIV for all but six weeks of my life.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.440
In my childhood I was told that I was going to die.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.860
Then when I didn't and I did graduate high school it was kind of this unexpected adulthood.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.860
What do I do now? I guess I'll go to college.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.080
So it was no longer a death sentence.  HIV was no longer a death sentence.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:20.100
That was an amazing change because mortality dropped from 72% of people who have HIV

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.220
to less than 25%, very rapidly, thanks to HAART therapy.
