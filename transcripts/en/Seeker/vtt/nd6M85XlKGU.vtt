00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.890
You guys, humanity is
another step closer

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.860
to harnessing the nuclear
powers of the sun.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.620
[MANIACAL LAUGH]

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.087
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.087 --> 00:00:15.740
Hey guys, Trace here, for
DNews, with some engineering

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.675
and physics that might
change the world.

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:20.050
A lot of time, we
get you on here

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.633
and we talk to you
about those things.

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:23.770
They're more conceptual
and sometimes

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.610
really complicated
and kind of jargony.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.230
Whoosh.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.274
But this, oh man, this is juicy.

00:00:30.274 --> 00:00:31.940
This week scientists
announced that they

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.000
can produce many suns--
seriously, for real this time.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.360
I know, they've been saying,
give us 30 more years

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.130
and we'll have it.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.490
They might have been
closer than they thought.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.930
We are close to solving
the mystery of fusion power

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.590
that keeps the Sun going.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.630
While nuclear fission
gets a bad rap,

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.360
nuclear fusion is
completely different.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.160
It's one of the holy
grails of science.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.730
Fusion offers a near limitless
pollution-free cheap source

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.230
of energy.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.290
The deuterium to
power the reaction--

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.310
harnessed from seawater.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.230
And it's waste is the
super-rare helium 3 or helium 4

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.459
or perhaps more deuterium--
plus ideally, hundreds of times

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.330
more energy than we put in.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.830
No big deal.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.750
The best part, we get all of
this with no more radiation

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.734
than we're exposed
to in an average day.

00:01:12.734 --> 00:01:14.400
Fission involves using
heat and pressure

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.130
to split an isotope of uranium.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.810
Fusion involves combining
two atoms into one.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.120
Both release huge
amounts of energy.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.730
But the whole fusion thing,
so much more efficient.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.350
The National
Ignition facility has

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.230
used 192 laser beams to
create an x-ray pocket

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.650
inside of a 77-ton machine.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.827
The pocket super heats the
hydrogen deuterium fuel

00:01:34.827 --> 00:01:35.910
and excites the particles.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.610
As hydrogen has a
positive charge,

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.300
atoms normally repel each other.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.510
But inside that pocket,
as the small piece of fuel

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.150
burns at 100 million
Kelvin, they move so fast,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.226
they slam into each other,
fusing and creating new atoms,

00:01:48.226 --> 00:01:50.350
releasing massive amounts
of energy in the process.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.750
This is amazing stuff.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.070
While these scientists
have confirmed

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.670
that they can create this
reaction for a microsecond,

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.269
they can't sustain it.

00:01:58.269 --> 00:01:59.810
And without sustaining
it, they won't

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.966
be able to use it to
create electricity.

00:02:01.966 --> 00:02:04.580
They say we haven't perfected
that little pellet of deuterium

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.210
fuel.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.616
It's microscopically uneven.

00:02:06.616 --> 00:02:08.949
And those imperfections cause
it to burn up too quickly.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:09.974
But never mind that.

00:02:09.974 --> 00:02:11.640
Even though we're not
sure how it works,

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.420
the EU, the US, China, India,
South Korea, and Russia

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.370
are all funding a single
fusion plant in France,

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.836
separately from the NIF.

00:02:18.836 --> 00:02:21.210
It's a different design, but
here's to hoping one of them

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.350
gets this to work,
because I could

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.160
use some cheap, clean
energy right about now.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.220
So there's one tiny little
thing that I probably

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.928
should point out.

00:02:26.928 --> 00:02:29.040
Scientists are saying
that we are about 30

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.040
years from flipping the
switch on a power plant,

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.770
so there's that.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.430
But hey, let's be
optimistic, right?

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.684
Guys?

00:02:37.684 --> 00:02:39.600
Are you on board with
this fusion power thing,

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.349
or should we just
forget it and stick only

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.471
to renewables and other
proven technologies?

00:02:43.471 --> 00:02:45.470

thoughts in the comments.
