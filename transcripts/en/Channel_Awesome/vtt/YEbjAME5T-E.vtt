00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.020
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.100
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.320
Now usually on the show, I talk about things you might have seen growing up:

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.300
Old TV shows, movies, stuff like that, but TODAY—

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.620
Today I'm making a special exception so I can talk to you about the trailer that premiered

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.260
right before the Transformer (sic) movie.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.940
You know what I'm talkin' about!

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.500
And for those of you who don't, I'll give ya the skinny:

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.960
Alright, so it starts off with a handheld video camera shooting a going-away party for a guy named Rob. (Walker? =P)

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.140
For the most part, it's just people joking, drinking, talking,

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.560
and saying how much they're gonna miss Rob after he leaves the city.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.200
I don't' know who Rob is, but I'm missing him already.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.300
When suddenly, the power goes out,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.580
and a loud explosion is heard outside!

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.080
*BOOM*

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.920
The people start screaming and running downstairs

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.160
as the camera goes a little Blair Witch on us.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.780
As everybody exits outside, they hear a thunderous ROARING sound!

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.460
A thunderous roaring sound? What could that be?

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.280
Oh, it's a building blowing up.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.780
*stammers* Dude, it's a building blowing up! Holy shit!

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.760
*BOOM!*

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.420
As the building blows up into smithereens,

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.960
bits of rubble and fiery death are smashing down on the onlookers.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.280
Within seconds, everything's being thrown at 'em!

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.440
A car, a house, other bits of rubble, a cow—okay, maybe not a cow—but a lot of stuff!

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.280
And last but not fuckin' least,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.040
the head of the GODDAMN STATUE OF LIBERTY!

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.800
Good God, I just pissed myself!

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.840
That's the scariest thing I've ever seen in my entire life!

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.840
I mean, it was terrifying, it was incredible, it was suspenseful, it just—it was—

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.240
I mean, oh my God, you just wouldn't believe it!

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.500
What could this horrible creation of Beelzebub be?

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.700
J. J. Abrams?

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.880
He may be a monster, but he's not that big.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.200
Okay, we know WHEN our lives are gonna come to an end,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.300
but what is it that's gonna kill us?

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.360
Oh come on, there's gotta be more than that, isn't there?

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.620
Isn't there?

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.820
*fanfare*

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.300
OH, FUCK YOU!

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.800
*grasping for words*

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.640
Heeey! Did you forget something?

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.040
The TITLE?!

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.160
You forgot the title of your movie!

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.700
What, I—how can you forget the title of your movie?

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.360
What kind of a ripoff is that?

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.180
You—you build us up, you scare the shit out of us,

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.680
and then you don't even tell us what we're supposed to be afraid of?

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.920
That's... bullshit!

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.720
Wha—*more incoherency*

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.340
I mean, what could it be?

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.540
What on Earth could that giant thing that blows up buildings

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.520
and throws the head of the Statue of Liberty everywhere be?

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.860
Is it a demon? Is it a machine?

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.540
Is it Donkey Kong?

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.240
My money's on Donkey Kong!

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.500
After he gets drunk on all those barrels of beer,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.560
he rampages through the city, seeking out all the Italian plumbers.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Or, you know, it is J. J. Abrams.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.120
Maybe it's the black smoke from Lost!

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.900
He got off the Island, and now he's looking for a nice industrial plant to call home.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.960
No, no, I bet it's J. J. Abrams' production logo, the Bad Robot!

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.240
He goes stomping through the city looking for the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man!

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.620
Because there's only room for one giant homicidal corporate logo in THIS town!

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.340
Maybe it's not a monster at all.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.340
Maybe it's Jesus!

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.420
Maybe he just wanted to give the Bible a twist ending, and decides to rampage through the city!

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.120
Maybe it's all four of 'em!

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.160
Maybe it's a Giant Robotic Donkey Kong Jesus riding a puff of smoke!

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.660
Holy shit, that'd be really cool...

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.880
...but HIGHLY improbable!

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.240
Now, good luck finding information about this movie,

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.300
'cause that's actually a lot harder than it sounds.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.640
Many people think the name of the movie's "Cloverfield", but that's not actually true. [It is.]

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.000
Cloverfield is the fake title they came up with

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.320
so that nobody can get an idea about what this thing really is.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.820
[QUICK NOTE: "Cloverfield" is the actual title, the Critic noted this and corrected it in a follow-up episode]

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.940
Which I feel is... kind of bad advertising.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.080
How can I, say, see the film...

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.660
purchase a ticket...

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.340
go into a theater...

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.720
and watch this motion picture experience...

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.440
if...

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.000
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT'S FUCKING CALLED?!?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.920
My prediction of what that monster is is that it's J. J. Abrams' gigantic ego

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.040
terrorizing the city with his pretentious advertising!

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.940
Will it consume this nation? Only time will tell, my friend.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.840
Only time will tell.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.920
I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to...

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.900
It had BETTER be Donkey Kong.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.580
*Donkey Kong arcade theme*

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.120
