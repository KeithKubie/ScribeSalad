00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.150
There are different forms of adversarial collaboration.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:11.820
So one form is that you have people who disagree
on some theoretical issue trying to conduct

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.760
experiments that will resolve their differences
or reduce their differences.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.420
And that is the first step in adversarial
collaboration, let’s see what we agree on

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.550
and then let’s try to trade our differences.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.609
In some cases they’re friends, so you can
easily agree, although you agree that when

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:36.149
you write up the results you will write them
in two voices, so you don’t not commit yourself

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.149
to agreeing on the interpretation of the result.

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.130
Sometimes you need an arbiter to run the experiment.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.579
That is when relations are more tense.

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:51.300
Instead of the reply and rejoinder format
you can agree to write a joint article in

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.180
which you first settle what you agree on and
then what you disagree on.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:07.080
You have to be willing not to win, that is
you have to be willing to accept a draw and

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.610
to see that in the interest of science and
civility and other things a draw is better

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.610
than a win.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.000
I happen to find a few people who are willing
to do that.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.220
By the way, it is not easy because people
who think poorly of your work and of your

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.140
ideas get on your nerves and so you have to
overcome that.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.830
The best of example of adversarial collaboration
that I have had was on issues of the boundaries

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.920
of intuition.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.140
When is intuition marvelous and when is it
flawed and it was with Gary Klein, who is

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.610
a well-known author who was a great proponent
of expert intuition.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:56.360
And so we worked for six or seven years together
trying to hammer out our differences about

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.670
whether intuition is valid or not and we came
out with an article that was actually--well,

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.280
it was a bit in two voices--but on most things
we agreed.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.869
And that was the best adversarial collaboration
of all.
