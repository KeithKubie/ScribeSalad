Rows and columns
are great for laying out widgets.

00:00:10.621 --> 00:00:12.963
But sometimes, you run out of room.

00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:15.658
One of the widgets that can help is Wrap.

00:00:15.947 --> 00:00:19.657
Wrap lays out its children,
one at a time, a lot like a row or column.

00:00:19.874 --> 00:00:23.029
But when it runs out of space,
it just wraps to the next line.

00:00:23.405 --> 00:00:25.342
You can use the direction property

00:00:25.343 --> 00:00:27.951
to tell it whether to run
vertically or horizontally.

00:00:27.955 --> 00:00:30.724
And there's alignment
and spacing properties as well.

00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:34.213
Wrap works <i>really</i> well
with things like dialog buttons...

00:00:34.797 --> 00:00:35.872
and chips.

00:00:36.905 --> 00:00:39.509

and all the other Flutter widgets,
