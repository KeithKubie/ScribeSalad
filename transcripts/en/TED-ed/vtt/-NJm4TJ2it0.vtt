00:00:06.956 --> 00:00:12.525
Every two seconds, someone somewhere 
in the world experiences a stroke.

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:17.878
And one out of every six people will have 
one at some point in their lives.

00:00:17.878 --> 00:00:20.868
Strokes deprive brain cells of oxygen

00:00:20.868 --> 00:00:23.589
and are one of the most 
common causes of death

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:26.785
and a leading cause 
of preventable disability.

00:00:26.785 --> 00:00:31.449
When someone experiences a stroke,
quick medical care is critical,

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.729
and can often help avoid 
permanent brain damage.

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:37.588
But what causes strokes 
in the first place?

00:00:37.588 --> 00:00:40.849
And what can doctors do to treat them?

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:44.520
The brain makes up just 2% 
of your body’s mass

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.958
but consumes more than 20%
of the oxygen in your blood.

00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:52.751
That oxygen is carried to the brain
through a system of arteries.

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:55.638
Carotid arteries supply 
the front of the brain,

00:00:55.638 --> 00:00:58.688
and vertebral arteries supply the back.

00:00:58.688 --> 00:01:00.719
These are connected to each other,

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.369
and divide into smaller 
and smaller vessels

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:07.380
that get billions of neurons 
the oxygen they need.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.349
If the blood flow is interrupted, 
oxygen delivery stops and brain cells die.

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:15.490
There are two ways this can happen.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.641
Hemorrhagic strokes are when a perforated
vessel allows blood to leak out.

00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:23.530
But the more common type 
is the ischemic stroke,

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.518
when a clot blocks a vessel 
and brings blood flow to a halt.

00:01:28.518 --> 00:01:30.690
Where do these clots come from?

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.591
On rare occasions,
a sudden change in heart rhythm

00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:37.900
prevents the upper chambers of the heart
from contracting normally.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.809
This slows down blood flow,

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:45.382
allowing platelets, clotting factors, 
and fibrin to stick together.

00:01:45.382 --> 00:01:46.731
The clot can be carried up

00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:50.611
towards the arteries
and blood vessels supplying the brain

00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:54.092
until it gets to one 
it can’t squeeze through.

00:01:54.092 --> 00:01:56.297
This is called an embolism

00:01:56.297 --> 00:02:00.665
and it cuts off the oxygen supply 
to all the cells downstream.

00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:05.862
The brain doesn't have pain receptors,
so you can't feel the blockage itself.

00:02:05.862 --> 00:02:08.672
But oxygen deprivation 
slows brain function

00:02:08.672 --> 00:02:11.802
and can have sudden, noticeable effects.

00:02:11.802 --> 00:02:15.593
For example, if the affected area 
is responsible for speech,

00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:18.514
an individual’s words may be slurred.

00:02:18.514 --> 00:02:21.972
If the stroke affects a part of the brain 
that controls muscle movement,

00:02:21.972 --> 00:02:26.553
it can cause weakness, 
often just on one side of the body.

00:02:26.553 --> 00:02:30.435
When this happens, the body 
will immediately try to compensate

00:02:30.435 --> 00:02:33.405
by diverting blood flow 
to the affected area,

00:02:33.405 --> 00:02:35.885
but this isn’t a perfect solution.

00:02:35.885 --> 00:02:39.824
Eventually, the oxygen-deprived cells 
will start to die,

00:02:39.824 --> 00:02:43.748
leading to brain damage 
that may be severe or permanent.

00:02:43.748 --> 00:02:48.390
That’s why it’s important to get
medical care as fast as possible.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.370
The first line of treatment
is an intravenous medication

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.205
called Tissue Plasminogen Activator,

00:02:54.205 --> 00:02:55.884
which can break up the blood clot

00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:59.855
and allow blood to flow again
in the compromised artery.

00:02:59.855 --> 00:03:02.015
If it’s delivered within a few hours,

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:05.415
this medication greatly increases
the chance of surviving the stroke

00:03:05.415 --> 00:03:08.496
and avoiding permanent consequences.

00:03:08.496 --> 00:03:11.646
If Tissue Plasminogen Activator
cannot be given

00:03:11.646 --> 00:03:13.976
because the patient 
is on certain medications,

00:03:13.976 --> 00:03:15.595
has history of major bleeding,

00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:18.336
or the clot is particularly large,

00:03:18.336 --> 00:03:23.605
doctors can perform a procedure
called an endovascular thrombectomy.

00:03:23.605 --> 00:03:28.694
Using a fluorescent dye that illuminates 
the blood vessels under a strong x-ray,

00:03:28.694 --> 00:03:33.146
the physician inserts a long, 
thin, flexible tube called a catheter

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:35.375
into an artery in the leg

00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:38.508
and maneuvers
it all the way to the blockage.

00:03:38.508 --> 00:03:41.377
A retriever is passed
through this catheter.

00:03:41.377 --> 00:03:45.867
It expands and anchors into the clot 
when it’s just past it.

00:03:45.867 --> 00:03:50.737
The catheter then pulls the clot out 
when it’s removed.

00:03:50.737 --> 00:03:53.679
These treatments need to be delivered
as soon as possible

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:55.338
to preserve brain function,

00:03:55.338 --> 00:03:59.588
which means figuring out fast 
if someone is having a stroke.

00:03:59.588 --> 00:04:01.017
So how can you tell?

00:04:01.017 --> 00:04:03.869
Here are three quick things to try:

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:06.558
1. Ask the person to smile.

00:04:06.558 --> 00:04:11.118
A crooked mouth or facial drooping 
can indicate muscle weakness.

00:04:11.118 --> 00:04:13.879
2. Ask them to raise their arms.

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:19.829
If one drifts downward, that arm weakness
is also a sign of a stroke.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.919
3. Ask them to repeat a
simple word or phrase.

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.788
If their speech sounds
slurred or strange,

00:04:26.788 --> 00:04:31.489
it could mean that the language area 
of their brain is oxygen-deprived.

00:04:31.489 --> 00:04:37.281
This is sometimes called the FAST test,
and the T stands for time.

00:04:37.281 --> 00:04:42.290
If you see any of those signs, 
call emergency services right away.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.331
Lives may depend on it.
