00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000
all these things he's trying to hit with
 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.330
all these things he's trying to hit with
all these sort of very classic genres

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340
all these sort of very classic genres
 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.789
all these sort of very classic genres
you know of monster films of superhero

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799
you know of monster films of superhero
 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.789
you know of monster films of superhero
films and sci-fi films uh they all have

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799
films and sci-fi films uh they all have
 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.970
films and sci-fi films uh they all have
these kind of distinct styles and he's

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980
these kind of distinct styles and he's
 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.009
these kind of distinct styles and he's
combining them all into one and it's

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019
combining them all into one and it's
 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.190
combining them all into one and it's
surprisingly really really gels and it's

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200
surprisingly really really gels and it's
 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.279
surprisingly really really gels and it's
funny and and it's clever and the use of

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289
funny and and it's clever and the use of
 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.040
funny and and it's clever and the use of
the effects there's a lot practical

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050
the effects there's a lot practical
 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.390
the effects there's a lot practical
effects that

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400
effects that
 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.850
effects that
you know watching it are fake it's

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860
you know watching it are fake it's
 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.950
you know watching it are fake it's
illusion but at the same time when you

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960
illusion but at the same time when you
 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.370
illusion but at the same time when you
see when you see this giant monster

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380
see when you see this giant monster
 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.350

this film I realize how much we really
 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.210
this film I realize how much we really
do rely way too goddamn much on CGI

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220
do rely way too goddamn much on CGI
 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.080
do rely way too goddamn much on CGI
because CGI we know is not there it

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090
because CGI we know is not there it
 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.840
because CGI we know is not there it

all a computer and when people are
 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.409
all a computer and when people are
running away from it you know it's again

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419
running away from it you know it's again
 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:01.029

I I know they're just running away from

I I know they're just running away from

a building you know what's really
 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.219
a building you know what's really
hitting it so that when these five

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:09.229
hitting it so that when these five
 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:11.560
hitting it so that when these five
pieces fly out they're gonna fly out in

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570
pieces fly out they're gonna fly out in
 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.589

a way that's not calculated that's not

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:14.599
a way that's not calculated that's not
 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.740
a way that's not calculated that's not
painted over that was really there and

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750
painted over that was really there and
 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.659
painted over that was really there and
it's going to have an impact that's

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:19.669
it's going to have an impact that's
 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.750
it's going to have an impact that's
different than a person typing it in so

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760
different than a person typing it in so
 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.760
different than a person typing it in so
it's so strange because watch these

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770
it's so strange because watch these
 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.529
it's so strange because watch these
effects and be like what's obviously a

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:26.539
effects and be like what's obviously a
 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:29.740
effects and be like what's obviously a
guy in a suit but at least it's really a

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750
guy in a suit but at least it's really a
 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.629
guy in a suit but at least it's really a
guy in the suit at least it's a really a

guy in the suit at least it's a really a
 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:33.040
guy in the suit at least it's a really a
guy who's there and so when the impact

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050
guy who's there and so when the impact
 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.680
guy who's there and so when the impact
happens you feel the impact because the

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:35.690
happens you feel the impact because the
 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:36.690
happens you feel the impact because the
impact is really

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:36.700
impact is really
 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.950
impact is really

don't want to say spoil because we're
 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.910
don't want to say spoil because we're
not spoiled by computer graphics I'm

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:44.920
not spoiled by computer graphics I'm

but for this even though I know they're

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:09.190
but for this even though I know they're
 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.430
but for this even though I know they're
not it's not a real monster it's not

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440
not it's not a real monster it's not

not it's not a real monster it's not
real building I know they actually built

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:14.290
real building I know they actually built
 

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.550
real building I know they actually built
these things and I felt that hid and

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:17.560
these things and I felt that hid and
 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.650
these things and I felt that hid and
there's so many scenes like that where

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:19.660
there's so many scenes like that where
 

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.000
there's so many scenes like that where
these little models will fall and they

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.010
these little models will fall and they
 

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.670
these little models will fall and they
look incredibly fake but you really feel

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:23.680
look incredibly fake but you really feel
 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.820
look incredibly fake but you really feel
them falling there's this gut reaction

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:26.830
them falling there's this gut reaction
 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.050
them falling there's this gut reaction
in you that feels the impact so it was

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.060
in you that feels the impact so it was
 

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.030
in you that feels the impact so it was
very very clever to do that and it

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:33.040
very very clever to do that and it
 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.560
very very clever to do that and it
really make me it made me realize the

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:37.570
really make me it made me realize the
 

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.630
really make me it made me realize the
effort and kind of what we were missing

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:39.640
effort and kind of what we were missing
 

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.570
effort and kind of what we were missing

there's this and why I did know was
 

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.920
there's this and why I did know was
going to work but it really paid off is

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:16.930
going to work but it really paid off is
 

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.200
going to work but it really paid off is
there's this kinetic energy throughout

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:19.210
there's this kinetic energy throughout
 

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:21.870

the whole thing that the only thing I

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:21.880
the whole thing that the only thing I
 

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.390
the whole thing that the only thing I
can think of I'm shows our examples but

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400
can think of I'm shows our examples but
 

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.560
can think of I'm shows our examples but
the first thing comes my mind is

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:25.570
the first thing comes my mind is
 

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.780
the first thing comes my mind is
probably the lego movie where the lego

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:27.790
probably the lego movie where the lego
 

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.770
probably the lego movie where the lego
movie is also fake their Legos you know

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:31.780
movie is also fake their Legos you know
 

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.719
movie is also fake their Legos you know
and I think they're mostly CG but you

00:08:33.719 --> 00:08:33.729
and I think they're mostly CG but you
 

00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:36.750
and I think they're mostly CG but you
know it's you also kind of enjoy like

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:36.760
know it's you also kind of enjoy like
 

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.219
know it's you also kind of enjoy like
when they build something it's you don't

00:08:38.219 --> 00:08:38.229
when they build something it's you don't
 

00:08:38.229 --> 00:08:39.960
when they build something it's you don't
see them actually take apart every

single thing put it over here they'll
 

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.790
single thing put it over here they'll
build it like a stop-motion lego video

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:44.800
build it like a stop-motion lego video
 

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.730
build it like a stop-motion lego video
it's kind of like that it's welcoming

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:47.740
it's kind of like that it's welcoming
 

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.710
it's kind of like that it's welcoming
the you know

or the comedy and the cheesiness of it
 

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:55.530
or the comedy and the cheesiness of it
but it's also not it's not being it's

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:55.540
but it's also not it's not being it's
 

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.929
but it's also not it's not being it's
not cheating if there's no cheating in

this movie everything is done as much

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:02.050
this movie everything is done as much
 

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:04.110
this movie everything is done as much
practically as possible that would get a

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:04.120
practically as possible that would get a
 

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.439
practically as possible that would get a
laugh and then something else like

00:09:07.439 --> 00:09:07.449
laugh and then something else like
 

00:09:07.449 --> 00:09:08.999
laugh and then something else like
somebody's telling a story about the

00:09:08.999 --> 00:09:09.009
somebody's telling a story about the
 

00:09:09.009 --> 00:09:11.129
somebody's telling a story about the
origin of this monster that's going to

00:09:11.129 --> 00:09:11.139
origin of this monster that's going to
 

00:09:11.139 --> 00:09:14.189
origin of this monster that's going to
be shown in these sort of CG puppets

00:09:14.189 --> 00:09:14.199
be shown in these sort of CG puppets
 

00:09:14.199 --> 00:09:16.920
be shown in these sort of CG puppets
going on that even actually even then

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:16.930
going on that even actually even then
 

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:20.369
going on that even actually even then
they can look like drawings but you kind

00:09:20.369 --> 00:09:20.379
they can look like drawings but you kind
 

00:09:20.379 --> 00:09:22.340
they can look like drawings but you kind
of know okay that would make sense for

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:22.350
of know okay that would make sense for
 

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.889
of know okay that would make sense for
this uh and there's a scene where

00:09:25.889 --> 00:09:25.899
this uh and there's a scene where
 

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.449
this uh and there's a scene where
somebody has like an epiphany and the

00:09:27.449 --> 00:09:27.459
somebody has like an epiphany and the
 

00:09:27.459 --> 00:09:29.879
somebody has like an epiphany and the

00:09:29.879 --> 00:09:29.889
UCM wake up and realize something and it
 

00:09:29.889 --> 00:09:32.189

shoots through the universe that has to

00:09:32.189 --> 00:09:32.199
shoots through the universe that has to
 

00:09:32.199 --> 00:09:34.290
shoots through the universe that has to
be CG it's funnier if it's done through

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:34.300
be CG it's funnier if it's done through
 

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:38.429
be CG it's funnier if it's done through
CG in that way so I think that's what I

00:09:38.429 --> 00:09:38.439
CG in that way so I think that's what I
 

00:09:38.439 --> 00:09:40.019
CG in that way so I think that's what I
really I think it's why I respect with

00:09:40.019 --> 00:09:40.029
really I think it's why I respect with
 

00:09:40.029 --> 00:09:42.840
really I think it's why I respect with
the effects is that it knew it wasn't

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:42.850
the effects is that it knew it wasn't
 

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.030

came from the kinetic energy and good

00:09:55.079 --> 00:09:55.089
came from the kinetic energy and good

editing in this - again there's a lot of

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.240
editing in this - again there's a lot of
 

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.999
editing in this - again there's a lot of
lines where if they just sort of read

00:09:59.999 --> 00:10:00.009
lines where if they just sort of read
 

00:10:00.009 --> 00:10:04.619
lines where if they just sort of read
the way they read it it get an okay

00:10:04.619 --> 00:10:04.629
the way they read it it get an okay
 

00:10:04.629 --> 00:10:06.840
the way they read it it get an okay
laughs whatever but it was really good

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:06.850
laughs whatever but it was really good

a you know to take a line those may be

00:10:14.519 --> 00:10:14.529
a you know to take a line those may be
 

00:10:14.529 --> 00:10:15.749
a you know to take a line those may be
okay but then when you have the

00:10:15.749 --> 00:10:15.759
okay but then when you have the
 

00:10:15.759 --> 00:10:17.490
okay but then when you have the
expression on top of it it'll be really

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:17.500
expression on top of it it'll be really
 

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.340
expression on top of it it'll be really
funny and well that's it good casting in

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:20.350
funny and well that's it good casting in
 

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:24.090

obviously allowed to improvise a little

00:10:26.309 --> 00:10:26.319
obviously allowed to improvise a little
 

00:10:26.319 --> 00:10:28.860
obviously allowed to improvise a little
bit and I think they took a lot of

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:28.870
bit and I think they took a lot of
 

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.929
bit and I think they took a lot of
scenes that were probably okay and made

00:10:30.929 --> 00:10:30.939
scenes that were probably okay and made
 

00:10:30.939 --> 00:10:32.759
scenes that were probably okay and made
them even better and it just made them

00:10:32.759 --> 00:10:32.769
them even better and it just made them
 

00:10:32.769 --> 00:10:35.579
them even better and it just made them
much more alive and the whole film I

00:10:35.579 --> 00:10:35.589
much more alive and the whole film I

I can't imagine the stuff he went
through and to still keep that energy

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:00.610
through and to still keep that energy
 

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.610
through and to still keep that energy
going throughout the whole thing even

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:02.620
going throughout the whole thing even

probably driving you bonkers I mean this
is why I say every film even the bad

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360
is why I say every film even the bad
