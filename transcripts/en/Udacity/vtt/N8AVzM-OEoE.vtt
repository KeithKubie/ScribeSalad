00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.955
You narrowed down the relationship between loudness and distance to two

00:00:02.955 --> 00:00:06.526
different graphs in the last quiz. So I'm just going to go ahead and tell you

00:00:06.526 --> 00:00:10.465
that this one shows the actual relationship between these two quantities.

00:00:10.465 --> 00:00:15.386
Loudness varies as 1 over the distance from the source of the sound. Now, if

00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:19.412
you wrote these with more standard mathematical variables, x and y, you'd have

00:00:19.412 --> 00:00:24.095
the equation y equals 1 over x. We actually worked with this in the last

00:00:24.095 --> 00:00:27.563
lesson, and this is an example of a rational function.
