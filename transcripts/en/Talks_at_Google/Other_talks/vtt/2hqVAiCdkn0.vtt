00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:16.049
&gt;&gt;presenter: Hello, everybody. Hi. Thanks
for joining us today. I'm really, really pleased

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.710
to introduce to you Loretta Napoleoni in today.
Loretta is a writer, journalist, and economist.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:31.859
She is the leading expert on the relation
between our economies and terror, and that's

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.861
what she's going to discuss with us today.
We will have 30 minutes of discussion and

00:00:38.861 --> 00:00:44.920
then another 30 minutes for Q &amp; A. I believe
we have--

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.920
[Loretta coughs]

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.770
a lot to learn from Loretta's, from this session
today and from her book. So, I hope you and

00:00:48.770 --> 00:01:00.730
Loretta as well, will enjoy the session. So,
join me in welcoming her and thank you.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.540
[applause]

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:10.680
&gt;&gt;Loretta: Well, thank you very much for being
here today. So, what I'm going to do is tell

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.000
you a story and through the story, I will
show you how terrorism and the economy are

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.990
actually intertwined. In particular, what
I want to put forward to you is how the War

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.610
on Terror, which was launched by George Bush
after 9/11, has caused the credit crunch,

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.250
the recession, and all the tribulations of
the current economy.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:43.140
And finally, at the end of the speech we'll
have a look at the future. And the danger

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.610
is that the consequences of this War on Terror
may actually be much more serious than the

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.759
crisis we have witnessed until today.

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.350
Now, why I told you, "I'll tell you a story,"
is because I think in order for you to understand

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:06.000
what is the economics of terrorism, I have
to start from the beginning. Otherwise, you

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.920
won't understand how this economy actually
has developed.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.160
And I will tell you my personal story because
it is happened to me, about 15 years ago,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.500
to stumble in to the economics of terrorism.
It's not something that I wanted to discover

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.450
or it was something that I was working on.
In fact, at the time, I was working as a banker

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.400
in the city of London.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.569
So, it all happened about 15 years ago, I
got a phone call from a friend who was looking

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.200
after the rights of political prisoners in
Italy. In particular, we're talking about

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.490
the Red Brigades. The Red Brigades was the
armed organization which was particularly

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:53.480
strong in Italy from the 60s to the 80s. It
was a Marxist organization and--

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.310
[clears throat]

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.620
one of their characteristics was not to talk
to anybody, including the lawyers. So, they

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.489
sat through the trials without saying one
single word.

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:12.159
So, it was a bit of mystery how the Red Brigades
came about, how they were organized. So, in

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:17.409
1992, they declared the end of the armed struggle,
and they decided that they would tell the

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:24.530
story of how the organization was formed to
a group of people. And they made a list of

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.519
people and I was one of the people on the
list.

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:34.470
Now, you'll be surprised, as I was surprised
myself. But the reason why I ended up on that

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.100
list is because my childhood friend became
a leader of the Red Brigades. So, she was

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:49.159
arrested in 1978, I discovered, by opening
the newspaper. And there was her picture.

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:54.640
I didn't know anything. She had never actually
spoke to me about her political conviction

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:02.049
and to me, she was a perfectly normal individual.
And yet, she was one of the leaders of the

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.170
Red Brigades.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:10.440
So, I stayed in touch with her, but we never
spoke about politics at all because she was

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:18.870
one of the unrepentant members of the organization,
so she was bound to silence. Anyway, in 1992,

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.940
when they decided that the armed struggle
had finished, she put my name forward. And

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:32.780
a group of female members of the Red Brigade
actually backed my name as potential person

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:40.020
to talk to because they met me at the time
I was a leader of the Italian Feminist Movement.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.800
Of course, I didn't know that they were members
of the Red Brigades. This is the life we lived

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.310
in the 1970s in Italy; your best friend being
a terrorist and you didn't know.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.699
[chuckles from audience]

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:58.490
Anyway, so, now this proposal came at a very
difficult time of my life because I just head

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:05.000
a management buyout of the company I worked
with so, I was very busy at the time. Plus,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.650
I just had a baby so that was the last thing
I wanted to do was to go back to Italy and

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:15.009
tour all the high-security prisons, meeting
people I haven't seen since the 1970s.

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:22.630
But, in the end, I actually decided to do
it. And the reason why I did it, is because

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:30.580
I wanted to know why my best friend from the
age of six, had never tried to recruit me.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:36.430
Why she actually never asked me to become
a member of the Red Brigades. Now, you'll

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:42.289
be surprised again, but the truth is that,
at that time, the way the organization worked

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:49.100
was to recruit people primarily among member
of the family and best friends. So, why not

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.100
me?

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:58.120
So, I went back, and I learned very, very
quickly why I was not recruited. I actually

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.880
had failed the psychological profile of a
terrorist. So, there's a group of people who

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:11.610
decide if you are the right person to be recruited
or not. So, it came out that I was too single-minded

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.319
and too opinionated to make a good soldier,
which is true.

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:22.540
So, but it was at that point that I realized
that perhaps, terrorism, it was something

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:29.090
totally different from what I had read in
newspapers, or what we actually had discussed

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.770
in the 1970s.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:38.900
So, I got more and more in to investigating
why they recruit people and once they recruit

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:44.979
people, what do these people actually do?
And what I discovered is that, in reality,

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:49.960
a terrorist organization is run like an army.
There's a very small group of people -- the

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.849
leaders -- that actually run the show; all
the others follow orders. And these orders

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:59.360
are always based upon searching for money.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:07.020
So, what the average terrorist does, all day
long, is find money in order to fund the organization.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:12.590
There's no discussion about ideology. There's
no discussion about politics because once

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.440
you get in, you're already indoctrinated.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:23.720
So, when I was asking members of the Red Brigades
why they decided to fight against the state

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.569
in a certain way, they actually didn't really
know how to answer me because they had no

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:32.561
idea. I mean, of course, the leaders is a
different thing, but the people that actually

00:07:32.561 --> 00:07:38.729
did carried out attacks on a daily basis,
they had no idea. Once I start asking them,

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:44.569
"Well, tell me how did how did you manage
to get the money? How did you fund the organization?"

00:07:44.569 --> 00:07:51.060
then they were really happy to talk to me.
So, some of the stories were amazing. For

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:58.650
example, there was one guy who was a psychiatrist;
he was a part-timer. The Red Brigades had--

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.389
[bird chirps]

00:08:00.389 --> 00:08:06.240
500 full-timers at any time and then they
had about 2,000 part-timers. So, the people

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:11.889
who basically did carried out a normal life,
and then they helped the Red Brigades on the

00:08:11.889 --> 00:08:16.890
side. So, he loved sailing. He had a beautiful
sailing boat. So, what he did in the summer

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:23.229
was to sail back and forth from Italy to Lebanon,
pick up the weapons from the PLO, which, of

00:08:23.229 --> 00:08:28.699
course, came from the Soviets, carried back
the weapons in Sardinia, and then various

00:08:28.699 --> 00:08:36.750
organizations, for example, ETA or the IRA,
will come and pick up their share of these

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:37.750
weapons.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:44.060
And for this service, the Red Brigades received
a fee. So, he was very happy to tell me that

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:50.020
because he thought it was a great idea. Plus,
he was having a great time sailing. So, this

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:55.990
is where I thought, "Well, maybe there is
something more to terrorism than ideology.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:01.600
Maybe, well, what I really need to investigate
is the economics of terrorism."

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:09.510
So, the idea to actually do a research in
this field came after I had lunch with Mario

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:15.100
Moretti. Mario Moretti was the leader of the
Red Brigades when Aldo Moro, the former Prime

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:20.430
Minister of Italy, was kidnapped. He was actually
the guy who executed him.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:25.771
So, I had lunch with him in one of these high-security
prisons. And while I was talking to him, I

00:09:25.771 --> 00:09:31.010
know it's, but this is why I want to tell
you this story because it's an amazing story.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:35.430
So, while I was having lunch with him, I had
the distinct feeling that I was back in the

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:38.670
City of London having lunch with a banker.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:45.450
This guy spoke the language of finance so
well. And the way he expressed himself, he

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:51.420
was a true manager. And he was explaining
to me how he was managing his company, which

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.690
happened to be called the Red Brigades.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:59.100
So, this is where I thought, "Well, that's
it. This is what I should be doing." I'm an

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:04.680
economist. I mean I'm trained in the economic
terms. I worked a long time in the City, so

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:10.970
this is when I began my investigation. And
I must tell you it was very difficult to find

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:17.959
anybody to fund my research until 9/11 because
everybody thought I was completely insane

00:10:17.959 --> 00:10:20.160
to talk about the economics of terrorism.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:27.320
So, I funded myself and I did the right thing.
So, what did I discover? Well, I discovered

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:34.160
that since World War II an economic system
has been created by armed organizations. And

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:39.000
this economic system has gone through three
major evolutionary stages.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.940
The first one is the state sponsor of terrorism,
the second one is the privatization of terrorism,

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:51.630
and the third one is the globalization of
terrorism. So, to a certain extent, this economy

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:58.399
has been following the evolution of the international
economy and eventually of the globalized economy.

00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:03.260
So, what is the state sponsor of terrorism?
Well, this is when the two superpowers were

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:11.600
fighting a war by proxy using fully funded
armed organizations at the fringes of the

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:16.510
sphere of influence that they controlled.
So, we're talking about the Soviet Union on

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:19.840
one side and the United States on the other
side.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:26.000
So, what was the modality? Well, basically
these armed organizations were funded with

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.149
legal and illegal activities. And I think
the best example, of course, is the Contras

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:36.779
in Nicaragua. So, we have the US Congress,
who actually funded a certain amount of money

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:43.430
to support what were considered "freedom fighters."
And then because this money were not enough,

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:49.310
we have the Reagan Administration launch a
series of covert operations in order to fund

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:50.310
them.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:56.420
So, that's the mix that we're basically going
to find. So, another interesting characteristic

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:03.700
of this stage is the fact that these groups,
these armed organizations, did not fight their

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:09.230
own wars, but they fought this war by proxy.
So, they basically fought whatever the superpower,

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:16.450
the sponsor, wanted them to fight. This situation
changed at end of the 70s, beginning of the

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:20.180
80s, when terrorism was privatized.

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:27.920
And the guy who actually did the first privatization
was Arafat. So, he managed to gain independence

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:34.570
from his sponsor by setting up the same kind
of system; so, a mix of legal and illegal

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:41.020
activities, but controlled by his organization
 -- so, by the PLO. Now, and the results were

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.020
fantastic.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:47.010
I mean, we see that, for example, there are
some documents coming from the CIA where they

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:54.080
list that the amount of money that actually
are produced on a daily basis by the PLO,

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.880
and it's higher than the GDP of some of the
small Arab countries. So, they actually did

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.279
very, very well.

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:03.550
So, this is the phase of the privatization
of terrorism.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:09.630
Another example, nearer to London, for example,
is the IRA. IRA did the same thing. So, we,

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:16.389
so that the IRA controlled all the transportation,
private transportation system, in Northern

00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:21.520
Ireland. So, every time somebody got into
a taxi in Belfast, without knowing, was actually

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:27.839
funding the IRA. The Orange, were, in the
construction business, so every time somebody

00:13:27.839 --> 00:13:34.640
actually remodeled his flat in Northern Ireland,
in reality, was funding the Orange group.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:43.410
So, this is how much terrorist organizations
managed to penetrate the legal economy, the

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:45.110
everyday economy.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:52.399
So, the last evolutionary stage is, is the
one that we know better which is, of course,

00:13:52.399 --> 00:13:57.020
the globalization of terrorism because this
is the one that created an organization like

00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:03.750
Al-Qaeda. Now that happened in the 1990 with
the deregulation of the international financial

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:11.990
system. All the barriers came down, so countries,
I mean, armed organizations, were able to

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:17.149
link up with each other in a much better way
than the one I just described to you about

00:14:17.149 --> 00:14:18.149
sharing arms.

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:23.459
So, they started to do business with each
other but also, they started to do business

00:14:23.459 --> 00:14:28.250
together with criminal organizations. They
money launder, the dirty profits, through

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:35.139
the same channels. So, we see the birth of
a new international economic system. Now,

00:14:35.139 --> 00:14:43.910
Al-Queada is very much the stereotype of this
new phase because it is an organization which

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:52.230
was able to fund itself cross-border. So,
the portfolio of somebody like Osama bin Laden

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:53.470
was an international portfolio.

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:59.740
But, so was the portfolio of Arafat, but the
difference is, of course, Arafat was focused

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:05.630
on one single part of the world, which was,
of course, Lebanon and Palestine, while Osama

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:12.860
bin Laden was actually looking at the global
world. So, in other words, 9/11 was a transnational

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:18.190
attack, which was funded in different parts
of the world. It was put together; it was

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:23.899
planned in one part of the world, Afghanistan,
and was carried out in a different country,

00:15:23.899 --> 00:15:30.670
in the United States. Now, we have never seen
anything like that. So, that is the, the product

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:33.399
of this globalization of terrorism.

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:41.649
So, what I did before 9/11, I actually calculated
the size of this economy. So, this is an economy

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:48.610
where we find three main components. So, the
first components is the illegal economy, which

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:53.839
is described as "capital flights." This is
a jargon to describe money they move from

00:15:53.839 --> 00:16:01.149
countries to countries, undetected, unreported,
and illegally. So, bribes, which go from one

00:16:01.149 --> 00:16:07.139
country to another, but also tax evasion gets
calculated into this. So, and this is 500

00:16:07.139 --> 00:16:12.390
billion dollars. Then there is, there is the
Gross Criminal Product. This is money generated

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:18.100
by, by criminal organizations across the world.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:23.829
So, we have from petty crime to organized
crime, which is another 500 billion dollars.

00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:29.959
And then we have what I have defined as the
"new economy of terrorism." So, these are

00:16:29.959 --> 00:16:38.579
money that are generated only by armed organization.
And one part is, of course, illegal, but one

00:16:38.579 --> 00:16:43.380
part, which is about one-third, is actually
produced by legitimate businesses.

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:51.130
So, people that are part of an armed organization
who fund this organization through help from

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:57.579
families, for example, but also, through work
that they carried out. And I think a good

00:16:57.579 --> 00:17:06.230
example of this is the attack that was carried
out on July 7th in London, where most of the

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:12.270
funding was legitimate. People had either
worked or used their salaries or used help

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:20.559
from their friends. So, there was not criminal
money coming in in order to fund this attack.

00:17:20.559 --> 00:17:27.240
So, in total, we're talking about 1.5 trillion
dollars, which is about five percent of the

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:34.610
world economy as it was in the year 2000,
or more than the GDP of the United Kingdom.

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:37.360
So, we're talking about a lot of money.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:44.970
Now, what was interesting, actually, is that
when I went to look at where did this money

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:50.730
get recycled because most of this money is
dirty money, so one way or another, it has

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:56.110
to be washed somewhere. So, what I found out,
that the majority of this money was denominated

00:17:56.110 --> 00:18:03.410
in US Dollar, and it was actually money laundered
inside the United States. So, this has very

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:05.940
serious implications in economic terms.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:11.280
I'll try to explain to you if you don't understand
in the question/answer, you can ask me. But,

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:18.210
what's happened is this; imagine all this
1.5 trillion dollars moving every year inside

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:24.740
the United States. Now, this goes straight
into the US economy, so it actually sustains

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:30.440
the US economy. But more to the point, because
it sustains the US economy, so it helps the

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:34.581
US economy to grow, it has an impact upon
the US money supply.

00:18:34.581 --> 00:18:42.299
The US money supply is the amount of cash
that every year is printed by the Federal

00:18:42.299 --> 00:18:48.419
Reserve in order to meet the demand coming
from the economy. So, the higher the growth

00:18:48.419 --> 00:18:56.030
of the economy, the higher will be the number
of bank notes that the Federal Reserve will

00:18:56.030 --> 00:19:01.230
print. So, I went to look at the US money
supply to see what was happening because,

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:06.850
of course, what I thought is, "If this money
come in and have to be money laundered, one

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:11.419
way or another, some of this money have to
come out in order to go back to the origin."

00:19:11.419 --> 00:19:17.289
So, imagine a Columbian drug dealer, he wants
his money back; he wants his profit. He's

00:19:17.289 --> 00:19:22.090
not going to invest all the money in the US.
Part of it has to come back and then with

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:27.330
those money, of course, he will buy weapons.
So, with those money, he will sustain the

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:34.020
growth of the illegal, terror, and criminal
economy -- our 1.5 trillion dollars.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:41.540
So, I went to look at the US money supply
figure and what I noticed is that from the

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:48.340
1960s onwards, an increasing amount of cash,
which is printed every year, left the United

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:55.029
States, never to come back. Now, these are
money that are taken out of the US in suitcases

00:19:55.029 --> 00:20:02.720
or bulk shipments or in containers. And I
discover that many economists from the Federal

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:08.720
Reserve's had written extensively on the topic
warning the government that something was

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:15.630
majorly wrong. Where are all this money going?
And, of course, this money went to fund the

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:22.490
terror, criminal, and illegal economy. So,
this is, this is how the circle of money actually

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:23.650
gets closed.

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:31.110
But what is very interesting is the fact that
the United States, as a country, was benefiting

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:36.500
from this flow of money. Not only because
the money was coming in to be money launder,

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:43.350
but above all, because the United States can
borrow against the total amount of dollars

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:50.090
in circulation in the entire world. Not only
against the amount of dollars in circulation

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:56.710
inside the United States. And this is because
the US is the reserve, I mean; the dollar

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.370
is the reserve currency of the world.

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:05.260
This privilege in economics is called the
seigniorage. So, the country that has the

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:13.330
reserve currency can borrow against the total
volume of dollar. So, this is explain why

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:20.720
the United States can have a debt, which is
enormous in terms of any other nation, but

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:25.590
it is allowed because the US has the dollar.
So you see how important is the dollar for

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:35.641
the US? So, what this research implies is
the fact that, in reality, the United States

00:21:35.641 --> 00:21:41.530
had been borrowing against the growth of the
illegal, criminal, and above all, terror economy.

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:46.850
So, it was actually borrowing against its
own, the growth of the economy run by its

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:47.850
own enemies. So, --

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:49.490
[clears throat]

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:57.090
this was quite shocking. And, but the situation
changed with the introduction of the Patriot

00:21:57.090 --> 00:22:04.559
Act. See, after 9/11, if you remember in October
2001, the US passed a legislation which was

00:22:04.559 --> 00:22:11.640
called the Patriot Act that reduces greatly
the rights of citizens inside the US in order

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:16.090
to protect them against terrorists. But, there's
a section, which is a financial section. In

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:17.350
this financial section, --

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:19.440
[microphone noise]

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:28.540
what the, the government actually posts is
a prohibition to all US bank and US registered

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:33.460
banks to do business with offshore facilities
 -- so, offshore banks. That means that it

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:40.320
block the entry of all this dollars into the
United States. So, it was, in reality, an

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.930
anti-money laundering legislation.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:47.640
At the same time, it also gave the US more
entirely authority -- the power to monitor

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:55.179
all dollar transaction taking place all over
the world. Now, the Patriot Act completely

00:22:55.179 --> 00:23:03.340
changed the way money flowed from one country
to another country.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:08.540
And, and I'll explain you why. It was first
of all, extremely unpopular among international

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:15.059
banks because nobody wants the US authority
to monitor what you're doing with your client.

00:23:15.059 --> 00:23:23.340
It, plus, of course, according to the Patriot
Act, if a bank failed to report of a suspicious

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:29.650
transactions taking place anywhere in the
world in dollars, it could be criminally persecuted.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:35.810
Now, you may remember that there are several
banks, for example, Lloyds and UBS, were actually

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:42.070
have been fined by the US authority on the
basis of the Patriot Act. So, what did the

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:49.120
banks actually do? The banks started to advise
their clients to get out of the dollar investment

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:56.060
into euro investment. And that explain why
all of a sudden, from October 2001 the euro

00:23:56.060 --> 00:24:03.370
start shooting up and the dollar start falling.
Now, the same thing, of course, happened with

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:09.640
illegal and criminal money. The criminal organization
did exactly the same thing. They said, "Ok,

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:14.760
we can't money launder anymore in the US.
Well, you know, let's go to Europe."

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:22.150
And then Europe was an ideal location because
we just got a new currency, the euro, which,

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:28.240
so, the, the, the way the European euro was
functioning was ideal. There were no barriers,

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.410
they were not controlled from one country
to another, the market was large enough, the

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:39.100
euro was a brand new currency. And above all,
we did not have any legislation, any an, anti-money

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:43.470
laundering legislation or, or any legislation
similar to the Patriot Act.

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:49.510
So, each country had different legislation,
but they were very weak. So, in reality, the

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:58.770
Patriot Act, instead of stopping terror money
being cir-, circulating around the world,

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:05.740
but also money laundering, it simply shifted
the epicenter of this activity from the United

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:16.210
States to Europe. Now, but, at the same time,
terrorism kept growing, in reality, from 9/11

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:24.740
to date. We have frozen only 125 million dollars
of terror money. The majority of this money

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:29.940
have been frozen in the first six months after
9/11.

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:39.100
Now, in 2005, I chaired this group of experts
on terrorist financing and we worked for six

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:46.780
months, basically tracking the money in order
to find a solution to the problem. And what

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:52.409
we did, we actually put forward a proposal
whereby the, the Patriot Act was gonna be

00:25:52.409 --> 00:25:58.710
scrapped. A start of an international body
was gonna be created in order to monitor the

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:03.200
transaction of different currencies, not only
of the dollar.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:11.780
To bring about a sort of cohesive international
policy, in order to fight terrorist financing,

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:16.720
and the Bush Administration, of course, who
which was in power at the time, did not even

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:24.940
take into consideration even one of this suggestions.
So, it was, to a certain extent, a waste of

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:31.310
time. But, but the problem remained because
the Patriot Act is still in place.

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:36.820
Terrorists, as you know, has not stopped.
On the contrary, actually, the terrorist activity

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:45.310
around the world has increased, and the unit
cost of a terrorist attack today is much lower

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:54.179
than it was in 2001. Now, if you think about
the, just executing 9/11 costs about half

00:26:54.179 --> 00:27:01.710
a million dollars, the attacked took place
a few days ago in the tube in Moscow probably

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:08.990
costs a fraction, an in, a very small fraction
of that amount. So, we are still facing this

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:10.710
problem.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:17.179
Now, the reason why all of this is happening
is because the Bush Administration reaction

00:27:17.179 --> 00:27:26.490
to 9/11 was very much single-minded. It was
also unilateral reaction, so the United States

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:32.210
decided to pass the Patriot Act, did not consult
anybody, they did not talk to the Europeans,

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:39.230
who actually had the much better understanding
of terrorism and its finances.

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:47.230
But the reason why all of this happened is
because, in reality, the, what the Bush Administration

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:52.880
really wanted to do was not so much bring
Osama bin Laden to justice or stop terrorist

00:27:52.880 --> 00:28:00.180
financing, as much as implement a plan which
was a plan to relaunch the role of America

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:04.799
within the international community as the
most important and hegemonic power.

00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:11.360
Now, all of this is contained in the Project
for the New American Century, is, is a blueprint

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:20.429
of the vision of the future of the neoconservative,
which was created under the supervision of

00:28:20.429 --> 00:28:29.070
Dick Cheney. Among this project, we find one
key point, which was the decision to go into

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:33.760
Iraq to bring about a regime change at any
possible cost.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.220
[clears throat]

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:42.559
So, 9/11 became a sort of opportunity to carry
out this kind of policy. And therefore, in

00:28:42.559 --> 00:28:50.930
2003, we actually went to war in Iraq on the
basis of false information. Now, what I wanted

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:58.630
to reflect now, and this is what links this
story to the present is how did the US actually

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:07.990
funded this kind of war and very, very strong
economic effort? As I told you before, the

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:12.990
money laundering was not any more, any longer
in circulation inside the US economy.

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:20.299
The truth is the funding took place by selling
government bonds in the international markets.

00:29:20.299 --> 00:29:28.049
So, basically, getting into debt. And I remind
you that Bush came to power in 2000, we doubt

00:29:28.049 --> 00:29:34.169
about the deficit claim, on the contrary,
Clinton left a very small surplus. So, the,

00:29:34.169 --> 00:29:40.240
the best way to sell government bonds on the
international market and be competitive is

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:46.990
to cut interest rate. If you cut interest
rate, the value of the bond rises. Now, from

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:55.360
9/11 to the summer of 2003, when they thought
that the war in Iraq was basically finished,

00:29:55.360 --> 00:30:00.900
interest rates in the United States goes from
six percent to 1.2 percent.

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:09.850
This is the time in which we find also, the
bubble of the subprime taking place and inflating

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:15.309
beyond any imagination. This is the time in
which banks, because they had the interest

00:30:15.309 --> 00:30:20.429
rate basically coming down continuously, started
to give free credit to everybody, including

00:30:20.429 --> 00:30:29.750
to people who actually could not afford to,
to get it. So, that's the link we find between

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:37.299
terrorism on one side, and the current crisis.
In reality, the, the bubble burst because

00:30:37.299 --> 00:30:47.260
the system had been based upon a constant
diet of low interest rates, and this is when

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:50.210
the world economy was actually overeating.

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:55.110
This is a, took place at a time in which,
actually, interest rates should be increased

00:30:55.110 --> 00:31:02.230
instead of decreased. Now, so the, the credit
crunch very much is related to the fact the

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:07.740
United States needed desperately to place
this kind of debt, in or-, we're talking about

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:15.720
four trillion dollars. This is the debt accumulated
during the Bush Administration from 2001 to,

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:23.630
to basically the day he left the White House.
But then what is the relationship between

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:29.049
this kind of debt and what is happening today?
I mean, today we see that the relationship

00:31:29.049 --> 00:31:34.669
between the United States and China is getting
tougher and tougher.

00:31:34.669 --> 00:31:39.530
This is quite risky for the world economy
because we are on very shaky ground. The reason

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:44.210
why we haven't gone into a major depression
is because one country, China, has continued

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:51.210
to grow and has continued to supply us with
cheap products. And the reason why this relationship,

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:56.649
at the moment, is shaky is based upon the
fact that the country that bankrolled this

00:31:56.649 --> 00:32:04.169
four trillion dollars needed by the US to
fight this war, is actually China. China bought,

00:32:04.169 --> 00:32:11.660
up to 2009, up to 75 percent of the issue
of treasury bonds of the United States. In

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:21.279
2010, it's gone down to five percent. So,
the US is actually funding its debt either

00:32:21.279 --> 00:32:25.919
domestically or through other countries -- Japan
being one.

00:32:25.919 --> 00:32:32.159
The tension between the two countries is based
upon, as you read in the newspaper, it's based

00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:39.159
upon the willingness of the US to do anything
to force China to unpeg its currency to the

00:32:39.159 --> 00:32:47.320
dollar. Because, of course, the Chinese do,
have pegged the currency to the US dollars

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:52.260
in order to defend the kind of debt they have
accumulated.

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:58.039
So, imagine if the renminbi appreciates and
the dollar depreciates all those four trillion

00:32:58.039 --> 00:33:06.420
that the Chinese actually have, will lose
in terms of value. It's very easy to understand

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:13.470
that. But, at the same time, of course, pegging
the renminbi to the dollar allows the Chinese

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:17.970
to comp-, to continue to be competitive with
their products on the international market.

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:24.659
While the US dollar, of course, coming down
as been very, very good for the US exports.

00:33:24.659 --> 00:33:31.190
In fact, the trade balance is positive when
the trade balance was actually negative in

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:33.180
2005 and 2006.

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:39.970
So, the policy of the US, at the moment, is
the policy of a country, which is really in

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:46.679
a big, big trouble and it's desperately trying
to solve its economic troubles by imposing

00:33:46.679 --> 00:33:51.730
certain kinds of condition to other countries.
And these other countries, because today,

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:56.559
as China is the case, because today are much,
much stronger than they were in the past,

00:33:56.559 --> 00:33:58.440
are basically saying no.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:06.690
Now, this is very serious. Meaning, if we
go down the road of protectionism, which is

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:12.460
exactly what is happening, and it's not only
the United States, it's also -- Europe is

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:19.440
doing the same thing, in order to defend their
own, our own products from the cheap Chinese

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:24.079
products. And if the Chinese retaliate, as
they've done, and I think the Google story

00:34:24.079 --> 00:34:29.320
is very interesting, because it's taking place
in a particular moment in which the relationship

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:34.500
between China and the United States are at
a very low point.

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:39.240
I mean, the Chinese, I just came back from
China, I was there for three weeks, the Chinese

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:45.329
are trying to impose harder and harder condition
to western business in order to do business

00:34:45.329 --> 00:34:51.889
in China as a sort of retaliation for what
is happening in the United States. So, it's

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:54.869
a very delicate, very delicate situation.

00:34:54.869 --> 00:35:03.030
So, to conclude, I think that if we go down
the protectionist route, if this relationship

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:10.010
between China and the US, which are vital
for our economy, actually fall apart, we may

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:14.830
risk to end up in a situation very similar
to the Great Depression. The Great Depression,

00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:20.380
in reality, was not caused by the crash of
'29. It was actually caused by the protectionism,

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:27.609
which was applied after the crash of '29.
Now, we if go down that road, the truth is

00:35:27.609 --> 00:35:35.610
that Osama bin Laden will have won this war
because the reason why 9/11 took place is

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:42.460
to destroy the power of the United States,
not only in economic terms but also in political

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:47.839
terms to destroy that role, that symbol, that
the United States always had of democracy

00:35:47.839 --> 00:35:48.839
and freedom.

00:35:48.839 --> 00:35:54.170
And if we go down the protectionist route,
I am afraid that this is what is going to

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:58.310
happen. And I don't think we should let this
happening at all. I mean, we should do something

00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:04.530
about that because otherwise, we would live
in a world that will not be the one we know

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:09.700
as being reshaped by an individual, Osama
bin Laden, and a bunch of religious fanatics;

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:14.150
you know the terrorists. Well, thank you.

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:15.150
[applause]

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:21.480
&gt;&gt;presenter: You willing to take some questions?

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:22.480
[pause]

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:33.060
&gt;&gt;male #1: Thanks, that was really interesting.
Just a question about, so, you ended the note

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:38.130
saying that we should really do something
about this. How do you balance, well, the

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:43.240
internal pressures coming from the United
States from the different lobbies to protect

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:49.390
their production within that, with the need,
and for the United States to get better relationships

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:55.300
with China? Also, you've given the fact that
the United States is, it's a government which

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:58.431
is, I can't, what, the electorates and they
have their own pressures, whereas the Chinese

00:36:58.431 --> 00:37:02.079
can really afford to take much longer term--

00:37:02.079 --> 00:37:03.079
[clears throat]

00:37:03.079 --> 00:37:06.200
much longer term positions on that policy.

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:11.470
&gt;&gt;Loretta: Well, I, I think that an organization
like Google, for example, can do a lot because

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:17.820
you, you're on, you're on the Net. I mean,
I believe that most of the true information

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:24.300
actually circulating on the Net is not through
the newspapers anymore; people should be educated.

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:30.910
Now, the story I told you, it is quite complex,
but it's not very difficult to understand

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:35.800
and yet, I haven't read the story like this
in any newspapers. I mean -- nobody is linking

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:41.880
this, this phenomena. But the truth is that
you can link it using data and using economic

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.710
information.

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:51.150
For the US, I'm afraid that Obama has very
good intention, but the people who are advising

00:37:51.150 --> 00:38:01.070
him are the same people that in the 1990s
did the deregulation. So, the, we need a major

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:06.500
change of also of advisor -- a new vision
of the economy.

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:12.460
And the truth is that the US should accept
the fact that perhaps it's not any longer

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:22.240
the most important economy and take some steps.
One could be to reorganize the monetary system.

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:27.740
I mean the dollar can't be the currency of
the world anymore. We can't have a reserve

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:32.300
currency, a currency, that depreciates regularly,
month after month after month.

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:37.300
I mean, people that hold that, that currency
in the end, you know this is why gold has

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:42.540
gone up so much. I mean, a lot of people,
in fact, are buying gold in order to protect

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:46.631
themself because the dollar is coming down.
The euro is doing the same thing. So, I mean,

00:38:46.631 --> 00:38:51.890
it's quite serious situation, so I would think
that the best thing would be to get economies

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:57.480
together and politicians in order to have
a new Bretton Woods whereby China plays a

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:02.670
very important role. But I don't see this
happening. I mean there's not that willingness

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:06.280
exactly as in the 19, the 1929 crisis.

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.790
[pause]

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:21.619
&gt;&gt;male #2: Thank you very much for coming,
it's very interesting. One question on terrorism

00:39:21.619 --> 00:39:27.440
because you mentioned the, the cost of carrying
out 9/11 and then the cost of, the relative

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:33.020
cost with carrying out the bomb attacks in
Moscow. I'm always surprised, too, when these

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:38.710
news come that actually this is not happening
more often, and I wanted to ask you w-, w-,

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:44.430
do you know why that isn't? If I were a, a,
a terrorist I would be doing things like that

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:45.609
every week. And I--

00:39:45.609 --> 00:39:46.609
[laughter]

00:39:46.609 --> 00:39:50.951
I think they have, they have the means and
they definitely have resources and the people--

00:39:50.951 --> 00:39:52.240
&gt;&gt;Loretta: Now, that's a very good question.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.240
&gt;&gt;male #2: to do this.

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:57.619
&gt;&gt;Loretta: Well, I mean, something like this
happens every day in certain countries. Pakistan,

00:39:57.619 --> 00:40:03.900
for example, Afghanistan, Iraq, so what we're
seeing after 9/11 is the concentration of

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:07.930
terrorist activity in a part of the world
which, of course, there was not terrorists

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:15.270
before. So it's ok, but Central Asia and then,
of course, the Middle East where we have terrorists

00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:16.270
for

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:17.270
[clears throat]

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:20.680
decades. But the reason why they're not doing
so much is because they're not very good at

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:26.030
it. So, the organization I described you,
the Red Brigades, doesn't exist anymore. I

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:32.910
mean, today the model of a terrorist organization
is very, very different. So, it's a virtual

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:38.540
kind of terrorism. A lot of these people get
recruited through the Net, they actually don't

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:44.380
go through a proper training, they don't go
through the selection that I was rejected

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:47.609
to, right? So, they are amateurs.

00:40:47.609 --> 00:40:55.410
I mean, think about that guy, for example,
that the, the, what was it? The 26th of December

00:40:55.410 --> 00:41:02.450
was lighting a match on a plane, sitting next
to three other people in order to blow the

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:07.440
explosives that was in his shoes. Why didn't
he go to the toilet to do it? I mean, you

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:15.380
know this is; I know this seems very logical
to us, but a lot of these people are fanatics.

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:22.430
A lot of these people are not very smart.
That's why they get recruited and this is

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:23.540
why they get indoctrinated.

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:29.550
&gt;&gt;male #2: Actually, there's a big correlation
between fanatism and just plain stupidity.

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:35.290
&gt;&gt;Loretta: There is. Absolutely. I mean, to
be honest, I, of all the people I've interviewed,

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:40.800
I mean I also interviewed members of the al
Zarqawi group for another book I wrote and,

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:46.150
and most of them, to me, sounded not very,
very smart. But, then you get the leaders

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:51.790
who are really smart but yes, who would become
a terrorist? I mean, terr-, it doesn't really

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:56.650
make sense. Yeah, I, does it make sense to
become a terrorist? Have you ever seen a terrorist

00:41:56.650 --> 00:42:02.470
actually succeeded in doing something? Yes,
you, you have a situation like Fidel Castro,

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:09.280
but it's a completely different context. Anybody
there today thinks that can bring down the

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:18.800
United States or the United Kingdom by blowing
himself up in a tube; it's stupid. It's not

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.550
gonna happen.

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:21.550
[pause]

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:33.369
&gt;&gt;male #3: Just following that train of thought,
did you find more about why your friend joined

00:42:33.369 --> 00:42:34.920
the Red Brigade?

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:41.930
&gt;&gt;Loretta: Oh, yes. My friend joined the Red
Brigades because she actually thought that

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:46.730
Italy was a block democracy, which is true,
I mean we have the same government for 35

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:52.700
years, and today we'll continue to have the
same government for another 35 years. Only

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:56.400
the name of the leaders changed.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:03.730
And she thought that the only way to unblock
the, the democracy was through the armed struggle.

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:12.690
But she was recruited by her boyfriend, and
apparently she was targeted by this guy. So,

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:20.160
this guy was trained in order to seduce her,
to recruit her, because she worked at the

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:26.080
Ministry of Defense, and she was the person
in charge of the route that every day a group

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:34.460
of key politician took in order to go to work
from home. And you know she got 35 years in

00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:41.400
jail for that. How stupid can you be?

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.619
[pause]

00:43:43.619 --> 00:43:49.470
&gt;&gt;male #4: You mentioned the three stages
of terrorism: state sponsor, privatization,

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:57.231
and globalization. Can you try and have a
guess at what's, what the next one will be?

00:43:57.231 --> 00:43:58.231
&gt;&gt;Loretta:

00:43:58.231 --> 00:43:59.231
[laughs]

00:43:59.231 --> 00:44:06.081
Well, I think what is happening now actually,
is a sort of privatization within the globalization.

00:44:06.081 --> 00:44:11.540
These small groups, I mean, for example, the,
again, going back to the Moscow attack which

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:18.520
is the most recent. Apparently, those two
women had been recruited through the Internet.

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:26.370
They received very, very basic training, and
they self-funded themself.

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:34.160
So, I would say that this is a sort of privatization
model, again. The same thing is the Ju-, the

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:37.550
July 5th here, July 7th.

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:44.090
They also, the Madrid attack, to a certain
extent, was the same. I mean, the idea that

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:54.150
terrorist organization are funded as it was
in the 1980s and 1970s by sponsor is actually

00:44:54.150 --> 00:45:00.040
not what is taking place, especially in the
west. Now, we do find some groups in Iraq

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:07.560
which receive money from Saudi Arabia. For
sure, we have sponsor that are sending money

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:12.040
in Pakistan and Afghanistan, but these are
different kind of terrorism, I would say.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:20.329
These are actually borderline with separatist
kind of fighting with the civil war, because

00:45:20.329 --> 00:45:24.349
this is clearly the situation in Iraq.

00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:30.589
But, talking about the kind of model that
is supplied in our country so, in the West,

00:45:30.589 --> 00:45:37.040
I would say that we have a sort of privatization
within the globalization. And it's cheap because

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:43.090
you know people get very scared. But y-, y-,
you know, the Moscow bombing was on the front

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:49.859
page of every single newspapers and for 24
hours, it was the most important news.

00:45:49.859 --> 00:45:59.010
And, so, this is the impac-, impact of 9/11
you know because 9/11 was such a tremendous

00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:06.290
event that got stuck in our subconscious.
So now each time something similar happen,

00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:15.829
you relive that kind of terrorist mastermind
attack, which, of course, is not the case.

00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:21.579
But and the government, of course, help a
lot because instead of rationalizing, instead

00:46:21.579 --> 00:46:27.280
of saying no, in reality, as we've said before,
that these guys, in reality, are not doing

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:29.319
it very often.

00:46:29.319 --> 00:46:34.000
So, either they're not good, or we are very
good, but one way or another we're winning

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:41.340
on this front. The governments use this terrorist
threat in order to scare us because they have

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:48.859
learned by scaring us, they are able to make
us accept certain kind of policy that we would

00:46:48.859 --> 00:46:52.640
never accept otherwise.

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:53.900
[pause]

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:57.680
&gt;&gt;presenter: More questions?

00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:58.940
[pause]

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:07.980
&gt;&gt;female #1: Yes, I was wondering, as we mentioned,
that you, that you rose a daughter and so

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:13.800
on, what's your opinion on the role of, of
the UK? Also, taking into account that there's

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.220
an election coming.

00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:17.119
&gt;&gt;Loretta: Within terrorist, maybe?

00:47:17.119 --> 00:47:22.140
&gt;&gt;female #1: Yeah, and economy. What do you
think of the UK economy situation?

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:23.140
&gt;&gt;Loretta: Well, the UK economy-

00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:24.140
[laughs]

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:25.240
is in very bad shape.

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:26.240
[audience laughs]

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:31.060
&gt;&gt;Loretta: That's for sure. Well, I, I, I
think it would be interesting to watch the

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:37.470
campaign in the next weeks because, you see,
to a certain extent both parties they have

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:44.650
to justify the presence in Iraq. And this
is going to be a key issue. Although, the

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:48.160
justification is very much on ideological
terms.

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:54.270
We are, you know, protecting freedom and democracy
and whatever, not in economic terms. But,

00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:59.069
one thing is sure and the public opinion now
knows that the reason why we have so many

00:47:59.069 --> 00:48:07.210
casualties it is because the UK soldiers did
not wear the protective equipment that the

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:12.700
Americans have. And the reason why they didn't
want to wear the equipment until recently

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:19.570
is because they were underfunded. They were
underfunded also in terms of weapons; they

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:22.450
were underfunded in terms of equipment, helicopters.

00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:30.599
So, it'd be interesting to see how this particular
aspect of the war, because running a war for

00:48:30.599 --> 00:48:38.310
a long time is extremely expensive, and even
if this war is only fought by professionals,

00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:45.589
the war is very expensive. So, i-, in a moment
like this, where we have major recession taking

00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:51.359
place in which the UK economy is not really
taking off, I would say that none of the economies

00:48:51.359 --> 00:48:57.470
is taking off, because the data that came
out yesterday about Germany also are extremely,

00:48:57.470 --> 00:49:04.520
extremely negative. There's a very high number
of small to middle size companies in Germany,

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:12.319
which actually have closed in the last six
months. Because there is not sufficient credit

00:49:12.319 --> 00:49:17.950
to sustain them, so I would think that something
like that, the justification of a war that

00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:20.500
is so expensive and we're not winning.

00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:30.530
Plus, a war that was, that was born out of
a pack of lies should be on the table in the

00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:37.410
electoral campaign. But, I doubt it, it's
any of the two parties; I'm talking about

00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:44.849
the Conservative of course, and Labor, won't
touch that topic because if they do, it may

00:49:44.849 --> 00:49:46.432
turn out to be the Pandora Box. But, backfire.

00:49:46.432 --> 00:49:48.800
&gt;&gt;male #5: The US is out of Iraq, I mean UK.

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:51.180
&gt;&gt;Loretta: Sorry?

00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:55.944
&gt;&gt;male #5: The UK is out of Iraq.

00:49:55.944 --> 00:49:56.944
&gt;&gt;Loretta: No, it's not.

00:49:56.944 --> 00:49:57.944
&gt;&gt;male #5: Mostly out.

00:49:57.944 --> 00:49:58.944
&gt;&gt;Loretta: No, no, no, no, no.

00:49:58.944 --> 00:50:02.120
&gt;&gt;male #5: But they're not in combat actually.
[laughter]

00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:09.599
&gt;&gt;Loretta: Yes, they are. They are in combat.
I, I can guarantee you. Y-y-y, you can use,

00:50:09.599 --> 00:50:12.730
see the bodies coming. I mean -- these guys
are in combat. I mean--

00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:17.580
&gt;&gt;male #5: You're talking about the war in
Afghanistan.

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:21.599
&gt;&gt;Loretta: No, no, no. I'm talking about Iraq.
The UK is at war and it's shoulder to shoulder

00:50:21.599 --> 00:50:24.560
with the US. It's the second largest contingent
after the US.

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:25.560
[pause]

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:26.619
I promise you, unfortunately.

00:50:26.619 --> 00:50:33.520
&gt;&gt;presenter: Ok, we've got another question
here.

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:41.400
&gt;&gt;female #2: Well, first of all, thank you
very much and I feel that it would be great

00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:48.050
if more people were aware of what you just
explained to all of us here today. I would

00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:55.240
like to know your opinion about the role that
the media is playing in this war of terror.

00:50:55.240 --> 00:51:01.810
You've talked about the changes that you would
like to see happening in the economy. Today,

00:51:01.810 --> 00:51:07.451
the media have succeeded in, in giving us
lunatic reasons behind the war of terror,

00:51:07.451 --> 00:51:13.079
one of them being religion, of course. What
would be the major changes that we need in

00:51:13.079 --> 00:51:16.240
our media landscape for this to maybe change?

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:24.390
&gt;&gt;Loretta: I think the media is very much
responsible for this failure to communicate

00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:30.210
to the world really what is happening. But,
in all fairness, I think that in certain countries,

00:51:30.210 --> 00:51:34.700
the situation is better than other countries.
I mean, clearly, if you talk about a country

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:39.490
like Italy, the media is controlled. So, yeah,
it's very much, you can say.

00:51:39.490 --> 00:51:44.880
But, in this country, the media is less controlled.
And I think one of the main problem is the

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:51.250
fact that today journalist has to work much
more than he did in the past so he has less

00:51:51.250 --> 00:51:57.530
time to do a proper research and on top of
that, the spinning, because you know this

00:51:57.530 --> 00:52:03.030
is all linked to spinning, the spinning came
at the moment in which journalists were desperate

00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:08.839
in order to fulfill all the different tasks
that they have to do on a daily basis.

00:52:08.839 --> 00:52:14.800
The 24-hour media, for example, so, in all
fairness, I don't think the media, particularly

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:21.720
in this country, but also would say in the
US, has done purposely a bad job. I think

00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:28.720
the media was just ill-equipped to do the
job properly, and continues to be so. Because

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:33.230
to do this kind of research, I mean, I told
you, I mean I started my story 15 years ago

00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:39.840
in 1993, basically. So, it takes a long time
to understand the intricacy of the system

00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:40.840
also.

00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:42.359
&gt;&gt;female #2: Isn't that a media choice at
the end?

00:52:42.359 --> 00:52:47.599
&gt;&gt;Loretta: Well, I don't think it's a choi-,
I mean, I think if you are employed, I mean,

00:52:47.599 --> 00:52:51.569
if you're employed by The Observer today,
for example, The Observer they say it may

00:52:51.569 --> 00:52:57.619
close, but it used to be a very good paper.
But if you're employed The Observer and you,

00:52:57.619 --> 00:53:02.869
the only way to keep your job because you,
there are no money is to write instead of

00:53:02.869 --> 00:53:11.619
one really good article every two weeks with
a serious research, but 15 mediocre articles,

00:53:11.619 --> 00:53:15.150
what are you going to do? I mean you will
do the mediocre.

00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:21.550
And if somebody like Alastair Campbell calls
you and invites you to a nice breakfast and

00:53:21.550 --> 00:53:28.920
spins you, you know, you gonna take those
news and you gonna print it. So, it's the

00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:36.270
problem is the system. The problem is, I think,
that the printed media is disappearing. Something

00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:40.880
new is coming out, which is on the Net, and
we are in this transition and unfortunately,

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:45.569
these horrible events took place during this
transition.

00:53:45.569 --> 00:53:51.930
And people believed, see everybody believed
what, what the, the leader told. I mean, who

00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:59.050
would've thought that Colin Powell, when he
went to the Security Council in February 2003,

00:53:59.050 --> 00:54:02.631
actually said one lie after another. I mean--

00:54:02.631 --> 00:54:13.720
&gt;&gt;male #6: That was in the newspaper. The
same thing, that it was all lies.

00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:17.841
&gt;&gt;Loretta: Was it?

00:54:17.841 --> 00:54:24.490
&gt;&gt;male #6: Yeah. The UK--

00:54:24.490 --> 00:54:25.490
&gt;&gt;Loretta: Well

00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:26.490
&gt;&gt;male #6: The UK has left Iraq, by the way.

00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:27.490
&gt;&gt;Loretta: Sorry?

00:54:27.490 --> 00:54:29.540
&gt;&gt;male #6: The UK has left Iraq. I tried to
Google it, gone to Wikipedia, whatever.

00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:30.540
[audience laughs]

00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:31.540
&gt;&gt;Loretta: The UK has left Iraq?

00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:32.540
&gt;&gt;male #6: Yes.

00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:33.540
&gt;&gt;Loretta: Well, maybe Wikipedia has been
hacked by the Chinese also, yeah?

00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:34.540
[audience laughs]

00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:40.450
Every is possible. Every is possible. But,
I don't think that unless you have they left

00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:43.597
in the last two hours, I don't think the UK
is not in Iraq anymore.

00:54:43.597 --> 00:54:47.590
&gt;&gt;presenter: On that point of debate, thank
you very much, Loretta Napoleoni, it's been

00:54:47.590 --> 00:54:54.130
a pleasure having you here, and thank you
everybody for coming.

00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:54.720
[applause]
