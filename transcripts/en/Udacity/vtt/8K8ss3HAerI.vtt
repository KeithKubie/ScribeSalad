The answer is a 32x slow down, okay, so since warps only have 32 threads,

00:00:04.976 --> 00:00:08.150
you can't have worse than 32-way branch divergence.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.396
So, at worst, you'll have to deactivate each thread one at a time, execute some code,

00:00:13.396 --> 00:00:17.793
and then activate another thread and deactivate the one you just executed,

00:00:17.793 --> 00:00:23.227
and at most you can do this 31 times. So, even if you have a 1024 threads in a thread block,

00:00:23.227 --> 00:00:26.162
you won't experience worse than 32x slow down.
