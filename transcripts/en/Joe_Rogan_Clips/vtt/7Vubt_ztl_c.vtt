1
00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.100
Again,
thinking about that,

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.080
about in relation to addiction,

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.550
I think often when you talk about seeing like work addiction,
right?

4
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:14.760
Which obviously caused by partly childhood trauma that he experienced,

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.970
there's been a real change in how we think about that as well.

6
00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:20.310
It relates back to what you're saying right at the start back chemical hooks,

7
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:25.290
right?
So if you look at the debate about,
um,
non-drug based addictions,
right?

8
00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:28.540
You think about 20 years ago,
people start talking about sex addiction.

9
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.490
Guy Called Stanton peal,

10
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:33.220
who were interviewed a lot first writes about love addiction or sources.
Exactly.

11
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.500
Gambling addiction at the time.
Initially what people say,

12
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.950
well this is bullshit because they believed the chemical hooks theory of

13
00:00:38.951 --> 00:00:41.520
addiction.
Right?
Right.
So it just seems like,
well that's not,

14
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.480
I mean there's an episode of chairs actually,
which I'm now would be,
yeah,

15
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.410
you wouldn't do this,

16
00:00:46.411 --> 00:00:50.220
but there's an episode where the whole hilarious premise of the show is that was

17
00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:51.420
the Ted Danson,
Sam Malone,

18
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.980
Ted Danson's character thinks he's a sex addict and this is like a punch line

19
00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:57.810
all the way through the show.
Right?
This was the attitude,

20
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.440
the ends where the goes through on a meeting a sex and love addicts anonymous

21
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.680
and like there's some woman talking about how she gets like have sex with every,

22
00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:07.440
every Madden ends with him just putting his arm around her and that's the end of

23
00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:10.290
the,
the end of the show.
Right.
That wouldn't happen in a sitcom.
Now people,

24
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.730
people thought,
well it might,
but people,

25
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.210
people don't think the very idea of sex addiction is ridiculous in the way they

26
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:20.830
did.
Right.
I don't think,
I think it's what this,
maybe they do maybe,

27
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.740
but then I think that's because there hasn't been a shift in gamble.

28
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.310
If you got to meeting in gamblers anonymous as I have with a friend,

29
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.450
I don't have a gambling problem,
but just to support someone,

30
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.620
they are as addicted as anyone in the next room down at narcotics anonymous on a

31
00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:36.570
lot of,
not a lot of gambling addicts.

32
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.150
And did you feel that they were as a dictator there?

33
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.850
They're straight up junkies and they might as well be chasing crack.

34
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.790
And that tells us something really important because you don't snort a roulette

35
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:48.250
wheel,
right?
You don't inject a,
an online poker,
right?

36
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.520
If you can have a professor not said this to me,

37
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.820
if you can have all of the addiction,

38
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.320
but none of the chemical hooks that tells us about how we've overestimated the

39
00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:02.310
role of calories as addiction,
Chemical Hook.
It's a,
there's a dopamine addiction.

40
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.400
Absolutely.
Everything you do that you like,
it gives you dopamine.

41
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.310
It definitely hit.
So I think there's been this attempt to integrate it by going,

42
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.320
oh,
well there's this pleasure in the brain and,

43
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.460
but some sort of self destructive issue.
There's something about gambling,

44
00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:18.470
there's a lot of self hate involved and,
and uh,
this,

45
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.230
this overwhelming feeling of failure that a lot of,
uh,

46
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.730
gambling addicts have because they fail so often and they're,

47
00:02:25.731 --> 00:02:27.250
they're always trying to chase the dragon.

48
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.240
They're always trying to make up for all the past things.
They've gone wrong.

49
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.450
This big score,
well,
this big score,
we're going to settle it out.

50
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.370
And somebody taught me about,

51
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.390
just think about what you're saying in relation to him.
A guy called Peter Cohen,

52
00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:43.380
who is a professor in the Netherlands who actually didn't say this to me

53
00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:45.780
directly.
I [inaudible].
Um,
he says,

54
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.500
we shouldn't call it addiction.
We should call it bonding.

55
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.100
That human beings have an innate need to bond and connect,
right?

56
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.380
And when you're happy and healthy,

57
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.070
you'll bond and connect with like the people around you with meaningful.

58
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.520
But if you can't do that cause you're isolated or traumatized or beaten down by

59
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:04.930
life,
we haven't been taught how to do that.

60
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.360
You will bond with something that gives you some sense of relief.
Right now,

61
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:13.990
for some people that might be porn,
for some people that might be gambling,

62
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:17.530
for some people might be cocaine,
alcohol,
whatever.
It says.
If you,

63
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.400
if you only have one bond that's giving you any relief,

64
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:23.740
you will obsessive Lee returned to that bond.
Right?

65
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.080
And I don't think that's a total lie.
He,
and as he would say,

66
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:28.330
that's not a total explanation for what's going on.

67
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.570
But I do think that is a useful way to think about some of these behavioral

68
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:35.240
addictions.
Right?
So I someone I know very well,
um,

69
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.170
a relative of mine has a gambling addiction and this is someone who has,

70
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.780
<v 1>okay,</v>

71
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.440
<v 0>no alternative form of joy or pleasure in their life.
Right?</v>

72
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.593
And

73
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.750
gambling gives a moment among lots of moments of search.

74
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.910
If you look at somebody who's playing online poker is,
I'd done my,
my relative,

75
00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.110
they're not happy or it's not looking at someone watching a nice movie,
right?

76
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.880
It's,
you can see,
I don't mean,
I'm sorry I should be up.

77
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.640
Someone with an addiction problem playing online poker.
Some people haven't.

78
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.830
Most people don't have a problem,
right?
Um,
it's the,

79
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.870
it's the relief of just being absent from your life for a moment or for however

80
00:04:14.871 --> 00:04:18.080
long you play,
rather than,
um,

81
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.250
I went to this philosophy,
connections,
my book about depression.

82
00:04:22.251 --> 00:04:26.390
I went to the first ever Internet Rehab Center in the United States.

83
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.750
It's a weird places.
Impressive place such as,
I like the people there.

84
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.310
It's in Spokane,
just outside Spokane in Washington.
It's called restart,

85
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.790
restart Washington.
And I remember going there.
Really,

86
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.920
it was really interesting to think about this.
Um,
I remember arriving,

87
00:04:42.921 --> 00:04:46.010
it's a clearing in the woods,
right?
A big wooden place in clearing the woods.

88
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.420
And I remember absolutely instinctively looking at my phone and feeling really

89
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.280
when a minute I got out the car,
I'm feeling really pissed off.

90
00:04:52.281 --> 00:04:55.490
I can check my email.
Oh wait,
you're in the right place.
Right.
Um,

91
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.490
and it's interesting cause they get all kinds of people and restart Washington,

92
00:04:58.491 --> 00:05:02.380
but they disproportionately get young men who are obsessed with multiplayer role

93
00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:02.811
play games.

94
00:05:02.811 --> 00:05:07.811
Like then it would have been well to walk off now it'd be fortnight and speaking

95
00:05:08.031 --> 00:05:12.530
to these young men,
I'm having this realization,

96
00:05:12.531 --> 00:05:15.680
talking to the woman who runs it is an amazing woman called Dr Hillary cash.

97
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.950
He said to me,
you've got to ask.
I think it relates to it.

98
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:21.793
You say about gambling,

99
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.910
you got to ask what these young men are getting out of this game because they're

100
00:05:25.911 --> 00:05:27.080
getting something out of it.
Right.

101
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.850
And she argues that one of the things that getting is the things they used to

102
00:05:31.851 --> 00:05:35.660
get from the culture,
but no longer gaps.
Like what?
Well,

103
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.960
I feeling that good at something,
a feeling that other people see them,

104
00:05:38.961 --> 00:05:42.540
that that part of a tribe,
a feeling that they're moving around,
you know,
um,

105
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.260
kids spend very little time outdoors now.
Right?

106
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.930
I think there's also anticipation.
There's puzzles,

107
00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:50.180
there's things where you're trying to figure out whether or not something's

108
00:05:50.181 --> 00:05:53.060
right or wrong and how to get it.
And then if you do get it,

109
00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:55.770
you get this positive surge of you don't get,
I mean,

110
00:05:55.771 --> 00:05:58.010
I think there's human systems that are being

111
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.970
<v 2>mirrored.
They're in gambling,</v>

112
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.870
<v 0>what psychologists call,
call that filling of mastery for your master's.</v>

113
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:06.050
When you feel you are good at something that is an absolutely underlying

114
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:08.720
psychological need.
Everyone needs to feel they're good at something.

115
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.640
If you don't have a sense of mastery in your life,

116
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:12.080
you will be depressed and anxious,
right?

117
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.320
Or you're much more likely to become depressed and anxious.
And I think,
again,

118
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.040
because it's so striking to me,
I've got teenage nephews,
I've got sons.

119
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.870
We actually don't ask anything of young men.
Right?

120
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.320
Very rarely are they actually asked to do very much.

121
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.390
They're not given responsibilities.
Right.
I think,
um,
look,
again,

122
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:34.550
I want to stress the most people playing video games and not dictated.

123
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.470
It's perfectly good form of pleasure,
that very directive.
I mean,
they're not,

124
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.600
most people playing them have a healthy relationship with them in the same way

125
00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:44.360
that I don't know if that's true and can maybe I,
yeah,
tell me about that.

126
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.860
<v 2>A lot of people playing them have a real problem with them.</v>

127
00:06:46.861 --> 00:06:50.880
They take up massive hours at a time.
It's a giant problem with young boys.

128
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:56.250
I mean the,
the thing is it's become an actual avenue for career.

129
00:06:56.251 --> 00:07:01.251
Now there's east sports careers where these young guys are making millions of

130
00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.860
dollars playing video games.
It's not like the old days where you would say,
hey,

131
00:07:04.861 --> 00:07:08.310
you're wasting your life.
Now it's basically almost like practicing golf.

132
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.180
But we have a setup back here where we play video games against each other.

133
00:07:12.181 --> 00:07:15.840
It's very addictive.
Don't you think it's addictive?
Sure.
Yeah.

134
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.530
So it's like basketball when I was younger too,
I loved playing basketball.

135
00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.450
Couldn't get me to play in the rain.
Right.

136
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.780
The basketball has movement and exercise attached to it.

137
00:07:24.781 --> 00:07:26.820
So you get some positive benefit from that addiction.

138
00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.660
I was definitely addicted to Jujitsu.
I would even train when I was injured,

139
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.010
you know?
But what does that mean?

140
00:07:32.011 --> 00:07:34.380
It means I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed not doing it.

141
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.060
The difference between a lot of video game addictions and particularly gambling

142
00:07:39.061 --> 00:07:41.600
addictions is that they tend to wreck people's yeah.

143
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:46.400
<v 0>Lives.
W you know,
when you had this period of Jujitsu addiction,
did you,
did you,</v>

144
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.590
cause they can essentially distinction there.

145
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.890
Where are you doing it to avoid some kind of pain in your life?

146
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.320
Or were you doing it because you just really deeply love it?
It's really,
yeah.

147
00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:55.040
Fun.

148
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.240
<v 2>Right?
Oh,
so you're chasing the thrill.
I mean,</v>

149
00:07:57.241 --> 00:08:01.770
I'm certain that was avoiding pain with almost everything I've done in my life

150
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.690
in some way,
shape or form.
You know,

151
00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:06.930
there's some of it where you're trying to do something positive to mitigate the

152
00:08:06.931 --> 00:08:11.620
pain or the frustration or the anger or whatever it is that's bothering you.
Um,

153
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.270
but I don't,
you know,
I,
I,
the video game thing was a real addiction though.

154
00:08:15.271 --> 00:08:19.770
It's like a compulsion.
How long was it doing in years?
Yeah.
How did you,

155
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:24.930
how did you get out of it,
Jay?
I quit.
I just quit cold Turkey,
stop playing.

156
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.610
I realized it was kind of messing up my life and my career.

157
00:08:27.611 --> 00:08:31.610
I was just taking up way too much time and I just,
I came to a realization,

158
00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.320
I was like,
I gotta stop doing this.
I'm just playing way too much.

159
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.860
And so I just said,
the only way I,
I'm just too competitive.

160
00:08:37.861 --> 00:08:39.090
I enjoyed it too much.

161
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:42.300
And so the only way to do it was to stop playing it all together.

162
00:08:42.301 --> 00:08:45.810
And we started playing it again recently after more than Shit,

163
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.650
more than 15 years of ever playing it at all,
you know,
and uh,

164
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.200
it's still addictive,
but I'm so busy now,

165
00:08:52.201 --> 00:08:54.090
I can't really fall into the grip of it.

166
00:08:54.091 --> 00:08:56.310
I'm actually just enjoying for an hour here or there.

167
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.170
<v 0>But that's so interesting in itself,
isn't it?</v>

168
00:08:58.171 --> 00:09:00.420
That's a bit like the rat park principle.
If there was to me,

169
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:05.220
correct me if I'm wrong,
that light,
the more you have in your life,

170
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.730
that is meaningful.
That is good.

171
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.070
And it gives you pleasure or sense of mastery,

172
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:15.780
the less space they will be for these objects of obsession come in.
Right.

173
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.120
And I think that is a principle that's true.

174
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.880
This was the principle behind the Portuguese drug decriminalization,
right?

175
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.100
If we give people good lives,

176
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.320
they will not want to anesthetize themselves so much.

177
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.890
It was the Swiss principle and I think we all see that in our lives to different

178
00:09:28.891 --> 00:09:30.030
degrees.
I,

179
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.433
<v 3>you know,</v>

180
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:38.730
<v 0>the happier I am,
the less I want to turn to,
uh,</v>

181
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.150
you know,

182
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:43.680
the behaviors that I developed as a child to avoid being present with like

183
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.660
violence and aggression.
Like

184
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.500
I don't think of like writing as an addiction.

185
00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:52.260
It's might be a compulsion if I have a day when I didn't do it,
I feel terrible.

186
00:09:52.261 --> 00:09:57.240
But something that is positive and rewarding,
I don't think is an addiction.

187
00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:01.620
Right?
Something that enriches your life and is not,
it's a way of living life.

188
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:07.110
The most fulfilling way to session maybe a positive obsession and compulsion and

189
00:10:07.111 --> 00:10:11.430
obsession,
uh,
uh,
a way of being in the world,
right?
Like,

190
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.820
I don't,
it's like sometimes I get people saying to me,
you know,
like,
oh,

191
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.950
am I addicted to sex or whatever and you want to say it.
I often say,
well,

192
00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.370
<v 3>does it give you pleasure?
Does it,
is it,</v>

193
00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:25.920
is it,

194
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.440
<v 0>and is it a way of avoiding pain if it gives you pleasure?</v>

195
00:10:28.441 --> 00:10:29.970
And it's not a way of avoiding pain.
It's not an addiction.

196
00:10:29.971 --> 00:10:32.430
It's just a way happy way of being in the world.
Right.

197
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.070
And that's the reality for,
and again,

198
00:10:35.071 --> 00:10:39.810
I think it's really helps us because ti partly what I'm arguing in loss in Las

199
00:10:39.811 --> 00:10:40.650
collections,
I'm chasing the scream,

200
00:10:40.651 --> 00:10:44.040
is we need to deeply reconceptualize how we think about these forms of pain like

201
00:10:44.041 --> 00:10:46.740
depression and addiction.
And this isn't some wacky business,

202
00:10:46.741 --> 00:10:48.060
the view of the World Health Organization,

203
00:10:48.061 --> 00:10:53.040
these leading medical bodies when it comes to depression,
that the,
yeah,
sorry.
