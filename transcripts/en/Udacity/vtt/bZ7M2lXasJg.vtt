00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.649
We're going to start this new unit by looking at a quadratic equation. A

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:07.944
quadratic equation has an x squared term in it. That's where the quadratic comes

00:00:07.944 --> 00:00:11.867
in. Let's look at one student's attempt to try and solve this. The student

00:00:11.867 --> 00:00:15.619
attempted to solve for x by isolating the variable. First, the student

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.863
subtracted x squared from both sides. And then subtracted 6 from both sides.

00:00:19.863 --> 00:00:26.131
Finally to isolate x, the student divide both sides by 5. So did the student

00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:29.440
find the number that x equals? Yes or no?
