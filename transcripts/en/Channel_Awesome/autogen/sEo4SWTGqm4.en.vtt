the first season the problems I have
with it I'll say right now begin because

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880
with it I'll say right now begin because
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.179
with it I'll say right now begin because
it is good the problems I have with it I

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189
it is good the problems I have with it I
 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.269
it is good the problems I have with it I
have to admit I only have with it

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279
have to admit I only have with it
 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.900
have to admit I only have with it
because this show has done so well in

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910
because this show has done so well in
 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.780
because this show has done so well in
having such a high standard and has

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790
having such a high standard and has
 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.270
having such a high standard and has
probably raised the bar a great deal as

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280
probably raised the bar a great deal as
 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.940
probably raised the bar a great deal as
well um because if this stuff happened

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950
well um because if this stuff happened
 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.830
well um because if this stuff happened
in any other kids show I probably won't

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840
in any other kids show I probably won't
 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.709
in any other kids show I probably won't
give a shit but the fact that it's done

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719
give a shit but the fact that it's done
 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.130
give a shit but the fact that it's done
in a show that they've established so

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140
in a show that they've established so
 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.369
in a show that they've established so
well uh I think it's worth bringing up

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379
well uh I think it's worth bringing up
 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.920
well uh I think it's worth bringing up
so I guess one thing is that the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930
so I guess one thing is that the
 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.990
so I guess one thing is that the
criticisms here are actually take it as

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000
criticisms here are actually take it as
 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.429

entirely knowing what he was talking

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400
entirely knowing what he was talking
 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.030
entirely knowing what he was talking
about but when it was all said and done

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040
about but when it was all said and done
 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.469
about but when it was all said and done
and now I do know what he's talking

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479
and now I do know what he's talking
 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.230
and now I do know what he's talking
about because there are good aspects in

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240
about because there are good aspects in
 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.330
about because there are good aspects in
here and I'm not gonna act like it was

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340
here and I'm not gonna act like it was
 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.920
here and I'm not gonna act like it was
totally emotionally devoid you know if

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930
totally emotionally devoid you know if
 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.050
totally emotionally devoid you know if
it wasn't there there's good scenes but

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060
it wasn't there there's good scenes but
 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.289
it wasn't there there's good scenes but
I'll admit I was not as invested in this

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299
I'll admit I was not as invested in this
 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.710
I'll admit I was not as invested in this
massive big climax as I was in other

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720
massive big climax as I was in other
 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.749
massive big climax as I was in other
episodes I think this was supposed to be

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759
episodes I think this was supposed to be
 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.590
episodes I think this was supposed to be
like the really big climax and I think

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
like the really big climax and I think
 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.319
like the really big climax and I think
the reason for that was bright is if

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329
the reason for that was bright is if
 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.830
the reason for that was bright is if
they gave it if they took out one of the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840
they gave it if they took out one of the
 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.800
they gave it if they took out one of the
other filler episodes and I'm not

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810
other filler episodes and I'm not
 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.120
other filler episodes and I'm not
against filler episodes are really not

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130
against filler episodes are really not
 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.219
against filler episodes are really not
if but if they maybe took out one of

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229
if but if they maybe took out one of
 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.729
if but if they maybe took out one of
those and replaced it with a

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739
those and replaced it with a
 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.520
those and replaced it with a
quote-unquote filler episode in the noir

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530
quote-unquote filler episode in the noir
 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.370

this stuff I think it would have had a
much bigger impact but the problem is

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060
much bigger impact but the problem is
 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.460
much bigger impact but the problem is
that there's a lot of times where it's

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470
that there's a lot of times where it's
 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.040
that there's a lot of times where it's
like a lot of exposition is thrown at

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050
like a lot of exposition is thrown at

there could have been more time devoted
 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.990
there could have been more time devoted
to it so that I guess um you saw the

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.390
se I actually think it's it's a good
chunk and it's a fair amount I think

00:13:59.390 --> 00:13:59.400
chunk and it's a fair amount I think
 

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.220
chunk and it's a fair amount I think
