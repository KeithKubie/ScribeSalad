00:00:00.442 --> 00:00:02.601
- [Voiceover] What does
period and frequency mean?

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:04.316
The period is the number of seconds

00:00:04.316 --> 00:00:06.111
it takes for a process to complete

00:00:06.111 --> 00:00:09.127
an entire cycle, circle, or revolution.

00:00:09.127 --> 00:00:10.844
So, if there's some repeating process,

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:14.788
the time it takes that process
to reset is the period,

00:00:14.788 --> 00:00:16.298
and it's measured in seconds.

00:00:16.298 --> 00:00:18.457
The frequency is the number of cycles,

00:00:18.457 --> 00:00:22.012
or circles, or revolutions
completed in one second.

00:00:22.012 --> 00:00:24.117
So, if there's some
process that's repeating,

00:00:24.117 --> 00:00:26.287
the number of times the process repeats

00:00:26.287 --> 00:00:28.906
in one second would be the frequency.

00:00:28.906 --> 00:00:31.596
This means it has units
of one over second,

00:00:31.596 --> 00:00:33.755
which is just called, the hertz.

00:00:33.755 --> 00:00:35.959
And because the period
and frequency are defined

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:38.677
in this inverse way as seconds per cycle

00:00:38.677 --> 00:00:40.714
or cycles per second, each one

00:00:40.714 --> 00:00:42.474
is just the inverse of the other.

00:00:42.474 --> 00:00:44.354
In other words, the period is

00:00:44.354 --> 00:00:45.929
just one over the frequency, and

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:48.527
the frequency is equal
to one over the period.

00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:50.540
One example of a repeating process

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.456
is an object going in a
circle at a constant speed.

00:00:53.456 --> 00:00:55.433
If this is the case, you can relate

00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:57.745
the speed, the radius of the circle,

00:00:57.745 --> 00:00:59.837
and the period of the motion since speed

00:00:59.837 --> 00:01:02.730
is just distance per
time, and the distance

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.118
the object travels in
one cycle is two pi R

00:01:06.118 --> 00:01:08.087
the circumference, the speed would

00:01:08.087 --> 00:01:11.146
just be two pi R per the period,

00:01:11.146 --> 00:01:13.603
or since one over the
period is the frequency,

00:01:13.603 --> 00:01:16.933
you could write the speed as
two pi R times the frequency.

00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.858
Since time is not a
vector these quantities

00:01:18.858 --> 00:01:21.676
are not vectors and
they cannot be negative.

00:01:21.676 --> 00:01:23.193
So, what's an example involving period

00:01:23.193 --> 00:01:24.619
and frequency look like?

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.428
Let's say moon travels around a planet

00:01:26.428 --> 00:01:30.234
in a circular orbit of radius
R at a constant speed S.

00:01:30.234 --> 00:01:32.349
And we wanna know what the
period and frequency are

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:34.229
in terms of given quantities and

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.394
fundamental constants, so
we'll use the relationship

00:01:36.394 --> 00:01:38.811
between the speed, the
period, and the frequency.

00:01:38.811 --> 00:01:40.717
We know that for object in circular motion

00:01:40.717 --> 00:01:43.183
the speed is two pi R over the period.

00:01:43.183 --> 00:01:44.506
And that means the period here

00:01:44.506 --> 00:01:47.277
would be equal to two pi R over the speed.

00:01:47.277 --> 00:01:49.513
And since frequency is
one over the period,

00:01:49.513 --> 00:01:51.734
if we take one over this quantity

00:01:51.734 --> 00:01:53.164
we just flip the top and bottom

00:01:53.164 --> 00:01:56.187
and we get that this is
the speed over two pi R.

00:01:56.187 --> 00:01:58.176
But we can't leave our
answer in terms of V.

00:01:58.176 --> 00:02:00.497
We had to express this in
terms of given quantities.

00:02:00.497 --> 00:02:02.576
We were given S, so our
answer for the period

00:02:02.576 --> 00:02:05.689
has to be two pi R over
S, and for frequency

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.957
it would be S over two pi R, which is C.

00:02:08.957 --> 00:02:10.827
What is centripetal acceleration?

00:02:10.827 --> 00:02:12.493
The centripetal acceleration of an object

00:02:12.493 --> 00:02:14.446
is the acceleration that's causing

00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:16.499
that object to go in a circle.

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:17.749
And it's important to note that

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:20.015
this centripetal
acceleration always points

00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:22.014
toward the center of the circle.

00:02:22.014 --> 00:02:24.305
The formula to find the
centripetal acceleration

00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:27.153
is speed squared divided by the radius

00:02:27.153 --> 00:02:29.914
of the circle the object is travelling in.

00:02:29.914 --> 00:02:32.381
Even though this has a
bit of an exotic formula

00:02:32.381 --> 00:02:35.091
for the acceleration, it's
still an acceleration,

00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:37.870
so it still has units of
meters per second squared,

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.793
and it is a vector, which means it does

00:02:39.793 --> 00:02:43.091
have a direction, i.e toward
the center of the circle.

00:02:43.091 --> 00:02:44.556
But this centripetal acceleration

00:02:44.556 --> 00:02:47.957
does not cause the object
to speed up or slow down.

00:02:47.957 --> 00:02:50.424
This centripetal
acceleration is only changing

00:02:50.424 --> 00:02:52.402
the direction of the velocity.

00:02:52.402 --> 00:02:54.533
If the object going in the circle

00:02:54.533 --> 00:02:57.082
is also speeding up or slowing down,

00:02:57.082 --> 00:02:58.331
there's also gotta be a component

00:02:58.331 --> 00:03:01.221
of the acceleration that's
tangential to the circle,

00:03:01.221 --> 00:03:02.426
in other words, if the object

00:03:02.426 --> 00:03:04.189
is going in a circle and speeding up,

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:05.766
there's gotta be a
component of acceleration

00:03:05.766 --> 00:03:07.798
in direction of the velocity,

00:03:07.798 --> 00:03:09.225
and if the object is slowing down,

00:03:09.225 --> 00:03:10.913
there's gotta be a
component of acceleration

00:03:10.913 --> 00:03:13.343
in the opposite direction to the velocity.

00:03:13.343 --> 00:03:15.618
So, centripetal acceleration
changes the direction

00:03:15.618 --> 00:03:18.488
of the velocity, and
tangential acceleration changes

00:03:18.488 --> 00:03:21.451
the magnitude or size of the velocity.

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.805
But this formula of V squared over R

00:03:23.805 --> 00:03:25.283
is only giving you the magnitude

00:03:25.283 --> 00:03:27.254
of the centripetal acceleration.

00:03:27.254 --> 00:03:30.436
This does not account for
any tangential acceleration.

00:03:30.436 --> 00:03:31.569
So, what's an example problem

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.129
involving centripetal
acceleration look like?

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.271
Let's say particle A is
travelling in a circle

00:03:36.271 --> 00:03:38.816
with a constant speed S and a radius R.

00:03:38.816 --> 00:03:40.676
If particle B is travelling in a circle

00:03:40.676 --> 00:03:44.154
with twice the speed of A
and twice the radius of A,

00:03:44.154 --> 00:03:46.086
what's the ratio of the acceleration

00:03:46.086 --> 00:03:48.458
of particle A compared to particle B.

00:03:48.458 --> 00:03:51.137
So, particle A is gonna have
a centripetal acceleration

00:03:51.137 --> 00:03:53.683
of the speed squared over the radius,

00:03:53.683 --> 00:03:55.761
and particle B is also
gonna have an acceleration

00:03:55.761 --> 00:03:57.182
of the speed squared, but this speed

00:03:57.182 --> 00:04:00.216
is twice as much of the
speed of particle A,

00:04:00.216 --> 00:04:01.639
and is travelling in a circle

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:03.716
with twice the radius of particle A.

00:04:03.716 --> 00:04:06.012
When we square the two
we'll get four over two,

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:08.379
gives us a factor of two times the speed

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:11.042
of A squared over the radius of A.

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:13.212
So, the ratio of the
acceleration of particle A

00:04:13.212 --> 00:04:15.857
compared to particle
B is gonna be one half

00:04:15.857 --> 00:04:17.846
since the acceleration of particle A

00:04:17.846 --> 00:04:20.485
is half the acceleration of particle B.

00:04:20.485 --> 00:04:23.606
Centripetal forces are
not a new type of force,

00:04:23.606 --> 00:04:25.107
centripetal forces are just one

00:04:25.107 --> 00:04:27.387
of the any other forces
that we've already met

00:04:27.387 --> 00:04:29.618
that happen to be pointing
towards the center

00:04:29.618 --> 00:04:32.511
of the circle making an
object travel in a circle.

00:04:32.511 --> 00:04:34.152
So, for a moon going around the Earth,

00:04:34.152 --> 00:04:35.894
gravity is the centripetal force.

00:04:35.894 --> 00:04:37.932
For a yo-yo going around on a string,

00:04:37.932 --> 00:04:39.893
the tension is the centripetal force.

00:04:39.893 --> 00:04:42.080
For a skateboarder doing a loopty loop,

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.218
the normal force is the centripetal force.

00:04:44.218 --> 00:04:46.148
And for a car going around a roundabout,

00:04:46.148 --> 00:04:49.226
the static frictional force
is the centripetal force.

00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:51.852
And these forces still
follow Newton's second law,

00:04:51.852 --> 00:04:53.729
but using centripetal forces means you're

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.450
also going to have to use the expression

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.185
for the centripetal acceleration.

00:04:57.185 --> 00:04:59.451
Now, if a force is
directed radially inward

00:04:59.451 --> 00:05:00.847
toward the center of the circle,

00:05:00.847 --> 00:05:02.510
you would count that force as positive

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.167
since it points in the same direction

00:05:04.167 --> 00:05:05.741
as the centripetal acceleration.

00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:07.579
And if a force points radially out

00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:08.926
from the center of the circle,

00:05:08.926 --> 00:05:10.601
you would count that as a negative force.

00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:12.867
And if force is directed
tangential to the circle,

00:05:12.867 --> 00:05:15.433
you wouldn't include it in
this calculation at all.

00:05:15.433 --> 00:05:17.225
You can include those forces in their own

00:05:17.225 --> 00:05:19.032
Newton's second law equation,

00:05:19.032 --> 00:05:21.193
but you wouldn't be using V squared over R

00:05:21.193 --> 00:05:22.785
for that acceleration.

00:05:22.785 --> 00:05:26.016
Those tangential forces change
the speed of the object,

00:05:26.016 --> 00:05:27.518
but the centripetal force changes

00:05:27.518 --> 00:05:29.296
the direction of the object.

00:05:29.296 --> 00:05:30.979
So, what's an example problem involving

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:32.671
centripetal forces look like?

00:05:32.671 --> 00:05:34.866
Imagine a ball of mass M rolling over

00:05:34.866 --> 00:05:37.280
the top of the hill of
radius R at a speed S.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.723
And we wanna know, at a top of the hill,

00:05:39.723 --> 00:05:41.731
what's the magnitude of the normal force

00:05:41.731 --> 00:05:44.044
exerted on the ball by the road.

00:05:44.044 --> 00:05:45.558
So, we'll draw our force diagram.

00:05:45.558 --> 00:05:47.184
There's gonna be an upward normal force

00:05:47.184 --> 00:05:49.020
on the ball from the road, and there's

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.630
gonna be a downward force of gravity

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.070
on the ball from the
Earth, and these two forces

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.234
are not going to be equal and opposite.

00:05:55.234 --> 00:05:56.383
If they were equal and opposite

00:05:56.383 --> 00:05:58.135
they would balance, and
if the forces are balanced

00:05:58.135 --> 00:06:00.291
the object would maintain its velocity

00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:02.104
and keep travelling in a straight line.

00:06:02.104 --> 00:06:03.875
But this ball doesn't
travel in a straight line,

00:06:03.875 --> 00:06:05.617
it starts accelerating downward.

00:06:05.617 --> 00:06:07.094
So, this normal force
is gonna have to be less

00:06:07.094 --> 00:06:08.847
than the force of gravity.

00:06:08.847 --> 00:06:10.285
To figure out how much less, we can use

00:06:10.285 --> 00:06:12.032
Newton's second law with the formula

00:06:12.032 --> 00:06:13.668
for centripetal acceleration.

00:06:13.668 --> 00:06:15.848
The speed is S, the radius is R,

00:06:15.848 --> 00:06:18.279
the force of gravity
is gonna be a positive

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:20.374
centripetal force since
it's directed toward

00:06:20.374 --> 00:06:21.803
the center of the circle.

00:06:21.803 --> 00:06:24.116
The normal force is gonna be
a negative centripetal force

00:06:24.116 --> 00:06:25.682
since it's directed radially away from

00:06:25.682 --> 00:06:27.078
the center of the circle.

00:06:27.078 --> 00:06:28.553
Then we divide by the mass, which,

00:06:28.553 --> 00:06:30.138
if you solve this for normal force,

00:06:30.138 --> 00:06:32.097
gives you the force of gravity

00:06:32.097 --> 00:06:35.319
minus M, S squared over
R, which makes sense

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:37.637
'cause this normal force has to be less

00:06:37.637 --> 00:06:39.253
than the force of gravity.

00:06:39.253 --> 00:06:41.637
Newton's universal law
of gravity states that

00:06:41.637 --> 00:06:44.626
all masses in the
universe pull, i.e attract

00:06:44.626 --> 00:06:46.435
every other mass in the universe

00:06:46.435 --> 00:06:48.207
with gravitational force.

00:06:48.207 --> 00:06:49.588
And this force is proportional

00:06:49.588 --> 00:06:52.113
to each mass, and inversely proportional

00:06:52.113 --> 00:06:54.911
to the square of the
center to center distance

00:06:54.911 --> 00:06:56.593
between the two masses.

00:06:56.593 --> 00:06:58.270
In mathematical form, it just says

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.780
that the force of gravity
is equal to big G,

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.496
a constant, which is 6.67
times 10 to the negative 11th

00:07:04.496 --> 00:07:07.168
multiplied by each mass in kilograms,

00:07:07.168 --> 00:07:10.049
and then divided by the
center to center distance

00:07:10.049 --> 00:07:11.830
between the two masses, in other words,

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.107
not the surface to surface distance,

00:07:14.107 --> 00:07:16.664
but the center to center distance.

00:07:16.664 --> 00:07:18.188
And even if these two
objects have different

00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:19.789
masses, the magnitude of the force

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:22.330
they exert on each other
is gonna be the same.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.011
This is illustrated by the formula

00:07:24.011 --> 00:07:25.414
since you could swap these two masses

00:07:25.414 --> 00:07:26.802
and you get the same number.

00:07:26.802 --> 00:07:29.204
And it's also something we
know from Newton's third law.

00:07:29.204 --> 00:07:31.047
This force of gravity is a vector

00:07:31.047 --> 00:07:33.126
and it has a direction, the
direction is always such

00:07:33.126 --> 00:07:34.890
that it attracts every other mass,

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.680
and since this is a force,
the unit is in Newtons.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.057
So, what's an example problem involving

00:07:39.057 --> 00:07:41.495
Newton's universal law
of gravity look like?

00:07:41.495 --> 00:07:43.403
Let's say two masses, both of mass M,

00:07:43.403 --> 00:07:45.861
exert a gravitational
force F on each other.

00:07:45.861 --> 00:07:49.144
If one of the masses is
exchanged for a mass 3M

00:07:49.144 --> 00:07:50.965
and the center to center distance between

00:07:50.965 --> 00:07:52.637
the masses is tripled, what would

00:07:52.637 --> 00:07:54.616
the new gravitational force be?

00:07:54.616 --> 00:07:55.983
We know the gravitational force

00:07:55.983 --> 00:07:58.918
is always big G times one
of the masses multiplied

00:07:58.918 --> 00:08:01.480
by the other mass divided
by the center to center

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.598
distance squared.

00:08:02.598 --> 00:08:04.470
So, the initial force
between the two masses

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.812
would be big G M times M over R squared,

00:08:07.812 --> 00:08:10.637
but the new force with the
exchanged values would be

00:08:10.637 --> 00:08:13.137
big G times 3M times M divided

00:08:14.046 --> 00:08:16.477
by three times the radius squared.

00:08:16.477 --> 00:08:18.177
The factor of three squared on the bottom

00:08:18.177 --> 00:08:19.879
gives nine, and three divided by nine

00:08:19.879 --> 00:08:23.838
is one over three times
big G M M over R squared.

00:08:23.838 --> 00:08:26.133
So, we can see that the
force with the new values

00:08:26.133 --> 00:08:29.345
1/3 of the force with the old values.

00:08:29.345 --> 00:08:31.268
What's gravitational field mean?

00:08:31.268 --> 00:08:33.189
The gravitational field
is just another word

00:08:33.189 --> 00:08:36.446
for the acceleration due
to gravity near an object.

00:08:36.446 --> 00:08:38.543
You can visualize a gravitational field

00:08:38.543 --> 00:08:42.286
as vectors pointing
radially in toward a mass.

00:08:42.286 --> 00:08:44.534
All masses create a
gravitational field that points

00:08:44.534 --> 00:08:47.193
radially in toward them and dies off like

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:50.536
one over R squared the farther
you get away from them.

00:08:50.536 --> 00:08:53.301
So, the formula for the
gravitational field little G

00:08:53.301 --> 00:08:56.963
created by a mass M is big G times

00:08:56.963 --> 00:09:00.479
the mass creating the field
divided by the distance

00:09:00.479 --> 00:09:02.779
from the center of the
mass to the point where

00:09:02.779 --> 00:09:05.656
you're trying to determine
the value of the field.

00:09:05.656 --> 00:09:07.914
And again, this value for
the gravitational field

00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:09.805
is going to be equal to the value

00:09:09.805 --> 00:09:11.496
for the acceleration due to gravity

00:09:11.496 --> 00:09:13.845
of an object placed at that point.

00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:15.645
The gravitational field is a vector

00:09:15.645 --> 00:09:18.461
since it has a direction,
i.e. toward the center

00:09:18.461 --> 00:09:19.943
of the object creating it.

00:09:19.943 --> 00:09:21.751
And since gravitational
field is equivalent

00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:23.434
to acceleration due to gravity,

00:09:23.434 --> 00:09:25.981
the units are meters per second squared,

00:09:25.981 --> 00:09:29.104
but you could also write
that as newtons per kilogram,

00:09:29.104 --> 00:09:30.786
which is another way
of thinking about what

00:09:30.786 --> 00:09:32.435
gravitational field means.

00:09:32.435 --> 00:09:34.971
Not only is it the
acceleration due to gravity

00:09:34.971 --> 00:09:36.798
of an object placed at that point,

00:09:36.798 --> 00:09:38.832
but it's the amount of
the gravitational force

00:09:38.832 --> 00:09:42.028
exerted on a mass M placed at that point.

00:09:42.028 --> 00:09:44.123
So, you could think of
the gravitational field

00:09:44.123 --> 00:09:46.429
as measuring the amount
of gravitational force

00:09:46.429 --> 00:09:49.124
per kilogram at a point in space,

00:09:49.124 --> 00:09:51.753
which when rearranged gives
you the familiar formula

00:09:51.753 --> 00:09:54.535
that the force of gravity
is just M times G.

00:09:54.535 --> 00:09:55.956
So, what's an example problem involving

00:09:55.956 --> 00:09:57.891
gravitational field look like?

00:09:57.891 --> 00:10:00.403
Let's say a hypothetical
planet X had three times

00:10:00.403 --> 00:10:03.274
the mass of Earth and
half the radius of Earth.

00:10:03.274 --> 00:10:05.432
What would be the
acceleration due to gravity

00:10:05.432 --> 00:10:08.068
on planet X, i.e. the gravitational field

00:10:08.068 --> 00:10:10.649
on planet X, in terms of the acceleration

00:10:10.649 --> 00:10:13.195
due to gravity on Earth, which is GE.

00:10:13.195 --> 00:10:15.122
So, we know that the
gravitational field on Earth

00:10:15.122 --> 00:10:17.643
has to be big G times mass of the Earth

00:10:17.643 --> 00:10:19.442
over the radius of Earth squared,

00:10:19.442 --> 00:10:21.565
which we're calling G sub E, and

00:10:21.565 --> 00:10:24.317
the gravitational field
on planet X would be

00:10:24.317 --> 00:10:27.696
big G times three times
the mass of the Earth

00:10:27.696 --> 00:10:30.762
divided by half the radius
of the Earth squared,

00:10:30.762 --> 00:10:32.677
and when we square this factor of a half

00:10:32.677 --> 00:10:34.757
we'll get 1/4, which
is in the denominator,

00:10:34.757 --> 00:10:38.168
so three divided by a
1/4 is 12 times big G

00:10:38.168 --> 00:10:40.966
mass of the Earth over
radius of the Earth squared,

00:10:40.966 --> 00:10:43.425
and since this entire term
here is the acceleration

00:10:43.425 --> 00:10:45.877
due to gravity on Earth,
the acceleration due

00:10:45.877 --> 00:10:48.340
to gravity on planet
X is gonna be 12 times

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.154
the acceleration due to gravity on Earth.

00:10:51.154 --> 00:10:53.152
Sometimes when you're solving
gravitational problems,

00:10:53.152 --> 00:10:55.625
you'll be given the density
instead of the mass.

00:10:55.625 --> 00:10:58.327
The density is the
amount of mass per volume

00:10:58.327 --> 00:10:59.606
for a given material.

00:10:59.606 --> 00:11:02.171
The symbol for density
is the Greek letter rho,

00:11:02.171 --> 00:11:03.899
and you can find it by taking the mass

00:11:03.899 --> 00:11:05.609
divided by the volume.

00:11:05.609 --> 00:11:08.922
So, the units of density are
kilograms per meter queued.

00:11:08.922 --> 00:11:11.054
And it's not a vector
since it has no direction,

00:11:11.054 --> 00:11:12.810
but it does let you solve for mass.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.393
If you know the density you could say

00:11:14.393 --> 00:11:17.408
that the mass is the
density times the volume.

00:11:17.408 --> 00:11:20.169
So, what's an example problem
involving density look like?

00:11:20.169 --> 00:11:22.518
Let's try the hypothetical
planet problem again,

00:11:22.518 --> 00:11:24.293
but this time instead of being told

00:11:24.293 --> 00:11:26.696
that planet X has three
times the mass of Earth,

00:11:26.696 --> 00:11:28.411
let's say that planet X has three times

00:11:28.411 --> 00:11:31.681
the density of Earth, and
again, half the radius of Earth.

00:11:31.681 --> 00:11:33.373
What would be the
acceleration due to gravity

00:11:33.373 --> 00:11:35.259
on planet X in terms of the acceleration

00:11:35.259 --> 00:11:37.501
due to gravity on Earth GE.

00:11:37.501 --> 00:11:38.961
We could write down the formula

00:11:38.961 --> 00:11:41.666
for gravitational acceleration
or gravitational field,

00:11:41.666 --> 00:11:44.111
which is big G M over R squared,

00:11:44.111 --> 00:11:45.924
but this time we don't know the mass,

00:11:45.924 --> 00:11:47.861
we just know the density,
so we want to rewrite

00:11:47.861 --> 00:11:49.744
this formula in terms of density,

00:11:49.744 --> 00:11:53.789
which we can do by rewriting
the M as rho times V,

00:11:53.789 --> 00:11:55.895
since density is mass per volume,

00:11:55.895 --> 00:11:58.388
and mass is density times volume.

00:11:58.388 --> 00:11:59.892
But we don't know the
volume of this planet,

00:11:59.892 --> 00:12:02.177
we just know the radius, so
we need to rewrite volume

00:12:02.177 --> 00:12:04.093
in terms of radius, which we could do

00:12:04.093 --> 00:12:06.955
since planets are spherical
and the volume of a sphere

00:12:06.955 --> 00:12:09.566
is four thirds pi R cubed.

00:12:09.566 --> 00:12:11.391
We can substitute this expression in

00:12:11.391 --> 00:12:13.766
for the volume and
finally get an expression

00:12:13.766 --> 00:12:16.282
for the acceleration
due to gravity of big G

00:12:16.282 --> 00:12:20.373
times rho four thirds pi R
cubed divided by R squared.

00:12:20.373 --> 00:12:23.234
And we can cancel an R squared
on the top and the bottom,

00:12:23.234 --> 00:12:26.016
which leaves this little
G as equaling big G

00:12:26.016 --> 00:12:27.766
rho four thirds pi R.

00:12:28.808 --> 00:12:30.685
So, the gravitational
acceleration on Earth

00:12:30.685 --> 00:12:33.494
would be big G rho of Earth four thirds pi

00:12:33.494 --> 00:12:34.990
times the radius of Earth.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:36.862
And the gravitational acceleration

00:12:36.862 --> 00:12:38.824
on planet X would be big G times

00:12:38.824 --> 00:12:41.374
the density of planet
X, which is three times

00:12:41.374 --> 00:12:44.314
the density of Earth times four thirds pi

00:12:44.314 --> 00:12:47.018
times the radius of planet
X, which is one half

00:12:47.018 --> 00:12:48.932
the radius of Earth,
which when we pull out

00:12:48.932 --> 00:12:50.838
the three and factor of a half,

00:12:50.838 --> 00:12:53.196
gives us three halves times the expression

00:12:53.196 --> 00:12:55.607
for the acceleration
due to gravity on Earth.

00:12:55.607 --> 00:12:57.166
So, the gravitational acceleration

00:12:57.166 --> 00:12:59.378
on planet X is gonna be three halves

00:12:59.378 --> 00:13:02.195
the gravitational
acceleration on planet Earth.

00:13:02.195 --> 00:13:04.319
Gravitational orbits
are just a special case

00:13:04.319 --> 00:13:06.640
of centripetal acceleration
where some object

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.225
is orbiting another object due

00:13:08.225 --> 00:13:09.862
to the gravitational force.

00:13:09.862 --> 00:13:11.284
And if that orbit is a circle,

00:13:11.284 --> 00:13:14.072
we can relate the speed,
the radius of the orbit,

00:13:14.072 --> 00:13:15.721
and the larger mass to each other

00:13:15.721 --> 00:13:19.186
using Newton's second law
and centripetal acceleration.

00:13:19.186 --> 00:13:20.616
You just plugin the acceleration

00:13:20.616 --> 00:13:23.243
as the centripetal
acceleration, V squared over R,

00:13:23.243 --> 00:13:26.294
and since the centripetal
force is the force of gravity,

00:13:26.294 --> 00:13:27.583
you can plugin the expression for

00:13:27.583 --> 00:13:30.208
the force of gravity as
the centripetal force,

00:13:30.208 --> 00:13:33.637
which is big G M M over the
distance between them squared.

00:13:33.637 --> 00:13:37.056
And since the mass of the
orbiting object cancels

00:13:37.056 --> 00:13:39.010
we get an expression
that relates to the speed

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.644
of the orbiting object, the larger mass

00:13:40.644 --> 00:13:42.479
that's pulling that object in,

00:13:42.479 --> 00:13:45.653
and the center to center
distance between the objects,

00:13:45.653 --> 00:13:47.243
which, if we solve this for V,

00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:50.595
gives us the square root
of big G times the mass

00:13:50.595 --> 00:13:52.631
pulling in the object divided by

00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:55.123
the center to center
distance between the objects.

00:13:55.123 --> 00:13:57.318
Note that this formula
does not depend on the mass

00:13:57.318 --> 00:14:00.037
that's in orbit since
that mass canceled out

00:14:00.037 --> 00:14:01.223
in the calculation.

00:14:01.223 --> 00:14:02.608
So, what's an example problem involving

00:14:02.608 --> 00:14:04.489
gravitational orbits look like?

00:14:04.489 --> 00:14:07.161
Well, imagine a space station of mass MS

00:14:07.161 --> 00:14:09.646
is orbiting at an altitude of 3R

00:14:09.646 --> 00:14:13.183
above a planet of mass MP and radius R

00:14:13.183 --> 00:14:15.734
as seen in this diagram, and then imagine

00:14:15.734 --> 00:14:18.208
a different space station of mass 3MS

00:14:18.208 --> 00:14:21.472
is orbiting at an altitude
of 2R above a planet

00:14:21.472 --> 00:14:26.447
of mass 4MP and a radius of
2R as seen in this diagram,

00:14:26.447 --> 00:14:27.879
and we wanna know, if the speed

00:14:27.879 --> 00:14:30.695
of the space station of mass MS is V,

00:14:30.695 --> 00:14:32.523
then in terms of V, what's the speed

00:14:32.523 --> 00:14:34.951
of the space station of mass 3MS?

00:14:34.951 --> 00:14:36.636
Well, we just showed that the speed

00:14:36.636 --> 00:14:38.473
of an orbiting object is gonna be equal

00:14:38.473 --> 00:14:40.822
to the square root of big G times

00:14:40.822 --> 00:14:43.149
the mass of the larger object pulling in

00:14:43.149 --> 00:14:44.933
the smaller object divided by the

00:14:44.933 --> 00:14:48.081
center to center distance
between the objects.

00:14:48.081 --> 00:14:49.926
And since this formula
doesn't involve the mass

00:14:49.926 --> 00:14:51.762
of the orbiting object, it doesn't matter

00:14:51.762 --> 00:14:53.861
that the objects have different masses,

00:14:53.861 --> 00:14:56.082
but the mass of the planet
can make a difference.

00:14:56.082 --> 00:14:58.438
So, to get the speed of
the space station MS,

00:14:58.438 --> 00:15:00.851
we could say that it's
the square root of Big G

00:15:00.851 --> 00:15:04.139
the mass of planet P over the
center to center distance,

00:15:04.139 --> 00:15:05.764
which is not gonna be the radius

00:15:05.764 --> 00:15:07.844
of the planet or the altitude,

00:15:07.844 --> 00:15:11.036
it's gonna be the radius of
the planet plus the altitude

00:15:11.036 --> 00:15:14.241
since this has to be the
center to center distance,

00:15:14.241 --> 00:15:17.371
which in this case will
be 3R plus R, which is 4R.

00:15:17.371 --> 00:15:19.157
And now to get the speed
of the space station

00:15:19.157 --> 00:15:21.656
of mass 3MS, we'll use the same formula,

00:15:21.656 --> 00:15:23.690
which is big G mass of the planet, which

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:26.203
in this case is 4MP divided by

00:15:26.203 --> 00:15:27.608
the center to center distance,

00:15:27.608 --> 00:15:30.701
which in this case would be 2R plus 2R,

00:15:30.701 --> 00:15:33.003
and again that's 4R, and if we compare,

00:15:33.003 --> 00:15:35.028
the only difference
between these expressions

00:15:35.028 --> 00:15:37.218
is that there's an extra
factor of four within

00:15:37.218 --> 00:15:38.502
this square root.

00:15:38.502 --> 00:15:40.533
So, if we take that factor
out, the square root

00:15:40.533 --> 00:15:43.533
of four is two, we'd get
two times the expression

00:15:43.533 --> 00:15:46.373
for the speed of the space station MS.

00:15:46.373 --> 00:15:49.930
So, the space station 3MS
is travelling two times

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:52.763
the speed of the space station MS.
