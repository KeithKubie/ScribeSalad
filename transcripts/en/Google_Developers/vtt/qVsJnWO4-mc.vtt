00:00:10.516 --> 00:00:12.440
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Hello, and
welcome to "YouTube Developers

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.080
Live." We have an exciting
show for you today.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.810
Let me introduce our guests
today, Tali Saar.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.570
How you doing, Tally?

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.490
TALI SAAR: I'm doing good.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.110
How are you?

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.110
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Doing good.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.300
TALI SAAR: Thank you
for having us.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.220
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Iddo Tal,
how are you doing?

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.240
IDDO TAL: I'm great.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.410
Thank you.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.510
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And
then on the Hangout,

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.010
we have Lior Gonnen.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.660
Can you hear us Lior?

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.616
LIOR GONNEN: Yes.

00:00:28.616 --> 00:00:29.572
Hi, guys.

00:00:29.572 --> 00:00:30.590
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK, great.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.159
What time is it right
now in Tel Aviv?

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.415
LIOR GONNEN: It's 8:20 PM.

00:00:35.415 --> 00:00:35.990
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.395
Well, thank you so much
for staying late.

00:00:37.395 --> 00:00:39.170
And I understand we'll
talk about instant

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.250
messaging today, right?

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.775
IDDO TAL: Yes.

00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:41.610
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK, good.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.090
So Iddo, tell us a little more
about what is it that you guys

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.720
are trying to do?

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.705
IDDO TAL: Well, invi is the next
generation of texting, So

00:00:49.705 --> 00:00:53.925
it lets you share rich
media clips.

00:00:53.925 --> 00:00:55.180
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I see
you're well prepared.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.250
You have a deck with you.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.520
IDDO TAL: Yeah.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.670
We'll go through it.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.270
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.355
Show us what you've got.

00:01:01.355 --> 00:01:03.730
IDDO TAL: So we believe it
shouldn't look like that.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.720
That's not a smartphone.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.560
It should look like that.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.200
The YouTube is embedded right
within in the conversation.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.885
Your click on it.

00:01:09.885 --> 00:01:12.330
You can start watching
it while chatting.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.500
Flip through photo,
share location.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.750
Eventually our philosophy is
that every app on the phone is

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.020
fully integrated into the
communication tool of texting,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.710
and that's the way texting
should be, right?

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.940
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Mm-hmm.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.650
IDDO TAL: And of course, all
wrapped up in a beautiful

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.055
state of the art user
experience.

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:32.280
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So is it fair
to say you guys really

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.580
bring the rich media into
the text messaging?

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.460
IDDO TAL: Yeah.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.110
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So I think
the text messaging is no

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.690
longer text messaging.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:41.280
OK, great.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.560
So I understand that we have a
video that kind of shows the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.760
basic overview of how
the app works.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.910
And let's see if we can roll
it for our audience.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.745
We have our excellent producer
here nodding.

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:53.150
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:53.150 --> 00:03:27.165
-[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:27.730
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.620
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So why don't
we switch to a live demo.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.060
I know Tali was going to show
us how the app works in

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.560
practice just to--

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.580
TALI SAAR: Sure.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.040
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: --make sure
that it really works as

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.190
beautifully as it does
in the video.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.040
TALI SAAR: I am happy to.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.510
So yeah.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.300
So you just saw in
the video part.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.380
But let's run through
it together.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.040
So this is my invi.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.280
You can see this is my inbox.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.200
I have all my friends right
here, and they all have these

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.730
cover photos, which makes it
really easy for me to find the

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.310
right contact.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.530
I can just see their face.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.500
I don't even need to
read their name.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.420
So this is my conversation with
Iddo, and let's see what

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.220
it looks like when we
share rich media or

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.100
content from the web.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.970
So this is, for example,
a link.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.960
It's an article from the web,
so instead of getting this

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.270
blue link that you click,
you open the browser.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.520
You just get it embedded
in the chat.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.330
You get a snippet.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.790
You get a nice preview of what
the article is about, so it's

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.450
really embedded inside your chat
as part of the texting

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.480
experience.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.390
Now, this is YouTube.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.640
Let's click on it.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.630
So if somebody sends me a
YouTube, this is what it looks

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.750
like inside my chat.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.040
It's embedded, and if
I click to play--

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.930
just a sec.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.670
If I click to play, it actually
plays inside my chat,

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:35.965
so I don't need to
leave the app.

00:04:35.965 --> 00:04:37.680
I don't need to go into
a different viewing.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.940
It's just everything really
integrated inside chat.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.400
Now, I can open my keyboard,
and I can continue texting

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.910
while I'm watching the video.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.135
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Nice.

00:04:46.135 --> 00:04:48.560
TALI SAAR: And eventually, if I
want to share this video, I

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:58.945
can just hit Forward, forward
it to Lior, and that's it.

00:04:58.945 --> 00:05:01.780
It shows up inside my chat with
Lior, and it's really,

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.110
really easy to share and
communicate with your friends.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.310
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.870
So speaking of Lior.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.070
Hey, Lior, I was going to ask
a few technical questions

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.300
about your app.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.480
So can you tell us a little
more about how the app is

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.902
implemented?

00:05:17.902 --> 00:05:18.750
LIOR GONNEN: Sure.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:25.800
So the app itself is written
100% in pure Android and Java.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.060
We're actually using quite
a few Google libraries.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.660
Obviously, the Google YouTube
native Player is the first.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.265
Our entire protocol is running
over Google protocol buffers,

00:05:37.265 --> 00:05:39.860
running over HTTP
to the server.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.330
So Google protocol buffers
is the next.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:45.490
Where also you can REST API.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.800
You can actually serve two
videos from within the app.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.310
You don't have to leave
the YouTube app.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.225
Obviously, you can share
directly from there as well.

00:05:57.225 --> 00:06:00.165
We're also using the Google
phone number library.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.000
and Jackson to parse JSON
requests from YouTube.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.800
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.550
So you're using the YouTube
Android Player API to

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.130
implement the inline playback.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.615
Is that correct?

00:06:16.615 --> 00:06:18.530
LIOR GONNEN: Yes, it is
correct, and we're are

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.380
actually one of the very
first to use it.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.300
We were on your beta program.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.292
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Right.

00:06:24.292 --> 00:06:27.310
LIOR GONNEN: And we had fun
being a part of it.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.100
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.490
Great.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.280
LIOR GONNEN: It works
beautifully from day one.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:29.775
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:06:29.775 --> 00:06:33.160
Well, I'm really happy to see
a real product come out of

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.170
that engagement.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:35.500
So very nice.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.720
So we typically like to ask
people on our show whether

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.350
there was anything that
surprised you while you were

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.080
developing your application,
anything-- whether there's a

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.750
technology or the usage, or the
business, can you share

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.144
any insights with
our audience?

00:06:52.144 --> 00:06:53.120
LIOR GONNEN: Yeah.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.420
So for example, one
of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.340
that we had, first of
all, users really

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.740
like our user interface.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.720
And when we went out to the
market onto Google Play,

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.840
people said, hey, guys, we
really like your user

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.315
interface, but we still don't
have any friends on invi, and

00:07:09.315 --> 00:07:11.220
we really want to enjoy
the beautiful

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.220
experience over texting.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.710
So why don't you add
SMS support?

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.320
So this was one thing that we
didn't plan to do, but we did

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.296
it, because our users
asked for it.

00:07:22.296 --> 00:07:23.120
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:28.170
So the way the app works right
now is, if I have an invi app

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:32.410
and I send a message to Lior,
then the message is actually

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.950
going to go over IP and through
your service, right?

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.860
If someone doesn't have
it, I can still send a

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.120
regular SMS to them.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.075
IDDO TAL: Exactly.

00:07:41.075 --> 00:07:41.610
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.790
And this is new in the version
you just released?

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:44.580
IDDO TAL: Yeah.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.520
Just two weeks ago.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:45.960
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.700
IDDO TAL: And actually, invi
replaced the default texting

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.780
application in creating
a rich media

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.260
experience also over SMS.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.660
So our technology can take the
SMS that you've got with a

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.730
link of YouTube, and actually it
will not present the link.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.880
Even though it's gone through an
SMS, it presents the widget

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.030
that you can actually click
and play it right while

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.475
continue SMSing or invi's.

00:08:07.475 --> 00:08:08.140
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.720
And then also you can also
share to invi, right?

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.230
So really any piece of rich
media that you guys support,

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.480
if I go through the standard
Android sharing, it will be

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.070
sent to your app and then to
whatever their CP and then

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.700
rendered in the rich media--

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:22.380
IDDO TAL: Yeah.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.840
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: -on
the receiving side.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.600
IDDO TAL: Exactly.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.500
That's what the big one
with our users.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.186
So if you're on Flipboard,
you're reading

00:08:29.186 --> 00:08:30.000
an interesting article.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.510
You say, oh, I have to
send it to Lior.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.549
So I can go from the Flipboard,
click Share.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:37.820
Invi is one of the options.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.789
I click invi and Lior gets it.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:40.409
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:41.110
Cool.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.190
And then another question that
we typically like to ask,

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:48.610
anything that you saw on the API
that you wish we had but

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:53.645
we didn't, any kind of road
map feedback for us?

00:08:53.645 --> 00:08:54.750
LIOR GONNEN: Yeah.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:58.770
I think I have for the YouTube
native Player, which is great,

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:03.370
and we really love it, it's
limited to being used inside

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:05.180
of an activity or a fragment.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:09.230
And one thing that we'd like to
do is to allow the user to

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.140
play YouTube while they're out
of the act, while they're

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.960
doing something completely else
on their phone or tablet.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:20.220
So just show a floating window,
it's something that we

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.560
were not able to do with
the current API.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.585
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I see.

00:09:23.585 --> 00:09:24.250
Cool.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:24.570
All right.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.820
Well, let's switch to the
moderator queue to see if we

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.590
have any questions from
our audience.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:29.200
Let's see.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.690
I see one question that is
relevant, and I think it's

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:32.540
addressed to me.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:33.980
The question is whether
YouTube Developer

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:34.990
Relations is hiring.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.200
And yes, we are hiring.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.100
You can learn more at
developers.google.com/jobs.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.970
In fact, the Google Developer
Relations team is hiring.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:46.910
So if you are not into YouTube,
you can look at some

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.470
of the other opportunities
that we have available.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.630
Well, I think this concludes
our show today.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.830
Thank you very much
for joining us.

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:57.950
And thank you, Lior, for staying
up late in Tel Aviv.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.190
And for those of
you watching--

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.040
LIOR GONNEN: Thank
you very much.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.890
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: --we'll see
you live again next week on

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:04.470
"YouTube Developers
Live." Bye.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:05.040
IDDO TAL: Bye.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.290
Thank you.
