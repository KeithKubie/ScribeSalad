00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.063
- [Voiceover] So let's think
a little bit about waves.

00:00:03.063 --> 00:00:05.684
The classical notion of what a wave is,

00:00:05.684 --> 00:00:08.670
is it's a disturbance
traveling through a medium.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.670
Disturbance traveling through a medium.

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:20.251
So what do we mean by disturbance and

00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:22.120
what do we mean by a medium?

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.066
We could come up with some
fairly simple examples.

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:29.007
Let's say that I have
a little puddle here.

00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:30.734
So that's my little puddle.

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:34.127
And let's say I were to
drop a stone in that puddle.

00:00:34.127 --> 00:00:35.834
So this is my stone.

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:37.358
It gets dropped in the puddle.

00:00:37.358 --> 00:00:38.963
We've all seen what happens.

00:00:38.963 --> 00:00:40.832
Right when it goes into the water,

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:42.498
that pushes that water down,

00:00:42.498 --> 00:00:44.448
pushes the water around it out,

00:00:44.448 --> 00:00:46.196
then that water comes back up.

00:00:46.196 --> 00:00:49.060
Then you have this traveling disturbance.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.681
You have this traveling disturbance.

00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:54.993
These kind of rings that
start to radiate outward

00:00:54.993 --> 00:00:59.993
from where I actually dropped the pebble.

00:01:04.461 --> 00:01:09.215
You can actually see them move outwards.

00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:12.425
You can see the crests of
those waves move outwards.

00:01:12.425 --> 00:01:14.091
We're talking about a disturbance.

00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:15.229
Well this is that disturbance.

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.484
The pond was completely flat,

00:01:17.484 --> 00:01:18.743
but then we agitate it.

00:01:18.743 --> 00:01:20.105
We pushed it down.

00:01:20.105 --> 00:01:21.324
It pushed the water outwards.

00:01:21.324 --> 00:01:23.799
Then that pushed the water
next to it up and down,

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:24.937
up and down.

00:01:24.937 --> 00:01:27.558
It traveled outwards from the point

00:01:27.558 --> 00:01:29.204
of that initial disturbance.

00:01:29.204 --> 00:01:33.653
We have this disturbance
traveling through the medium.

00:01:33.653 --> 00:01:35.340
What's the medium here?

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.184
The medium here is the water.

00:01:38.184 --> 00:01:41.130
The initial disturbance was the rock

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.796
disturbing that water.

00:01:42.796 --> 00:01:44.909
But then that water disturbed
the water around it,

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.433
which disturbed the water around it.

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:49.826
That disturbance kept
traveling through the medium.

00:01:49.826 --> 00:01:52.711
We can give other examples of this.

00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:57.711
If I take a really long string
and hold it right there.

00:01:59.314 --> 00:02:01.041
That's my hand.

00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:05.287
The string is, let's just
say, attached to something.

00:02:05.287 --> 00:02:07.728
Let's say it's a really long string

00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:10.363
and right now there's some slack in it.

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:13.025
It's attached to a wall.

00:02:13.025 --> 00:02:16.682
Let's say that I were to start
moving my hand up and down.

00:02:16.682 --> 00:02:18.429
So I move my hand up and down.

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:19.729
What's going to happen?

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:22.935
If I just did it once,

00:02:22.935 --> 00:02:25.380
what I'm gonna have is this lump of string

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.752
move from the left to the right.

00:02:28.752 --> 00:02:31.414
So that's what it's
gonna look like at first.

00:02:31.414 --> 00:02:35.863
Then a few seconds later,
it's gonna look like this.

00:02:35.863 --> 00:02:37.834
It's gonna look something like this.

00:02:37.834 --> 00:02:39.927
You're gonna have this disturbance,

00:02:39.927 --> 00:02:43.604
which is this wave, this
lump that I just generated.

00:02:43.604 --> 00:02:48.277
It is going to move to the right.

00:02:48.277 --> 00:02:49.476
What's the medium?

00:02:49.476 --> 00:02:52.097
The medium in this case is the string.

00:02:52.097 --> 00:02:53.681
It is the string.

00:02:53.681 --> 00:02:55.368
What just happened there?

00:02:55.368 --> 00:02:58.151
When I jerk the string up,

00:02:58.151 --> 00:03:01.808
I'm disturbing those string
molecules right next to my hand.

00:03:01.808 --> 00:03:03.860
They're pulling on the
string molecules next to them

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.465
pulling on the sting
molecules next to them.

00:03:05.465 --> 00:03:08.411
Then you have this traveling lump.

00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:10.910
Once again, these are
both examples of waves.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.339
Disturbances traveling through a medium.

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:19.260
Now I can give other through a medium.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.642
I can give other examples.

00:03:20.642 --> 00:03:21.788
Sound waves.

00:03:21.788 --> 00:03:23.023
What causes sound waves?

00:03:23.023 --> 00:03:27.351
You have a bunch of air
particles all bouncing around

00:03:27.351 --> 00:03:32.329
at actually surprisingly fast speeds.

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:33.609
But if you disturb them,

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.108
if you cause something to, say, compress

00:03:36.108 --> 00:03:37.992
a bunch of air particles right here.

00:03:37.992 --> 00:03:40.532
These air particles get ultra-compressed.

00:03:40.532 --> 00:03:42.543
Some type of clap happens,

00:03:42.543 --> 00:03:44.656
so these get ultra-compressed.

00:03:44.656 --> 00:03:47.033
Then they're gonna bounce
on the ones next to them.

00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:49.430
Once again, you have this disturbance

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.015
traveling through the medium.

00:03:51.015 --> 00:03:54.489
In this case, the medium is the air.

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.786
The medium is the air.

00:03:56.786 --> 00:03:58.106
So, now that we've seen some

00:03:58.106 --> 00:04:00.320
classical notions of waves,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.368
let's think about something
a little bit more mysterious.

00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:07.086
That is the notion of light.

00:04:07.086 --> 00:04:12.086
Light definitely has wave like properties.

00:04:12.722 --> 00:04:15.224
Wave light can interfere with each other.

00:04:15.224 --> 00:04:17.682
We can do a whole other videos on light.

00:04:17.682 --> 00:04:22.682
If I were to take a barrier like that

00:04:24.012 --> 00:04:28.924
with two small slits in it.

00:04:28.924 --> 00:04:33.748
If I were to shine some light,

00:04:33.748 --> 00:04:35.710
one way to think about
it is these slits are

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.464
the only place where the
disturbance gets through

00:04:40.464 --> 00:04:42.882
and then it would cause the light

00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:47.087
to propagate from each of them like that.

00:04:47.087 --> 00:04:50.013
Maybe I'm just drawing
the crests of the waves,

00:04:50.013 --> 00:04:52.289
but also come out from here.

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.007
You can see where the two crests meet.

00:04:56.007 --> 00:05:00.497
They're going to constructively
enhance each other.

00:05:00.497 --> 00:05:03.138
They're going to constructively interfere.

00:05:03.138 --> 00:05:08.034
If you were to put some type
of a detector right over here,

00:05:08.034 --> 00:05:11.326
you would see the bright
points of the light

00:05:11.326 --> 00:05:14.089
and you would see the
dark points of the light.

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:15.755
So light definitely behaves like a wave.

00:05:15.755 --> 00:05:17.380
I'm just showing you even one example of

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.574
light behaving like a wave.

00:05:19.574 --> 00:05:22.805
But if it is a wave, that
means it needs to be or

00:05:22.805 --> 00:05:24.444
if we use our classical logic,

00:05:24.444 --> 00:05:25.086
you would say,

00:05:25.086 --> 00:05:26.127
well that means it's a disturbance

00:05:26.127 --> 00:05:28.168
traveling through a medium.

00:05:28.168 --> 00:05:30.423
But what is that medium?

00:05:30.423 --> 00:05:33.349
We have light coming from our sun.

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:35.239
We call it sunlight.

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:37.352
We have light coming,

00:05:37.352 --> 00:05:38.550
I keep wanting to make it a -

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.338
actually our sun is white,

00:05:40.338 --> 00:05:42.471
we tend to draw it as a yellowish color,

00:05:42.471 --> 00:05:44.178
but that's just because of its -

00:05:44.178 --> 00:05:46.291
what happens is it goes
through the atmosphere.

00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:50.944
So you have the sun, you have the earth.

00:05:50.944 --> 00:05:52.711
This is not drawn to scale.

00:05:52.711 --> 00:05:54.743
Somehow that light is able to reach us

00:05:54.743 --> 00:05:59.743
over 93 million miles.

00:06:00.107 --> 00:06:02.240
What's it going through?

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.694
Is it a disturbance
traveling through a medium?

00:06:05.694 --> 00:06:07.461
Well, for a long time, people said,

00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:08.579
well it must be.

00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:10.773
It has these wave-like properties.

00:06:10.773 --> 00:06:14.471
It seems to be traveling with a velocity,

00:06:14.471 --> 00:06:16.055
the speed of light.

00:06:16.055 --> 00:06:18.920
So there must be medium that
it is traveling through.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.972
People theorize what this medium is.

00:06:20.972 --> 00:06:23.491
They called it the luminiferous ether.

00:06:23.491 --> 00:06:25.584
Let me write that down
cause it's a fun word.

00:06:25.584 --> 00:06:27.636
It's a good name for a band.

00:06:27.636 --> 00:06:32.636
Luminiferous. Lumine, no
I'm not spelling it right.

00:06:34.045 --> 00:06:39.045
Luminiferous ether.

00:06:39.595 --> 00:06:44.595
It was this idea that maybe,
even in the vacuum of space,

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.367
you have this substance.

00:06:50.367 --> 00:06:54.850
This luminiferous ether that
the light is traveling through.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.706
That it's somehow a disturbance

00:06:57.706 --> 00:07:02.082
in that luminiferous ether.

00:07:02.082 --> 00:07:04.337
Now, what we're gonna do in future videos,

00:07:04.337 --> 00:07:05.454
is we're gonna test that.

00:07:05.454 --> 00:07:06.633
We're gonna see if
that's actually the case

00:07:06.633 --> 00:07:08.563
because what's interesting
about if there is

00:07:08.563 --> 00:07:10.696
a luminiferous ether,

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:12.972
we're not gonna be stationary relative to

00:07:12.972 --> 00:07:14.394
that luminiferous ether.

00:07:14.394 --> 00:07:17.604
In fact, we're orbiting around the sun.

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:21.038
The sun is orbiting around
the center of the galaxy.

00:07:21.038 --> 00:07:23.292
There's no way that we're gonna be

00:07:23.292 --> 00:07:27.011
stationary relative to
that luminiferous ether.

00:07:27.011 --> 00:07:29.083
If we're not stationary relative to that

00:07:29.083 --> 00:07:31.074
luminiferous ether, we should be able to

00:07:31.074 --> 00:07:33.065
detect how light behaves.

00:07:33.065 --> 00:07:36.072
If it's going in the direction of ether

00:07:36.072 --> 00:07:38.449
or if it's going against the direction of

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:41.558
the relative movement of
the ether relative to us.

00:07:41.558 --> 00:07:43.183
So anyway, I'll leave you there.

00:07:43.183 --> 00:07:44.829
This mystery of science.

00:07:44.829 --> 00:07:47.104
Waves, disturbance through a medium.

00:07:47.104 --> 00:07:48.303
We saw that with the water,

00:07:48.303 --> 00:07:49.806
with the air, with the string.

00:07:49.806 --> 00:07:51.554
But what about light?

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:54.093
Is there a luminiferous ether?

00:07:54.093 --> 00:07:56.477
Put a question mark there.
