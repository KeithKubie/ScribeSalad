00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.600
A quiet life sounds like an option that only the defeated would ever be inclined to praise.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.380
Our age is overwhelmingly alive to the benefits of active, dynamic, noisy ways of living.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.740
If someone offered us a bigger salary for a job elsewhere, we'd move.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.960
If someone showed us a route to fame, we'd take it.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.620
If someone invited us to a party, we'd go.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.740
These seem like pure, unambiguous games.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.440
Lauding a quiet life has some of the eccentricity of praising rain.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.300
Partly, that's because the defenders of quiet lives

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.060
have tended to come from the most implausible sections of the community:

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.140
slackers, hippies, the work-shy, the fired,

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.340
people who've seem like they've never had any choice about how to arrange their affairs.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.820
A quiet life just seems like something imposed on them by their own ineptitude.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.520
And yet, when we examine matters closely,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:59.040
busy lives do often turn out to have certain, strikingly high, incidental costs that we often ignore.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.060
For a start, we have very limited control over our time.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.040
Once we reach a certain position in society, we may be able to shut down a factory in India,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.320
and our every word is listened to with trembling respect within our firm.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.520
But what we absolutely cannot do is admit that we're also extremely tired,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.220
and just want to spend the afternoon reading on the sofa.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.780
We can no longer express our more spontaneous, imaginative, vulnerable sides.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.920
Along the way, we grow strangers to those who love us outside of our wealth and status.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.320
Our children see less of us, our spouses grow bitter;

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.380
we may own the wealth of countenance,

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.280
but it might've been ten years at least since we last had the chance to do nothing for a day.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.700
The most famous cultural figure in the history of the West

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.500
was someone very interested in the benefits that can attend quiet lives.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.040
In the gospels, Jesus tells his disciples to take nothing for their journey except a staff--

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.780
no bread, no bag, no money in their belts--

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.600
but to wear sandals and not to put on two tunics.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.000
Christianity opens up vital space in our imaginations by making a distinction between two kinds of poverty:

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.100
what it terms "voluntary poverty" on the one hand,

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.500
and "involuntary poverty" on the other.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.980
We are, in this point in history, so fixated on the idea that poverty must always be involuntary,

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.560
and therefore the result of a lack of talent.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.420
But we can't even imagine that it might be a result of an intelligent and skilled person's free choice

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.960
based on a rational evaluation of costs and benefits.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.280
It might sincerely be possible for someone to decide not to take the better paid job,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.540
not to publish another book, not to seek high office...

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.280
and to do so, not because they have no chance, but because having surveyed the externalities involved,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.380
they chose not to fight for them.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.580
One of the central moments in Christian history came in 1204,

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.240
when a wealthy young man we know today as Francis of Assisi,

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.900
willingly renounced his wealthy goods (of which he had quite a few):

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.500
a couple of houses, a farm, and a ship at least.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.620
He did so not through any external compulsion;

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.960
he just felt that they would interfere with other things he really wanted rather more of:

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.600
a chance to contemplate Jesus' teachings, to honor the creator of the earth, to admire the flowers and the trees,

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.840
and to help the poorest in society.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.200
For its part, Chinese culture has been equally reverent towards what it calls,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.700
the "Yinshi," or recluse:

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.320
someone who chooses to leave behind the busy, political, and commercial world

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.100
and live more simply, usually on the side of a mountain in a hut.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.120
The tradition began in the 4th century A.D.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.420
When a high ranking government official named Tao Yuan Ming surrendered his position at court

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.080
and moved to the countryside to farm the land, make wine, and write.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.000
In his poem, "On drinking wine," he recounts the riches that poverty have brought him.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.060
"Plucking chrysanthemums from the eastern hedge / I gaze into the distance at the southern mountain. /

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.540
The mountain air is refreshing at sunset / As the flocking birds are returning home. /

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:12.240
In such things we find true meaning. / But when a I try to explain, I can't find the words."

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:19.820
There are, for many of us, plenty of options to take up certain career paths that carry high prestige with them.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.060
We could have something deeply impressive to answer those who ask us what we do at parties,

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.540
but this doesn't necessarily mean we must or should follow these possibilities.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.460
When we come to know the true price that some careers exact,

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:41.100
we may slowly realize that we're not, in fact, willing to pay for the ensuing envy, fear, deceit, and anxiety.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.420
Our days are limited on this earth.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.300
We may, for the sake of true riches, willingly and with no loss of dignity,

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.280
opt to become a little poorer, and a little more obscure.
