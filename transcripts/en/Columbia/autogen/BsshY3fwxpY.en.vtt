response to those growing pressures I
think as a this particular event is

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500
think as a this particular event is
 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.370
think as a this particular event is
funny because it tells us a lot of what

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380
funny because it tells us a lot of what
 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.819
funny because it tells us a lot of what
could be done in the future yeah that's

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829
could be done in the future yeah that's
 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:40.900
could be done in the future yeah that's
why we need people like you

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910
why we need people like you
 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.180
why we need people like you
mmm to push us in the right direction
