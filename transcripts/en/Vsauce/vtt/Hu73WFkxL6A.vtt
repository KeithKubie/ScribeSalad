00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.540
An R2-D2 pepper mill and cologne that makes you smell

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.120
like Play-doh.
It's episode 20 of LÃœT.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.719
This wallet

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.469
looks like a lot of hundreds and these
bars of soap from ThinkGeek

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.440
contain caffeine, really. Each shower you
take delivers the same

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.320
as a cuppa coffee, because caffeine can
be absorbed through your skin.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.400
Soup up your phone's camera with
wide-angle telephoto and fish eye lenses

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.410
all in one contraption and then charge
your phone via USB

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.770
by installing sockets with USB ports.
Protect it with a heat-sensitive

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.860
backing that responds to your touch, like that little touch you add to your outfit by wearing

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.570
a tie that says joystick,

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.510
pong, Guitar Hero, Tetris or Duck hunt.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.360
Your kids can stamp animal footprints
with these sandals. And this stamp

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.410
allows you to print over 2,000
different Japanese emoticons.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.610
Also on Japan Trend Shop, a home planetarium

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.199
that project ten thousand of the stars and
galaxies seen in the northern hemisphere

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.199
onto your wall. These holiday cards for web
developers are stamped with the recipe

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.030
for eggnog

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.260
in Python, JavaScript, Relieve and PHP.
Pour some beer out of a skull pitcher

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.490
and make important life decisions with
this magic 8 ball

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.799
pen.
Then relax on your space invader couch or

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.189
sit on the toilet next to your dragon
toilet paper tyrant

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.650
and rest your head on the pillow that
makes you look like you're on the cover

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.130
of a magazine.
Do you like jewelry and engineering?

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.460
Well, grab yourself a gear-ring and how about this LED

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.670
faucet that tells the temperature of water
without getting you wet.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.130
Blue is cold, green is warm and red is hot.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.020
Hot like this heart necklace.
It's anatomically correct.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.369
Cool down some ice cream scooped into
stackable cylinders

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.920
and decorate your body things to Etsy
user project Pinup,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.119
who makes diablo health and mana
potion earrings,

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.659
but that's not all. She also makes
amazingly creepy cameos.

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.229
Remember the brain I used in the deja
vu episode? I bought it

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.799
from Evolution, a store in Manhattan that also
has an online store,

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.310
where you can buy actual dinosaur teeth,
actual pieces of meteorites

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.390
and more.
Today's free thing is more of a DONG -

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.480
Gapminder - a really cool site that allows
you to chart global data,

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.970
like life expectancy versus income
per person by country

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.370
and even play it through time to see how
things have changed.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.140
More videos coming soon,
especially about outer space.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.489
Why? Because I'm here at Space Camp with
Brad and Liam

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.840
from World of the Orange. We're shooting stuff
for YouTube.com/SpaceLab. The

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.790
only cool thing I've seen so far is this

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.300
pin they gave me right there.
Just

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.880
kidding. It's gonna be awesome.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.680
And as always,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.820
thanks for watching.
