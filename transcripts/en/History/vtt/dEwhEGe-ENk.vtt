00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:02.210
- What's that?

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.169
What's that, right there?

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:04.379
SHANNON: That would be--

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:05.880
MIKE: Two bikes.
- --two motorcycles.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.382
Do we want to talk to him?
- Well, I don't know.

00:00:07.382 --> 00:00:08.550
You're the bike guy.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.509
You tell me.

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:10.468
Do we want to talk to him?

00:00:10.468 --> 00:00:11.845
Yeah, let's talk to him.

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:15.265
Let's just get out
of this damn vehicle.

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:16.975
Listen, I just want to
get out of the truck.

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:18.351
Whatever.

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:21.604
MIKE: I'm over sitting
in a truck with you.

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:23.106
I ain't nothing but a tag-along.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:24.774
I might as well be holding
your pocket right now.

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:26.192
We'll just-- there you go.

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:27.193
Does that feel better for you?

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:28.778
That doesn't look right.

00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:29.654
What's going on man?

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:30.822
I'm Shannon.

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:32.073
Nice to meet you.
- Vat.

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:33.074
- Mike.
- Mike.

00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:34.242
Good to meet you, brother.

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:35.410
SHANNON: Nice to meet you.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.747
Are any of these for sale?

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:40.123
Just this one.

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:43.460
It's a '88, S and
S, fishtails on it.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.461
'88 Harley.

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:45.628
MIKE: Wow.

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:47.005
MIKE: (VOICEOVER)
Harley Davidson

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:48.590
holds the trademark
on the term "softail."

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.508
But like roller
blades and Kleenex,

00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:52.677
it becomes a commonplace
term for any bike

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:54.888
that has a hidden
suspension in the rear.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:57.557
Harley Davidson obtained a
patent for the first softails

00:00:57.557 --> 00:00:58.850
in 1982.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.520
And they released
the FXSTC in 1984.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.981
It revolutionized the
motorcycle industry.

00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:07.609
These bikes kept the look
of the rigid hardtails,

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:11.112
with much more comfortable
ride for your backside.

00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:13.156
Can you tell me
anything about it?

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:15.742
I've had it since '89.

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.452
It's a carbureted bike--

00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:18.953
put a custom paint job on it.

00:01:18.953 --> 00:01:20.288
What you looking at?

00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:22.123
That tanks-- did
you stretch them out?

00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:26.044
I actually hand sanded them
and stretched the tanks--

00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:28.213
had a buddy of mine
paint them for me.

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:29.714
Put a little skulls
action in there.

00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:31.216
SHANNON: Those are
like five gallon tanks.

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:32.008
They're big tanks.
MIKE: That's what I'm saying.

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:33.259
They're so wide.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.010
5.3.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.053
MIKE: Damn.

00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:35.970
So these are original miles?

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.263
3131?
VET: Yes sir.

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:39.182
Yes sir.
SHANNON: Wow.

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:41.392
So is the engine
stock-- bone stock?

00:01:41.392 --> 00:01:43.478
Engine's pretty much stock.

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:44.646
The only thing I
did to the engine--

00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:45.814
I had it reject it.

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:47.607
I put a S and S
carburetor on it.

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:49.984
I put some drag pipes on it.

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:53.571
And pretty much that's it.
- So this thing--

00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:54.781
I mean, it runs and everything?

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:55.740
Everything's good to go?

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.616
Yeah.

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:57.867
It runs like a rocket.

00:01:57.867 --> 00:01:59.994
Runs like a rocket.

00:01:59.994 --> 00:02:02.789
Start it up, man.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.624
[engine starting]

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.212
That's what I'm
talking, babies.

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:10.713
Drag pipe.

00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:12.966
They hear you coming, but
you ain't going to hit.

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.509
Hey, it does sound good.

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:15.552
It sounds good.

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:17.971
You don't like it that loud.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.097
I'm going to be
the brokenhearted

00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:20.765
if you guys actually buy it.

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:23.935
So what do you think, fellas?

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:25.562
- Would you take 45?
- No.

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:27.105
SHANNON: Cash?
- Definitely not.

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:28.022
Definitely not.

00:02:28.022 --> 00:02:29.065
No way.

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:29.774
MIKE: Stop insulting the man.

00:02:29.774 --> 00:02:31.317
55?

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:34.237
It's more than that in parts.

00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:36.614
52, and you got
yourself a deal.

00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:42.495
Um, done.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:43.246
Done.

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:44.455
Cool.

00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:45.999
Well, don't cry now.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.417
Don't cry.

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:48.418
I'm totally going to
cry man, are kidding me?

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:49.878
SHANNON: Don't cry.

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:52.422
I've had so many
stories on this thing.

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:53.423
All right, man.

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:54.632
I appreciate it.
Thank you.

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:56.384
Thank you bro.

00:02:56.384 --> 00:02:58.511
And I will be back with your
cash to get you all situated.

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:00.930
All right, appreciate it.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.473
Oh, man.

00:03:02.473 --> 00:03:04.517
I don't want to see
a grown man cry.

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:07.186
Vet and that bike have obviously
been through some things

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:08.146
together.

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:09.731
He's off to Washington.

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:12.400
We will take good care of
his bike here in Vegas.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.321
It's a win-win for everybody,
but he gonna cry in the house.

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:18.907
So we'll just go get his
money, come back, pick it up.

00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:20.241
Is that cool?

00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:21.409
I really don't care.

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:22.285
What do you mean
you don't care?

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:23.661
You should care.

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:24.829
You're not happy we
bought something cool?

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.122
I'm happy that
you bought a bike,

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:27.540
and we're going to
go back to the shop.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.167
I'm just happy I'm going
to get-- be able to get

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:30.168
back out of the truck.
