00:00:13.622 --> 00:00:14.979
There are all sorts of things

00:00:14.994 --> 00:00:15.976
that happen every day

00:00:15.976 --> 00:00:17.127
that might make you ask,

00:00:17.127 --> 00:00:18.404
"Why?

00:00:18.404 --> 00:00:20.291
Why do we drive on a parkway

00:00:20.292 --> 00:00:22.017
and park on a driveway?

00:00:22.017 --> 00:00:25.758
Why does my hair get frizzy when it's humid?

00:00:25.773 --> 00:00:30.371
And why do my fingers get all pruney when they're wet?"

00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:33.434
Often we simply can't know the answers to these questions.

00:00:33.434 --> 00:00:36.185
But progress can often be made,

00:00:36.185 --> 00:00:37.602
and, when it comes to your pruney fingers,

00:00:37.602 --> 00:00:40.489
scientists have a few interesting ideas.

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.126
The story here begins with an observation

00:00:42.126 --> 00:00:44.604
made in the 1930s in the emergency room.

00:00:44.604 --> 00:00:46.426
Doctors noticed that patients

00:00:46.426 --> 00:00:48.264
with nerve damage to their hands

00:00:48.264 --> 00:00:50.009
did not get pruney fingertips

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:51.988
like most of us do in a bath,

00:00:51.988 --> 00:00:53.192
which might make you wonder,

00:00:53.192 --> 00:00:55.444
"Why would primates want wrinkly fingers,

00:00:55.444 --> 00:00:57.917
presumably when it's rainy or dewy?"

00:00:57.917 --> 00:00:59.716
What could this trait be for?

00:00:59.716 --> 00:01:03.333
What if these wrinkles functioned like rain treads?

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.997
Think about car tires.

00:01:04.997 --> 00:01:06.624
When the ground is dry,

00:01:06.624 --> 00:01:08.848
it's generally best to have smooth tires,

00:01:08.848 --> 00:01:10.870
and race cars do.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.805
Smooth tires means more rubber

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:15.397
or surface area in contact with the road,

00:01:15.397 --> 00:01:17.314
which gives them better grip.

00:01:17.346 --> 00:01:19.441
But in rainy and muddy conditions,

00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:20.728
it's a different story,

00:01:20.728 --> 00:01:23.352
and here's where treads come into play.

00:01:23.352 --> 00:01:25.741
Treads reduce the amount of rubber on the road,

00:01:25.741 --> 00:01:29.104
but they help channel out water when it rains,

00:01:29.104 --> 00:01:31.231
lowering the risk of hydroplaning.

00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:33.523
Well, if your fingers really are like rain treads,

00:01:33.523 --> 00:01:34.617
you should be able to predict

00:01:34.617 --> 00:01:36.663
the optimal shape for them, right?

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:40.256
So, what would the predicted wrinkle shapes be?

00:01:40.256 --> 00:01:43.116
That is, are our prunes actually the right shape

00:01:43.116 --> 00:01:44.491
to be rain treads?

00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:46.411
Let's take a detour into rivers.

00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:47.507
When we think of river networks,

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:50.220
we usually imagine lots of smaller river channels

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.449
joining to make larger river channels downstream,

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:56.508
which is what happens in concave basins.

00:01:56.508 --> 00:01:58.589
In these cases, the divides,

00:01:58.589 --> 00:02:00.612
the regions between the river segments,

00:02:00.612 --> 00:02:02.305
are disconnected from one another

00:02:02.305 --> 00:02:04.761
and diverge away from one another uphill.

00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:06.905
But river networks look fundamentally different

00:02:06.905 --> 00:02:09.886
on convex promontories or protrusions.

00:02:09.886 --> 00:02:12.980
Here, the river channels are disconnected from one another

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.703
and diverge away from one another downstream,

00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:17.812
not very river-like.

00:02:17.812 --> 00:02:20.042
In these cases, it's the divides

00:02:20.042 --> 00:02:21.708
that link together to form a tree,

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:24.486
with its trunk uphill at the top of the promontory.

00:02:24.486 --> 00:02:29.213
Here, it's the divides that look more traditionally river-like.

00:02:29.213 --> 00:02:31.339
If our pruney fingers are drainage networks,

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:33.494
designed to channel out water when they grip,

00:02:33.494 --> 00:02:36.537
then we expect to find similar shapes on our fingers

00:02:36.537 --> 00:02:38.846
as we find out there among rivers.

00:02:38.846 --> 00:02:41.418
There should be a tree network of divides,

00:02:41.418 --> 00:02:45.005
or ridges, with their trunk near the top of the fingertip

00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:46.373
and with their more leaky parts

00:02:46.373 --> 00:02:49.519
reaching out downhill, away from the tip.

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:50.753
The channels themselves,

00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:52.852
through which the water is channeled during a grip,

00:02:52.852 --> 00:02:54.484
should not connect to one another,

00:02:54.484 --> 00:02:57.916
and instead should diverge away from one another downhill.

00:02:57.916 --> 00:02:59.856
If pruney fingers are rain treads,

00:02:59.856 --> 00:03:01.917
then they should look like the river networks

00:03:01.917 --> 00:03:03.737
on convex promontories.

00:03:03.737 --> 00:03:06.453
In fact, that's exactly the morphology

00:03:06.453 --> 00:03:08.321
we find among pruney fingers!

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.173
When we grip, then,

00:03:10.173 --> 00:03:14.092
our pruney wrinkles really do channel out the water.

00:03:14.092 --> 00:03:16.704
But does it actually help us grip?

00:03:16.704 --> 00:03:19.559
New behavioral experiments have shown that they do.

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:22.422
In a task where subjects had to grasp wet marbles

00:03:22.422 --> 00:03:24.745
and move them through a hole and out the other side,

00:03:24.745 --> 00:03:27.091
those with pruney fingers finished the task

00:03:27.091 --> 00:03:29.982
significantly faster than those with smooth fingers.

00:03:29.982 --> 00:03:34.183
Pruney fingers not only ought to enhance grip in wet conditions

00:03:34.183 --> 00:03:35.963
but do.

00:03:35.963 --> 00:03:38.900
So, pruney fingers may be a crucial part

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.829
of the primate repertoire.

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.066
Maybe, once primates lost their claws

00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:44.479
in favor of fingernails,

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:46.175
rain treads were needed to deal

00:03:46.175 --> 00:03:47.856
with the especially challenging,

00:03:47.856 --> 00:03:51.746
often wet, grip-heavy forest habitats.

00:03:51.746 --> 00:03:53.937
By looking closely at the mysteries in our world

00:03:53.937 --> 00:03:56.134
and trying to find things that look similar,

00:03:56.134 --> 00:03:58.493
like our wet fingers and rain treads,

00:03:58.493 --> 00:04:01.313
we can come up with ideas about what's happening.

00:04:01.313 --> 00:04:02.546
And that's a good way to think about

00:04:02.546 --> 00:04:05.558
all sorts of questions in life, too.
