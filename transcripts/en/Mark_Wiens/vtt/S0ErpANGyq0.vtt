00:00:00.197 --> 00:00:02.298
- On my next bite, I wanna
get everything in one bite,

00:00:02.298 --> 00:00:04.546
including all those toppings.

00:00:04.546 --> 00:00:07.046
Look at that beautiful burger.

00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:14.714
Hey, everyone.

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:16.808
It's Mark Wiens with migrationology.com

00:00:16.808 --> 00:00:18.259
in New York City.

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:20.067
It is a Sunday this morning

00:00:20.067 --> 00:00:22.077
and we are on our way to have coffee,

00:00:22.077 --> 00:00:23.294
then we're gonna have some lunch,

00:00:23.294 --> 00:00:24.127
and after that,

00:00:24.127 --> 00:00:25.457
we're gonna meet up with a friend of mine

00:00:25.457 --> 00:00:27.370
that I've known for many, many years

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.023
and go to church.

00:00:29.023 --> 00:00:29.912
And then after that,

00:00:29.912 --> 00:00:31.403
hopefully have some more food.

00:00:31.403 --> 00:00:33.087
But the first thing this morning,

00:00:33.087 --> 00:00:35.254
on our way to have coffee.

00:00:50.403 --> 00:00:52.735
The coffee shop is called Stumptown Coffee

00:00:52.735 --> 00:00:55.749
and it's out of Portland, Oregon

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:57.328
and it is pretty cool.

00:00:57.328 --> 00:00:59.131
Classy coffee shop.

00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:01.009
They have a lot of cold brews

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:03.625
and I was a little bit
torn between my decision

00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:05.725
because I really want
a coffee this morning,

00:01:05.725 --> 00:01:07.232
because I like to drink hot coffee,

00:01:07.232 --> 00:01:10.088
but I really wanted to try
the cold brew on draft.

00:01:10.088 --> 00:01:12.274
So I decided to make a compromise.

00:01:12.274 --> 00:01:13.192
I got the hot coffee,

00:01:13.192 --> 00:01:15.251
but then I bought one bottle

00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:18.805
of the cold brew, which I will
have later, this afternoon.

00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:22.055
But I'm gonna drink the hot coffee now.

00:01:25.763 --> 00:01:26.870
Oh, yeah.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.328
That's a good coffee.

00:01:28.328 --> 00:01:30.745
I got an Americano right now.

00:01:31.931 --> 00:01:35.629
Oh, it has a fruity taste for sure.

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:37.355
We are very near to the Flatiron Building,

00:01:37.355 --> 00:01:38.595
so we're gonna take a walk over there

00:01:38.595 --> 00:01:41.595
and check out the Flatiron Building.

00:01:50.156 --> 00:01:52.739
This is one of the landmark
buildings in New York City

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:55.864
known for its triangular shape

00:01:55.864 --> 00:01:57.532
and it really is a beautiful building.

00:01:57.532 --> 00:01:58.605
What I really like about it

00:01:58.605 --> 00:02:01.487
is that there are so many
buildings in Manhattan

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:02.699
and you get--

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:05.222
Like everything starts
to kind of look similar,

00:02:05.222 --> 00:02:07.564
but the Flatiron Building
really stands out.

00:02:07.564 --> 00:02:08.397
And not only that,

00:02:08.397 --> 00:02:11.684
but it's in kind of a plaza
area of New York City,

00:02:11.684 --> 00:02:13.303
so there's space around it.

00:02:13.303 --> 00:02:16.598
It's just like a beacon of shining light

00:02:16.598 --> 00:02:18.294
in the middle of New York City.

00:02:18.294 --> 00:02:19.623
And now we're gonna
walk across this street

00:02:19.623 --> 00:02:21.698
to the park over here.

00:02:21.698 --> 00:02:23.748
New York is such a fast paced city,

00:02:23.748 --> 00:02:25.932
so it feels so good just
to walk around a park

00:02:25.932 --> 00:02:30.099
drinking a coffee on a slow,
peaceful, quiet Sunday morning.

00:02:35.603 --> 00:02:38.186
And this is really good coffee.

00:02:40.972 --> 00:02:42.515
Ying and I have just been enjoying

00:02:42.515 --> 00:02:43.719
this morning in New York City,

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:45.899
walking around the park
and drinking coffee.

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:48.488
Right now we're at Madison Square Park.

00:02:48.488 --> 00:02:50.061
And I had originally though that

00:02:50.061 --> 00:02:51.742
we were gonna go down
the street a little bit

00:02:51.742 --> 00:02:53.764
to a restaurant for lunch.

00:02:53.764 --> 00:02:55.251
But walking through the park,

00:02:55.251 --> 00:02:57.313
and I didn't know this before.

00:02:57.313 --> 00:02:59.670
There is a restaurant,

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.442
which I did not want
to leave New York City

00:03:02.442 --> 00:03:03.909
without trying.

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:05.979
And it happens to be
right within the park.

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:07.193
It's 10 AM right now.

00:03:07.193 --> 00:03:10.852
They open at 11 AM, so we're
gonna wait here for an hour.

00:03:10.852 --> 00:03:12.201
And coming up.

00:03:12.201 --> 00:03:15.175
Ying, are you excited to try
Shake Shack for the first time?

00:03:15.175 --> 00:03:16.008
- I think so.

00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:18.258
(laughter)

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.429
- You've been waiting for it.

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:24.096
(speaking foreign language)

00:03:25.144 --> 00:03:26.652
While I'm waiting for them to open,

00:03:26.652 --> 00:03:27.631
I've just been reading a little bit

00:03:27.631 --> 00:03:29.494
about Shake Shack and their history

00:03:29.494 --> 00:03:30.953
and beginnings.

00:03:30.953 --> 00:03:33.432
The actual original location is right here

00:03:33.432 --> 00:03:34.642
in Madison Square Park

00:03:34.642 --> 00:03:38.298
and it started off as just a food stall.

00:03:38.298 --> 00:03:40.267
And in 2004, the first kiosk,

00:03:40.267 --> 00:03:41.874
permanent kiosk, opened.

00:03:41.874 --> 00:03:44.551
And now they have a couple of--

00:03:44.551 --> 00:03:45.750
They have some branches worldwide

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.061
and then they also have
quite a few other branches

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:49.204
within New York City,

00:03:49.204 --> 00:03:51.480
but this is the original location,

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.118
the original branch of Shake Shack.

00:03:55.118 --> 00:03:57.261
And one of the things that they emphasize

00:03:57.261 --> 00:04:00.594
is that they use 100% natural Angus

00:04:01.748 --> 00:04:06.218
vegetarian-fed, no hormones,
no antibiotic beef.

00:04:06.218 --> 00:04:09.143
And that is supposed
to be one of their key

00:04:09.143 --> 00:04:13.295
to signature quality and
delicious tasting burgers.

00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:15.122
It's about 10:50 AM now,

00:04:15.122 --> 00:04:16.863
10 minutes until they open.

00:04:16.863 --> 00:04:19.369
I decided to stand in line now.

00:04:19.369 --> 00:04:22.389
Can I please get one ShackBurger Double

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.690
with pickles and onions.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.107
One Chick'n Shack

00:04:27.025 --> 00:04:29.960
and then one just regular fries.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.344
I just put in my order and
then they give you a buzzer.

00:04:32.344 --> 00:04:33.516
And I'm gonna go sit down.

00:04:33.516 --> 00:04:36.936
Ying has hopefully, secured
us a table here in the park

00:04:36.936 --> 00:04:39.853
and the order should be ready soon.

00:04:42.238 --> 00:04:45.360
I can smell the fumes of
the burgers in the breeze

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.777
of the trees of the air in this park.

00:04:47.777 --> 00:04:49.427
Or maybe that's also french fries.

00:04:49.427 --> 00:04:51.427
But it smells fantastic.

00:04:54.388 --> 00:04:55.221
- Mark?

00:04:55.221 --> 00:04:56.304
- [Mark] Yes.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.897
- Enjoy.
- Alright, thank you.

00:04:58.897 --> 00:04:59.980
- No problem.

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:07.622
- At first, we were sitting in the shade

00:05:07.622 --> 00:05:09.099
where it was really nice and comfortable,

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:10.934
but the light was really hard to work with

00:05:10.934 --> 00:05:11.767
with the camera,

00:05:11.767 --> 00:05:14.546
especially the trees and the leaves moving

00:05:14.546 --> 00:05:15.807
and changing the light.

00:05:15.807 --> 00:05:17.630
So we decided to come over here

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.873
into the bright, hot sunshine,

00:05:19.873 --> 00:05:22.380
where the light is gonna
be a bit more even.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.320
And although, it's gonna
be a little bright,

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.133
sorry, the picture might
be a little bright.

00:05:27.133 --> 00:05:28.881
I ordered the Double Shack,

00:05:28.881 --> 00:05:31.815
which is two burger patties.

00:05:31.815 --> 00:05:34.606
Look how that cheese is just
overflowing onto the box.

00:05:34.606 --> 00:05:36.771
Ying got the Chick'n
Shack, the chicken burger,

00:05:36.771 --> 00:05:37.733
which also looks fantastic.

00:05:37.733 --> 00:05:40.315
And then we got an
order of fries to share.

00:05:40.315 --> 00:05:41.318
Gotta start with this burger.

00:05:41.318 --> 00:05:43.551
It's just oozing and beautiful.

00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:45.118
Before I take my first bite,

00:05:45.118 --> 00:05:46.808
there are a couple of
things I want to explain

00:05:46.808 --> 00:05:48.086
to you about this burger.

00:05:48.086 --> 00:05:49.771
Number one is about the bun.

00:05:49.771 --> 00:05:51.622
And it is a potato roll,

00:05:51.622 --> 00:05:53.705
which is first toasted in butter.

00:05:53.705 --> 00:05:56.281
So it should have a buttery taste to it.

00:05:56.281 --> 00:05:57.485
And then according to,

00:05:57.485 --> 00:05:59.932
I was reading an article
by seriouseats.com,

00:05:59.932 --> 00:06:01.766
and they mentioned that the bun

00:06:01.766 --> 00:06:03.400
is actually engineered

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.666
or designed to prevent burger slidage

00:06:07.666 --> 00:06:08.648
from the back.

00:06:08.648 --> 00:06:09.585
So we all know that

00:06:09.585 --> 00:06:11.960
when we take a bite of that burger

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.234
and the burger starts to slip out,

00:06:14.234 --> 00:06:15.967
as well as the different toppings.

00:06:15.967 --> 00:06:18.046
This bun is actually made to like

00:06:18.046 --> 00:06:19.893
conceal in all of the toppings

00:06:19.893 --> 00:06:21.260
and all of the goodness.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.239
And you can actually
feel that in your hands.

00:06:23.239 --> 00:06:26.673
The bun feels very soft and supple.

00:06:26.673 --> 00:06:28.028
And then you can kinda feel it

00:06:28.028 --> 00:06:29.948
just all like held together.

00:06:29.948 --> 00:06:32.339
And then next, I wanna point
out the burger patties,

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:34.056
which are four ounce patties

00:06:34.056 --> 00:06:36.261
made with a combination, a mixture,

00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:38.820
of brisket and short rib.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.801
And they are always 100%
fresh, never frozen.

00:06:43.801 --> 00:06:44.634
Oh, yeah.

00:06:44.634 --> 00:06:46.568
And also, I ordered it with tomatoes.

00:06:46.568 --> 00:06:47.401
Oh, no.

00:06:47.401 --> 00:06:48.333
Tomatoes come, but I ordered it

00:06:48.333 --> 00:06:50.833
with extra pickles and onions.

00:07:01.008 --> 00:07:01.841
Wow!

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:07.736
That is a beautiful burger.

00:07:09.392 --> 00:07:11.231
What I love so much

00:07:11.231 --> 00:07:13.202
is that you can taste like

00:07:13.202 --> 00:07:15.878
the little pieces of meat.

00:07:15.878 --> 00:07:19.418
The grind of the beef
is not very, very fine.

00:07:19.418 --> 00:07:21.314
You taste the texture of that beef.

00:07:21.314 --> 00:07:22.838
Although, it just sort
of melts in your mouth

00:07:22.838 --> 00:07:24.928
with all of that cheese.

00:07:24.928 --> 00:07:26.157
I didn't even get any toppings on that.

00:07:26.157 --> 00:07:28.800
All I got was meat, cheese, and bun.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.546
And then the bun.

00:07:30.546 --> 00:07:31.379
The bun is really good,

00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:32.821
the bun is extremely soft.

00:07:32.821 --> 00:07:34.261
Despite the bun holding in the toppings,

00:07:34.261 --> 00:07:36.747
the toppings were sort
of over to the back side,

00:07:36.747 --> 00:07:38.327
so I'm gonna scoot them forward.

00:07:38.327 --> 00:07:39.240
Pat that whole onion.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.509
On my next bite, I wanna
get everything in one bite,

00:07:41.509 --> 00:07:43.892
including all those toppings.

00:07:43.892 --> 00:07:46.392
Look at that beautiful burger.

00:07:56.313 --> 00:07:57.820
Okay.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.050
That is an amazing burger.

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:01.563
That beef is so good.

00:08:01.563 --> 00:08:03.072
Just look at that glisten.

00:08:03.072 --> 00:08:04.509
And what I also like about this burger

00:08:04.509 --> 00:08:06.101
is that that dressing,

00:08:06.101 --> 00:08:07.808
which is some type of--

00:08:07.808 --> 00:08:09.213
The dressing that they put on there,

00:08:09.213 --> 00:08:10.535
it's not really overpowering.

00:08:10.535 --> 00:08:13.138
Has a little bit of a
creamy mayonnaisey taste,

00:08:13.138 --> 00:08:15.132
but it's not an overpowering dressing.

00:08:15.132 --> 00:08:18.372
So the onion is very mild, but very crisp.

00:08:18.372 --> 00:08:20.897
The pickle is light.

00:08:20.897 --> 00:08:22.950
That freshness of the tomato.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.825
But I think it really
is all about that beef.

00:08:24.825 --> 00:08:26.742
That beef is fantastic.

00:08:38.048 --> 00:08:40.001
Take a timeout to eat some fries.

00:08:40.001 --> 00:08:42.090
And these are crinkle cut fries

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.474
and they said on the menu
that they Yukon potatoes.

00:08:45.474 --> 00:08:46.891
A dip in ketchup.

00:08:51.762 --> 00:08:54.313
They're nice and crispy on the outside

00:08:54.313 --> 00:08:56.013
and then starchy in the middle.

00:08:56.013 --> 00:08:59.148
Those are just good classic fries.

00:08:59.148 --> 00:08:59.981
Hot sauce.

00:09:04.184 --> 00:09:05.017
Oh, yeah.

00:09:05.017 --> 00:09:06.711
The fries are actually really good.

00:09:06.711 --> 00:09:08.030
They're really nice and crispy.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:10.074
It's a really solidly delicious burger,

00:09:10.074 --> 00:09:11.809
but if there's one thing I could change,

00:09:11.809 --> 00:09:13.667
I'm not huge on the cheese.

00:09:13.667 --> 00:09:16.222
The cheese, it's cheddar cheese,

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.965
but it sort of has that
processed kind of flavor to it.

00:09:18.965 --> 00:09:21.867
I think using a better quality cheese,

00:09:21.867 --> 00:09:24.108
I think that would be maybe the only thing

00:09:24.108 --> 00:09:26.652
that could improve this burger.

00:09:26.652 --> 00:09:27.858
The beef really stands out.

00:09:27.858 --> 00:09:29.525
The beef is awesome.

00:09:34.256 --> 00:09:37.309
And I love that texture of the patties.

00:09:37.309 --> 00:09:38.809
That coarse grind.

00:09:41.675 --> 00:09:45.239
Ying has graciously allowed
me to test her chicken burger.

00:09:45.239 --> 00:09:47.685
Got a nice fried piece
of chicken in the middle

00:09:47.685 --> 00:09:49.185
and that same bun.

00:09:56.942 --> 00:09:58.844
You can really taste the
buttery roll in this one.

00:09:58.844 --> 00:10:00.768
Maybe because there are less toppings.

00:10:00.768 --> 00:10:03.155
There's mayonnaise in here, I think.

00:10:03.155 --> 00:10:04.814
There's lettuce

00:10:04.814 --> 00:10:08.401
and just maybe a chicken
breast piece of meat.

00:10:08.401 --> 00:10:09.851
Crispy on the edges.

00:10:09.851 --> 00:10:11.601
I would say that I'm maybe

00:10:11.601 --> 00:10:14.284
over three quarters of the
way finished with this burger,

00:10:14.284 --> 00:10:16.014
but I wanna give you a quick update.

00:10:16.014 --> 00:10:16.847
It really is true.

00:10:16.847 --> 00:10:17.863
I don't think I actually made it up

00:10:17.863 --> 00:10:19.778
that the bun is actually securing

00:10:19.778 --> 00:10:22.982
all the meat and the toppings.

00:10:22.982 --> 00:10:24.183
It really is.

00:10:24.183 --> 00:10:25.723
There's nothing dripping
on the bottom there,

00:10:25.723 --> 00:10:27.163
apart from a little bit of cheese

00:10:27.163 --> 00:10:31.276
that was left in the
wrapper from oozing out.

00:10:31.276 --> 00:10:32.481
It's very clean.

00:10:32.481 --> 00:10:33.772
I got some hot sauce on the side too

00:10:33.772 --> 00:10:37.625
and I wanted to eat most
of my burger just as is,

00:10:37.625 --> 00:10:40.209
but hot sauce, I cannot
live without hot sauce.

00:10:40.209 --> 00:10:42.542
And also, I do like mustard.

00:10:50.419 --> 00:10:51.419
And the bun.

00:10:52.363 --> 00:10:53.637
The bun is so soft.

00:10:53.637 --> 00:10:55.070
This is the very bottom of the burger.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.899
And it is kind of remarkable
how clean my hands are.

00:10:58.899 --> 00:11:02.247
I do have a little bit
of grease and dressing

00:11:02.247 --> 00:11:03.694
on my fingers,

00:11:03.694 --> 00:11:04.535
but that's really about it.

00:11:04.535 --> 00:11:06.618
It's a very clean burger.

00:11:11.326 --> 00:11:14.189
The burger has disappeared,
the fries are gone,

00:11:14.189 --> 00:11:17.250
and despite any kind of
burger battles in the US,

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.294
what I can say is that Shake Shack

00:11:19.294 --> 00:11:22.916
has put together a fantastic
burger that was delicious.

00:11:22.916 --> 00:11:25.038
The meat patties are what
really stood out to me,

00:11:25.038 --> 00:11:26.843
but also, the bun was really good.

00:11:26.843 --> 00:11:29.524
Next up for today, we are
walking towards midtown

00:11:29.524 --> 00:11:31.195
and towards Madison Square Garden

00:11:31.195 --> 00:11:33.445
and we are going to Hillsong Church.

00:11:33.445 --> 00:11:35.153
And Hillsong is a huge church

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:37.075
and they have multiple different campuses

00:11:37.075 --> 00:11:38.212
in New York City.

00:11:38.212 --> 00:11:41.225
But today, they have a special service,

00:11:41.225 --> 00:11:44.222
which is a combined service of
all the campuses, I believe.

00:11:44.222 --> 00:11:46.514
And it is gonna be at some theater,

00:11:46.514 --> 00:11:48.495
which is actually just around
the corner from our hotel,

00:11:48.495 --> 00:11:50.038
very near to Penn Station

00:11:50.038 --> 00:11:51.342
and Madison Square Garden.

00:11:51.342 --> 00:11:54.259
So that's where we're heading next.

00:12:06.642 --> 00:12:07.475
So we got in line.

00:12:07.475 --> 00:12:10.012
I think they're doing some
security checks at the front,

00:12:10.012 --> 00:12:14.179
but we do have a nice view
of the Empire State Building.

00:12:20.036 --> 00:12:21.119
We made it into the service

00:12:21.119 --> 00:12:22.397
and they have already started,

00:12:22.397 --> 00:12:24.593
so we came to the upper balcony section.

00:12:24.593 --> 00:12:27.843
I will talk to you all when we're done.

00:12:32.101 --> 00:12:32.934
That was amazing.

00:12:32.934 --> 00:12:35.601
That was like a concert in here.

00:12:42.823 --> 00:12:43.992
If you come to New York City,

00:12:43.992 --> 00:12:47.492
coming to Hillsong is a great opportunity.

00:12:56.882 --> 00:12:59.109
I'm gonna do a quick vlog.

00:12:59.109 --> 00:13:01.764
We met up with Sarah
and we jumped in an Uber

00:13:01.764 --> 00:13:05.931
and we are now on our way
to go eat Ethiopian food.

00:13:19.763 --> 00:13:22.499
- [Sarah] And then there's
a vegetarian combo too.

00:13:22.499 --> 00:13:23.332
- [Mark] Okay.

00:13:23.332 --> 00:13:24.165
- [Sarah] It's all good.

00:13:24.165 --> 00:13:25.015
Special tibs.

00:13:25.015 --> 00:13:26.160
- I'm okay with everything.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.758
The restaurant is called Meske,

00:13:27.758 --> 00:13:29.537
it's an Ethiopian restaurant.

00:13:29.537 --> 00:13:31.037
And Sarah and I,

00:13:31.037 --> 00:13:33.266
we grew up together in Kenya

00:13:33.266 --> 00:13:36.748
and we ate Ethiopian
food together growing up.

00:13:36.748 --> 00:13:38.619
And so, the right thing to do

00:13:38.619 --> 00:13:40.483
was to have Ethiopian food.

00:13:40.483 --> 00:13:41.663
That aroma.

00:13:41.663 --> 00:13:42.496
- I know.

00:13:42.496 --> 00:13:45.559
(laughter)

00:13:45.559 --> 00:13:46.746
- That aroma.

00:13:46.746 --> 00:13:48.027
And we ordered the--

00:13:48.027 --> 00:13:49.843
- Well, how could we forget the doro wat?

00:13:49.843 --> 00:13:52.704
- We gotta get the doro wat,
we gotta get the doro wat.

00:13:52.704 --> 00:13:53.575
- [Sarah] Seep into the injera.

00:13:53.575 --> 00:13:55.995
- [Mark] Yeah, because
that's the saucy dish

00:13:55.995 --> 00:13:58.272
that really like mopped everything up.

00:13:58.272 --> 00:14:01.833
- [Sarah] The berebere and onions sauteed.

00:14:01.833 --> 00:14:04.390
- It has been a while since
I've had Ethiopian food

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:09.299
and just the aroma is already
making my mouth water.

00:14:09.299 --> 00:14:11.130
As soon as she dumped on

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:12.586
this is the special tibs,

00:14:12.586 --> 00:14:13.621
which is--

00:14:13.621 --> 00:14:14.592
It's lamb, right?

00:14:14.592 --> 00:14:15.425
- [Sarah] Yeah.

00:14:15.425 --> 00:14:18.407
- It's lamb sauteed with all of the spices

00:14:18.407 --> 00:14:20.786
with the onions, with peppers.

00:14:20.786 --> 00:14:22.794
Smells amazing.

00:14:22.794 --> 00:14:24.045
Thank you.

00:14:24.045 --> 00:14:26.096
Okay, so we got injera here.

00:14:26.096 --> 00:14:28.453
This is the Ethiopian staple,

00:14:28.453 --> 00:14:31.299
which is kind of a spongy,

00:14:31.299 --> 00:14:35.738
pancake type of like sheet.

00:14:35.738 --> 00:14:37.012
And it's usually,

00:14:37.012 --> 00:14:38.073
it's made from teff flour,

00:14:38.073 --> 00:14:40.958
which is a type of grain that
grows mostly in Ethiopia.

00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:44.271
And what you do is you grab a piece

00:14:44.271 --> 00:14:45.188
and dig in.

00:14:46.638 --> 00:14:47.783
I gotta go straight in
for the special tibs.

00:14:47.783 --> 00:14:48.616
- [Sarah] Yes.

00:14:48.616 --> 00:14:51.800
- [Mark] Which is that main dish.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.475
We need to have a toast.

00:14:54.475 --> 00:14:55.689
- [Sarah] A tibs toast.

00:14:55.689 --> 00:14:56.939
- A tibs toast.

00:14:58.357 --> 00:15:01.574
Wait, Ying, you gotta get that toast.

00:15:01.574 --> 00:15:02.741
- [Ying] Okay.

00:15:03.969 --> 00:15:04.802
- Okay.

00:15:07.715 --> 00:15:09.132
- That's so good.

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:16.063
- That's amazing.
- So good.

00:15:16.063 --> 00:15:19.687
- And then with that music
playing in the background.

00:15:19.687 --> 00:15:21.779
The lamb is tender.

00:15:21.779 --> 00:15:23.955
You can really taste
that mixture of spices

00:15:23.955 --> 00:15:26.514
with the peppers in there, the onions.

00:15:26.514 --> 00:15:28.650
- You found the right one, Mark.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:29.483
- Well, that's good.

00:15:29.483 --> 00:15:31.774
Make sure you guys taste her Thai cooking.

00:15:31.774 --> 00:15:33.012
Oh, man.

00:15:33.012 --> 00:15:33.845
- I can't wait to visit.

00:15:33.845 --> 00:15:36.404
- Oh, you gotta come.

00:15:36.404 --> 00:15:38.839
Yeah, you should come.

00:15:38.839 --> 00:15:40.824
- When you having the baby?

00:15:40.824 --> 00:15:41.658
I really wanna come.

00:15:41.658 --> 00:15:44.177
- I think it's awesome.

00:15:44.177 --> 00:15:45.760
My life is so good.

00:15:47.588 --> 00:15:49.005
Gettin' the food?

00:15:51.075 --> 00:15:52.711
We almost forgot to order doro wat,

00:15:52.711 --> 00:15:55.609
which is one of the staples
of Ethiopian cuisine.

00:15:55.609 --> 00:15:58.277
It is a stew with chicken and eggs

00:15:58.277 --> 00:15:59.749
and lots and lots of onions,

00:15:59.749 --> 00:16:01.384
which are stewed down for hours and hours

00:16:01.384 --> 00:16:04.691
to became a pureed

00:16:04.691 --> 00:16:08.053
blend of spices and onions.

00:16:08.053 --> 00:16:10.053
Yeah, and so here it is.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:17.865
It's awesome.

00:16:17.865 --> 00:16:19.825
That blend of spices.

00:16:19.825 --> 00:16:21.356
And then the sauce just
melts in your mouth

00:16:21.356 --> 00:16:25.210
because these are just
like dissolving onions.

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:26.611
How's the food?

00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:27.444
- So good.

00:16:29.484 --> 00:16:30.401
Speechless.

00:16:35.721 --> 00:16:36.998
- That was a delicious meal.

00:16:36.998 --> 00:16:39.966
It's been way too long since
I've had Ethiopian food.

00:16:39.966 --> 00:16:42.867
And thank you to Sarah
for bringing us here.

00:16:42.867 --> 00:16:44.885
She said that she's eaten at just about

00:16:44.885 --> 00:16:47.326
all of the Ethiopian
restaurants in New York City

00:16:47.326 --> 00:16:50.195
and this one is the
best and it was amazing.

00:16:50.195 --> 00:16:52.245
Great, great food.

00:16:52.245 --> 00:16:54.333
Great to see Sarah as well.

00:16:54.333 --> 00:16:58.536
And she also runs a blog called OHK World

00:16:58.536 --> 00:17:00.559
about women's sneakers.

00:17:00.559 --> 00:17:02.590
I'll leave her link in
the description box below.

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:04.111
You can check that out.

00:17:04.111 --> 00:17:07.005
And Ying and I are now probably just gonna

00:17:07.005 --> 00:17:09.701
slowly walk back towards our area,

00:17:09.701 --> 00:17:11.201
back to Courtyard.

00:17:18.112 --> 00:17:19.616
Before leaving New York City,

00:17:19.616 --> 00:17:22.193
I really wanted to have a lobster roll.

00:17:22.193 --> 00:17:24.530
And we leave tomorrow in
the middle of the day,

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:27.097
so I'm not sure when I'll
have another opportunity

00:17:27.097 --> 00:17:28.894
to eat a lobster roll.

00:17:28.894 --> 00:17:31.714
So I'm gonna take that
opportunity tonight.

00:17:31.714 --> 00:17:35.881
We are walking over to a
restaurant called Luke's Lobster.

00:17:43.917 --> 00:17:45.142
Came into Luke's Lobster

00:17:45.142 --> 00:17:46.721
and this is not the original location.

00:17:46.721 --> 00:17:48.952
I think the bigger location may be busier

00:17:48.952 --> 00:17:50.451
and more action happening

00:17:50.451 --> 00:17:52.933
is I think, over on the river

00:17:52.933 --> 00:17:55.146
near Manhattan Bridge in Brooklyn.

00:17:55.146 --> 00:17:56.952
But since this location is right

00:17:56.952 --> 00:17:58.332
near to where we're staying,

00:17:58.332 --> 00:18:00.322
it was very convenient to come in here.

00:18:00.322 --> 00:18:02.356
Comes in a brown paper
bag and I got it to go.

00:18:02.356 --> 00:18:04.265
They do have some
seating in there as well.

00:18:04.265 --> 00:18:06.912
Let's take a look at this.

00:18:06.912 --> 00:18:10.662
In a little box to keep
it nice and delicate.

00:18:15.977 --> 00:18:17.631
Oh, there it is.

00:18:17.631 --> 00:18:19.250
Lobster filled into a bun.

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:20.803
Actually, maybe it's not a bun.

00:18:20.803 --> 00:18:22.837
It looks like a piece of bread,

00:18:22.837 --> 00:18:26.117
which is like cut specifically

00:18:26.117 --> 00:18:28.842
and hollowed out specifically
for this crab roll

00:18:28.842 --> 00:18:30.266
and then it's toasted.

00:18:30.266 --> 00:18:32.979
You can see that brown crust on the edge

00:18:32.979 --> 00:18:35.090
with probably butter.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:39.125
And then it is quite
nicely filled with lobster.

00:18:39.125 --> 00:18:40.239
And there's some kind of whitish sauce

00:18:40.239 --> 00:18:43.208
and then sprinkled just
with a little bit of--

00:18:43.208 --> 00:18:44.708
Let me smell that.

00:18:47.693 --> 00:18:51.693
It has like a little bit
of an herb aroma to it.

00:19:00.742 --> 00:19:04.701
I wasn't expecting the lobster to be cold.

00:19:04.701 --> 00:19:07.198
It's cold, but it's really good.

00:19:07.198 --> 00:19:08.855
Filled with meaty chunks,

00:19:08.855 --> 00:19:11.355
thumb-sized chunks of lobster.

00:19:12.524 --> 00:19:14.897
And it's just very, very lightly seasoned.

00:19:14.897 --> 00:19:15.902
Maybe barely even seasoned.

00:19:15.902 --> 00:19:19.735
I can taste that butter
on the piece of bread.

00:19:25.596 --> 00:19:28.021
That lobster is really amazing, though.

00:19:28.021 --> 00:19:29.646
Tastes like such a pure lobster.

00:19:29.646 --> 00:19:32.872
Has a little bit of a like
almost spongy texture to it.

00:19:32.872 --> 00:19:35.931
Tastes very fresh, tastes very pure,

00:19:35.931 --> 00:19:37.337
and very little seasoning,

00:19:37.337 --> 00:19:40.853
other than really focusing
on the lobster itself,

00:19:40.853 --> 00:19:44.020
and then you taste that buttery toast.

00:19:51.763 --> 00:19:52.813
Okay.

00:19:52.813 --> 00:19:55.268
On the bottom there is like
some mayonnaise on there.

00:19:55.268 --> 00:19:57.020
I didn't even reach that until the middle

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.638
and that gives it a creaminess

00:19:58.638 --> 00:19:59.889
to go with the lobster.

00:19:59.889 --> 00:20:03.004
At first, the coldness of the lobster

00:20:03.004 --> 00:20:04.108
just kind of threw me off.

00:20:04.108 --> 00:20:06.511
I think it's just 'cause I
was expecting it to be warm.

00:20:06.511 --> 00:20:07.350
But actually, the coldness

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:08.845
really kinda made it refreshing

00:20:08.845 --> 00:20:11.431
like a shrimp cocktail, except lobster.

00:20:11.431 --> 00:20:13.092
But, yeah, that was very,

00:20:13.092 --> 00:20:14.609
it's very simple,

00:20:14.609 --> 00:20:17.607
but just focusing on the
good quality lobster.

00:20:17.607 --> 00:20:19.266
And they explained in the restaurant

00:20:19.266 --> 00:20:20.636
that they source their--

00:20:20.636 --> 00:20:22.113
Where they source their lobster from

00:20:22.113 --> 00:20:24.227
and every lobster is accountable.

00:20:24.227 --> 00:20:25.522
That was good.

00:20:25.522 --> 00:20:27.002
It's definitely kind of expensive

00:20:27.002 --> 00:20:28.246
and kind of small.

00:20:28.246 --> 00:20:29.651
But it is a treat.

00:20:29.651 --> 00:20:31.792
We are just walking back
to the hotel from here,

00:20:31.792 --> 00:20:34.010
so I'm gonna end the
video for today right now.

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:36.933
Thank you all very much
for watching today's video.

00:20:36.933 --> 00:20:38.854
It's been a fantastic day.

00:20:38.854 --> 00:20:43.176
And this is our final
full day in New York City.

00:20:43.176 --> 00:20:44.102
Please remember to give this video

00:20:44.102 --> 00:20:45.509
a thumbs up if you enjoyed it

00:20:45.509 --> 00:20:47.300
and also make sure you click subscribe

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.362

00:20:49.362 --> 00:20:51.163
And I will see you on the next video.

00:20:51.163 --> 00:20:52.640
Thank you again for watching.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.073
I have taken a shower and
I'm almost ready for bed.

00:20:55.073 --> 00:20:57.330
But I totally forgot this afternoon

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:59.072
about my cold brew.

00:20:59.072 --> 00:21:01.313
It is in the fridge right here.

00:21:01.313 --> 00:21:03.703
As much as I would love
to drink it right now,

00:21:03.703 --> 00:21:06.267
I think it would not be
the responsible thing to do

00:21:06.267 --> 00:21:08.167
right before I go to bed.

00:21:08.167 --> 00:21:10.394
So I'm gonna save it for tomorrow

00:21:10.394 --> 00:21:12.264
and I will drink it first thing.
