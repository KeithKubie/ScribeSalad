00:00:13.507 --> 00:00:16.777
Everybody has that one friend --

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:18.625
you know, the single-minded one,

00:00:18.649 --> 00:00:21.824
the one who, no matter
what the question is,

00:00:21.848 --> 00:00:26.012
always finds a way to make the answer
whatever it is she's single-minded about.

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:27.982
I'm that friend.

00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:29.779
(Laughter)

00:00:29.803 --> 00:00:32.386
And the thing that I'm single-minded about

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.592
is racism.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.436
If someone were to ask me, "So, Janet,
got any plans for the 4th of July?"

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.529
I'm subject to answer, "Yeah,
I'm going to binge-watch 'Roots.'"

00:00:41.553 --> 00:00:42.609
(Laughter)

00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:45.509
Or if they said, "Janet,
I've got a joke for you:

00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.382
Why'd the chicken cross the road?"

00:00:47.406 --> 00:00:49.567
"Uh, was it a black chicken?

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:51.204
Probably gentrification."

00:00:51.228 --> 00:00:53.428
(Laughter)

00:00:54.657 --> 00:00:57.553
(Applause)

00:01:01.065 --> 00:01:05.629
But for me, single-mindedness
is not just caring about something.

00:01:05.653 --> 00:01:09.414
It's caring about something enough
to do something about it.

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:13.081
It's not just thinking, it's doing.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.363
It's not just praying,
it is moving your feet.

00:01:18.292 --> 00:01:22.970
And the reason I'm single-minded
about racism is because I know

00:01:22.994 --> 00:01:26.079
single-mindedness can destroy it.

00:01:26.103 --> 00:01:28.250
I learned that many, many years ago.

00:01:28.274 --> 00:01:31.968
Back in 1984, I was a junior
at Davidson College

00:01:31.992 --> 00:01:33.607
in Davidson, North Carolina.

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:36.513
Now, Davidson is a little-bitty town,

00:01:36.537 --> 00:01:38.933
Southern town, split by railroad tracks,

00:01:38.957 --> 00:01:42.722
with white Davidson on one side,
black Davidson on the other side,

00:01:42.746 --> 00:01:46.047
and, as black students lived
on the white side of the tracks,

00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:49.561
we got used to being stopped
in downtown and asked for ID,

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.353
until the police memorized our faces.

00:01:53.377 --> 00:01:55.452
But fortunately,
that didn't take too long,

00:01:55.476 --> 00:01:59.132
because out of 1,200 students,
only 52 of us were black.

00:01:59.156 --> 00:02:00.963
There was one black professor

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:02.663
and one black assistant dean.

00:02:03.194 --> 00:02:05.072
Things weren't a lot better on campus.

00:02:05.657 --> 00:02:07.954
Well, I wasn't OK with this.

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:10.507
And so, I started writing things.

00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:12.516
And then I started yelling things.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.293
And after about three years of that,

00:02:14.317 --> 00:02:15.600
I got tired.

00:02:15.624 --> 00:02:18.508
So I decided to write one more thing;

00:02:18.532 --> 00:02:21.097
I wrote something called "Project '87."

00:02:21.788 --> 00:02:25.368
Project '87 was really
just a challenge to Davidson:

00:02:25.953 --> 00:02:28.636
in three years, by 1987,

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.771
enroll 100 black students,

00:02:31.387 --> 00:02:33.581
hire 10 black professors,

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:36.859
create five Black Studies classes

00:02:36.883 --> 00:02:38.687
and hire one black dean.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.616
It didn't seem particularly revolutionary,

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.739
but what was different about it was,

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:47.541
we also challenged Davidson
to say that if you don't do this,

00:02:47.565 --> 00:02:50.470
we will question
your commitment to diversity.

00:02:50.946 --> 00:02:52.399
It was a real problem.

00:02:52.423 --> 00:02:54.234
We put some real numbers to it.

00:02:54.258 --> 00:02:56.479
We gave them some real consequences.

00:02:56.503 --> 00:02:58.773
Well, the campus went absolutely nuts.

00:02:59.316 --> 00:03:01.962
But fortunately, in the middle of this,

00:03:01.986 --> 00:03:03.912
Davidson got a new president,

00:03:03.936 --> 00:03:07.059
and that president was
single-minded about racism, too.

00:03:07.632 --> 00:03:09.776
And so, he created a task force

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.948
to address the issues in Project '87.

00:03:12.972 --> 00:03:14.907
And several months after that,

00:03:14.931 --> 00:03:18.427
we produced a 77-page report.

00:03:19.244 --> 00:03:24.149
That report was the foundation
for all the change that came after it.

00:03:24.882 --> 00:03:27.684
Now, I wasn't there to see that change,

00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:30.086
because, actually, in 1985,

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.395
I graduated.

00:03:31.816 --> 00:03:34.604
(Applause)

00:03:36.231 --> 00:03:41.478
You are looking at the three
happiest people on the planet that day,

00:03:41.502 --> 00:03:43.386
because I am leaving.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.949
(Laughter)

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.786
However, the change did happen,

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.389
and today, there are 185 black students,

00:03:51.413 --> 00:03:55.315
there are 16 black
or multiracial professors,

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:56.960
there are four black deans,

00:03:56.984 --> 00:04:01.484
and there's an entire degree-granting
Africana Studies Department.

00:04:01.508 --> 00:04:04.159
(Applause)

00:04:07.513 --> 00:04:09.973
Project '87 changed Davidson.

00:04:09.997 --> 00:04:12.974
But it also changed me,
because what it taught me

00:04:12.998 --> 00:04:15.758
was there's a lot of power
in single-mindedness.

00:04:16.896 --> 00:04:19.302
Well, today, I'm an executive speechwriter

00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:21.660
for one of the biggest
companies in the world.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.153
It's a profession that is 92 percent white
and predominantly male,

00:04:27.177 --> 00:04:29.607
which makes me a little bit of a unicorn.

00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:32.002
But I'm a single-minded unicorn.

00:04:32.026 --> 00:04:33.875
(Laughter)

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:37.695
So the thing about speech writing
is, it's very personal.

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:40.355
So I spend a lot of time
in deep conversation

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:43.549
with the CEO and senior executives,

00:04:43.573 --> 00:04:47.909
and a lot of times those conversations
turn to diversity and inclusion,

00:04:47.933 --> 00:04:50.530
which, of course, I'm always
happy to talk about.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.691
But after quite a few
of these conversations,

00:04:53.715 --> 00:04:55.205
I've come to a conclusion:

00:04:55.824 --> 00:04:59.098
I believe that business
is in a position to do something

00:04:59.122 --> 00:05:01.405
that no other entity can do.

00:05:02.286 --> 00:05:05.325
Business can dismantle racism.

00:05:06.344 --> 00:05:07.798
Now, colleges can't do it.

00:05:07.822 --> 00:05:10.353
There aren't but 5,000 of them
in the United States

00:05:10.377 --> 00:05:12.563
and only 20 million students enrolled.

00:05:12.587 --> 00:05:14.007
Church can't do it, either --

00:05:14.031 --> 00:05:16.798
only 35 percent of us go
on a regular basis,

00:05:16.822 --> 00:05:18.185
and when we do,

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:22.385
eleven o'clock Sunday morning
is "the most segregated hour" in America.

00:05:23.232 --> 00:05:24.632
But business?

00:05:24.656 --> 00:05:31.008
There are a 162 million people
in the US workforce alone --

00:05:31.032 --> 00:05:32.571
people of all races,

00:05:32.595 --> 00:05:37.087
united in the spirit of wanting a paycheck
and having to show up to get it.

00:05:37.111 --> 00:05:38.662
(Laughter)

00:05:39.458 --> 00:05:43.467
Now, I'm aware that diversity
is bigger than race,

00:05:43.491 --> 00:05:45.614
and racism is bigger than America.

00:05:45.638 --> 00:05:49.424
But racial discrimination
is the most prominent form,

00:05:49.448 --> 00:05:51.941
and Lord knows America is
the absolute best at it.

00:05:52.524 --> 00:05:55.956
So what if, though, what if

00:05:56.703 --> 00:06:01.143
we worked in diverse
and inclusive environments

00:06:01.167 --> 00:06:03.298
that we had something
to do something with?

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.517
And since we spend
one-third of our lives at work,

00:06:07.541 --> 00:06:11.248
what if we did that with people
who didn't look like us?

00:06:11.272 --> 00:06:14.936
I think the world would be
a totally different place outside of work.

00:06:15.624 --> 00:06:20.300
That can happen if business
gets single-minded about racism.

00:06:21.316 --> 00:06:23.789
But the question is:
How is that supposed to happen?

00:06:23.813 --> 00:06:27.594
Well, I think there are three things
that business can borrow from Project '87:

00:06:27.618 --> 00:06:29.084
real problems,

00:06:29.108 --> 00:06:30.301
real numbers,

00:06:30.325 --> 00:06:31.647
real consequences.

00:06:33.235 --> 00:06:34.810
Like it or not,

00:06:35.401 --> 00:06:38.870
diversity is not really a problem
for business -- yet.

00:06:38.894 --> 00:06:42.354
I mean, it's a nice thing to have,
it's the right thing to do,

00:06:42.378 --> 00:06:45.054
but for decades, we've been trying
to make the case

00:06:45.078 --> 00:06:49.334
that diversity fuels innovation
and customer insight.

00:06:49.973 --> 00:06:52.278
I mean, at this point,
it's kind of a no-brainer,

00:06:52.302 --> 00:06:54.791
a little bit like hearing
a smoke alarm going off

00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:56.899
and standing with your hand
on the hot door,

00:06:56.923 --> 00:07:00.206
waiting for some data to tell you
that your house is on fire.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.239
Because the data is already there.

00:07:02.904 --> 00:07:07.692
Ethnically diverse companies perform
33 percent better than the norm.

00:07:08.632 --> 00:07:14.389
Forbes's best workplaces for diversity
enjoy 24 percent higher revenue growth.

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:18.938
And yet, here we are in 2018,

00:07:18.962 --> 00:07:23.747
and there are only three black CEOs
in the Fortune 500.

00:07:23.771 --> 00:07:26.133
And if your name is Molly or Connor,

00:07:26.157 --> 00:07:30.409
you've got a 14 percent better chance
of getting a callback on your resume

00:07:30.433 --> 00:07:32.673
than if your name is Shanice or DeShawn.

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:38.150
And all of this, despite
the fact that by 2045,

00:07:38.174 --> 00:07:43.314
America is projected to be
a minority-majority country.

00:07:44.207 --> 00:07:45.448
Here's the thing:

00:07:45.472 --> 00:07:48.890
the business case for diversity,
as it stands today,

00:07:48.914 --> 00:07:50.917
doesn't really speak to any problem.

00:07:51.472 --> 00:07:54.229
And the only way business
is going to get single-minded

00:07:54.253 --> 00:07:56.166
about racial diversity

00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:00.416
is if it has a problem that is urgent
and relative to somebody

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.999
other than people of color.

00:08:02.928 --> 00:08:04.140
I got one:

00:08:04.164 --> 00:08:06.542
How about employees and customers?

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.297
Because no matter what business you're in,

00:08:09.321 --> 00:08:11.030
you're going to need those, right?

00:08:11.054 --> 00:08:14.295
Well, let's talk about some real numbers.

00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:18.611
If you have employees and customers,
wouldn't it make sense

00:08:18.635 --> 00:08:23.321
if they looked a little bit like
the people that work for you?

00:08:23.345 --> 00:08:28.417
So if that's the case, maybe your employee
base should be 13 percent Black

00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:29.992
and 18 percent Hispanic,

00:08:30.016 --> 00:08:32.389
because that's what
the population looks like.

00:08:32.413 --> 00:08:35.492
Maybe that's what
your customer base looks like.

00:08:36.017 --> 00:08:37.379
But let's be clear:

00:08:37.403 --> 00:08:40.738
diversity and inclusion
are not the same things.

00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:43.547
Diversity is a numbers game.

00:08:43.937 --> 00:08:46.089
Inclusion is about impact.

00:08:46.652 --> 00:08:48.886
Companies can mandate diversity,

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.218
but they have to cultivate inclusion.

00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:54.516
And if inclusion is what you're after,

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.268
you've got to calculate
some slightly different numbers.

00:08:57.292 --> 00:08:59.687
How about 30 percent?

00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:02.827
Because that's the point
that research shows

00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:07.395
at which the voices of minorities
actually begin to be heard.

00:09:08.379 --> 00:09:10.133
If you want a real problem,

00:09:10.157 --> 00:09:12.232
you're going to need
real numbers to fix it,

00:09:12.256 --> 00:09:14.415
and if you're not willing
to set real numbers,

00:09:14.439 --> 00:09:17.911
then maybe you're not real serious
about diversity and inclusion.

00:09:17.935 --> 00:09:19.711
That brings me to my third point:

00:09:20.779 --> 00:09:22.506
real consequences.

00:09:23.143 --> 00:09:24.314
Think about this:

00:09:24.338 --> 00:09:28.395
when salespeople forget what they're doing
and don't come up with their numbers,

00:09:28.419 --> 00:09:29.580
what do we do?

00:09:29.604 --> 00:09:32.510
We give them a little time,
maybe we give them some training.

00:09:32.534 --> 00:09:34.985
But then if they don't hit
those numbers eventually,

00:09:35.009 --> 00:09:36.474
we fire them.

00:09:36.498 --> 00:09:39.696
However, when you start talking
about diversity and inclusion,

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.729
we use terms like "accountability."

00:09:42.163 --> 00:09:46.497
And maybe we scold, and maybe
we hold back an incentive or two.

00:09:46.521 --> 00:09:48.473
But you know what the best incentive is?

00:09:48.497 --> 00:09:49.670
A job.

00:09:49.694 --> 00:09:51.769
And you know what
the best disincentive is?

00:09:51.793 --> 00:09:53.034
Losing it.

00:09:53.058 --> 00:09:56.793
So if companies really
want accountability,

00:09:56.817 --> 00:09:58.922
they should assume that that is a given.

00:09:58.946 --> 00:10:03.180
Consequences are what happen when you
don't do what you're accountable for.

00:10:04.426 --> 00:10:06.414
Imagine this:

00:10:06.438 --> 00:10:13.189
imagine a place where people
of all colors and all races

00:10:13.213 --> 00:10:17.905
are on and climbing every rung
of the corporate ladder;

00:10:17.929 --> 00:10:22.270
where those people feel safe --
indeed, expected --

00:10:22.294 --> 00:10:26.772
to bring their unassimilated,
authentic selves to work every day,

00:10:26.796 --> 00:10:31.897
because the difference that they bring
is both recognized and respected.

00:10:32.511 --> 00:10:38.213
And imagine a place where the lessons
we learn about diversity at work

00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:43.667
actually transform the things we do,
think and say outside of work.

00:10:44.288 --> 00:10:47.176
That is what happens
if we all work together

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.738
to fix what's broken.

00:10:48.762 --> 00:10:52.396
That is what happens if we stop
praying for change to happen

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.997
and actually start moving
our feet to making it.

00:10:55.551 --> 00:10:58.047
That is the power of single-mindedness.

00:10:58.071 --> 00:10:59.231
Thank you.

00:10:59.255 --> 00:11:02.114
(Applause)
