00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:03.436
(adventurous music)

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:11.411 align:start size:88% position:13%
- He does center of
gravity this way, flip!

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:12.946 align:start size:84% position:16%
Well Seagal maybe
has a different grip?

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.147
I don't know, but he's got
the guy he flips usually--

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:15.248
- This is stupid.

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:16.683
- Hey, oh you dick!

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.251
- Jiu jitsu time, D-cup!

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:19.085
- No!

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:23.323 align:start size:81% position:19%
Wait, what's going
on over there?

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:24.391
- Okay, what?

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:27.894
- Hey, knock it off!

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.664
- Gino!

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:37.337 align:start size:88% position:13%
- What was that
douchebag doing to you?

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:38.505
- Oh that guy?

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:39.906
He's Jared Rothstein.

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:41.441
He's been bullying me

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:43.276 align:start size:97% position:3%
since the sixth grade and he's
gonna ruin my whole summer.

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:44.878
- You want that
kid to disappear?

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.179
Say the word and
his mother'll be

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:47.647
at a closed-casket
funeral by Friday.

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:48.915
Talking hammer in the fucking--

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:49.783 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Woah, woah, woah,
woah, a little strong.

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:51.251
That's killing a child.

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:53.319 align:start size:94% position:6%
- But maybe you guys
could scare him, you know?

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:56.823 align:start size:97% position:3%
I mean, you are the toughest
guys in the neighborhood.

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:57.657
Right?

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:00.827
- Yeah.

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:02.062
Well, what's in it for us,

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.164 align:start size:84% position:16%
the toughest guys
in the neighborhood?

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:06.833 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Well I'm having a
graduation party in four days,

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:08.401 align:start size:84% position:16%
I could give you a
10% cut of everything,

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:11.337
that's cash, checks,
and the mini-fridge.

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:12.806 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You'll have to do a little
better than that, Gino.

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:14.507 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Come on, we're the toughest
guys in the neighborhood!

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:15.742
- You heard from someone.

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.710
- Fine, you guys can
come to the party,

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.413 align:start position:0%
and we've got a six-foot chicken
club coming from My Hero,

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:22.782
so that's my final offer.

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:24.184
- Yeah, yeah, we are in.

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:25.718
- We are in.
- We're in.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:27.187 align:start size:81% position:19%
- We are in, bro.
- Fuck, yes!

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:29.589
Fuck, fucking Gino come over.

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:33.860
- [Danny] This is everything
I have on Jared Rothstein.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.395
- Where did you get all this?

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:38.865
- Remember four years ago
when someone egged my car?

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:40.133
- Nope.

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.101
- Well I gathered
some intelligence

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.368
on the neighborhood kids.

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:45.004
Suspect number 12,
Jared Rothstein.

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:46.506
- Wait, why am I in here?

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:49.876 align:start position:0%
- Uh, your alibi during the
egg incident was full of holes.

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:50.944
- Are these medical records?

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:52.278
Where would you even get those?

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.013
- Had to bang the
high school nurse.

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:56.015 align:start size:88% position:13%
- That's gross, man,
she's like 80 years old.

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:57.450
- Still got her memory.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
- Wait a minute, it's a
receipt for a steampunk outfit.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.921
Isn't steampunk that nerdy shit

00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:04.424 align:start size:97% position:3%
that's like old timey and
futuristic at the same time?

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:05.625
Like an escalator?

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:06.459
- Yes.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:07.994
We will exploit this.

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:10.530
We'll break into his house,
steal his steampunk outfit,

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.098 align:start size:88% position:13%
give it to Gino, who'll
take it to school

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:13.800
and embarrass himself so badly

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.201 align:start size:84% position:16%
that he'll spend
the rest of his life

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:17.370
living in his mom's basement.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.605
- [Mark] Bingo.

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:20.974
- Don't you guys live
in your mom's basement?

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.442
- No!

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:24.477 align:start size:94% position:6%
Our mother lives in a
house above our apartment.

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:25.311
- [Gino] Okay.

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:26.713
- Geeze, Gino.

00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:27.714
- [Gino] Sorry.

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:29.382
- Let's do this.

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:32.719
(singing fanfare music)

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:36.856
(beatboxing)

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.127
(vocalizing wordlessly)

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.104
- Is that Rusted Root?

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:56.309
- The family's out
getting ice cream

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:58.044
for the next 30 minutes.

00:02:58.044 --> 00:02:59.512
This is our window.

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:00.413
Let's roll.

00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:05.518
(plastic bottles clanging)

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:10.857
(body thumping against ground)

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:13.326
- Dude, what's with that mask?

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:15.562
You look like a god
damn psychopath!

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:16.930 align:start size:84% position:16%
- According to Jared's
psych evaluation,

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.666 align:start size:97% position:3%
he has a reoccurring
nightmare of a skeletal demon.

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:20.500
What's with your outfit?

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.334
You're all in black.

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:23.069
This is a daytime op.

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:26.005
Once we take this
little prick down,

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:29.042 align:start size:97% position:3%
we're gonna be eating My
Hero at Gino's like ballers.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:31.778 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Ballers in our late 20s
at a high school grad party.

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:33.346
(laughs)

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:34.314
Young pussy.

00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:35.148
Move.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.988
(fabric rips)

00:03:41.988 --> 00:03:42.822
We're in.

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:44.190
- Dude, it smells.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.458
- Oh, whatever.

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.364
- Dude, what are you doing?

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:52.765
You don't know how
long that's been out.

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:53.733
- I don't think about it, man.

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.201
- Dude, you're gonna be sick.

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:56.502 align:start size:97% position:3%
- (laughs) I'll be fine,
think about it, he comes home,

00:03:56.502 --> 00:03:58.304
he looks for his Chinese
food, there's none left.

00:03:58.304 --> 00:04:00.206
Revenge! (laughs)

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:01.841
- Dude, put it down.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.482
(slurps)

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:10.917
(wood breaking)

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:14.220
(Mark grunting)

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.090 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I am never opening a
door the regular way again.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.392
- Oh, you got to
ease up, Seagal.

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:23.296
- Yo, check the closet,
I'll check the drawers.

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:27.000
Oh, the April issue.

00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:29.168
(discordant music)

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:30.169
- Ha, look, I'm a big dork!

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.104
(laughs)

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:32.005
This is actually really cool.

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:33.106
Let's get outta here.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:35.408 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Yeah.
(stomach gurgling)

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:37.043
Oh, it's bang bang time.

00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:37.977
- [Danny] Mark, come on!

00:04:37.977 --> 00:04:39.212
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:41.281
(farting loudly)
No, not, no, not.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.549
(screams)

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:45.451
Here comes the thunder!

00:04:46.886 --> 00:04:48.054
- It's just such a relief

00:04:48.054 --> 00:04:49.122 align:start size:88% position:13%
that everyone's finally
making fun of him

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.390
instead of me, you know?

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.824
- That's awesome.
- You're welcome.

00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:53.459 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I actually checked out
some of that steampunk stuff.

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:55.495
Pretty cool, I'm into it.

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:57.030 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm actually making
my own goggles.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.432
- They're not making fun of
him for the steampunk stuff.

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:01.901
No, no, they found fecal
matter all over his closet,

00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:04.170
like in the clothes and
the shoes and everything.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.505
- [Danny] What?

00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:06.739
- That's weird.

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:07.674
- He wrote help
me in big letters

00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:09.008
with his own shit on the walls.

00:05:09.008 --> 00:05:10.510
- Ugh!

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.944
- Yeah, and then the doctors
took his poop down to the lab,

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:13.413
ran some tests on it.

00:05:13.413 --> 00:05:15.815 align:start size:97% position:3%
(sharp breath) They found
dangerous amounts of nitrates,

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:17.583
MSG, traces of blood.

00:05:18.785 --> 00:05:20.053
Even some baby teeth.

00:05:20.053 --> 00:05:22.822
- Oh, what is wrong with him?

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:24.290 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Sent him to the hospital,
doctors said he's lucky

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.993
to even be alive with
all that in his system.

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:27.827
- Wow.

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.395
- Well, we got him.

00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:32.932
(playful music)

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.072
