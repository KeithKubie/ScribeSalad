00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.340
Air travel.

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.120
Whizzing through the sky without a care in
the world.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.680
Except the nausea, swollen feet, dehydration,
and sluggish thoughts caused by oxygen deprivation.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.200
Yep, without a care in the world.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.300
Hi there Sky Captains, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.820
Flying is one of those dreaded necessities
right up there with going to the dentist and

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.940
checking your bank statement.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.880
It’s uncomfortable and scary, but at some
point you’re probably going to have to do

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.880
it.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.859
And now with the holidays upon us, people
are flying home to see families and wondering

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.439
why it makes them miserable.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.320
The air travel, not the families…

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.320
Hopefully

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.890
As it turns out airplanes are the perfect
cocktail for messing with your body.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.510
Even if you’re not the type to get airsick,
there are a number of factors working against

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.510
you.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.120
First and foremost is the low oxygen levels.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.020
The higher you go the thinner the air gets,
and at the altitudes commercial airliners

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.400
fly the air is so thin if you had to breathe
it you would suffer from a severe case of

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.400
deadness.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.289
To counteract this, airplanes pressurize air
from outside, but it’s still not as much

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.289
oxygen as you’re probably used to.

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.719
Standard atmospheric pressure at sea level
at 15 degrees centigrade with 0% relative

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:09.219
humidity is 101.325 kilo Pascals.

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:14.399
Airplanes pressurize air inside to about 75
kilo Pascals, which is equivalent to being

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.799
8000 feet or 2400 meters above sea level.

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.130
Contrary to popular belief, that’s not the
reason why your feet swell.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.649
Sitting and doing nothing will cause blood
to pool in your legs at any altitude.

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.850
However the unintended side effect of that
is your brain gets even less oxygen, and you

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.740
were already operating on 3 quarters the O2
you usually do.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.329
That may be why that sudoku puzzle is kicking
your butt all across Wyoming.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.499
The pressure differentials are also responsible
for that popping sensation in your ears on

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:41.630
takeoff and landing.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.840
Below 6,000 feet the pressurization is shut
off and the cabin pressure fluctuates to the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.509
same pressure as the outside air.

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.130
Inside your head, the Eustachian tubes are
doing the same, opening and closing until

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.259
the pressure in your middle ear matches the
cabin pressure which is matching the outside

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.479
air as you descend from the height of Denver,
Colorado.

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.369
So why not pressurize the cabin more?

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.469
Well in order to take the pressure differential
the fuselage has to be strong, but it also

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.020
has to be light in order for the airplane
to sort of… fly.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.829
So there’s a limit to how much pressure
it can take without popping like a balloon.

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.459
There’s another problem with the air up
there too; it’s not as humid.

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.290
This can lead to dry mouth and eventually
dehydration.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.790
When you combine that with the lower oxygen
levels, it means alcohol hits a lot harder

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.569
and you run the risk of becoming internet
famous when a modern family editor live tweets

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:28.790
your sloppy drunkenness.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.120
The solution?

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.019
Drink plenty of water before and during the
flight, walk around and do leg exercises,

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.500
and for the love of god don’t sit near anyone
with a lot of twitter followers.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.680
If you want to know more about other airplane
inconveniences, Anthony explains the truth

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.430
about cell phones on a plane here.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.489
And is air travel worth the hassle for you?
