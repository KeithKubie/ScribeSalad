00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.420
STAVROS MACRAKIS: So today
I'm happy to introduce

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.820
Marilynn Johnson, Lynn, who
is a professor at Boston

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.750
College of history.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.980
Today she's presenting
about "The New Bostonians,"

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.500
which you saw the blurb about.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.140
But let me give you a
little bit of background.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.806
One of the interesting
things about Lynn

00:00:22.806 --> 00:00:25.470
is that she seems to manage
to be ahead of the curve

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.110
writing academically,
doing research and writing

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.790
about topics which then
turn out to be much more

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.710
important than when she
started writing about them.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.512
So how many years ago was it you
did your police violence book?

00:00:38.512 --> 00:00:40.470
MARILYNN JOHNSON: It's
a little-- 12 years now,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.920
something like that.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.370
STAVROS MACRAKIS: So 12
years ago, she wrote a book

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.750
on police violence, which
of course has become

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.580
a very hot issue in the past
couple of years with Black

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.680
Lives Matter and so on.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.450
And as you know, in the
current electoral campaign,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.250
immigration has
become a big topic.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.640
These evil immigrants are
ruining our neighborhoods

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.179
and ruining our economy and
taking jobs away and all

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:02.970
that sort of thing.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.846
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:04.846 --> 00:01:07.379
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:09.670
STAVROS MACRAKIS: So Lynn
started working on that topic

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.950
years ago and has had her
book out for about a year

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.850
now on this topic.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.320
So I'd like to have you
hear from Lynn Johnson.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.320
MARILYNN JOHNSON: Great.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.982
Thanks, Stavros.

00:01:21.982 --> 00:01:24.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.420
And thanks for the opportunity
to come here and speak.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.670
I really appreciate it.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.350
And I think it's
the first time I've

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.940
gotten to speak at a
workplace other than my own.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.440
I want to do-- as
I usually start

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.410
when I talk about
this book, 1965

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.560
is a key moment, a
kind of turning point

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.770
in immigration in the United
States and in the Boston area

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.000
as well.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.650
And the timing--
my book actually

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.740
came out this Fall in time
for the 50th anniversary

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.070
of the 1965
Immigration Act, which

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.400
was signed in October 1965.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.640
And now there was a bit of
a historical event about it,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.419
so I wanted to have the book
coming out timed with that.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:13.530
And this is a scene from
the signing of that bill,

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.220
with Lyndon Johnson
there in the middle

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.330
and some familiar Massachusetts
faces off to the right.

00:02:22.296 --> 00:02:27.150
It was part of this
whole wave of legislation

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.550
that was passed as part
of the Great Society

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.000
during Lyndon Johnson's term,
civil rights legislation,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.990
and anti-poverty legislation,
and immigration legislation,

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.610
which was part of the
civil rights ethos.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.900
The reason that this
legislation was so significant

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.190
is because it reformed the
immigration system that

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.960
had been set up back
in the 1920s, which

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.980
was a very restrictive
immigration quota system.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.180
And it was one that
favored immigrants

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.050
from Northern and Western
Europe and ended up

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.850
disfavoring immigrants from
Southern and Eastern Europe

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.530
and other parts of the
world, particularly

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.810
Asia, which had been
partially excluded

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.660
under older immigration
laws, and then

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:22.110
was completely excluded
based on Asian ineligibility

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.610
for citizenship under US law.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.790
So this 1965 act
changed that system

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.600
and set up equal quotas for
each country around the world.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.850
They were pretty small
quotas in some cases,

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.350
just like 100 or so.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.920
But it did allow immigration
from across the globe

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.110
in a smaller-- and actually
did increase the numbers up

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:54.510
to about 160,000 or so, and then
would increase it in small ways

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.800
after that.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.630
Now the other thing
about this legislation

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.190
is that it gave preferences and
exemptions for certain kinds

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.000
of immigrants.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.680
So if you had
particular skills that

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.020
were needed in the economy--
and typically these

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.750
were skills in the sciences
and engineering and medicine--

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.290
you could move to the
front of the line.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:23.850
Also, if you became an American
citizen-- you were foreign born

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.690
and you became an
American citizen,

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.740
you could bring immediate family
members over with exemption.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.290
So you could go
around the quotas.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.370
And what happened very quickly
is that family exemptions

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.570
became very popular.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.330
People got citizenship, and they
brought family members over.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.730
So the numbers of immigrants
coming in actually

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.890
went up, because those
family exemption visas

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.950
were outside of the quotas.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:59.190
This is part of the reason
that the 1965 immigration

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.130
law changed things so
dramatically in the country.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.630
Frankly, nobody had
any idea that this law

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.060
was going to change
things as much as it did.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.890
Most of the people
in Congress who

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.300
pushed for this
legislation, many of them

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.610
were second and third
generation Italians, Jews,

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.600
other people whose
families had come

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.300
in the more recent wave
of southern and eastern

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.350
immigration.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.370
They assumed that
the family exemptions

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.170
would help their families, their
relatives to bring more family

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.940
members over from Southern
and Eastern Europe.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.640
And a small amount
of immigration

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.790
would come from other
parts of the world.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.800
This would help the US image
abroad during the Cold War,

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.420
because the Soviet
Union was always

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.170
trying to capitalize on the
fact that the US practiced

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.610
various forms of racial
and ethnic discrimination.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.040
It would be a goodwill gesture,
but it wasn't really going

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.680
to change the population.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.210
And that, of course,
proved to be very untrue.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.900
Here in Boston, for instance,
the change was staggering.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.710
In the 1960s, Boston
was an overwhelmingly

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.850
white, Catholic, predominantly
Irish Catholic, Irish American

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:10.830
town.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.400
Today, of course,
people of color

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.350
make up the majority of the
population, in large part

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.950
because of immigration
from Asia, Latin America,

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.140
the Caribbean, and
Africa, more recently.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.680
Boston has always been
an immigrant portal.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.690
We had many, many
immigrants coming in

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.240
in the 19th and
early 20th centuries.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.080
But the diversity of the
immigrant population,

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.810
the foreign born
population, today

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.070
is astounding even in
comparison to the peak years

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.640
of the old immigration.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.380
And this is a
chart from my book.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.900
You can see that in 1910,
which was the peak census

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:54.070
year of the old immigration, you
have basically four groups that

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.420
made up more than 3/4
of the foreign born.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.590
They were all from Europe
or Canada-- Ireland,

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:04.300
predictably, Italy, Russia,
mainly Jews in that time

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.440
period, and Canadians, both from
maritime provinces and French

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.840
Canadians, Canadians
more generally.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.210
If you compare this to 2010
though, it's quite remarkable.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:16.990
You have more than
two dozen groups

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.090
that make up that same
percentage of the foreign born.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.310
And they come from
all over the world.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.140
The three biggest groups
are not from-- actually,

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:31.980
the top 10 groups, at
least-- are not from Europe.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.890
China, the Dominican
Republic, and Haiti

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:37.270
have been the three largest
groups historically.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.390
But they switch
around a little bit.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.420
And also significant
numbers from Vietnam

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.590
and El Salvador and Cape Verde.

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:45.750
And then after
that, you just have

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.622
all of these little slices
of different groups.

00:07:49.622 --> 00:07:53.220
And it's made the city much,
much more cosmopolitan,

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.560
and obviously much
more multiracial

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.450
as people have come
from all over the world.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.750
And this particular makeup
continues to change.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.400
Every census is a
little bit different.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.490
We'll be seeing more
Africans in the future,

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:10.430
because some of the groups that
came later and are beginning

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.690
to cash in on-- as
they get citizenship

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.130
and being able to use
the family exemptions,

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.870
their numbers will
increase in the future.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.760
But similar great
diversity will continue,

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.451
I think, into the future,
unless the legislation changes.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:33.720
As far as the metro area's
concerned, similar mixture

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.260
of people.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.970
Some slight differences here.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.299
You have Brazilians ranking
a little bit higher,

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:41.500
because Brazilians tend to
live more in the suburbs

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.260
than in the city.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.170
You also have same
thing with Indians

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.100
disproportionately
in the suburbs

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.152
rather than in the
city of Boston itself.

00:08:51.152 --> 00:08:52.820
Cape Verdeans rank
a little lower,

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.760
because they tend
to be concentrated

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.080
in the city of Boston.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.270
But more or less the
same kind of profile.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.460
Now, the new immigration
is now 50 years old.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.640
And we know a good bit about
it at the national level,

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.310
been a lot of national
level studies of immigrants.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:13.400
But we know less about how
these immigrants have shaped

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.030
American life in particular
places and cities

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.130
and metropolitan areas.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.520
A lot has been
written about this

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.610
by journalists and by social
scientists, kind of snapshots.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.890
And I used a lot of
"Globe" articles,

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.940
actually, going back into their
archive over the last 50 years,

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.970
which were an important
source for me.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.690
But typically, these
are sort of snapshots

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:40.760
of particular immigrant
communities or groups

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.170
at that particular moment.

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:45.030
So you don't get much of
a historical perspective.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.870
And as a historian,
I thought, you know,

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.950
the new immigration
is not so new anymore.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.440
It's 50 years old.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.370
It's changed.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.970
When I was reading about
immigration in the 1970s,

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.310
it looked very different from
what we see in the city today.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.610
So that's why I decided
to write this book.

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.880
I wanted to tell the story
of the new immigration

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.360
in a particular city,
a particular region,

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.540
to see how it evolved
over time and how

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:14.350
immigrants helped to shape the
region and the city as a whole.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:17.620
And it turned out that Boston
was a great place to do that.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.500
It's a city that was
powered by immigrants

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.620
in the 19th and
early 20th centuries

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.160
during the industrial era.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.580
It's also a city that's been
one of the top 10 immigrant

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.870
receiving areas of the late
20th and early 21st centuries.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.810
So it's always been an
important immigrant portal.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:39.120
And during this past
50 years, Boston

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:44.280
has also experienced a dramatic
turnaround in its economy,

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.340
in its infrastructure.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.690
There has been a
kind of rebirth,

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:52.890
a renaissance of Boston and its
economy in this time period.

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.570
So I wanted to know
what's the relationship

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.780
between this so-called
Boston Renaissance

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.820
and the new immigration?

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:03.440
So as I argue in
"The New Bostonians,"

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.096
I think that the two are
very directly connected,

00:11:06.096 --> 00:11:09.570
that immigration is very much
a part of the bigger story

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.130
of the Boston Renaissance.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.080
Now here, I don't
want to oversimplify.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.760
There's a lot of things that
went into Boston's turnaround.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.070
And you can think
of globalization,

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:25.250
the restructuring of capital,
urban renewal, technology,

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.300
all kinds of important changes.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:31.050
But immigration, I think, is
one of the ingredients that

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.010
has been the least
talked about in terms

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.760
of the contributions
to the labor market

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.320
and the transformation
of the city itself

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.660
and its neighborhoods,
its life, that has really

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.460
been a part of the
Boston Renaissance.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.070
So I really want to make
an argument in this book

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:57.380
that we have to really remember
the role of immigration

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.070
and how important it is if
we want to really understand

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:04.330
the history of the new
Boston, which has sort of come

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:09.650
into being since the 1960s and
especially since the 1980s.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:13.270
So let me give you a
few examples of how

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.220
I think this is the case.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.380
Population replenishment is an
important part of the story.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:22.090
As you can see in
this chart, I just

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:27.930
charted the population in
Boston from 1880 to the present.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:32.970
And you can see in the height
of the mature industrial era,

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:37.930
from 1880 until the
1920s, Boston's population

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:39.290
was steadily growing.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:42.880
And the foreign born population
in the lighter color of the bar

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.370
was clearly a big part of that.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.570
The native born population
was also growing.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:50.910
Lots of people were coming
in from rural areas,

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:53.100
moving into the cities.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.120
And so both populations
were important.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:00.690
By 1930, we see a
kind of leveling off

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.710
and a slight decline
in the population.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:04.990
A lot of that was due
to the Great Depression

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.202
and how hard Boston was
hit in the Depression.

00:13:08.202 --> 00:13:10.330
A lot of its
industries closed down

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.310
temporarily or permanently.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:15.050
And World War II kind of
revived things for a while.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:19.500
But then after the war
ended, things declined again.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:24.100
And from 1950, you can
see a pretty dramatic drop

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.610
in the population.

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:31.220
Between 1950 and 1970,
Boston lost more than 20%

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:36.160
of its population, and
many industries and jobs

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.290
along with that.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:41.410
And it wasn't until
1980 that we start

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:43.950
to see the population
go up again.

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:47.760
And as is quite clear
from this chart,

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.140
it is the foreign
born population, not

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:55.920
the native born population,
that's driving the increase.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.370
And it's also
driving the increase

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:04.730
in the labor force, which is key
to the turnaround in Boston's

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:06.200
economy.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.940
It isn't until
2010 that we start

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.410
to see a slight increase in
the native born population.

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:15.220
Now, a good part
of that increase

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.150
is actually the children
of the foreign born, who

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:19.640
are disproportionately younger.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:23.160
Boston has an aging population,
like much of the Northeast

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.290
and the Midwest.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:28.280
And this foreign born population
is much more concentrated

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:34.540
in the 20 to 38 range, more
likely to have children,

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:39.790
and thus more likely to produce
native born children there.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:43.350
So without immigrants,
I think it's

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.850
pretty clear that our population
would not be going up.

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:49.210
It would be, at best, flat.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:53.260
Now this is the same idea
looking at the labor force.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.750
And here you can see, again,
that the native born labor

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:59.215
force since 1980 has been
pretty flat in Boston

00:14:59.215 --> 00:15:01.600
and in Massachusetts generally.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.990
And it's really the
foreign born population

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:07.010
that has driven the
growth in the labor force.

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:12.030
And if you hear anybody talk
about economic development

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:14.940
in the state or in
the city, keeping

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.390
the labor force growing
at a moderate rate

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.660
is a central concern.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:24.710
There's a lot of lamenting
about we have all these college

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.716
students that come into Boston,
and they get well educated,

00:15:27.716 --> 00:15:28.840
and they have great skills.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:29.940
And then they leave.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.350
And how do we keep them here?

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.170
How do we keep the
native born here,

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:37.230
who can contribute
to the labor force?

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.940
So there is a net outflow
of native born workers,

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.800
particularly skilled workers.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:47.220
And it's really only immigration
that makes up for that

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.770
and provides a slight
increase in the labor force.

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:55.620
So I think both of these
trends show how important it

00:15:55.620 --> 00:16:00.010
is that immigration is not
immigrants coming and taking

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.800
away jobs and
depressing the economy.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.460
It's actually contributing
to growth in the economy.

00:16:11.812 --> 00:16:17.880
The places where immigrants
are working, it really varies.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.880
The immigration
of the modern era,

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:27.260
since 1965, consists of many
more educated and skilled

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.640
people coming in than
was true in the earlier

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.710
migration of the late 19th
and early 20th centuries.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:37.850
That was overwhelmingly
unskilled or semi-skilled

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:42.150
workers, most of whom went into
day labor or the manufacturing

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.710
industries.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:46.000
They were factory workers,
for the most part.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.270
Immigrants coming in today tend
to be clustered at the top end

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:54.720
and at the bottom end
of the labor force.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.990
So you have, in some of
the most important-- now

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:01.220
that we have a service-based
economy rather than

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.530
a manufacturing economy-- you
have immigrants who are highly

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:07.920
educated, highly skilled, who
are concentrated in fields

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:12.640
like medicine, technology,
as you no doubt know,

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:17.650
in education, engineering,
a variety of fields

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:20.390
which are very important
to Boston's economy.

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:25.470
But they also make up
the largest proportion

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:27.910
of people who clean
the buildings, who

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:30.850
serve the food, who do
yard work, who take care

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.530
of our children, who
take care of the elderly,

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:37.380
the whole growing number
of care industries

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:42.570
that are driven very largely
by immigrants, many of whom

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:48.055
come from the Caribbean, Latin
America, and Asia, as well.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.330
Immigrants have also been
important as entrepreneurs.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.390
They're not just employees.

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:57.440
Many of them are starting
their own businesses.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.450
Again, I'm sure you're
familiar with this.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.900
Technology and
biotech, in particular,

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.920
there's been a good
bit of research

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.630
on this in Massachusetts.

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:11.620
And a very large
number of immigrants

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:16.420
are involved either solely
or in partnerships developing

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.940
startups and other businesses.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:24.270
And it ranges all the
way down to local bodegas

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:28.270
and restaurants right on
up to big technology firms

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:32.200
and medical instruments
and any other businesses

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.210
you can think of.

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:37.390
One of the things that happened
that sort of-- thinking

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:39.220
about the care
industries and the way

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:43.090
that immigrants have become so
important to that, in my own

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:46.210
writing this book and
picking the photograph

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.540
to go on the cover,
which I loved-- it's

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:52.150
a naturalization
citizenship swearing

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:54.350
in ceremony at Fenway Park.

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.565
They had several thousand
people there back in 2007.

00:18:57.565 --> 00:18:58.940
I love the image,
because it just

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:00.970
showed people from
all over the world who

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:03.000
were going through this.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.330
And I gave a copy of
the book to my father,

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:08.740
who lives in assisted living
in Brooklyn where I live.

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:12.220
And he was taking it over
to show to a friend of his.

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:14.790
And the nurse's aide who
was pushing his wheelchair

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.550
sees the book and
said, that's my father!

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.570
And my sister!

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:26.490
So I mean, it's so true that
just picking this image,

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:28.930
that I would have
stumbled into immigrants

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:31.225
right in my own backyard.

00:19:31.225 --> 00:19:33.100
And I subsequently found
out the whole story.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.683
I met her, and I found out the
story of how she and her family

00:19:35.683 --> 00:19:38.940
came from Somalia via
Ethiopia and Pakistan,

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:42.240
took something like 10 years
to get the whole family here.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.810
They live in Dorchester
in Jamaica Plain now.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:46.870
So it's just a great
example and reminder

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:51.430
of how important immigrants
are to all of our lives.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:55.942
I know I see immigrants on both
the professional and higher end

00:19:55.942 --> 00:20:00.706
and the lower ends of the
service economy all the time.

00:20:00.706 --> 00:20:02.330
Now, the other ways
in which immigrants

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:06.070
have been a strong
force in our economy

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:11.750
is in terms of community and
neighborhood revitalization.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:14.330
And we may not see
that so clearly today,

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.330
because things are so built
up and gentrified now.

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:20.622
But if you go back to
the 1960s or the 1970s,

00:20:20.622 --> 00:20:22.080
maybe there's a
few people here who

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.560
remember Boston in that era.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.510
I didn't live here then, but
I visited a number of times.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:29.480
And it was a pretty
down-at-the-heels,

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.050
declining manufacturing center.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:34.990
And it wouldn't be
until the 1980s and '90s

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:39.030
that this whole high-tech new
world, new Boston economy,

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.440
would take off.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.830
And immigrants settled
in a lot of neighborhoods

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:46.100
that were pretty rundown, that
were losing population, losing

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:50.080
jobs, losing
industries, and actually

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:54.210
ended up really rebuilding
them and turning them around.

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:57.120
And Washington
Street in Chinatown

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.610
is a really good
example of this.

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:05.450
This is a street
which in the 1960s

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:07.140
was known as the Combat Zone.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.060
It was the adult entertainment
district, so-called.

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:13.800
After Scollay Square was
torn down in an urban renewal

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.540
program, the city relocated the
adult entertainment district,

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:20.690
all the porn theaters
and adult bookstores,

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.500
along the edge of
Chinatown, which

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.380
made residents of
Chinatown very unhappy,

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.310
because they had families.

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:30.629
And it attracted a
less savory element.

00:21:30.629 --> 00:21:31.670
There was a lot of crime.

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:34.670
There was a lot of prostitution.

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:38.470
But there didn't seem to be much
that people could do about it.

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:42.620
The existing Chinatown
entrepreneurs

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:46.760
didn't really want to
try and expand in there.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.240
And it wasn't until
the 1980s, early 1980s,

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:55.450
when refugees came from Vietnam
in the so-called boat people

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:55.980
crisis.

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.350
These were mainly
ethnic Chinese who

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:07.100
had been entrepreneurs in
Vietnam and who were leaving,

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:11.240
in part because of persecution
they were facing there.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.590
And they came in.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.460
They weren't always
comfortable settling

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.680
in Vietnamese neighborhoods,
like Fields Corner.

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:23.830
So they settled kind of on
the outskirts of Chinatown.

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:26.390
And they began, when
they started businesses--

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:28.900
and they had been small
business owners in Vietnam,

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.960
for the most part-- they
started buying up the cheapest

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.380
property they could find
or renting out the cheapest

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.820
property they could find, which
was along Washington Street,

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.760
starting up small
stores and restaurants.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.160
And they were the
single biggest force

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:49.450
for turning around the economy
on that street and kind

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:53.240
of pushing the Combat Zone out.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.260
And today, there's
hardly anything left

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.120
of that old Washington Street.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:01.560
And what you see now is much
more like the picture in 2010

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.060
here.

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.520
This is the same building.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.240
You can see the arch there.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.110
It's mostly restaurants.

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:10.140
It's very much a part
of Chinatown now.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.400
And it really sort of turned
things around to the point

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.240
where now, there are luxury
condos and high rises going up,

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.450
and people are priced
out of there now.

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:24.900
But you can see this same
transformation in neighborhoods

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.990
around the city,
as immigrants have

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:31.640
come into places like East
Boston and Dorchester, Allston,

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:35.230
Brighton, Jamaica
Plain, Roslindale.

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:38.610
A lot of different
places you could

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:40.240
identify the same phenomenon.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.560
And it's also happened in
some of the nearby suburbs.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:47.680
Somerville, of course, is
a great example of this.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:51.050
Not everybody wanted to live in
Somerville not that long ago.

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:53.250
It was mostly immigrants
who were moving in

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.520
as the population was declining.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:59.620
And now, of course,
it's really taken off.

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:04.410
And gentrification has become
the bigger threat, rather than

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:05.830
decline.

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:08.330
And as immigrants
started businesses,

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.620
as they bought homes,
triple deckers,

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:15.440
just the way earlier
immigrant groups had done,

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.630
they're paying tax
dollars to contribute

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:19.530
to those local economies.

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:26.050
We see a revitalization that
just changes the local culture

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:26.840
in a lot of ways.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.520
Obviously, it makes
it more diverse.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.714
But it also revitalizes things.

00:24:30.714 --> 00:24:32.130
It puts more people
on the street.

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:36.110
There were a lot of these
older industrial suburbs where

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:39.320
the downtowns were like
ghost towns in the 1970s

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.760
after a lot of the bigger
manufacturing industries

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:43.740
closed up.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:50.090
I'm thinking of places like
Everett and Framingham, Malden.

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:54.710
The downtowns of these
suburbs were pretty rundown.

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:56.880
They were becoming unsafe.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.500
There's a sociologist
at Harvard who's

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.610
done a very elaborate
study in several cities

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:06.030
showing that the presence
of immigrants in most cases

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:07.680
actually reduces crime.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:11.450
So it's just the opposite of
what people like Donald Trump

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:13.570
are arguing.

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:16.300
And that was clearly
the case in many parts

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:19.270
of Boston and its suburbs.

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:23.990
Now In the book, I want to
move beyond the city of Boston

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.400
and look at greater
Boston as a whole,

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:30.480
because in the past
20 years or so-- maybe

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.070
even a little bit more, since
the late '80s-- immigrants have

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:37.230
been moving disproportionately
to the suburbs rather

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:38.320
than the city.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:44.060
And they do this for
a number of reasons.

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.890
One of the big things is
that the city of Boston

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:50.310
has become less
affordable, obviously.

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:51.870
The initial wave of
immigrants that I

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:55.140
look at in the late
'60s and 1970s,

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:58.650
they're going to some of the old
parts of the city, Chinatown,

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:02.870
the South End, East
Cambridge would be

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:04.950
looking in the Cambridge case.

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:07.540
But very quickly, because
of development pressures

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:11.210
and gentrification in
the 1980s, newcomers

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:14.050
start moving out to more
affordable neighborhoods,

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:18.540
places like Allston, Brighton,
East Boston, Dorchester,

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:21.410
and also out to the
closer in suburbs.

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:24.420
And they're investing
in these areas

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.020
and helping to change them.

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:29.980
So I wanted to follow this
process into the suburbs.

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.060
I wasn't able to study
all of the suburbs.

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:35.100
What I did is I
picked-- well, here's

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:41.350
just to show you the diffusion
that happens between 1970.

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:43.440
You can see immigrants
are concentrated,

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.940
and it's a pretty small number.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.220
This is 1970, was
the lowest level

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:50.340
of foreign born
population in the history

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.710
of the 20th century.

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:54.280
And it's concentrated around
Boston and a few suburbs

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.710
to the north.

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:58.390
40 years later, it's
quite a different story.

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:01.750
We have immigrants dispersed
around the metro area,

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:05.120
and in some cases, places
like Malden and Chelsea

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.820
and Randolph that have
pretty high foreign born

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:12.160
populations a good
distance out from the city.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:16.910
Same with Framingham
and a few others, Acton.

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:21.290
So I wanted to get
a handle on why

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:24.620
immigrants were going to some
suburbs and not to others.

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:27.850
So I just started
out making a chart.

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:30.890
This is a list of
suburbs that have

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:32.490
a higher percentage
of immigrants

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.560
than the city of Boston itself.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.100
And as you can see,
it's a pretty good list.

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:41.870
And the immigrants are
coming from different places.

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:44.390
There are different
stories behind each city.

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:48.690
But in general, what I found
is that there were two patterns

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:49.840
that seemed to be dominant.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:56.070
One was skilled, educated,
professional, managerial class

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:59.400
immigrants, who were
moving to the same suburbs

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.720
that skilled, educated,
professional, native born

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.430
residents go to, going
there for schools,

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:08.460
going there for amenities
and nice housing.

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:14.230
So you have places like
Lexington and Burlington

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:18.610
and some of the suburbs
to the west of the city.

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:22.730
But you also have a lot of
poorer, working class suburbs,

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:27.230
places like Chelsea, old
industrial cities which

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:29.770
have been taking in
immigrants for years.

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:33.110
Chelsea used to have the
largest Jewish population

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:37.490
relative to its size of
any city in the country.

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:41.780
And later on, as Jews moved
out, Puerto Ricans and then

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:44.960
Latino immigrants,
particularly Central Americans

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:48.240
and later Brazilians and
others, would move in.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.145
And so Chelsea now has the
highest foreign born population

00:28:51.145 --> 00:28:51.770
in the country.

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:54.590
I think it's 43%.

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:57.440
Not very far away,
Malden has also

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.620
experienced a huge increase
in its immigrant population.

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:02.950
It, too, was an
old industrial town

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:09.490
and saw a major
transformation in the 1980s.

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:11.190
And same thing with Quincy.

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:15.260
And both Malden and Quincy
are connected to Boston

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:19.140
by the T, either the red
line or the orange line.

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.990
They were very popular with
Asian immigrants, Chinese

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:26.230
and Vietnamese, who first
moved there in the 1980s

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:28.780
and began that
revitalization process

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.800
and then proceeded to diversify.

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.980
And both cities take in
large numbers of immigrants

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:35.730
from all over the world.

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:40.750
Quincy has people from-- have
Latinos, they have Albanians,

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:45.020
they have people from
Afghanistan, Iraqis.

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:47.010
It's a remarkably diverse place.

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:49.610
Same with Malden, as well.

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:53.570
So you tend to have these
higher end suburbs and more

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:56.050
working class suburbs,
old industrial suburbs,

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:59.050
that account for the largest
number of immigrants.

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:02.760
In between, you do have
some middle class areas,

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:06.580
but not nearly as many.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.540
Framingham is another
interesting case.

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:11.120
And actually in
the book, what I do

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.910
is I look at three different
suburbs and their history,

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:17.090
and try and understand why they
became popular with immigrants.

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:19.050
I look at Malden to the north.

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:24.140
Malden was the home of
Converse, the Converse factory.

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:27.700
It's where the Converse All-Star
was made for many, many years.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.520
Converse shut down in the 1980s.

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.080
The city went into
a bit of a slide.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:35.730
But because it had the
T and the orange line,

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:38.090
it was attractive
for new immigrants

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:41.440
to move in when the housing
prices were relatively low,

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.080
and took off.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:46.460
And Quincy also was
an industrial town.

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:49.700
There was a shipbuilding
center and a granite quarry

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.030
located there.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:55.660
Both of those industries went
down in the late 20th century.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:57.770
And again, Chinese and
Vietnamese immigrants

00:30:57.770 --> 00:31:01.680
started the revitalization
there in the 1980s.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.970
And then out in Framingham,
which I always thought of as--

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:07.160
I just think of those
big malls out there

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:10.260
in Natick and Framingham,
the classic post-war suburb.

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.130
Well, it turns out
south Framingham

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:13.480
was an old industrial center.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.880
It's on the railroad.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.990
There was a GM
assembly plant there.

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:21.430
It was built, I believe,
in the late 1930s

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:24.240
and shut down in the '70s.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.090
Dennison Paper was there,
Bancroft Cap and Gown,

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:31.740
a lot of big manufacturing
industries there, nearly all

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:32.900
of which closed down.

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:37.290
And so the downtown
area really hit bottom.

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:40.180
But in the 1980s, we
start seeing Brazilians

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:44.200
moving to Framingham
and, again, bringing

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.620
about a revitalization of
that old industrial part

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:49.100
of the community.

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.750
So there's a correlation
between the older immigrants

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:54.280
and the older industries
and the places

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.070
where new immigrants
are going, but not

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:57.861
because they're going
for those industries,

00:31:57.861 --> 00:32:02.660
but because the housing market
and the local commercial

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:05.700
infrastructure had
openings for them.

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:09.130
And they became
attractive places to go.

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:11.890
I got to watch my time here.

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:14.000
The other thing I talk
about in the book,

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.210
I talk about the history
of racism and nativism,

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:19.440
which is a long, involved topic.

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:22.160
I can talk about it a little
bit in question and answer.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:27.650
I look at religion and
churches and religious centers

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:29.170
that immigrants founded.

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:32.120
And I also look at
politics and the rise

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:35.510
of what I call the new ethnic
politics in the city of Boston.

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:42.120
I'll just use my
last few minutes here

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.580
to tell you a little
bit about what

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:46.760
I found with religion,
because this I've found

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.720
to be one of the most
fascinating parts of the story.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.690
The revitalisation
that I've discussed

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:56.320
was not only economic
and physical,

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:59.050
it was also cultural
and religious.

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:02.520
And I found that
immigrants, when

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:06.590
they settled in these city
neighborhoods or in suburbs,

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:09.070
they start a new
community organizations.

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:12.750
They start new churches,
new religious institutions.

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:16.460
So in my chapter called
"The Quiet Revival,"

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:19.000
I look at how
newcomers have helped

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.500
to revitalize
Christianity in the Boston

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:27.570
area, both Catholicism
and Protestantism.

00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:29.690
And both Protestant
and Catholic churches

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:35.250
since the 1960s, their
native born congregations

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:36.500
have been dwindling.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:39.260
At the same time, the
foreign born congregations

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:42.080
that are Christian have been
growing quite strikingly

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.950
as more immigrants came in.

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:46.680
So immigrants were
refilling the pews,

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:50.860
but they were also bringing
rather different practices

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:54.290
with them, cultural practices
from their homeland.

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:59.110
And this brings about what
sociologists of religion

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:02.940
refer to as the
de-Europeanization

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:05.030
of Christianity
and often a shift

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:09.120
to a more evangelical
and charismatic style

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.179
of religious practice.

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:14.820
So I look first at
the Catholic church,

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:17.760
then at the Protestant
churches, and this process

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:24.699
of church sharing which goes
on among both denominations.

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:26.560
And within the
Catholic church, you

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.350
had the development of
ethnic apostolates, which

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:32.380
are somewhat like the old
national parishes that

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:34.739
were formed for
immigrants in Boston

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:37.730
in the 19th and
early 20th centuries.

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:39.500
But they're somewhat different.

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.670
They're not new churches
that are being built,

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:44.650
which was the pattern
in the 19th century.

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:46.580
They're repurposing
older churches,

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:49.139
and often having
ethnic congregations

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:52.639
sharing those facilities
with native born groups.

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:55.449
And in some cases in,
say, a city like Chelsea,

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:58.130
where you have a very large
foreign born population,

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:00.870
you have a whole bunch
of ethnic apostolates,

00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:05.710
speaking different languages,
and different services, masses,

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:08.520
that are sharing
the same building.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:12.170
And so it's a very
multicultural mix of groups.

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:14.820
Protestants, they're
less top down.

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:19.840
It's a more improvisational
kind of pattern.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:23.140
But they, too, engage
in church sharing.

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.990
This is a church
that I end up talking

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:28.050
about a good bit at the
beginning of my religion

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:28.760
chapter.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.990
I became interested
in it because it's

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:33.350
three blocks from my house
in Brookline Village.

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:35.470
And when I moved
there 20 years ago,

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:38.090
it was the First Presbyterian
Church of Brookline,

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:42.410
and it looked like any other
Protestant church in the area.

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:46.670
And over time, I
noticed that there

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:49.030
were a lot of different
uses going on at the church,

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:50.930
different groups going there.

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:53.310
There was a daycare
center in the basement.

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:55.250
And then there
seemed to be other

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:57.540
groups and congregations
who were there,

00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:00.950
most notably a
Korean congregation.

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:04.090
And then a few years
later, pretty soon,

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:07.840
the old First Presbyterian
Church of Brookline comes down.

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.040
And the Korean Church
of Boston sign,

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:12.460
written in English
and Korean, goes up.

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:14.649
And I thought, well
there's a story here.

00:36:14.649 --> 00:36:16.190
I've got to find
out what it's about.

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.310
And I went and met some
people at the church.

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:24.960
And actually, it was their 50th
anniversary in 2003, I guess.

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.210
And so they had done
some writing about this.

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:32.670
And they were one of the oldest
Asian Christian congregations

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.650
in New England, and,
I think, certainly

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:36.800
the oldest Korean congregation.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:41.770
And I found out that they
had started as a prayer group

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:45.050
at Marsh Chapel at
BU back in the '50s.

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:47.090
And they had grown.

00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:49.550
They had students who were
coming from Harvard and MIT

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:50.950
and all local universities.

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:52.580
They would all go to BU.

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:55.950
And soon, they got a pastor.

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:58.790
They were able to get
space in a nearby church.

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:01.092
And they were in
Boston for a while.

00:37:01.092 --> 00:37:02.550
They were in
Cambridge for a while.

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:04.820
But eventually,
in the late 1960s,

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:06.370
they landed in
Brookline Village.

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:08.370
And they've been
there ever since.

00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:11.100
But as their congregation
grew very rapidly,

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:13.940
with a lot of Korean
students and professionals

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:16.890
moving into the area and
turning to the church

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:21.790
not only for religion, but for
all kinds of community support

00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:29.000
purposes and cultural
amenities, they

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.350
came to have a much
bigger congregation

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:33.740
than the native born one.

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:38.140
And back sometime
in the late 1990s,

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:41.820
they renegotiated to take over
stewardship of the building.

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:45.800
So the First Presbyterians
are still there.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:50.100
But now they're in the
basement, and they rent space

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:51.820
from the Korean
Church of Boston.

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:54.960
And I found that this
is a really common story

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.830
in many churches,
this church sharing,

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:00.100
and in some cases
actually a change

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:02.580
in the stewardship
of the building

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:06.787
over to the ethnic
congregations.

00:38:06.787 --> 00:38:08.870
And of course, this is
just one side of the story,

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:11.810
because there's also all
kinds of new world religions

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:15.940
that are brought in-- Buddhism,
Islam, Hinduism-- that

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:19.780
are building new religious
centers, both in the city

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:21.720
and especially in the suburbs.

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.870
They have a whole story
behind them, as well,

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:26.170
that's really fascinating.

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:31.930
And also, some resistance
to those new religious

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:34.987
institutions, particularly
among Muslims.

00:38:34.987 --> 00:38:36.570
And the best known
of this, of course,

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:43.200
is the Roxbury Mosque, which
had major protests around it

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.340
some years back when
they were first breaking

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:47.310
ground and building the mosque.

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:49.950
So I talk about that
story, and the rise

00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:53.980
of an interfaith movement
among churches here,

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:56.600
in churches and synagogues
here in New England,

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.630
that defended the
rights of immigrants

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:02.230
to build their
religious centers.

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:06.380
And I think that's been one of
the positive things that's come

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:10.060
out of some of those conflicts.

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:12.080
So I think I might--
no, you know what?

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:13.170
Let me say one more thing.

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:15.240
And then I'll open
it up to questions.

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.391
I've been emphasizing a
lot of the positive things

00:39:18.391 --> 00:39:19.890
about immigration,
and I think there

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:22.890
are a lot of positive things.

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:26.220
But there are challenges,
and the book talks about that

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:26.987
as well.

00:39:26.987 --> 00:39:28.570
And let me just
mention a few of them.

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:33.190
Nativism and racism,
of course, have

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:34.680
been a big problem
for immigrants,

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.560
as we're seeing in
the present moment

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.140
and has been true all along.

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:42.880
In the 1980s in the
Boston area, there

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.530
were some really
vicious incidents

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:50.140
of violence and racism against
southeast Asian refugees

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:53.040
who were moving into the
area after the Vietnam War.

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:57.517
And you had cases of murder,
of arson, of vandalism.

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:02.670
It was one of the worst
cities in the country for it.

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:04.450
In many ways, it
was a continuation

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:07.670
of the animosity of
the busing crisis,

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:12.560
but now turned toward
immigrants and refugees.

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:16.000
But something good did
grow out of that episode.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.920
And that was a kind of
organized political response

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:24.190
and community
response, which I call

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:26.126
the rise of multiculturalism.

00:40:26.126 --> 00:40:27.750
Multiculturalism is
one of those things

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:30.820
that just sort of happened.

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:33.650
I knew it came about sometime
in the late 20th century.

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:36.210
It wasn't a word that was
around much before then.

00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:38.600
So I learned in writing
this book that it actually

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:41.830
was very much a
product of the violence

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:45.610
and anti-immigrant sentiments
of the 1980s, which were so, so

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:47.820
strong, particularly
against Asians

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:52.040
in this part of the country
and also Latinos in California,

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:57.530
that really gave rise to
these well thought out efforts

00:40:57.530 --> 00:41:00.810
to educate people, to provide
services for newcomers,

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:04.870
and to create these sort
of multicultural movements

00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:08.340
and a whole ethos of
multiculturalism, which is

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:11.940
still hopefully with us today.

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:15.510
There are, of course, problems
with repression and deportation

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:18.050
that have been
growing since 9/11.

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:19.720
I talk a little bit about that.

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:23.240
But finally, I just want to get
back to the Boston issue, which

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:26.740
is we have this new economy.

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:30.370
Immigrants have been a big part
of building that new economy.

00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:34.200
But yet the fruits
of these changes

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.940
have not been equally shared.

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:39.360
There are many newcomers
that are doing well,

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.610
who have well-paying
jobs, have nice homes,

00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:44.990
live in the suburbs,
and are well integrated

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:48.750
into Massachusetts society.

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:51.470
But there are many others
who continue to struggle.

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:55.330
And some of the bigger issues
in our economy about growing

00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:58.500
income inequality, patterns
of contingent labor,

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:02.750
contract labor, entrenched
forms of racial segregation,

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:06.960
and most importantly for Boston,
the lack of affordable housing

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.760
and the growing costs
of higher education

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:13.710
are really, really critical
for everyone, but especially

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:14.400
for immigrants.

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.983
When we look at new
immigrants, and we

00:42:15.983 --> 00:42:20.330
say, oh, why aren't they doing
as well as the old immigrants?

00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:22.110
It's the classic thing.

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:23.614
The old immigrants were better.

00:42:23.614 --> 00:42:25.530
They pulled themselves
up by their bootstraps.

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:27.330
What's wrong with
the new immigrants?

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:30.860
Well, in fact, it's more
difficult to advance

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:33.650
your children up
the-- if you come in

00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:38.220
as an uneducated,
unskilled worker,

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:41.500
it's quite difficult, as the
rungs of the middle class

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:43.800
are eroding, to launch
your children up

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:49.190
into the upper
ranks of the economy

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:52.290
if you're dealing
with housing problems

00:42:52.290 --> 00:42:55.190
and you're being forced to
live in communities that have

00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:58.650
very poor education systems
and poor services generally,

00:42:58.650 --> 00:43:03.040
and if you can't afford
to go to college.

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.830
I work with mentoring Boston
public school students, many

00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:09.690
of them from abroad or
their parents from abroad,

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:13.090
and many of them are
very good students.

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:16.400
And they get offered admission
to a lot of local universities,

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.560
including my own.

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:21.420
But the financial aid packages
they often get would leave them

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:24.850
$120,000, $150,000 in debt.

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:28.380
That's not a good
alternative for most people.

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:30.470
And I think unless
we are really going

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:34.290
to expand our opportunities
for public education

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:36.670
at a reasonable
cost, we're not going

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:39.340
to be able to take full
advantage of the newcomers

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:42.230
and their children
coming up now.

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:43.390
So I will stop there.

00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:47.364
And I'd love to
hear your questions.

00:43:47.364 --> 00:43:49.825
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:51.685 --> 00:43:53.110
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned busing.

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:54.060
MARILYNN JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:55.518
AUDIENCE: I get
the impression that

00:43:55.518 --> 00:43:58.280
back in the '70s, that was a
pretty big driver of population

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.770
dynamics, obviously a reaction
to earlier immigration,

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:01.870
but then white flight.

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:04.270
And in some respects,
Boston is still

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:06.150
kind of recovering from that.

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:08.971
What's your take on
how that relates?

00:44:08.971 --> 00:44:10.346
MARILYNN JOHNSON:
To immigration?

00:44:10.346 --> 00:44:12.381
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:12.381 --> 00:44:12.880
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:15.206 --> 00:44:17.330
MARILYNN JOHNSON: I think
white flight is something

00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:20.170
that had been occurring
since World War II

00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:22.060
and since the early 1950s.

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:25.890
It had a lot to do with the
changes in the local property

00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:27.470
markets that were
really favoring

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:31.796
the suburbs as
highways were built.

00:44:31.796 --> 00:44:35.630
The structure of
mortgages really benefited

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:39.860
whites who would be moving
to new suburban housing.

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:41.650
So it's a longer term process.

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:45.550
And I think the busing
crisis aggravated it and made

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:47.930
a sort of dramatic
example of a moment

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:51.330
when particularly
Dorchester and Roxbury saw

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:54.850
a lot of native born
whites moving out to places

00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:59.600
like Quincy and other
South Shore suburbs.

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:07.865
But in terms of
immigrants, this was

00:45:07.865 --> 00:45:10.240
something that was really hard
for me to get a handle on,

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:13.980
because there is some research
going on about this right

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:17.280
now where they're interviewing
people who were my age,

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.110
who were kids during
the busing crisis,

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:21.630
including those who
were foreign born

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:25.910
or from Asian American
or Latino families.

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:28.800
And their experience
in that was kind of

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:35.100
unusual in that it
didn't really make sense

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:38.460
on either-- it was an issue that
was painted in black and white.

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:41.190
And immigrants were not really
factored into the equation,

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:45.090
because for one thing, we
had bilingual education

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:47.740
programs that had been
established in the 1970s.

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:49.120
And we're one of
the first states

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:51.440
to have bilingual education.

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:54.830
And so you needed
a critical mass

00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:57.300
of students who spoke a
particular language in order

00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:59.209
to be able to have
a bilingual program.

00:45:59.209 --> 00:46:01.000
So these communities,
immigrant communities

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.250
that worked really hard to
create bilingual programs,

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:08.330
are suddenly being dismantled
to send students who

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:09.960
are considered perhaps black.

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:12.000
But if they're Latino,
they might be white,

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.690
they might be black.

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:17.470
There were cases of students
from the same family,

00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:19.282
one child would be
sent to one school

00:46:19.282 --> 00:46:20.740
because they were
considered white,

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:22.781
and another child would
be sent to another school

00:46:22.781 --> 00:46:25.405
because they were darker
and considered black.

00:46:25.405 --> 00:46:26.780
And so there were
a lot of things

00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:28.570
that had to be worked
out around that

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:31.550
to preserve bilingual programs.

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:35.110
But I think it was a confusing
thing for a lot of immigrants.

00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:38.530
There were Haitians who
were walking down the street

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:44.340
and suddenly attacked by
white crowds in South Boston,

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:47.810
were fresh off the boat, had
no idea what was going on.

00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:50.350
So I think it was a
disorienting time.

00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:53.720
And we didn't really understand
how important immigrants were

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:58.390
becoming in taking into account
how the busing system was

00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:59.080
set up.

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:01.710
AUDIENCE: Could you compare
the political opportunities

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:04.610
for the 1910 group
of immigrants,

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:06.640
the Irish and the
Italians, et cetera,

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:09.217
compared to the immigrants that
are coming into Boston now?

00:47:09.217 --> 00:47:10.800
If you look at Boston
city government,

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.430
it still looks a little bit
more like the 1910 group

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:15.922
than it does like
the 2000 immigration.

00:47:15.922 --> 00:47:17.380
MARILYNN JOHNSON:
Well, it actually

00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:21.550
has changed considerably
in the last 15 years.

00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:23.400
It's been very slow to change.

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.360
And with the exception
of the Irish who,

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:29.130
because they spoke
English and they were

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:31.810
in very large numbers here
and a few other cities,

00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:35.390
were able to move into politics
very quickly, if you look

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:38.480
at other groups like
Italians and Jews,

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:42.907
it took them a couple of
generations to really move

00:47:42.907 --> 00:47:43.990
into the political system.

00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:47.490
The Irish tended
to control things.

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:49.130
Well, the Yankees
and the Irish tended

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:53.140
to control things pretty closely
in the early 20th century.

00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:56.240
So politics takes longer.

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.600
You can change the
political culture.

00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:01.790
You can change the
religious culture.

00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:04.340
And you can change the
workplace and neighborhoods.

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:07.700
But changing politics and
getting political power

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:08.760
takes a while.

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:13.680
Not everyone gets
citizenship right away.

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:16.230
The first generation continue
to have their loyalties

00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:17.040
to the homeland.

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.660
They might have dual
citizenship now.

00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:21.660
But they might be more
engaged with the homeland

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:23.000
than they are with
local politics.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.690
It's usually with
the second generation

00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:26.030
that that change comes.

00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:28.430
And that's what we're
starting to see now.

00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:30.440
We now have an Asian
American president

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:33.080
of the Boston City Council.

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:37.640
And so we've had both
Latinos and Asian Americans

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:40.540
in city government and state
government in high positions,

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:41.690
as well as Haitians.

00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:43.060
So it's starting to change.

00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:45.220
And of course, Boston is
a majority non-white city.

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:48.740
And I think that's driving
some of it as well.

00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:51.080
But political coalitions
have to be built.

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:55.070
No single group has
the electoral support,

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:57.990
like the Irish did, to sort
of just quickly elect people.

00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:01.104
And that takes time to
build those coalitions.

00:49:01.104 --> 00:49:02.645
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for coming today.

00:49:02.645 --> 00:49:03.070
MARILYNN JOHNSON: Sure.

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:04.736
AUDIENCE: To what
extent are the changes

00:49:04.736 --> 00:49:09.140
in Boston since 1965
representative of changes that

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:11.220
are happening in other
cities in the country,

00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:13.890
because the legislation is
affecting those cities as well?

00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:17.070
Or what aspects of this
are unique to Boston,

00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:20.040
whether it's the mix
of foreign to native

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:23.635
born or the high versus low
end of the service spectrum?

00:49:23.635 --> 00:49:25.010
What things are
unique to Boston?

00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:26.760
MARILYNN JOHNSON:
That's a great question.

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:29.540
And I think Boston is typical
of a lot of other cities,

00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:32.810
and particularly older
cities in the Northeast

00:49:32.810 --> 00:49:35.860
and to a lesser
extent, the Midwest.

00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:40.650
But a lot of parallels
between New York and Boston.

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:44.570
They have similar ethnic
mix, some similar patterns

00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:48.950
in terms of many of
the things I discussed.

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:52.420
Philadelphia has
similarities as well.

00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:56.860
I think this idea of
new wine in old bottles,

00:49:56.860 --> 00:50:00.320
if you will, as immigrants
came in and sort of took over,

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:02.690
inherited a sort of
older, rundown city

00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:06.500
and rebuilt it has been
happening across the country,

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:08.670
and particularly in
the older cities.

00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:11.410
It's happened in Midwestern
cities, some of which

00:50:11.410 --> 00:50:12.670
are quite depressed.

00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:15.644
And their leaders there are
anxious to get immigrants

00:50:15.644 --> 00:50:17.310
to come to their city,
hoping that there

00:50:17.310 --> 00:50:18.490
will be this renaissance.

00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:21.280
But of course, you have
to have an economy that

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:24.730
has the jobs to attract people
there in the first place.

00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:27.339
Immigrants can open all the
small businesses they want.

00:50:27.339 --> 00:50:28.880
But if people are
going to have money

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:31.030
to buy things in
those businesses,

00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:36.650
there has to be some real
economic development there.

00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:40.060
Now in terms of
differences, I think

00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:46.620
Boston obviously is on one
end of the knowledge economy

00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:48.650
spectrum.

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:51.760
Along with San Francisco
and New York and Seattle,

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:59.580
we probably have the most
high-tech, meds, engineering,

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:00.819
science-oriented.

00:51:00.819 --> 00:51:03.360
And a lot of that has to do with
the educational institutions

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:03.860
here.

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:05.530
And so we do have
a higher percentage

00:51:05.530 --> 00:51:10.680
of people, foreign born, in
these skilled, highly educated

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:11.990
professional positions.

00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:13.410
I think nationally,
it's something

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:15.290
like a quarter of immigrants.

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:17.360
Here in Boston,
it's more than 30%.

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:20.810
So it's significantly higher.

00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:23.360
What other differences?

00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:25.080
I'll see if I can
think of some more.

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:26.100
AUDIENCE: Just a quick question.

00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:27.058
MARILYNN JOHNSON: Sure.

00:51:27.058 --> 00:51:29.990
AUDIENCE: Certainly a lot of
the current political rhetoric

00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:33.205
centers on so-called
illegal-- I guess undocumented

00:51:33.205 --> 00:51:35.710
is the more proper word.

00:51:35.710 --> 00:51:41.090
In your data analysis
of the Boston area,

00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:42.720
what's your analysis?

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:45.110
Is there a statistically
significant number

00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:46.050
of undocumented?

00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:48.930
MARILYNN JOHNSON: It's
actually relatively low here.

00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:51.470
I think the most
recent estimates that

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:55.360
have been done for Massachusetts
are 1% of the foreign born

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:57.160
population is undocumented.

00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:59.080
There are places
closer to the border

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:01.350
where it's more like 6% or 7%.

00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:05.130
So relatively speaking,
it's pretty small here.

00:52:05.130 --> 00:52:09.070
Now in some groups, Central
Americans, for instance,

00:52:09.070 --> 00:52:13.330
those numbers are much
higher, Brazilians as well.

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:16.470
And you're much
more likely to find

00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:21.010
undocumented in certain
groups compared to others.

00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:24.720
And why that is, it may
be proximity to the border

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:26.300
is part of it.

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:30.281
But we don't have a
particularly large population.

00:52:30.281 --> 00:52:32.030
And I don't deal with
it much in the book.

00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:33.904
I deal with the problems
of the undocumented.

00:52:33.904 --> 00:52:36.540
But I don't really have
data, because frankly, it's

00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:37.750
all an estimate anyway.

00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:40.000
They go around and they
talk to different agencies

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.362
and make estimates based
on-- they have formulas

00:52:42.362 --> 00:52:44.320
for doing this, but it's
not like you can count

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:46.144
the undocumented population.

00:52:46.144 --> 00:52:47.310
STAVROS MACRAKIS: All right.

00:52:47.310 --> 00:52:48.110
Thanks again, Lynn.

00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:49.276
MARILYNN JOHNSON: Thank you.

00:52:49.276 --> 00:52:52.070
