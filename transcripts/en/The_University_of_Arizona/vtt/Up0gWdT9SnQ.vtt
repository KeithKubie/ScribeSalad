MAGGIE LINDSAY: What
gives me the opportunity

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.740
to grow my imagination,
I really like that.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.250
I like learning things about
the way the world works

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.040
and seeing how each
little piece is connected

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.360
to every other little piece,
to create this beautiful planet

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.109
that we live on.

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:22.900
SUNGGYE HONG: Visual
impairments should not

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.400
serve as the
barrier for students

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.330
who are blind or visually
impaired in choosing

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.560
their own path.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.510
So we came up with a
very capable team members

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.860
from the U of A and also
throughout the country, who

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.130
have been working and
specialized in this topic,

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.290
and put together
around two key words

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.380
project based learning
and mentorship.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.020
And this is a
three-year project that

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.364
is being funded by the
National Science Foundation.

00:00:57.364 --> 00:00:58.780
KATHRYN BUSBY:
This is a great way

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.610
to get students integrated
with each other,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.840
whether they are blind or
visually impaired or not.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.620
And I hope that they
take away acceptance

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.150
for each other, no matter what.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.120
I hope they take away the
fact that they can do science,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.670
because I think they may get
the message that they can't when

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.461
they totally, totally can.

00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:19.710
I hope they take away an
appreciation for the outdoors

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.330
and carry it forward
into their lives.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.700
MAGGIE LINDSAY: In some
ways you learn more

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.830
through not using your eyes.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.110
I think, because
the world we live in

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.220
is so visual, sighted people
tend to overlook those things,

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.290
just because they use
their eyes so much.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.510
So since I can't
use my eyes, I had

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.830
to find all the other
ways I could do it,

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.815
and I ended up learning
in some ways more.
