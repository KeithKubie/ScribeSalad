00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.040
Now I hope you take some time thinking about this

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.530
because the answer to the question is well, maybe. I mean

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.750
just knowing about one pair of twins doesn't tell you much

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.080
about the genetic contribution to handedness. Because they could have matched

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.640
simply by chance. And then you need data from a lot

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.760
more pairs of twins than just one set. And we need

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.220
data from dizygotic twins as well, to start getting a real

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.290
estimate of heritability. Remember the more pairs of twins you compare,

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.760
the more confidence you have that the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.200
heritability estimate is going to be accurate.
