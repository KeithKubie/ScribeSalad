00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.525
- Oh that is a,

00:00:01.525 --> 00:00:03.942
oh that piece keeps on going.

00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:12.827
(upbeat music)

00:00:15.362 --> 00:00:16.703
- Good morning everyone it's Mark Wiens

00:00:16.703 --> 00:00:19.204
with migrationology.com in Hong Kong.

00:00:19.204 --> 00:00:22.872
I just took the metro to Sham Shui Po

00:00:22.872 --> 00:00:25.968
and on our way to have a
quick breakfast this morning.

00:00:25.968 --> 00:00:28.551
(upbeat music)

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.252
(customers chatting)

00:00:39.878 --> 00:00:40.795
- Only one.

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:48.741
- [Mark] Scrambled egg
beef sandwich for one

00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:51.205
and then lemon tea and coffee.

00:00:51.205 --> 00:00:54.602
This is a classic and they serve a number

00:00:54.602 --> 00:00:56.915
of my tea has just arrived.

00:00:56.915 --> 00:00:58.894
It was just about a five minute walk

00:00:58.894 --> 00:01:01.834
from the metro station
and this place is famous

00:01:01.834 --> 00:01:04.705
for their breakfast
especially their sandwiches.

00:01:04.705 --> 00:01:07.587
So we came here to have
a tea and a sandwich

00:01:07.587 --> 00:01:10.435
and it's kind of right
within a market area

00:01:10.435 --> 00:01:13.347
and luckily there was a
table right in the back

00:01:13.347 --> 00:01:15.097
with available seats.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.654
My tea and sandwich came
out literally seconds

00:01:20.654 --> 00:01:23.297
after ordering and this
is one of my beverages

00:01:23.297 --> 00:01:25.825
of choice in Hong Kong
which is a lemon tea.

00:01:25.825 --> 00:01:27.864
I love how they just slice up,

00:01:27.864 --> 00:01:30.706
that's at least half
a lemon just sliced up

00:01:30.706 --> 00:01:33.165
and put into a cup of dark black tea,

00:01:33.165 --> 00:01:36.246
and what you do, if you really squish down

00:01:36.246 --> 00:01:40.518
that lemon, release
all of that lemon juice

00:01:40.518 --> 00:01:45.348
and that lemon peel, get all
of that goodness out of there

00:01:45.348 --> 00:01:46.907
into the tea and then I think a lot

00:01:46.907 --> 00:01:48.457
of people would add sugar to this,

00:01:48.457 --> 00:01:50.652
but I like it just black tea, no sugar,

00:01:50.652 --> 00:01:52.902
and just that strong lemon.

00:01:55.781 --> 00:01:57.892
(gasps)

00:01:57.892 --> 00:01:59.889
Oh that'll wake you up in the morning.

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:02.806
Oh that's sour, really really sour!

00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:05.695
It will almost make you squint

00:02:05.695 --> 00:02:08.331
and then it's really
strong black tea that,

00:02:08.331 --> 00:02:10.939
yeah, it's delicious and it's so soothing

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:12.106
on the throat.

00:02:13.353 --> 00:02:16.626
The main thing I came to eat
here though is the toasted beef

00:02:16.626 --> 00:02:19.538
and egg sandwich and again, this came out

00:02:19.538 --> 00:02:20.830
literally in like seconds.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.317
Let's take a look inside.

00:02:22.317 --> 00:02:26.106
I think it's like a oh, oh it
looks awesome on the inside.

00:02:26.106 --> 00:02:28.181
I wasn't expecting it to
look that good on the inside.

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:30.269
There's minced meat, there's egg in here,

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.379
and then just toasted bread.

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.379
Oh that looks fantastic.

00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:41.896
The beef is so tender and
then just coat it in egg

00:02:41.896 --> 00:02:44.979
and then with that white bread toast,

00:02:45.976 --> 00:02:48.619
it has maybe a sesame oil flavor to it.

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:53.196
That is a very good
delicious breakfast sandwich.

00:02:53.196 --> 00:02:56.946
And I think it goes
fantastic with lemon tea.

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:02.177
For my next half, I think I'm
gonna bump up the taste level

00:03:02.177 --> 00:03:04.414
by adding some of the chili oil to it,

00:03:04.414 --> 00:03:05.402
but it is really good.

00:03:05.402 --> 00:03:07.335
It's remarkably simple and good.

00:03:07.335 --> 00:03:08.658
This is the chili oil that's used

00:03:08.658 --> 00:03:10.175
for the noodles that they serve here,

00:03:10.175 --> 00:03:13.092
but I'm gonna take advantage of it.

00:03:17.676 --> 00:03:20.759
All right, I'll add maybe a bit more.

00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:40.683
The dried chili oil maybe

00:03:40.683 --> 00:03:42.467
and some kind of sesame oil or something.

00:03:42.467 --> 00:03:43.300
Mm!

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.918
That steps up the level
of flavor one more notch.

00:03:48.918 --> 00:03:50.022
I don't need too much oil

00:03:50.022 --> 00:03:52.567
but that dried chili is just stunning.

00:03:52.567 --> 00:03:55.694
You just add it to that bite there.

00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:57.175
I'm gonna put away the chili

00:03:57.175 --> 00:04:00.092
before I consume the entire bottle.

00:04:06.282 --> 00:04:09.699
This is like a five star omelet sandwich.

00:04:11.673 --> 00:04:13.408
Thank you, thank you.

00:04:13.408 --> 00:04:17.575
(people speaking in a foreign language)

00:04:20.122 --> 00:04:22.645
The tea was good, but
that beef egg sandwich

00:04:22.645 --> 00:04:25.844
was the real reason that it
was well worth coming here

00:04:25.844 --> 00:04:29.849
so simple but so good,
perfect amount of butter

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:31.511
and he whips up all the sandwiches

00:04:31.511 --> 00:04:33.782
and cups out the tee

00:04:33.782 --> 00:04:36.871
and the drinks from just
a little tiny like kitchen

00:04:36.871 --> 00:04:41.038
within the cafe and they
have been doing it since 1968

00:04:42.144 --> 00:04:45.096
and, yeah, just a classic
little cafe in Hong Kong

00:04:45.096 --> 00:04:47.628
and by the way they do
also have bowls of noodles

00:04:47.628 --> 00:04:50.365
and they have a pretty good selection

00:04:50.365 --> 00:04:53.000
of different dishes on
their menu but I just came

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.495
for that toasted beef and egg sandwich,

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:57.449
and I wasn't disappointed.

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.908
We are just walking
around this market area.

00:04:59.908 --> 00:05:01.868
There is a lot going on around here

00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:03.082
and a lot of fruits and vegetables.

00:05:03.082 --> 00:05:05.404
Ying is about to buy some more cherries.

00:05:05.404 --> 00:05:09.571
(women speaking in foreign language)

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:17.160
We are coming in here to
the fresh wet market now.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.668
That is a lot of meat

00:05:19.668 --> 00:05:24.374
and we're gonna just walk
around here for a little while.

00:05:24.374 --> 00:05:26.957
Oh there's seafood there's meat

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:31.716
and visiting fresh wet
markets along with eating

00:05:31.716 --> 00:05:33.907
is one of my favorite
things to do when I travel.

00:05:33.907 --> 00:05:36.490
(upbeat music)

00:05:41.176 --> 00:05:44.287
You can get any type
of food at this market

00:05:44.287 --> 00:05:46.936
and we just passed through
the meat and fish section,

00:05:46.936 --> 00:05:49.626
seafood section, and now moving on.

00:05:49.626 --> 00:05:52.577
Well lot's of tofu and
preserved vegetables

00:05:52.577 --> 00:05:56.744
and moving on into more of
the fresh vegetable section.

00:05:58.377 --> 00:06:00.274
There's some stalls that
are so busy it's hard

00:06:00.274 --> 00:06:03.046
to even get a glimpse
of what they're selling.

00:06:03.046 --> 00:06:07.686
So many people are fighting
to get the fish and the meat.

00:06:07.686 --> 00:06:10.269
(upbeat music)

00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:18.887
It's starting to drizzle
again this morning.

00:06:18.887 --> 00:06:22.448
It's been very rainy so
far this trip to Hong Kong

00:06:22.448 --> 00:06:25.253
but it doesn't look like it's
gonna rain too much today.

00:06:25.253 --> 00:06:28.836
We are walking over to a
place now to eat noodles.

00:06:28.836 --> 00:06:30.618
I don't know a whole lot
about this restaurant

00:06:30.618 --> 00:06:32.469
but when I was doing research

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:34.863
for where to eat won ton noodles,

00:06:34.863 --> 00:06:37.877
I came across this place
and what I like about it

00:06:37.877 --> 00:06:41.843
is that they still made the
noodles using a bamboo pole

00:06:41.843 --> 00:06:44.995
to press the dough, and so I'm hoping

00:06:44.995 --> 00:06:47.414
that I'm gonna get a chance to
see them making the noodles,

00:06:47.414 --> 00:06:51.497
not fully sure but gonna
go check it out and see.

00:06:53.447 --> 00:06:58.080
(men speaking in foreign language)

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.739
We made it to the restaurant
just as they opened

00:07:00.739 --> 00:07:02.681
and this restaurant has
an interesting story.

00:07:02.681 --> 00:07:05.846
It's actually a newly
opened restaurant in 2010,

00:07:05.846 --> 00:07:09.418
but the owner got his recipe
for making the noodles

00:07:09.418 --> 00:07:12.133
from his grandfather who had a restaurant

00:07:12.133 --> 00:07:15.998
or a shop in Macau and made
the traditional style noodles

00:07:15.998 --> 00:07:19.531
and kneaded the dough with a bamboo pole

00:07:19.531 --> 00:07:21.869
and so they still make the
noodles the traditional way here

00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:24.336
and unfortunately, I don't
think I'm gonna have a chance

00:07:24.336 --> 00:07:25.794
to see them making the noodles,

00:07:25.794 --> 00:07:26.995
but they have a room in the front

00:07:26.995 --> 00:07:28.263
you can see the bamboo poles.

00:07:28.263 --> 00:07:31.099
So when they still need to make noodles,

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:32.637
they still make them that way,

00:07:32.637 --> 00:07:34.238
and so I'll have a
chance to try the noodles

00:07:34.238 --> 00:07:36.348
but maybe not see them being made.

00:07:36.348 --> 00:07:39.029
Ying and I got two
different dishes to share

00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:40.945
and they have come out.

00:07:40.945 --> 00:07:45.073
They look fantastic and these
are bamboo kneaded noodles.

00:07:45.073 --> 00:07:47.798
This is the classic bowl of
won ton on noodles with soup

00:07:47.798 --> 00:07:49.446
and shrimp dumpling.

00:07:49.446 --> 00:07:52.360
Let me just taste the broth first.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.067
(slurps)

00:07:55.067 --> 00:07:55.900
Mm!

00:07:57.771 --> 00:08:00.298
Oh that is a richly flavorful broth.

00:08:00.298 --> 00:08:03.026
I think it's fish based broth

00:08:03.026 --> 00:08:05.950
and then you can taste
kind of like the flower

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.203
of the noodles within there are well.

00:08:08.203 --> 00:08:11.382
Grab chop sticks and
before doing any seasoning,

00:08:11.382 --> 00:08:14.242
I just gotta taste those noodles.

00:08:14.242 --> 00:08:17.448
And this is very light and
you can just see the beauty

00:08:17.448 --> 00:08:18.886
of these noodles.

00:08:18.886 --> 00:08:22.633
Yeah, look at that
individual-ness of the...

00:08:22.633 --> 00:08:23.936
(laughs)

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:25.102
Okay, I don't know if that made any sense,

00:08:25.102 --> 00:08:26.935
but they do look good.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:34.456
Mm!

00:08:34.456 --> 00:08:37.279
It has like a little bit of
a rubbery texture to them

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:40.884
but then at the same time
they chew very easily

00:08:40.884 --> 00:08:44.082
and just sort of like almost
dissolve in your mouth.

00:08:44.082 --> 00:08:45.098
Mm!

00:08:45.098 --> 00:08:49.142
It's awesome, like a
slight rubbery al dente,

00:08:49.142 --> 00:08:53.309
not really al dente more of
like a very tiny elasticity

00:08:55.533 --> 00:08:57.043
like almost like your
chewing on a rubber band,

00:08:57.043 --> 00:08:59.123
but then it just breaks.

00:08:59.123 --> 00:09:02.040
Probably go for one of the won ton.

00:09:07.673 --> 00:09:08.506
Mm!

00:09:09.487 --> 00:09:10.886
Filled with shrimp!

00:09:10.886 --> 00:09:12.286
Oh that's delicious.

00:09:12.286 --> 00:09:15.968
The owner said he used the
dry chili oil for the soup

00:09:15.968 --> 00:09:17.236
and then there's a different chili sauce

00:09:17.236 --> 00:09:18.449
for the other noodle.

00:09:18.449 --> 00:09:20.214
Okay let me add some of this chili.

00:09:20.214 --> 00:09:21.896
This is the dry chili oil.

00:09:21.896 --> 00:09:23.558
Oh this looks fantastic.

00:09:23.558 --> 00:09:26.225
Oh and that smells just so good.

00:09:27.231 --> 00:09:29.885
I'll just add a little bit to start with.

00:09:29.885 --> 00:09:34.052
(customers speaking in foreign language)

00:09:36.386 --> 00:09:38.636
Mix this around, oh oh yes.

00:09:49.731 --> 00:09:51.981
Follow that with some soup.

00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:54.102
Mm!

00:09:56.525 --> 00:09:58.621
That adds some nice heat to it

00:09:58.621 --> 00:10:03.372
and then I can feel that
chili oil down my throat.

00:10:03.372 --> 00:10:05.134
Oh that's a wonderful burn.

00:10:05.134 --> 00:10:07.717
The texture of those noodles is amazing.

00:10:07.717 --> 00:10:10.714
It really has a little
like rubbery factor to it,

00:10:10.714 --> 00:10:12.109
but it's fantastic.

00:10:12.109 --> 00:10:14.581
They're bouncy, that's what
they are, they're bouncy

00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:16.344
and this has probably gotten
a little bit dried out.

00:10:16.344 --> 00:10:17.797
These are like tossed noodles

00:10:17.797 --> 00:10:20.307
so I'm gonna re-toss them a little bit

00:10:20.307 --> 00:10:22.218
and this is with beef brisket.

00:10:22.218 --> 00:10:25.330
Oh, you can immediately
smell that like braised aroma

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.494
to that brisket.

00:10:27.494 --> 00:10:30.298
Now let me just taste
a few strands of noodle

00:10:30.298 --> 00:10:32.728
before adding anything again.

00:10:32.728 --> 00:10:35.895
There's just a very light sauce to it.

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:47.700
The bounciness and they
don't really have a strong

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.415
like starchy taste to them,

00:10:50.415 --> 00:10:51.616
and then he gave me
some of this chili sauce

00:10:51.616 --> 00:10:53.902
to add to these noodles he said.

00:10:53.902 --> 00:10:57.902
I'm gonna scoop it on,
or maybe wipe it all out.

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:07.528
I didn't want any of it to go to waste.

00:11:07.528 --> 00:11:09.945
All right, toss them up a bit

00:11:14.063 --> 00:11:15.984
and on the noodles, it's
just a very light glaze

00:11:15.984 --> 00:11:17.268
but I think it's some of the broth from

00:11:17.268 --> 00:11:19.768
that beef brisket has a beefy,

00:11:22.288 --> 00:11:24.871
a very light beefy taste to it.

00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:33.812
That chili sauce is a little bit sour

00:11:33.812 --> 00:11:38.606
and it has like an amazing
like almost nutty flavor to it.

00:11:38.606 --> 00:11:40.939
And it's a little bit spicy.

00:11:47.455 --> 00:11:50.038
Oh yeah, that is tender indeed,

00:11:50.984 --> 00:11:55.608
and it has that wonderful
like star anise flavor to it.

00:11:55.608 --> 00:11:57.191
It is, that's good.

00:11:58.168 --> 00:11:59.632
I'm really enjoying these noodles,

00:11:59.632 --> 00:12:01.335
but I really love this soup.

00:12:01.335 --> 00:12:03.261
Oh man it is so good.

00:12:03.261 --> 00:12:05.511
(slurping)

00:12:07.619 --> 00:12:10.544
(man speaking in foreign language)

00:12:10.544 --> 00:12:11.884
But normally it's every day.

00:12:11.884 --> 00:12:16.727
- Uh, not every day, maybe
three or four times a week.

00:12:16.727 --> 00:12:18.739
- Oh okay, but all of the noodles

00:12:18.739 --> 00:12:20.230
are made with the bamboo pole?

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:21.632
- Yes.

00:12:21.632 --> 00:12:23.631
- All right, thank you.

00:12:23.631 --> 00:12:26.554
Those were some serious
good quality noodles.

00:12:26.554 --> 00:12:29.242
I enjoyed that and I was
just talking with the owner,

00:12:29.242 --> 00:12:31.714
he said that all of the noodles
that you'll eat at the shop

00:12:31.714 --> 00:12:34.653
are all made with the
traditional way, using the bamboo

00:12:34.653 --> 00:12:37.331
to knead the dough, but if you come,

00:12:37.331 --> 00:12:40.096
he said about three or four times per week

00:12:40.096 --> 00:12:43.134
they make the noodles and
sometime in the afternoon.

00:12:43.134 --> 00:12:46.492
So if you are lucky not only
will you get to eat the noodles

00:12:46.492 --> 00:12:48.909
but also see them being made.

00:12:53.515 --> 00:12:56.129
And also I should just quickly
mention that the bamboo pole

00:12:56.129 --> 00:13:00.072
kneading method for noodles
is becoming very very rare.

00:13:00.072 --> 00:13:02.617
It is a traditional way to make noodles

00:13:02.617 --> 00:13:06.268
and it's very very hard to
find these days in Hong Kong.

00:13:06.268 --> 00:13:07.735
We're heading to the subway station

00:13:07.735 --> 00:13:10.966
and going down a couple stops to Mong Kok.

00:13:10.966 --> 00:13:13.716
(carefree music)

00:13:17.136 --> 00:13:19.848
This is one of the busiest
areas of Hong Kong,

00:13:19.848 --> 00:13:21.593
a big shopping area.

00:13:21.593 --> 00:13:25.462
The streets are just clogged
with signs and stores

00:13:25.462 --> 00:13:27.795
and lots and lots of people.

00:13:35.897 --> 00:13:37.769
One of the things that's
just crazy about this area

00:13:37.769 --> 00:13:40.139
of Hong Kong is the signage.

00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:42.560
There are so many
billboards and so many signs

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.869
and so many colorful bright lights

00:13:44.869 --> 00:13:47.451
and this is always a
busy area, you can shop

00:13:47.451 --> 00:13:51.144
for just about anything
you want around this area

00:13:51.144 --> 00:13:53.699
and also there are quite a few markets.

00:13:53.699 --> 00:13:56.116
Oh and what's coming up here?

00:13:58.094 --> 00:14:00.261
Some kind of a procession.

00:14:01.713 --> 00:14:03.963
(clanging)

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:10.170
This stretch of market is often referred

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:12.678
to as Ladies Market and you can find a lot

00:14:12.678 --> 00:14:15.350
of souvenirs within this lane

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:19.517
and then a lot of pretty
budget clothes and what else?

00:14:21.098 --> 00:14:25.048
Oh just rows and strips
of backpacks and handbags,

00:14:25.048 --> 00:14:28.965
t-shirts, some kids toys,
lots of random stuff,

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.134
but this is a huge market area.

00:14:33.134 --> 00:14:34.804
What I love most about this market is

00:14:34.804 --> 00:14:36.848
that it's almost like
you're in a slot canyon

00:14:36.848 --> 00:14:39.846
because there are sky
rise buildings are huge

00:14:39.846 --> 00:14:42.257
like towering condos on either side

00:14:42.257 --> 00:14:45.579
and then just this like
sprawling flea market

00:14:45.579 --> 00:14:47.934
within the center of the alley.

00:14:47.934 --> 00:14:50.517
(upbeat music)

00:14:55.556 --> 00:14:57.383
We didn't really have any shopping to do

00:14:57.383 --> 00:14:59.343
so we just wondered
around for a little bit

00:14:59.343 --> 00:15:01.027
and now we are heading,

00:15:01.027 --> 00:15:04.118
well we're walking along
Nathan Road to the bus stop

00:15:04.118 --> 00:15:07.847
and gonna take the bus a
little ways down the road

00:15:07.847 --> 00:15:09.680
towards Tsim Sha Tsui.

00:15:27.504 --> 00:15:29.708
We are heading towards Tsim Sha Tsui

00:15:29.708 --> 00:15:33.040
and I'm not sure if I got that
pronunciation quite right,

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.582
it's pretty tough to pronounce,

00:15:34.582 --> 00:15:38.332
but it's also a shortened
abbreviated as TST,

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:41.958
so I'm gonna call it TST,

00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:46.125
but it's the area of Kowloon
which is right at the harbor

00:15:47.455 --> 00:15:50.622
of right across from Hong Kong island.

00:16:07.605 --> 00:16:10.985
We just drove past the Chungking Mansions

00:16:10.985 --> 00:16:12.764
and we're not gonna stop there today

00:16:12.764 --> 00:16:15.462
but it is a huge international building

00:16:15.462 --> 00:16:17.653
and you can find people from all walks

00:16:17.653 --> 00:16:20.237
of life in that building
and it's an amazing building

00:16:20.237 --> 00:16:21.587
and I have good memories

00:16:21.587 --> 00:16:23.843
because on my first trip to Hong Kong,

00:16:23.843 --> 00:16:26.257
that must have been about eight years ago,

00:16:26.257 --> 00:16:30.424
maybe back in 2009 or 2010
or something like that,

00:16:32.243 --> 00:16:34.421
I stayed at the Chungking Mansions

00:16:34.421 --> 00:16:36.660
at a hostel within the Chungking Mansions

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.551
so I have some great memories there,

00:16:38.551 --> 00:16:40.694
it's a very interesting place.

00:16:40.694 --> 00:16:42.655
We just got off the bus at the promenade

00:16:42.655 --> 00:16:44.395
which is right on the harbor

00:16:44.395 --> 00:16:46.619
and overlooking Hong Kong island.

00:16:46.619 --> 00:16:49.705
This is the view of one of
the most recognizable skylines

00:16:49.705 --> 00:16:53.068
in the world and maybe one
of the ultimate skylines

00:16:53.068 --> 00:16:54.008
of the world.

00:16:54.008 --> 00:16:57.247
Unfortunately it is
pretty hazy today, though.

00:16:57.247 --> 00:17:00.080
(uplifting music)

00:17:12.341 --> 00:17:14.894
The view of Hong Kong
skyline is always nice

00:17:14.894 --> 00:17:16.972
and we actually might come back tonight

00:17:16.972 --> 00:17:19.182
cause they have a famous
light show in the evening.

00:17:19.182 --> 00:17:21.581
Still not sure if we'll make it or not,

00:17:21.581 --> 00:17:24.978
but we may but we are now
heading to the star ferry

00:17:24.978 --> 00:17:27.352
and we're gonna take the ferry across back

00:17:27.352 --> 00:17:28.406
to Hong Kong island.

00:17:28.406 --> 00:17:30.989
(upbeat music)

00:17:42.551 --> 00:17:44.446
Just going from Kowloon
to Hong Kong island,

00:17:44.446 --> 00:17:48.302
it's just a really short trip,
but enjoying some great views

00:17:48.302 --> 00:17:51.225
of Hong Kong island and also the harbor

00:17:51.225 --> 00:17:53.142
and giant cruise ships.

00:18:21.383 --> 00:18:23.767
We are gonna take the
metro now to North Point

00:18:23.767 --> 00:18:26.434
and on our way to go eat dinner.

00:18:31.281 --> 00:18:33.968
We arrived to North Point
station and the restaurant

00:18:33.968 --> 00:18:37.066
should just be a very short
walk up the street from here.

00:18:37.066 --> 00:18:39.763
The restaurant is within
the Java Road Market

00:18:39.763 --> 00:18:42.846
and I think it's on the second floor.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.727
(restaurant patrons speaking
in a foreign language)

00:19:01.638 --> 00:19:04.148
Made it to the restaurant,
it is on the second floor

00:19:04.148 --> 00:19:06.532
of the Java Road Market,

00:19:06.532 --> 00:19:08.786
and this restaurant is called Tung Po,

00:19:08.786 --> 00:19:10.567
and this is a huge dai pai dong,

00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:12.785
it is a local Hong Kong restaurant.

00:19:12.785 --> 00:19:16.318
Right now it actually just opened,

00:19:16.318 --> 00:19:18.937
so I wanted to come early
because I think it can be hard

00:19:18.937 --> 00:19:21.197
to get a table if you come
here right around dinner time

00:19:21.197 --> 00:19:22.397
so it's 5:30.

00:19:22.397 --> 00:19:25.020
There are only a couple tables occupied

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.811
but you can tell how they are prepared

00:19:27.811 --> 00:19:29.865
for the masses to come in here

00:19:29.865 --> 00:19:31.637
and just chow down and hang out.

00:19:31.637 --> 00:19:33.968
This is truly an amazing menu.

00:19:33.968 --> 00:19:36.255
There are so many different
dishes on the menu

00:19:36.255 --> 00:19:40.155
and there's also some really
interesting mixes of dishes.

00:19:40.155 --> 00:19:43.179
A lot of things have a Thai influence.

00:19:43.179 --> 00:19:46.716
It says Thai style and then
also Ying and I can hear some

00:19:46.716 --> 00:19:48.972
of the chefs speaking Thai

00:19:48.972 --> 00:19:50.720
so they have some Thai influence here

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.426
and then also some of the
dishes have, you know,

00:19:52.426 --> 00:19:54.355
Western influence, there's pasta dishes

00:19:54.355 --> 00:19:56.553
and also it's definitely worth mentioning

00:19:56.553 --> 00:20:01.056
that on the mention it says
all dishes do not use any MSG

00:20:01.056 --> 00:20:02.581
or chicken powder.

00:20:02.581 --> 00:20:04.129
Before the food comes
I'm gonna get started

00:20:04.129 --> 00:20:05.989
by rinsing off our dishes.

00:20:05.989 --> 00:20:07.818
You rinse your little bowls and spoons

00:20:07.818 --> 00:20:10.151
and chopsticks with hot tea.

00:20:14.168 --> 00:20:15.523
All right I think that's good,

00:20:15.523 --> 00:20:19.098
and just kind of make sure
everything gets rinsed off

00:20:19.098 --> 00:20:20.515
with the hot tea.

00:20:34.577 --> 00:20:36.043
And then also the chopsticks,

00:20:36.043 --> 00:20:38.067
and by the way this is our
order, this is what we ordered.

00:20:38.067 --> 00:20:42.457
He wrote it down and then
stuck it in the chopstick tin.

00:20:42.457 --> 00:20:44.707
(clanging)

00:20:47.654 --> 00:20:48.727
We got a table very close

00:20:48.727 --> 00:20:50.641
to the kitchen where they're
cooking all of the food

00:20:50.641 --> 00:20:55.201
and you can just continuously
hear those woks roaring.

00:20:55.201 --> 00:20:57.240
It sounds almost like a jet engine

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.747
they keep those fires so hot.

00:20:59.747 --> 00:21:01.529
Cooking, cooking the food here,

00:21:01.529 --> 00:21:03.284
these are gigantic razor clams

00:21:03.284 --> 00:21:06.372
and I think that they
have taken them in half

00:21:06.372 --> 00:21:10.205
and split them length
wise and then stir fried

00:21:11.194 --> 00:21:13.863
with bell peppers, there's onions in here,

00:21:13.863 --> 00:21:16.986
there are black beans and garlic.

00:21:16.986 --> 00:21:19.837
And it almost looks like squid.

00:21:19.837 --> 00:21:21.850
Wow, okay, I'm just gonna taste a piece

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:25.578
of that razor clam oh
that piece keeps on going.

00:21:25.578 --> 00:21:27.661
(laughs)

00:21:38.412 --> 00:21:39.995
Oh that is amazing.

00:21:42.412 --> 00:21:46.245
Oh that sauce, you can
really taste the onions

00:21:47.118 --> 00:21:49.589
and the bell pepper in there!

00:21:49.589 --> 00:21:52.410
And then that saltiness
from the black bean sauce

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:53.880
and then that razor clam,

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.346
it almost tastes like a
combination between squid

00:21:56.346 --> 00:21:59.596
and a scallop with a sweet tinge to it.

00:22:00.434 --> 00:22:03.006
Yeah, it's like a clam in different shape.

00:22:03.006 --> 00:22:04.339
It is wonderful.

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:10.838
The rest of the food has all arrived now.

00:22:10.838 --> 00:22:12.404
For rice I had to go for

00:22:12.404 --> 00:22:14.014
this is their specialty rice

00:22:14.014 --> 00:22:15.997
which is I think there's some kind

00:22:15.997 --> 00:22:18.463
of duck flavoring in the rice

00:22:18.463 --> 00:22:19.831
and then also with mushrooms

00:22:19.831 --> 00:22:22.112
and then steamed in a lotus sleeve.

00:22:22.112 --> 00:22:23.566
Let's take a look at it.

00:22:23.566 --> 00:22:26.847
Lift the lid, oh, lift the lid to this.

00:22:26.847 --> 00:22:29.170
Oh that looks awesome!

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:32.228
Oh it's packed full of I
think it's chicken as well.

00:22:32.228 --> 00:22:35.369
Chicken and lots and lots of
mushrooms in here as well.

00:22:35.369 --> 00:22:36.869
Oh and that aroma.

00:22:39.124 --> 00:22:41.624
Put some of this into my bowl.

00:22:52.298 --> 00:22:54.606
Oh this smells fantastic.

00:22:54.606 --> 00:22:55.952
Again, it's just embedded with

00:22:55.952 --> 00:22:58.535
that essence of the lotus leaf.

00:23:07.179 --> 00:23:11.007
It's really really hot, and really fluffy

00:23:11.007 --> 00:23:13.261
and it's not too salty you
can taste the fragrance

00:23:13.261 --> 00:23:17.184
of the lotus leaf and also
the mushrooms in there.

00:23:17.184 --> 00:23:19.598
And I think it does have a little bit

00:23:19.598 --> 00:23:22.657
of a duck fragrance as well.

00:23:22.657 --> 00:23:24.067
This a fried fish and I actually meant

00:23:24.067 --> 00:23:26.403
to order a steamed fish.

00:23:26.403 --> 00:23:28.160
So I think I ordered the wrong thing,

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.691
but anyway, this is what it came,

00:23:30.691 --> 00:23:32.795
it's a fried fish little like nuggets

00:23:32.795 --> 00:23:34.653
of fish deep fried,
there's ginger in here,

00:23:34.653 --> 00:23:37.710
there's green onions
and sauteed in some kind

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:39.127
of a glaze sauce.

00:23:46.278 --> 00:23:49.307
Yeah these are like deep
fried pieces of fish

00:23:49.307 --> 00:23:52.968
there's kind of a garlicky
tasting oyster sauce

00:23:52.968 --> 00:23:54.458
and also you can taste the fragrance

00:23:54.458 --> 00:23:56.458
of ginger on it as well.

00:23:59.508 --> 00:24:00.709
And then finally for a vegetable,

00:24:00.709 --> 00:24:02.988
I've got a plate of bok choy with garlic.

00:24:02.988 --> 00:24:04.665
I think it has both garlic sauce

00:24:04.665 --> 00:24:07.082
and then fried garlic on top.

00:24:08.547 --> 00:24:10.964
Let me set this into my bowl.

00:24:13.538 --> 00:24:16.684
That's just very light,
sauteed full of garlic

00:24:16.684 --> 00:24:18.887
and then yes it has both fresh garlic

00:24:18.887 --> 00:24:20.726
and then fried garlic sprinkled on top.

00:24:20.726 --> 00:24:23.202
So you've got double garlic on there.

00:24:23.202 --> 00:24:25.214
As I'm sitting here eating
the restaurant is starting

00:24:25.214 --> 00:24:28.296
to really fill up now and
even people are coming

00:24:28.296 --> 00:24:30.837
and they're having to turn away and wait

00:24:30.837 --> 00:24:32.677
because some of these tables I think all

00:24:32.677 --> 00:24:36.310
of the tables are reserved,
but now you've got more

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:39.033
of a dai pai dong Hong Kong atmosphere

00:24:39.033 --> 00:24:41.530
and the razor clams is
by far the best dish

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:43.350
and not only the actual
razor clams themselves

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:46.868
but the sauce, the black
beans and these onions.

00:24:46.868 --> 00:24:50.005
These onions are jut incredibly good.

00:24:50.005 --> 00:24:53.422
Let me get a good chopstick full of them.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.246
The onions are like half caramelized

00:25:00.246 --> 00:25:05.185
but they're still crisp
and then just coated in all

00:25:05.185 --> 00:25:09.447
of that black bean sauce, chilis in there,

00:25:09.447 --> 00:25:11.849
that sauce is amazing.

00:25:11.849 --> 00:25:12.725
And this is that type of restaurant

00:25:12.725 --> 00:25:13.870
that would be really good to go to

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:15.447
with a big group of people.

00:25:15.447 --> 00:25:18.617
If you come with 10 people
you can order 10 or 15 things

00:25:18.617 --> 00:25:20.447
off the menu and share
all the different dishes

00:25:20.447 --> 00:25:22.153
because the plates are really big

00:25:22.153 --> 00:25:24.412
and there's such a variety
of different dishes.

00:25:24.412 --> 00:25:27.425
I would've loved to try many more

00:25:27.425 --> 00:25:28.949
of those dishes on the menu,

00:25:28.949 --> 00:25:32.537
but just coming with two
people couldn't order too much

00:25:32.537 --> 00:25:34.551
but the food was good.

00:25:34.551 --> 00:25:36.561
On some previous visits to Kong Hong,

00:25:36.561 --> 00:25:38.451
I've been to some
restaurants like this as well

00:25:38.451 --> 00:25:40.955
where the service is pretty bad,

00:25:40.955 --> 00:25:43.171
or there's just zero service.

00:25:43.171 --> 00:25:45.690
But this restaurant they
actually have quite good service,

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:47.755
very good service, the
waiters are friendly

00:25:47.755 --> 00:25:50.208
and the staff are nice

00:25:50.208 --> 00:25:54.666
and so this is like the
perfect Hong Kong atmosphere

00:25:54.666 --> 00:25:56.249
and also with good service.

00:25:56.249 --> 00:25:58.999
(carefree music)

00:26:01.132 --> 00:26:02.540
From here we're going back to the subway

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.509
and I think we're gonna
head over to Kowloon

00:26:04.509 --> 00:26:08.676
because it is perfect time
to go see the light show.

00:26:15.058 --> 00:26:16.708
Made it back to Tsim Sha Tsui,

00:26:16.708 --> 00:26:19.458
and we are walking to the Harbor.

00:26:27.374 --> 00:26:29.500
I think we arrived here just in time

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.778
but every night they have a lights show

00:26:32.778 --> 00:26:34.669
that's coordinated with music

00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:38.039
and the lights shine across
on all of the buildings

00:26:38.039 --> 00:26:41.789
and so it is a major
attraction in Hong Kong.

00:26:48.196 --> 00:26:51.034
The skyline of Hong Kong
island is spectacular

00:26:51.034 --> 00:26:53.438
throughout the day but at
night it really comes alive

00:26:53.438 --> 00:26:55.105
with all the lights.

00:27:13.099 --> 00:27:14.786
When you come to Hong
Kong you definitely need

00:27:14.786 --> 00:27:17.218
to come here at night and see the skyline

00:27:17.218 --> 00:27:19.546
of Hong Kong all lit up with the lights,

00:27:19.546 --> 00:27:24.393
but honestly the actual show,
the like symphony of show

00:27:24.393 --> 00:27:25.850
wich is coordinated with music,

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:27.633
it's a little bit underwhelming.

00:27:27.633 --> 00:27:29.554
It's actually not really
that much different

00:27:29.554 --> 00:27:31.121
from the actual skyline how it looks,

00:27:31.121 --> 00:27:33.301
except it involves music coordinated

00:27:33.301 --> 00:27:36.108
with like some spot lights
coming from the top,

00:27:36.108 --> 00:27:38.680
but I think the real beauty
is just the actual skyline

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.742
at night anytime so that was a good way

00:27:41.742 --> 00:27:43.555
to end the day.

00:27:43.555 --> 00:27:45.191

00:27:55.299 --> 00:27:56.657
