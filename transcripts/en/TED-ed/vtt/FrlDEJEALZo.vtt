00:00:12.071 --> 00:00:16.040
Sunning themselves on rocks or waddling 
awkwardly across the beach,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.031
it’s easy to think of these immobile 
mammals less as sea lions,

00:00:20.031 --> 00:00:22.478
and more as sea house cats.

00:00:22.478 --> 00:00:25.002
But don’t be fooled by their 
beachside behavior.

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:29.284
Under the waves, sea lions are 
incredible endurance hunters.

00:00:29.284 --> 00:00:32.840
Hurtling around at speeds from 
4 to 18 miles an hour

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.706
and hunting for up to 30 hours at a time,

00:00:35.706 --> 00:00:39.011
these majestic mammals live 
up to their name.

00:00:39.011 --> 00:00:41.963
And thanks to a suite of 
physical adaptations,

00:00:41.963 --> 00:00:47.235
finely tuned over millions of years, 
they make for resourceful foragers.

00:00:47.235 --> 00:00:48.900
To find their favorite food,

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.542
sea lions hunt much deeper than 
many of their semi-aquatic peers.

00:00:53.542 --> 00:00:57.000
With some species diving to 
depths of nearly 400 meters,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.307
they’re able to cope with 
the mounting pressure

00:00:59.307 --> 00:01:04.379
by collapsing their pliable rib cage, 
and compressing a pair of springy lungs.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.151
This pushes air up through 
the smaller airways,

00:01:07.151 --> 00:01:11.298
collapsing rings of cartilage as 
oxygen travels out from the lungs,

00:01:11.298 --> 00:01:14.296
to be held in the larger, upper airways.

00:01:14.296 --> 00:01:18.514
Upon surfacing, this air will be 
used to re-inflate the lungs,

00:01:18.514 --> 00:01:22.825
but for now their heart slows 
down to preserve oxygen.

00:01:22.825 --> 00:01:26.657
Blood flow is redirected towards 
only the most essential organs

00:01:26.657 --> 00:01:29.109
like the heart, lungs, and brain,

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:33.316
which rely on reserve oxygen 
stored in blood and muscle.

00:01:33.316 --> 00:01:35.424
Once they arrive at their hunting ground,

00:01:35.424 --> 00:01:39.649
sea lions depend on their superior 
vision to find their prey.

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.531
Most mammal eyes have 
a structure called a lens–

00:01:42.531 --> 00:01:47.351
a transparent, convex structure whose 
shape refracts light to enable sight.

00:01:47.351 --> 00:01:52.295
In humans, this lens is curved to process 
light waves traveling through air.

00:01:52.295 --> 00:01:56.833
But sea lions need to see their 
best at hundreds of meters deep.

00:01:56.833 --> 00:02:01.773
To accommodate, their eyes have a much 
rounder lens to refract light underwater,

00:02:01.773 --> 00:02:03.851
as well as teardrop-shaped pupils

00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:07.380
which can expand to 25 times 
their original size.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.593
This lets in as much light as possible,

00:02:09.593 --> 00:02:14.330
helping them pinpoint their prey in 
even the dimmest conditions.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.892
But once they’ve closed in,

00:02:15.892 --> 00:02:21.352
they rely on something akin to a sixth 
sense to actually catch their meal.

00:02:21.352 --> 00:02:24.003
Their whiskers, or vibrissae,

00:02:24.003 --> 00:02:27.202
are composed of keratin 
and full of nerve fibers

00:02:27.202 --> 00:02:31.223
that run deep into the connective 
tissue of their face.

00:02:31.223 --> 00:02:34.956
Sea lions have full directional control 
over these whiskers,

00:02:34.956 --> 00:02:39.509
which can lie flat against their face, 
or stick out at a 90-degree angle.

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:40.812
When properly tuned,

00:02:40.812 --> 00:02:45.792
these whiskers can sense the slim trails 
of moving water fish leave in their wake.

00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:49.128
And they’re precise enough to let 
blindfolded sea lions

00:02:49.128 --> 00:02:54.318
tell the difference between objects less 
than two centimeters different in size.

00:02:54.318 --> 00:02:58.525
With these tools a healthy sea lion can
catch generous helpings of fish

00:02:58.525 --> 00:03:02.476
such as anchovy, mackerel, 
and squid on every outing.

00:03:02.476 --> 00:03:06.363
And with their exceptional memories, they 
can remember multiple hunting grounds,

00:03:06.363 --> 00:03:09.143
including those they haven’t 
visited in decades.

00:03:09.143 --> 00:03:13.307
This memory also extends to breeding 
territories and birthing areas,

00:03:13.307 --> 00:03:16.787
as well as which neighbors 
are friend and foe.

00:03:16.787 --> 00:03:20.779
There’s even evidence that sea lions 
can remember how to perform tasks

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:24.220
after 10 years with no 
practice in between,

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.972
letting them navigate old stomping 
grounds with ease.

00:03:27.972 --> 00:03:30.379
Yet despite these incredible adaptations,

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.966
there are changes unfolding 
in their habitats

00:03:32.966 --> 00:03:35.799
too rapidly for sea lions to handle.

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.944
As climate change warms the oceans, 
certain toxic algae species thrive.

00:03:40.944 --> 00:03:43.804
This algae is harmless to 
the fish who eat it,

00:03:43.804 --> 00:03:46.235
but for the sea lions which 
ingest those fish,

00:03:46.235 --> 00:03:50.517
the algae’s domoic acid can trigger 
seizures and brain damage.

00:03:50.517 --> 00:03:53.918
Changing ocean conditions keep 
this algae blooming year round,

00:03:53.918 --> 00:03:58.364
causing more and more sea lions 
to wash up on beaches.

00:03:58.364 --> 00:04:01.322
This tragic discovery is just one 
of the many ways

00:04:01.322 --> 00:04:04.089
the health of aquatic animal 
communities can help us

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:06.529
better understand Earth’s oceans.

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:08.680
These red flags help us take action

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.800
to protect ourselves and other 
maritime mammals.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.564
And the more we can learn about the 
changing ocean that sea lions inhabit,

00:04:15.564 --> 00:04:20.264
the better equipped we’ll be to help 
these clever creatures thrive.
