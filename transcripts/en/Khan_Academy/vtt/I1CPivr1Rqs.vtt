00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.500
Welcome back.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.510
So we're on problem number 15.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.210
Boy, this SAT can be tiring.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.790
I know you probably rolled your
eyes when I said that

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.060
because you're the one that
has to take it, not me.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.330
Anyway, number 15.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.730
The graph above shows-- and this
is on page 399-- shows

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.280
Alena's height in inches.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.820
So the graph looks like this.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.570
And then I'll draw the
rest. I don't have to

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.580
draw these fancy lines.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.470
You get the point.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.690
So this is her age.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:45.490
Let me do it at 6,
8, 10, and 12.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.070
And then when she's 6,
she is 45 inches.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.150
This is in inches.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.990
So at 6 she's at 45.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:01:00.060
At 8 she's at 50.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.830
At 10 she's at 55-- no, a little
less than-- well, this

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.320
is like-- on the graph
it looks like 55.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.740
And the way they draw it, it's
like a little bit lower than

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.840
55, so it's like a little bit
lower than 55 on the graph.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:25.800
And then at 12, she's
right at 60.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.500
And then they draw a line
connecting all of them so it

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.650
looks something like this.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.220
So the line looks like
this, like this.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.360
It's nothing fancy.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.540
And it says Alena's height at
age 12 was what percent

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.390
greater than a height
at age 6?

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.030
So when she is 12,
age, height.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.600
So at age 12, she's what?

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.910
At age 12, she's
60 centimeters.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:57.930
That's this point, right?

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.300
60.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.960
And at age 6 she's what?

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.100
45 centimeters, right?

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.669
Age 6, 45.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.750
So this question is really-- so
we've got to make sure that

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.400
we're reading right.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.220
Alena's height at the age of
12 was what percent greater

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.850
than her height at
the age of 6?

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.610
So they're really saying 60 is
what percent greater than 45?

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.690
And so I actually do this
all the time in my job.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.060
I work in a hedge fund.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.450
But this is what I
do all the time.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.220
And a really quick and dirty way
of doing this, you would

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.660
literally say, well, this is the
same thing as 60 divided

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.480
by 45 minus 1 to get you the
percentage, because-- well, I

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.930
don't want to confuse
you too much.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.820
But 60 divided by 45
will tell you what

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.750
percentage 60 is of 45.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.310
So 60 divided by 45 is what?

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.290
It's 1 and 15/45, or
1.333333, right?

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.720
I think you can confirm that.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.200
So that equals 1.333333.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:22.440
Or 60 is 133% of 45.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.640
We can make all of
these statements.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.860
60 over 45, that's a percent
that 60 is of 45.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.180
That's 1.333333.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.760
It keeps repeating, right?

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.340
Repeating.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.070
But they want to know what
percent greater than her

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.120
height at age 6.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.390
So 60 is 133% of 45.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:47.210
This is the same thing as
saying that 60 is 33%

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:53.420
greater than 45.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.380
Hopefully, you understand
what I'm saying.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.930
Saying one thing is 133% of
another thing is the same

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.650
thing as saying that this
first thing is 33%

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.890
greater than 45.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:13.690
Or we could say that saying
something 133% is equal to 33%

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.040
more than 100%, right?

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.400
More than 100.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.820
I hope I'm not confusing you.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.100
I try to do this in a couple of
different ways to help you

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.370
understand what 33%
greater means.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:35.120
If x is 33% greater than y,
that means x is 133% of y.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.520
So they want to know how much
greater is 60 than 45?

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.750
Well, it's 33% greater.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.983
And so the answer is C,
33 and 1/3, because

00:04:43.983 --> 00:04:45.950
it's a repeating 33.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.200
Next problem.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.100
This looks fun.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.486
So we have this cylinder
looking thing.

00:04:58.486 --> 00:05:02.720
Let's see how well I can
draw a cylinder.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.490
Well, my cylinder's going to
be a little tilted, but you

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.630
get the point.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.520
I should have drawn these
vertical lines first. This is

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.258
the cylinder.

00:05:15.258 --> 00:05:17.030
So that's the cylinder.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.500
And they're saying that on the
base of the cylinder, we have

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.720
this line x, or this
distance x.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.040
It goes to the center.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.390
It's essentially the center
of the cylinder.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.390
Let me draw it in a more muted
color to show that's it's in

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.640
the inside, and the height of
the cylinder goes to the top.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.680
They're essentially asking which
of the following-- and

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.020
they give you a bunch of
choices-- has the same volume

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.340
as the cylinder shown with
radius x and height to x?

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:58.690
So they're saying this is x,
that's x and this is 2x.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.000
So before figuring out which of
these choices has the same

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.110
volume as this thing, let's
figure out what the volume of

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.680
this thing is.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.050
Well, if you know the area of a
circle, you essentially know

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.140
the volume of a cylinder,
because it's really the area

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.510
of one-- you can kind of figure
out the area of this

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.450
base and then just multiply it
times the height, right?

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.000
Multiply it times this third
dimension of the height.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.360
So what's the area
of this base?

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.920
So volume is equal to area of
the base, which is pi times

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.150
the radius squared, so
that's pi x squared.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.460
And then we're going to multiply
that times the

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.830
height, times this, times 2x.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.540
So the volume of this is
equal to 2x times this.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.710
You get 2 pi x to the
third, right?

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.300
Because this is x to the first.
Add the exponents.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.990
So volume is 2 pi
x to the third.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.840
We know the volume
of our cylinder.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.370
So let's see what these
other choices are.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:06.120
So choice A says a cylinder with
radius 2x and height x.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.580
So radius is equal to 2x and
the height is equal to x.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.300
So what would this be?

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:21.250
The volume would be this squared
times pi times this

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.010
because we take the area of the
base, so the area of the

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.880
base would be what?

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:33.020
It would be pi times 2x squared,
and we multiply that

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.130
times the height.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.740
And this equals-- I can already
tell you this isn't

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.140
going to be right because
we've got a 4 in here.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.120
Oh, this is x, right?

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.410
The height is x.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:48.180
So this will get 4 pi x to the
third if you multiply it out,

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.050
so that's not it, B.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:58.710
A cylinder with radius 2 pi,
radius is equal to 2 pi x, and

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.650
height is equal to x.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:02.110
And I can already tell you this
is going to be it because

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:04.300
we're going to get something
with a pi squared in it

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:10.500
because if you take the area
of the base, you get-- the

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:18.340
volume will just be pi times
2 pi x squared times x.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.835
And we're going to get 4 pi
squared, and then you're going

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:23.410
to have another pi, and
it's 4 pi cubed.

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:25.800
It's not going to be the
same thing as this.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.080
Choice C.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.280
A cube with edge 2x.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.670
This is easy.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:35.429
If a cube has side 2x, it's
volume is just that side

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:36.789
cubed, right?

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:41.120
So volume would be 2x
to the third, and

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.130
that equals 8x cubed.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.350
That's definitely not right.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:47.600
D.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.730
A cube with edge 2 pi x.

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:53.420
So the same thing.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:57.220
The volume for this cube would
be 2 pi x to the third.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.100
And this is going to be what?

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.130
8 pi to the third,
x to the third.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:01.810
Once again, not right.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.860
So assuming I haven't done
anything wrong yet, it's

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.830
probably going to be choice
E, but let's confirm.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.460
Choice E.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.710
A rectangular solid with the
dimensions-- ah, see this

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:13.770
looks very suspicious.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:17.088
So let me draw the rectangular
solid.

00:09:17.088 --> 00:09:27.210
A rectangular solid with the
dimensions x, 2x and pi x.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.920
So we just multiply width times
height times depth.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:35.990
So x times 2x times pi x.

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:38.275
You would get 2 pi x cubed.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.230
And the answer is E.

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:47.420
Very good.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.490
And you could have done that
faster just kind of inspecting

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:50.880
some of these earlier ones.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.290
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
