is a lot of commemoration we thought it

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300
is a lot of commemoration we thought it
 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.660
is a lot of commemoration we thought it
would be good in this institution to

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670
would be good in this institution to
 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.880
would be good in this institution to
have the very firmly academic event also

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890
have the very firmly academic event also
 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.199
have the very firmly academic event also
and that is why we thought also it would

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209
and that is why we thought also it would
 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.790
and that is why we thought also it would
be a good idea to take a more

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800
be a good idea to take a more
 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.820
be a good idea to take a more
comprehensive view of the upheavals that

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830
comprehensive view of the upheavals that
 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.570
comprehensive view of the upheavals that
happened 50 years ago in that part of

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580
happened 50 years ago in that part of
 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.880
happened 50 years ago in that part of
Europe and we felt that it would be

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890
Europe and we felt that it would be
 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.670
Europe and we felt that it would be
appropriate therefore to start our first

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680
appropriate therefore to start our first
 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.940
appropriate therefore to start our first

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950
panel with the crush of speech and its
 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.600
panel with the crush of speech and its
impact and then and that is also an

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610
impact and then and that is also an
 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.520
impact and then and that is also an
intention not to keep the polish events

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530
intention not to keep the polish events
 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.440
intention not to keep the polish events
and the Hungarian events totally

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450
and the Hungarian events totally
 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.110
and the Hungarian events totally
separate which tends to happen quite

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120
separate which tends to happen quite
 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.319
separate which tends to happen quite
frequently these days rather to see

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329
frequently these days rather to see
 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.840
frequently these days rather to see
whether them we can also establish an

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850
whether them we can also establish an
 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.229
whether them we can also establish an
intellectual academic dialogue between

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239
intellectual academic dialogue between
 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.340
intellectual academic dialogue between
all the experts who are here and some of

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350
all the experts who are here and some of
 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.590
all the experts who are here and some of
them will know each other already but I

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600
them will know each other already but I
 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.600
them will know each other already but I
have a feeling that some others will

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610
have a feeling that some others will
 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.030
have a feeling that some others will
meet for the first time and my hope is

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040
meet for the first time and my hope is
 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.590
meet for the first time and my hope is
that indeed there will be further

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600
that indeed there will be further
 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.199

both in east-central europe but also
 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.500
both in east-central europe but also
across the Atlantic so that was one

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510
across the Atlantic so that was one
 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.170
across the Atlantic so that was one
consideration and the other one was that

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180
consideration and the other one was that
 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.449

we really also wanted to look not just

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459
we really also wanted to look not just
 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.560
we really also wanted to look not just
at the latest research that is now being

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570
at the latest research that is now being
 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.840
at the latest research that is now being
produced and a lot of it was not

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850
produced and a lot of it was not
 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.530
produced and a lot of it was not
available to many of us who do not

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540
available to many of us who do not
 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.459
available to many of us who do not
polish or russian or Hungarian so that

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:11.469
polish or russian or Hungarian so that
 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:14.339
polish or russian or Hungarian so that
we would learn about the latest research

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349
we would learn about the latest research
 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.620
we would learn about the latest research
that we were also hoping to look at the

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630
that we were also hoping to look at the
 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.979
that we were also hoping to look at the
long-term fall out the implications of

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989
long-term fall out the implications of
 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.490
long-term fall out the implications of
these events 50 years ago and that is

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500
these events 50 years ago and that is
 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.820
these events 50 years ago and that is
why we have this composition of panels

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830
why we have this composition of panels
 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.760
why we have this composition of panels
on each panel we do have also people who

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770
on each panel we do have also people who
 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.550
on each panel we do have also people who
will be looking at the consequences of

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560
will be looking at the consequences of
 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.670
will be looking at the consequences of
what happened and then as you will have

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680
what happened and then as you will have
 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.400
what happened and then as you will have
noticed also we thought it would be very

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410
noticed also we thought it would be very
 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.300
noticed also we thought it would be very
important to try to put the whole these

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310
important to try to put the whole these
 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.150
important to try to put the whole these
events into a global context at the end

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160
events into a global context at the end
 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.550
events into a global context at the end
of it and that is why we have tomorrow

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560
of it and that is why we have tomorrow
 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.749
