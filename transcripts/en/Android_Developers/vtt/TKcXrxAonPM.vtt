00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:05.866
[upbeat music]

00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:08.666
female narrator: Better data
drives better decisions,

00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:11.266
from improving engagement
to increasing your revenue.

00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.400
The Google Play
developer console

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.033
and Google Analytics can help
you turn your app data

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:17.733
into actionable insights.

00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.433
Here are ten things
you should be measuring

00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:21.166
that will help you build
more successful apps

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.566
and market them better.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.933
The user acquisition performance
report in the developer console

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:31.400
gives you a snapshot of how many
users visit your store listing

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.700
and install your app.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.666
You can also see the sources
they come from,

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.733
whether paid or organic.

00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:44.233
The user acquisition performance
report also includes buyer data

00:00:44.233 --> 00:00:47.300
so you can see which users
are going on to make purchases

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.600
in your app.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.133
You'll see where your most
valuable users come from

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:54.466
and can determine what affects
your installs from each channel,

00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:57.800
so you can better understand
where to focus your efforts.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.866
In the developer console's
financial reports,

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:08.133
you can see the average revenue
per paying user, ARPPU,

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.700
and understand
how you're generating income.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.900
You can experiment
with changes to your app

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.933
and see how
they affect this value.

00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:16.366
You can also review data

00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:19.133
that helps you understand
how users' spending patterns

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.966
in your app change over time.

00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:24.300
The metrics we've talked about
so far are all available

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.766
in the developer console.

00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:28.200
By implementing Google Analytics
in your app

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.333
and linking it
to the developer console,

00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.733
you'll unlock a huge amount
of valuable data

00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.333
you can analyze and use

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:38.233
to discover useful information,
such as...

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:43.466
User retention rates
are a great indicator

00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:45.900
of how well your app will do
long-term.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.300
Google Analytics active users
reports show

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.700
how active users remain
in your app,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.366
and you can then look
more deeply

00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:57.266
into how you are retaining users
with cohorts reports.

00:01:57.266 --> 00:01:59.866
As you identify
which users don't come back,

00:01:59.866 --> 00:02:02.166
you can devise tactics
to change that,

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:04.800
from app improvements
to push notifications

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.766
to reengagement ads.

00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:13.033
Your users' average session
duration

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:15.500
will give you an idea
of how sticky your app is.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.533
Longer session times
may indicate

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:19.533
users are more engaged
with your app

00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:21.633
and finding more value
in spending time in it.

00:02:21.633 --> 00:02:23.266
You can then compare this data

00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:25.166
to how often
users are returning.

00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:28.500
You may find they come back
frequently but for short spurts

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.700
or they use your app once in
a while but for a long period.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.666
You can now experiment
and measure how app changes

00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:38.533
impact on the pattern
of users' visits to your app.

00:02:43.566 --> 00:02:46.166
Google Analytics
behavior flow report

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:49.100
can show you which screens
users visit most

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.433
and how they move from screen
to screen within your app.

00:02:52.433 --> 00:02:55.900
Use this data to improve
and optimize the critical paths

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.033
in your app's user experience.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.800
Often, you'll have specific
things you want users to do,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.200
from signing up to a service

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.766
to making an in-app purchase,
for example.

00:03:08.766 --> 00:03:10.466
These are your conversions.

00:03:10.466 --> 00:03:13.300
Google Analytics
lets you define events

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.033
and the conversions
you want to track.

00:03:15.033 --> 00:03:17.333
By knowing how successful
each event is

00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:18.700
at driving conversions,

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.666
you can guide users
to the popular events.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.633
If your app sells
physical products or services,

00:03:29.633 --> 00:03:33.100
Google Analytics can help you
understand your sales better.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.000
E-commerce reports
and enhanced e-commerce

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.433
help you see
which products users buy,

00:03:38.433 --> 00:03:39.933
the average order size,

00:03:39.933 --> 00:03:43.800
and how long it takes users
to complete purchases.

00:03:47.266 --> 00:03:50.133
Analytics lets you track
the lifetime value

00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:52.566
of your users' transactions
in your app

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:54.766
by each marketing acquisition
channel.

00:03:54.766 --> 00:03:56.833
By understanding which channels
bring in

00:03:56.833 --> 00:03:58.400
your most valuable users,

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.633
you can adjust your
marketing spend accordingly.

00:04:01.633 --> 00:04:03.133
Using the amount that you earn

00:04:03.133 --> 00:04:06.033
over the lifetime of a user's
activity in your app,

00:04:06.033 --> 00:04:08.333
you can subtract
your per-user cost

00:04:08.333 --> 00:04:11.200
to calculate your return
on investment.

00:04:14.666 --> 00:04:16.600
From anonymized aggregate data,

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.233
understand the different
technology dimensions

00:04:19.233 --> 00:04:22.600
to your users,
including what devices they use,

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.400
what screen sizes are common,

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.233
and what operating system
version they're on.

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:29.633
This will help you optimize
your app design

00:04:29.633 --> 00:04:33.200
and test your app against
the right device configurations.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.800
The developer console
and Google Analytics

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.766
deliver you the data
and the means to analyze it

00:04:38.766 --> 00:04:41.766
so you can gain meaningful
comprehension of your business.

00:04:41.766 --> 00:04:43.766
