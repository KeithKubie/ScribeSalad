Today-- guys,
this is gonna upset you--

00:00:02.768 --> 00:00:06.305
today is Harry Potter's
37th birthday.

00:00:06.338 --> 00:00:09.542
-(groans) I know.
-Whoa!

00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:12.678
So-so, break... 'Cause it
just makes everyone feel old.

00:00:12.711 --> 00:00:14.680
But, hey, go ahead
and break out the Butterbeer

00:00:14.713 --> 00:00:15.982
or, if you're
a designated driver

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:17.350
or a teetotaler, like me,

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:20.319
then break out the I Can't
Believe It's Not Butterbeer!

00:00:20.352 --> 00:00:22.255
And because the end
of<i> The Deathly Hallows</i>

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:23.823
is set in September 2017,

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:25.858
this is how Harry
actually looks right now.

00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:27.160
This is how they look.

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:29.095
It's sort of like that sad,
late-30s guy you see

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:30.997
wandering the frozen food
section at Trader Joe's.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.265
That's what he looks like.

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:33.966
Just think about what his life
is like right now.

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:36.436
He's a 37-year-old dropout
who peaked in high school,

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.838
married his childhood sweetheart
and is trying to raise a family

00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:40.640
on the combined pay
of a government employee

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:42.909
and a newspaper reporter.

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:46.379
Voldemort couldn't kick his ass,
but time definitely did.

00:00:46.412 --> 00:00:48.881
He's just trying
to relive his...

00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:51.484
Yeah.

00:00:51.517 --> 00:00:53.286
So, with Harry Potter
pushing middle age,

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:55.922
what is a spell
a 37-year-old wizard would use?

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:57.924
-Yassir.
-An invisibility cloak

00:00:57.957 --> 00:00:59.892
to help him avoid
paying child support.

00:00:59.925 --> 00:01:02.295
-All right, points.
-What's up? Where we at?

00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:05.398
(laughter)

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:07.767
Chris D'Elia.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.735
Viagracadabra.

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:11.871
Yes, points. Very nice.

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:13.306
Yeah.

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:16.342
(cheering and applause)

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:19.278
I mean... that's kind of cute.

00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:21.347
The spell he would probably use
is Petrificus Totalus,

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.950
but that's fine.

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:25.785
Brian Posehn.

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:28.284
Hold my wand.
I had too much Patronus.
