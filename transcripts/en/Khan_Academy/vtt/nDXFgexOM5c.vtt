00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.465
- Let's think about the
limit of the square root

00:00:02.465 --> 00:00:05.430
of 100 + x - the square root of x,

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.890
as x approaches infinity and I encourage

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.120
you to pause this video and try to

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.886
figure this out on your own.

00:00:10.886 --> 00:00:13.450
So I'm assuming you've had a go at it.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.970
So first let's just try to think about it,

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.360
before we try to manipulate
this algebraically,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.670
in some way.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.960
So what happens is x

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.080
gets really really really really large,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.770
as x approaches,

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.800
as x approaches infinity.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.090
While even though this 100

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.480
is a reasonably

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.090
a reasonably large number,

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.280
as x gets really large,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.720
Billion, trillion, trillion trillions.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.730
Even larger than that.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.530
Trillion trillion trillion trillions.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.650
You could imagine that the 100,

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.680
under the radical sign,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.600
starts to matter a lot less.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.041
As x approaches really
really large numbers,

00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:46.910
the square root of 100 + x is going to be

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.247
approximately the same thing as the

00:00:49.247 --> 00:00:50.980
square root of x.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.190
So for

00:00:53.724 --> 00:00:55.570
really really

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.440
large large x's,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.440
we can reason that the square root

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.980
of 100 + x is going to be

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.840
approximately equal to

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.900
the square root of x

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.940
and so in that reality,

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.335
we are going to

00:01:10.335 --> 00:01:11.230
really really really large x's.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.290
In fact,

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.123
there's nothing larger,

00:01:13.123 --> 00:01:15.048
where you can keep increasing x's,

00:01:15.048 --> 00:01:17.270
then these two things are going to be

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.360
roughly equal to each other.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.311
So it's reasonable to believe,

00:01:21.311 --> 00:01:23.019
that the limit as x approaches

00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:24.550
infinity here,

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.740
is going to be zero.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.480
You're subtracting this,

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.350
from something that is

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.020
pretty similar to that,

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.920
but let's actually do

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.170
some algrebraic manipulation

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.680
to feel better about that,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.513
instead of this kind of

00:01:34.513 --> 00:01:36.010
hand-wavy argument about

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.560
the 100 not mattering as much,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.970
when x gets really really really large

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.360
and so let me re-write this expression.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.610
See if we can

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.910
manipulate it in interesting ways.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.030
So this is

00:01:49.252 --> 00:01:50.627
100 + x - x.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.890
So one thing that might jump out at you

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.670
whenever you see one radical,

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.130
minus another radical like this.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.540
Well maybe we can multiply

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.900
by its conjugate and somehow

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.130
get rid of the radicals,

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.000
or at least transform the

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.890
expression in some way,

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.190
that might be a little more useful

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.500
when we try to find the limit,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.350
as x approaches infinity.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.480
So let's just and obviously

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.450
we can't just multiply it

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.770
by anything arbitrary,

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.020
in order to not change the value

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.853
of this expression,

00:02:17.853 --> 00:02:19.730
we can only multiply it by one.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.690
So let's multiply it by a form of one,

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.440
but a form of one that helps us,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.890
that is essentially made
up of its conjugate.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.700
So let's multiply this

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.970
let's multiply this

00:02:30.532 --> 00:02:32.970
times the square root

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.516
of 100 + x

00:02:36.516 --> 00:02:39.370
+ the square root of x,

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.620
over the same thing.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.860
The square root of

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.327
100 + x

00:02:45.327 --> 00:02:48.130
+ the square root of x.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.963
Now notice this,

00:02:48.963 --> 00:02:51.550
of course is exactly equal to one

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.630
and the reason why we like

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.553
to multiply by conjugates,

00:02:53.553 --> 00:02:55.120
is that we can take advantage

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.740
of differences of squares.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.230
So this is going to be equal to

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.280
and our denominator,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.970
we're just going to have

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.675
we're just going to have the

00:03:02.675 --> 00:03:04.700
square root of 100.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.530
Let me write it this way actually.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.970
100 + x

00:03:10.037 --> 00:03:12.770
+ the square root of x

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.400
and our then our numberator,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.460
we have the square root

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.870
of 100 + x,

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.060
minus the square root of x

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.780
times this thing.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.470
Times square root of

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.170
100 + x +

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.130
the square root of x.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.300
Now right over here,

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.350
we're essentially multiplying

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.180
A + B times A - B,

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.720
will produce a difference of squares.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.791
So this is going to be equal to

00:03:41.791 --> 00:03:44.180
this top part right over here,

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.040
is going to be equal to

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.460
is going to be equal to

00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:49.686
this,

00:03:49.686 --> 00:03:50.902
let me do this in a different color.

00:03:50.902 --> 00:03:52.740
It's going to be equal to

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.230
this thing squared

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.700
minus,

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.140
minus,

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.420
this thing,

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.350
minus that thing squared.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.290
So what's 100 + x squared?

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.583
Well that's just 100 + x,

00:04:05.583 --> 00:04:07.850
100 + x

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.050
and then what square root

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.180
of x squared?

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.100
Well that's just going to be x.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.190
So minus x

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.230
and we do see that this

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.160
is starting to simplify nicely.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.290
All of that,

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.190
over the square root

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.747
of 100 + x

00:04:23.747 --> 00:04:25.880
+ the square root of x

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.050
and these x's

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.640
x - x will just be nothing

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.530
and so we are left with 100 over

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.790
the square root of 100 + x +

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.220
the square root of x.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.220
So we could re-write the original limit,

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.010
as the limit,

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.540
the limit as x approaches infinity.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.720
Instead of this,

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.400
we just algebraically manipulated it,

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.690
to be this.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.400
So the limit as x approaches infinity

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.240
of 100 over

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.580
the square root of

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.577
100 + x

00:04:54.577 --> 00:04:56.560
+ the square root of x

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.170
and now it becomes much clearer.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.980
We have a fixed numerator.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.060
This numerator just stays at 100,

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.770
but our denominator right over here,

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:04.603
is just going to be,

00:05:04.603 --> 00:05:06.060
it's just going to keep increasing.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.780
It's going to be unbounded.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.900
So if you're just
increasing this denominator,

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.089
while you keep the numerator fixed,

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:14.210
you essentially have a fixed numerator,

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.730
with an ever-increasing,

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.590
or a super large,

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.120
or an infinitely large denominator.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.200
So that is going to approach,

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.010
that is going to approach zero,

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.080
which is consistent with

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.793
our original intuition.
