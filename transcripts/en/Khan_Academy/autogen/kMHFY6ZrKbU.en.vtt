00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
 Let's look at some examples 

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.419
 from the exercises of Cannes Academy, 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.191
 to get used to different ways 

00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:06.705
 to collect numbers. 

00:00:06.705 --> 00:00:08.619
 The condition is, "Choose all ways, 

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:10.996
 which can be used to collect 78 and 9. 

00:00:10.996 --> 00:00:13.180
 Choose all applicable ways. " 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.444
 The first option is 77 plus 10. 

00:00:16.444 --> 00:00:18.284
 But does that make sense? 

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:21.104
 Instead of 78, a 1-digit number is written, 

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:22.962
 that is 77 and instead of 9 

00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:25.644
 a 1-digit number is written, say 10. 

00:00:25.644 --> 00:00:26.764
 So it makes sense. 

00:00:26.765 --> 00:00:30.844
 If you draw 1 unit of 78, but add that 1 unit to 9, 

00:00:30.844 --> 00:00:32.674
 you will get the same amount. 

00:00:32.674 --> 00:00:35.443
 This will be the same as 78 plus 9. 

00:00:35.443 --> 00:00:39.428
 Therefore, this is true, this is the correct answer. 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:41.142
 In fact, this is a good way, 

00:00:41.142 --> 00:00:43.200
 because it is easier to calculate. 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.806
 Because now you get 77 plus the nice circular number 10. 

00:00:47.806 --> 00:00:49.919
 And you will just increase the titles by 1 

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:51.415
 and will get 87. 

00:00:51.415 --> 00:00:54.423
 It's a little easier to calculate than that here. 

00:00:54.423 --> 00:00:57.143
 But what happened here? Collected 7 and 8. 

00:00:57.143 --> 00:01:00.854
 Why collect 7 tens plus 8 units? 

00:01:00.854 --> 00:01:04.744
 Here they looked at the figure 7 as 7 units, 

00:01:04.744 --> 00:01:06.430
 but that does not make sense. 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.474
 That is why I choose only the first opportunity. 

00:01:09.474 --> 00:01:13.117
 Let's take a few more examples. 

00:01:13.117 --> 00:01:16.932
 "Choose any way that can be used to collect 35 and 15. 

00:01:16.932 --> 00:01:18.872
 Choose all applicable ways. " 

00:01:18.872 --> 00:01:22.993
 Here are collected 35 plus 5 and then added 10, 

00:01:22.993 --> 00:01:26.405
 15 is decomposed to 5 and 10, 

00:01:26.406 --> 00:01:28.705
 which makes sense because 15 is 5 plus 10. 

00:01:28.705 --> 00:01:31.513
 And this is a good way, because here we get 40, 

00:01:31.513 --> 00:01:33.087
 which we can calculate in mind, 

00:01:33.087 --> 00:01:35.381
 and then add 10 to get 50. 

00:01:35.381 --> 00:01:37.754
 Yes, this is a good way. 

00:01:37.754 --> 00:01:40.202
 But what is going on here? 30 plus 20. 

00:01:40.202 --> 00:01:42.624
 Here, instead of 35, recorded 30, 

00:01:42.624 --> 00:01:44.357
 ie 5 units less. 

00:01:44.357 --> 00:01:47.526
 Then the second number is increased by 5 units. 

00:01:47.526 --> 00:01:49.780
 Taking 5 out of 35, you get 30. 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.120
 When you add 5 to 15, you get 20. 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.932
 Yes, it also makes sense and is also a good strategy, 

00:01:54.932 --> 00:01:57.774
 because 30 plus 20, that's 3 decades plus 2 tens, 

00:01:57.774 --> 00:01:59.957
 and is equal to 5 tenths, or 50. 

00:01:59.957 --> 00:02:01.923
 It's very easy to think. It happened when 

00:02:01.923 --> 00:02:05.993
 we took 5 units out of 35 and added them to 15. 

00:02:05.993 --> 00:02:07.723
 Indeed, there is a lot of logic in it. 

00:02:07.723 --> 00:02:10.672
 Let's figure out another example. 

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:14.625
 "Choose all the right ways to find the sum of 41 and 52. 

00:02:14.625 --> 00:02:16.395
 Choose all the right ways " 

00:02:16.395 --> 00:02:21.299
 Collect 40 plus 52 and then add 1 unit. 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.495
 Let's think, 41 plus 52. 

00:02:23.495 --> 00:02:26.180
 40 because we pulled out 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.638
 1 unit of 41 

00:02:28.638 --> 00:02:30.404
 and we will add it later. 

00:02:30.404 --> 00:02:32.202
 Number 52 is not changed, so 

00:02:32.202 --> 00:02:34.410
 41 plus 52 is the same as 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.587
 40 plus 52, plus 1. 

00:02:36.587 --> 00:02:38.495
 We just add that 1 unit later 

00:02:38.496 --> 00:02:39.936
 and that's easier because 

00:02:39.936 --> 00:02:42.176
 first collect only the decades, 

00:02:42.176 --> 00:02:46.300
 40 plus 52 is 92, and when you add 1, you get 93. 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.170
 Now let's see this opportunity. 43 plus 50. 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.750
 Note that 2 is added to 41 and 2 is subtracted from 50. 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.960
 Yes, that makes sense. 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.501
 Add 2 here and get it out of here, 

00:02:58.501 --> 00:03:00.320
 so that the same value will be obtained. 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.421
 We'll get 93 again. 

00:03:03.421 --> 00:03:05.371
 And this way is useful because it turns 

00:03:05.371 --> 00:03:08.331
 52 in a nice round 50 

00:03:08.331 --> 00:03:11.001
 by subtracting 2 units and adding them to 41, 

00:03:11.001 --> 00:03:15.001
 to give 43.
