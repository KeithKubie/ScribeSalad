00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:00.973
- What we're going to do

00:00:00.973 --> 00:00:05.630
in this video is start to
think about voting behavior,

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:06.760
and in particular,

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.470
we're going to start
classifying motivations

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.040
for why someone votes for
a particular candidate,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.990
and I'm going to introduce some terms

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.960
that will impress your
political science friends,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.440
but you'll see that they map two things

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.580
that we see every day or
even behaviors that we see

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.550
in ourselves in a pretty intuitive way.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.810
So one pretty clear reason
why someone might vote

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.660
for one candidate or another is

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.360
because of their political party,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.970
and so this would be referred
to as party-line voting.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.250
Party-line voting.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.010
So if your family has
always been a Republican,

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.100
and you're a Republican,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.200
and you just always support
the Republican candidate,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.760
that would be party-line voting.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.770
Now, another behavior

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.910
that political scientists will
often talk about is the idea

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.483
of rational choice.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.460
Rational choice,

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.360
and this is the idea that
someone would choose to vote

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.220
for one candidate or another
based on a perception

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.210
of which candidate is going
to benefit them the most,

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.350
which one would it be rational
for their own wellbeing.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.527
So for example, if you
said, "Hey, you know what?

00:01:18.527 --> 00:01:20.817
"I really care about
the corporate tax rate.

00:01:20.817 --> 00:01:22.487
"I'm the CEO of a corporation.

00:01:22.487 --> 00:01:24.767
"If my corporate tax rate were to go down,

00:01:24.767 --> 00:01:27.287
"then I would be able to have
a more thriving business,

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:30.357
"and I think one candidate
is going to do better for me

00:01:30.357 --> 00:01:31.857
"on the corporate tax rate,

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:33.880
"and I'm gonna vote for
them because of that,"

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.680
that would be your rational
choice, your model,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.360
what's driving your voting behaviors,

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.540
what's gonna benefit me.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.010
Now, another classification

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.740
that you will hear talked
about is retrospective voting.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.333
Retrospective,

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.740
and this is the idea that,

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.740
hey, I'm just gonna vote for someone

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.810
if it seems like they've
been doing a good job,

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.120
or if it seems like
things have been improving

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.220
under their watch.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.730
You're looking in retrospect,

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.487
and this will often be
for incumbents, and say,

00:02:04.487 --> 00:02:06.467
"Hey, look, yeah, the last
term was pretty good with them,

00:02:06.467 --> 00:02:08.950
"so I'm gonna vote for them again."

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.960
Now, the last classification
we will introduce

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.970
in this video is the opposite
of retrospective voting,

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.270
and this is looking into the
future, prospective voting.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.000
Prospective voting,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.587
and here, you might look
at one candidate and say,

00:02:24.587 --> 00:02:27.847
"Look, I think that they will
be better for the country

00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:30.540
"over the next four years."

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.750
You're not even necessarily thinking

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.410
about your own personal benefit.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.130
You're thinking about
the country as a whole,

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.280
but you're looking forward.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.820
You're looking prospectively
and thinking about, hey,

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.500
candidate A I think is
gonna do a better job,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.740
so I'm gonna vote for her.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.270
So with these classifications
out of the way,

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.310
let's look at some statements
that you might hear

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.160
from folks when they think
about who they are voting for.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.387
So here, it says,

00:02:53.387 --> 00:02:54.987
"The economy has been growing

00:02:54.987 --> 00:02:58.460
"under Clinton so he has my vote."

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.610
So pause this video,

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.403
and how would you classify
this motivation for voting?

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.760
Well, here, the person, the voter,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.640
is talking about the
economy in the recent past.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.880
So this right over here
is retrospective voting.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.240
So I'll draw a line right over there.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.970
That is retrospective voting.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.280
Clinton seems to have
been doing a good job,

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.585
where the economy's
been growing under him,

00:03:22.585 --> 00:03:26.143
so he has my vote.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.737
Now what about this statement?

00:03:29.737 --> 00:03:34.737
"I'm a lifelong Democrat
so Obama has my vote."

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.863
Pause this video.

00:03:35.863 --> 00:03:38.083
What type of voting behavior is that?

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.780
Well, here, the individual
is clearly motivated

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.930
by their party line.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.890
They're not talking about
Obama being good for them,

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:47.723
in particular.

00:03:47.723 --> 00:03:49.200
They're not talking about
what Obama's gonna do

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.200
in the future or what he's
done in the recent past.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.330
They're just talking about his party

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.360
and that being the motivation
for voting for him.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.040
So that would be party line voting.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.257
Now what about this statement?

00:04:01.257 --> 00:04:04.590
"Bush has ideas that will be
really good for this country

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.160
so I'm going to vote for him."

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.993
Pause this video.

00:04:06.993 --> 00:04:08.973
What type of voting behavior is that?

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.040
Well, here, the voter's
thinking prospectively,

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.870
thinking about, well, what
will Bush do for the country

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.220
in the near future, ideas
that will be really good

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.450
for this country?

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.590
So that is prospective voting,

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.410
and then one more example...

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.827
So if someone were to say,

00:04:30.827 --> 00:04:33.237
"I think Mitt Romney will lower my taxes

00:04:33.237 --> 00:04:36.080
"so I'm going to vote for
him," what would that be?

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.180
Pause the video again.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.220
Well, we have one choice left here,

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.000
and that is indeed rational choice.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.260
This voter is voting based on
what is going to benefit them.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.870
Mitt Romney's gonna lower their taxes,

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.490
so they're gonna vote for them,

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.820
and to be clear,

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.460
it's not that everyone's
behavior falls clearly

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.250
into one of these categories.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.650
It oftentimes will be a
mix of these categories.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.727
In fact, oftentimes someone might say,

00:05:00.727 --> 00:05:03.477
"Hey, I like Obama 'cause he's a Democrat,

00:05:03.477 --> 00:05:06.180
"and I think he's going
to be good for me,"

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.950
and things might've been good under him,

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.100
or the perception is that
things are good under him,

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.300
and they might believe

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.290
that it's gonna be good going forward.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.003
Many voters will be motivated
by a combination of these.
