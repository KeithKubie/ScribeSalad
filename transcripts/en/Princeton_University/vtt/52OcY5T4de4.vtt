ZOE SIMS: Living
and learning at Mpala

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.360
has shaped me in ways
that I never expected.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.570
I'm definitely at my happiest
when I'm outside in nature.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.310
I'm feeling like I'm really
part of the ecosystem where

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.309
I'm living, and
is something I've

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.670
come to really deeply value.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.170
My name is Zoe Sims.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.300
I'm a Princeton in
Africa fellow here

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.160
at Mpala Research
Centre in Kenya,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.850
and I'm a Princeton
alumna, Class of 2017.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.990
Princeton in Africa is
really about providing

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.320
leadership and professional
development opportunities.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.830
My role, as part of the
management team at Mpala,

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.950
involves connecting
and supporting

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.535
students with the management,
and also supporting

00:00:45.535 --> 00:00:48.560
our researchers here at
Mpala, and supporting

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.290
some of our outreach programs,
including the Northern Kenyan

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.725
Conservation Clubs Program.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.914
DAN RUBENSTEIN: Zoe came from
the ecology and evolutionary

00:00:58.914 --> 00:01:00.830
biology department at
Princeton, so I knew her

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.330
when she was a senior.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.090
She came here, immersed herself,
got to know all the faculty

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.070
members, got to know the staff.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.530
And I've watched
her grow and mature,

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.720
and she's now very
confident in her roles.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.540
We had a group come from
Ol Girgir, one of our schools,

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.070
one of our conservation clubs.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.040
Where they live, they
do not see zebras,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.740
they do not see dik-diks,
they do not see hartebeest,

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.390
they do not see elephants.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.440
And so when they come to
Mpala, it's amazing for them.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.470
So it fell to Zoe to blend
right into their school,

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.540
to blend in and work
with their teachers,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.691
and make it an amazing
experience for them.

00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:37.690
And when we heard them
over lunch talking about,

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.040
'I saw this, and I saw
that, and I saw this.'

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.020
It's clear that she has
done a terrific job.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.750
ZOE SIMS: As human beings,
we are part of our ecosystems

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.980
everywhere we are.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.170
I find that being here
at Mpala, in Kenya,

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.170
I'm more acutely
aware of that fact.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.470
Partly because I
wake up every morning

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.640
to the sound of guinea fowl
in the bushes outside my room.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.700
And many days I go
to sleep at night

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.950
to the sound of hyenas
in the distance,

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.530
calling to each other.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.140
All of these things are
just reminders that I

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.150
am part of nature.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.180
I've never gone to a new place
before and felt so quickly

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.950
at home, and so welcome
with such open arms.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.300
