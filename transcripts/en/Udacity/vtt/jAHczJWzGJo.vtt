00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.020
So it's important for you to recognize

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.270
that DNA never leaves the nucleus. It never

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.190
comes in direct contact with the machinery necessary

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.550
to build protiens, called roibosomes. And as a

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.080
solution of this problem there's an intermediate step

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.820
that involves a chemical cousin of DNA called

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:25.400
RNA. So although DNA never leaves the nucleus A copy is made, and this copy is

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.560
composed of a very closely related molecule called RNA. It's

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.330
kind of like taking a, a big book of recipes,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.010
or our big genome book here, and we're just xeroxing

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.770
a few pages that we're interested in, that'll help us

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.570
make the protein we need. Obviously, we don't need the

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.290
whole genome to make one protein. But there are sequences

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.520
of information that are necessary to make up individual proteins,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.510
and we just want to make copies of what we need, and

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.370
bring them out to the cytoplasm to read.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.460
This copying process must happen for every protein-coding gene.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.290
Any gene is going to produce a protein, including

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.360
the ABO gene. So for the ABO gene to

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.320
be turned into protein, we'll first make a

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.350
copy that'll be brought to the cytoplasm, and then

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.320
turned into protein. This basic process of making copies

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.920
of DNA, bringing it to the cytoplasm to make

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.740
protein, is so important to almost all lifeforms on

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.980
our planet, that we call it the Central Dogma. And

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.020
the Central Dogma takes on a very specific form

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.520
in these three words, organized in a certain order. They're

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.500
found up here, I just want to see if you

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.390
can plug them into the boxes in the right order.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.440
Blank to blank to blank is the Central Dogma. See

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.460
if you can figure out what belongs in each one.
