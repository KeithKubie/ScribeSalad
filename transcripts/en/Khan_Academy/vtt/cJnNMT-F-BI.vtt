00:00:00.817 --> 00:00:01.885
- [Voiceover] I thought
it would be interesting

00:00:01.885 --> 00:00:04.786
to get a little bit more
intuition on ellipses

00:00:04.786 --> 00:00:08.688
and their foci, or fo-si,
sometimes I like to

00:00:08.688 --> 00:00:12.657
call them focuses, but
the correct word is foci

00:00:12.657 --> 00:00:15.792
or fo-si, but either
pronunciation is apparently okay.

00:00:15.792 --> 00:00:16.606
So let's work with this.

00:00:16.606 --> 00:00:18.579
This is interactive
exercise on Khan Academy

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:19.578
as you see over here,

00:00:19.578 --> 00:00:20.994
so let's see if we can
work through this together

00:00:20.994 --> 00:00:23.200
and learn a little bit
more about ellipses.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.381
So they tell us the
equation of an ellipse is

00:00:26.381 --> 00:00:29.051
X minus X one squared over A squared

00:00:29.051 --> 00:00:32.464
plus Y minus one squared
over B squared equals one.

00:00:32.464 --> 00:00:33.555
And this is true.

00:00:33.555 --> 00:00:35.691
This is the equation of an ellipse.

00:00:35.691 --> 00:00:38.407
This would be an ellipse that
is centered at X equals X one,

00:00:38.407 --> 00:00:40.034
Y equals Y one.

00:00:40.034 --> 00:00:43.099
The major radius would be A,

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:45.630
the minor radius would be B.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.299
So then they say find the
foci of the ellipse bellow

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:51.295
by moving the orange points
to their correct positions.

00:00:51.295 --> 00:00:53.859
Then use that information
to find the values of

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:56.218
X one, Y one, A, and B.

00:00:56.218 --> 00:00:58.710
So they want us to move these
to the correct position,

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.218
the correct position is where
the sum of the distance,

00:01:01.218 --> 00:01:03.262
so if we move it to the correct position,

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:05.908
the sum of the length of that red line

00:01:05.908 --> 00:01:07.488
and the length of that green line

00:01:07.488 --> 00:01:09.137
should be constant.

00:01:09.137 --> 00:01:10.344
Now you can see, they're clearly not

00:01:10.344 --> 00:01:12.201
in the correct position right over here,

00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:14.408
because up here when I
was moving it around,

00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:16.590
you see that look, the
distance to focus one

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.866
from this point on the ellipse is 11.7,

00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:19.725
that's the green line.

00:01:19.725 --> 00:01:20.792
The distance to focus two is six.

00:01:20.792 --> 00:01:22.697
You add them together, it's 17.8.

00:01:22.697 --> 00:01:25.390
But when you move it around, that changes.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.595
And so, we would have to find,

00:01:27.595 --> 00:01:29.570
we would have to find a different,

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.938
we could just keep trying different foci

00:01:31.938 --> 00:01:34.724
until that sum of these, the red length

00:01:34.724 --> 00:01:36.443
and the green length is constant.

00:01:36.443 --> 00:01:38.927
Now in my mind, that
is a hard way to do it.

00:01:38.927 --> 00:01:40.877
An easier way to do it would be,

00:01:40.877 --> 00:01:45.149
well let's figure out the
center of the ellipse first,

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.424
which we could do just literally
by inspecting this drawing,

00:01:48.424 --> 00:01:51.187
and then figure out what the
length of the major radius

00:01:51.187 --> 00:01:52.394
and the minus radius is

00:01:52.394 --> 00:01:55.319
and then use that
information to find the foci.

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:56.736
So let's see if I can put these dots,

00:01:56.736 --> 00:01:58.570
let me put them first at the center.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.940
Alright, so let's see.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.007
So that's center,

00:02:02.007 --> 00:02:02.981
and let me,

00:02:02.981 --> 00:02:04.515
that looks pretty good,

00:02:04.515 --> 00:02:06.395
that looks like the center.

00:02:06.395 --> 00:02:07.881
And I can even confirm.

00:02:07.881 --> 00:02:10.412
So in the Y direction, that is

00:02:10.412 --> 00:02:13.408
if I'm at the top of the ellipse I am

00:02:13.408 --> 00:02:15.769
10 from that center and
if I'm at the bottom

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.555
of the ellipse, I'm 10 from that center.

00:02:19.555 --> 00:02:21.923
And so that does look like the center.

00:02:21.923 --> 00:02:26.071
And it also tells us, it tells us that the

00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:29.000
major radius is 10

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.991
and it's along the y-axis.

00:02:31.991 --> 00:02:36.566
So the major radius is 10
and it's along the y-axis.

00:02:36.566 --> 00:02:38.771
And we also know the Y
coordinate of the center,

00:02:38.771 --> 00:02:40.334
it's Y is equal to four.

00:02:40.977 --> 00:02:42.452
Y is equal to four.

00:02:42.452 --> 00:02:46.108
And then the X coordinate of
the center is X equals five.

00:02:47.436 --> 00:02:50.084
So once again, where
I put this orange dot,

00:02:50.084 --> 00:02:51.245
that is the center of the ellipse.

00:02:51.245 --> 00:02:54.705
It's at X equals five, Y equals four,

00:02:54.705 --> 00:02:56.353
and that's why I put X equals five,

00:02:56.353 --> 00:02:59.697
or X one equals five
and Y one equals four.

00:02:59.697 --> 00:03:02.855
And you see from the equation of ellipse,

00:03:02.855 --> 00:03:05.844
that's what defines the
center of the ellipse.

00:03:05.844 --> 00:03:08.723
And then A is going to be,

00:03:08.723 --> 00:03:09.930
A, we can see from here,

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.228
this is the radius in the X direction,

00:03:12.228 --> 00:03:13.412
I guess is one way to think about it.

00:03:13.412 --> 00:03:14.504
And that's gonna be the minor radius,

00:03:14.504 --> 00:03:15.665
it's the shorter radius.

00:03:15.665 --> 00:03:17.127
And you see that has length eight.

00:03:17.127 --> 00:03:19.845
we're going from X equals
five to X equals 13.

00:03:19.845 --> 00:03:24.094
Or X equals negative
three to X equals five.

00:03:24.094 --> 00:03:25.603
So it has a length eight.

00:03:25.603 --> 00:03:28.555
So this thing right over
here, A is going to be eight.

00:03:29.387 --> 00:03:30.698
So this is eight.

00:03:30.698 --> 00:03:31.672
And we already said,

00:03:31.672 --> 00:03:34.506
the major radius is going to
be in the vertical direction

00:03:34.506 --> 00:03:36.479
and it is of length 10.

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:37.687
So just like that we figured out

00:03:37.687 --> 00:03:39.195
we could write the equation down,

00:03:39.195 --> 00:03:40.822
I don't have my pen out,
but you could just say

00:03:40.822 --> 00:03:42.256
this is the equation,
this ellipse is gonna be

00:03:42.256 --> 00:03:46.852
X minus five squared over eight squared,

00:03:46.852 --> 00:03:50.638
plus Y minus four squared

00:03:50.638 --> 00:03:53.169
over 10 squared equals one.

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:54.190
But now let's actually figure out

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.746
where we need to put these,

00:03:55.746 --> 00:03:57.487
where we need to actually put these foci

00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:59.159
and then figure out that, hey look,

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:00.715
if we put them in the right place

00:04:00.715 --> 00:04:04.221
the sum of the red and
green lines is going to be,

00:04:04.221 --> 00:04:06.288
is going to be a constant.

00:04:06.288 --> 00:04:08.075
And clearly where they are
right now it's not a constant.

00:04:08.075 --> 00:04:11.204
You see that sum of the
distances is at 20.6

00:04:11.204 --> 00:04:14.572
and then it goes to 20 point,
it's clearly not constant.

00:04:14.572 --> 00:04:15.918
So let's see if we can do it.

00:04:15.918 --> 00:04:17.544
And one way to do it is just to remember,

00:04:17.544 --> 00:04:20.098
well there's a formula
and we talk about it,

00:04:20.098 --> 00:04:21.863
we explore the intuition behind it

00:04:21.863 --> 00:04:23.674
in a previous video,

00:04:23.674 --> 00:04:25.717
but the formula for the foci ellipse

00:04:25.717 --> 00:04:28.688
is you find the difference
between the larger

00:04:28.688 --> 00:04:30.570
of these two values and the smaller

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.940
of these two values.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.424
So in this case you'd find
the difference between

00:04:34.424 --> 00:04:36.979
10 squared and eight squared.

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:40.321
Well that's going to be 100 minus 64,

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:43.590
which is 36, and then you
take the square root of that.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.797
So it's going to be equal to six.

00:04:45.797 --> 00:04:48.676
So the focal length is
going to be equal to six.

00:04:48.676 --> 00:04:51.022
So if we go back to the center,

00:04:51.022 --> 00:04:52.810
if you go back to the center,

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.051
if we had figured out
our focal length is six,

00:04:55.051 --> 00:04:57.233
and remember, all I did is
I took the larger of these,

00:04:57.233 --> 00:04:58.812
I squared it, and from that I subtracted

00:04:58.812 --> 00:04:59.927
the other one squared.

00:04:59.927 --> 00:05:02.735
So 100 squared minus eight squared is,

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:05.383
is 100 minus 64 which is 36

00:05:05.383 --> 00:05:08.077
and I took the square
root of that to get six.

00:05:08.077 --> 00:05:12.140
So our focal length along
the major axis, I could say,

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.463
is going to be six.

00:05:13.463 --> 00:05:16.389
So it's going to be six from the center up

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:17.899
and six from the center down.

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:19.129
So six from the center up,

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:20.940
one, two, three,

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.123
four, five, six.

00:05:23.123 --> 00:05:24.794
And six from the center down,

00:05:24.794 --> 00:05:26.581
one, two, three,

00:05:26.581 --> 00:05:28.835
four, five, six.

00:05:28.835 --> 00:05:30.135
Now that's what the math tells us,

00:05:30.135 --> 00:05:32.480
but let's just make sure
that this actually holds.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.873
This actually holds.

00:05:33.873 --> 00:05:37.054
So now let's go to points on the ellipse

00:05:37.054 --> 00:05:39.817
and you see, it's calculating the distance

00:05:39.817 --> 00:05:42.139
to each of the foci,

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:45.390
and the length of the
lines are the distances,

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.736
and you see when you sum them up

00:05:46.736 --> 00:05:50.777
we are at a nice, constant 20,

00:05:50.777 --> 00:05:53.192
which is the really cool
thing about ellipses.

00:05:53.192 --> 00:05:55.003
That look, I can go anywhere around here

00:05:55.003 --> 00:05:56.670
and the sum of these two distances,

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.339
of the green and the
red line, their lengths,

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:00.478
is a constant 20.

00:06:00.478 --> 00:06:03.496
That's actually what defines an ellipse.

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:05.818
In fact, you can draw an
ellipse on a chalk board,

00:06:05.818 --> 00:06:08.442
you could draw this
ellipse on a chalk board.

00:06:08.442 --> 00:06:10.787
If you had a string of
say length 20 centimeters,

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:12.970
and you put one focus
there and one focus there

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.454
and you kind of put your
chalk in the string,

00:06:15.454 --> 00:06:17.196
and you just tried to move it around,

00:06:17.196 --> 00:06:19.634
and so it would look something,

00:06:19.634 --> 00:06:21.955
it would look something like that.

00:06:21.955 --> 00:06:24.620
Anyway, hopefully you
found that as fun as I did.
