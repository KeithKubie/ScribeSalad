[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.253 --> 00:00:05.170
MICKEY KATARIA: Hello.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.890
Good afternoon.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.540
My name is Mickey Kataria, and
welcome to the Android for Cars

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.633
session at Google I/O.

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:15.100
AUDIENCE: Woo-hoo!

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.780
MICKEY KATARIA: Thank you.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.640
It's hard for me to
believe that this is now

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.350
our sixth year at Google I/O
talking about Android and cars.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.050
Here is our first
time back in 2014,

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.080
when we unveiled the Android
Auto onstage at Moscone

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.180
in San Francisco.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.490
A fun fact from that
day, by the way,

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.770
the sled that we had up
on stage was actually

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.560
one of our first
test Kia Soul cars

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.550
that we transformed
specifically for that purpose.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.940
Rest assured, it's since found
a happy home in our team area,

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.880
where we still use it every
day for demos and testing.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.610
Even before Android Auto, our
investments and commitments

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.620
in the industry go back
almost 15 years at Google.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.459
We know that cars stay on
the road for a very long time

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:08.270
and are an important part
of people's daily lives.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.910
That's why over the
last decade, we've

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.580
continued to only
increase our investments

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.280
and broaden our partnerships
with the automotive industry,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.270
and we expect that trend to
continue for the coming decade

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.770
as well.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.020
One thing that's
remained constant

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.540
throughout all of those
years is our vision,

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.070
and that is to bring a safe and
seamless connected experience

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.160
into every car.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.010
A big part of making that
experience and this vision

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.180
a reality is to have a
consistent, reliable,

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.540
and extensible
platform like Android

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.810
that enables us to bring modern
services easily into the car.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.300
With Android as an
underlying platform,

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.200
we think we can seamlessly
connect the user's digital life

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.000
from outside of
the car to what's

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.220
happening inside of the car.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.350
What that means is the
same apps and services

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.250
that you use on your phones,
laptops, other smart devices--

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.710
those same apps and services
can be brought easily

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.700
into the car with Android as
a shared underlying platform.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.790
And if we do our
job well, we think

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.640
that the experience in the
car will be very personalized

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.950
and deeply integrated.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.530
I've personally had the
opportunity to build and shape

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.240
many of the in-car
products that we've

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.210
brought to market
over the years,

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.890
and they've gone through
three phases of investment.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.600
We started back in 2005, when
we first worked with Audi and VW

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.160
to bring Google Earth
into their cars.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.100
It's a great product.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.630
It's still on the road today,
many drivers still going

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.010
with it, but the challenge was
taking a desktop app-- a client

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.020
app like Google Earth--
and porting it to run

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.970
on a proprietary platform.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.790
That required a lot
of effort and we

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.580
found it virtually impossible
to keep the software up

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.710
to date over time.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.480
So we pivoted in our
second phase of investment

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.990
to a different approach.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.000
We started to open up
Cloud-based APIs, primarily

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.970
in Maps and local, so that
connected cars could pull

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.800
in specific features, like
Street View, as shown here,

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.980
and incorporate them and tie
them into the built-in car

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.470
navigation systems.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.220
You can see many of
these cars on the road

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.380
today, from partners like Tesla,
BMW, Mercedes, and many more.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.140
And while the API
approach meant that we

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.410
didn't have to port any
client software into cars,

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.810
what we didn't
anticipate was how

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.440
ubiquitous and common
smartphones would become over

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.060
that period of time--

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.790
so much so that drivers
were increasingly

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.630
turning to familiar and
intuitive applications

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.160
on their phones
even when they had

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.030
access to these in-car
advanced navigation systems.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.920
So finally, in our
third and most recent

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.780
phase of investment, and
what brings us here today,

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.660
we looked at the
phone strategy, and we

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.270
saw how important it was to have
an Android as a common platform

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.090
that could enable us and
developers everywhere

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.590
to bring services--

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.480
modern services--
easily into the car

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.880
and build great,
up-to-date experiences.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.700
And that is how we
started the effort

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.820
to bring Android into cars.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.850
One of the first investments
behind in-car products

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.610
is on the phone screen itself.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.460
With more than one
billion cars on the road

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.880
today, we know that the phone
is a part of many, many drives

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.660
already.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.050
And we want to do our part
to make that experience

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.480
safer as well.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.670
At the I/O keynote
this morning, you

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.790
heard about the Google
Assistant's driving mode.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.760
Here you see it displayed
in a dark theme.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.080
This driving mode is a new way
to use your phone in a safer

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.410
and helpful way in your car.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.110
This project brings
together the best

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.410
of designing for our driving
experience from several teams

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.480
across Google, including
the Android Auto team,

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.690
and it also represents
the next step

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.070
in evolution of the Android
Auto phone-screen experience.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.020
Stay tuned for
more details as we

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.590
migrate users from the Android
Auto phone-screen experience

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.830
to the Google Assistant
driving mode later this year.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.890
Beyond the phone screen,
we have two major products

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.840
for the car screen itself.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.950
The first is Android Auto,
which we unveiled in 2014,

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.960
and launched to
consumers in 2015.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.920
This has Android Auto
technology running on the phone

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.930
and integrating
with compatible cars

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.110
to bring your favorite
apps and services directly

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.180
to the car screen,
and then you can

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.580
interact with these apps and
services in a natural way,

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.160
using your car's touchscreen,
rotary controller,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.980
or otherwise.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.330
Meanwhile, all the software
is running on the phone.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.110
It's exciting for us to see that
since 2015, Android Auto has

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.720
become virtually an
industry standard.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.780
And it's also humbling for
us to see that consumers

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.270
will increasingly not
buy a new car if it

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.160
ships without Android Auto.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.280
The second major product
for the car screen

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.290
is the Android Automotive OS.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.320
This is Android
running in the car

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.340
as the embedded
infotainment platform,

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.240
and it powers a much deeper,
more seamless experience

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.960
for everything-- from
navigating with Google Maps,

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.100
to listening to
music with Spotify,

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.740
to controlling
vehicle functions,

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.380
like cabin or seat temperature.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.370
We can also enable
richer user experiences,

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.265
like showing
contextual visual maps,

00:06:51.265 --> 00:06:52.640
as you see in the
cluster display

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.790
here, as infotainment
itself expands

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.940
from being in one central
screen to multiple screens

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.540
and gets more deeply integrated
into the car as well.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.300
And unlike Android Auto,
your apps and services

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.160
are running on the
car, so it doesn't

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.810
matter what kind
of phone you have,

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.470
or even if you forgot
your phone at home.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.550
The name Android
Automotive OS, by the way,

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.730
is directed primarily
towards developers,

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.590
so that they know the
underlying platform

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.840
for which they're
developing their services

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.090
is based on Android.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.270
We think consumers are
more likely to notice

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.950
familiar brands that
they already use

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.100
on their smart devices, like
Google Maps, or iHeart Radio,

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.590
or Spotify, when they're
in the market looking

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.330
at one of these
cars that's powered

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.710
by Android under the hood.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.610
One of the questions
that we sometimes

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.310
get when we talk about these
two projects side by side

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:49.050
is, is Android Automotive OS
going to replace Android Auto?

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.730
The short answer is no.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.270
We think that both
products-- both experiences--

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:56.820
will continue to
grow for a long time,

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:01.650
and ultimately offer both
users and our OEM partners

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:05.233
a choice in what to
bring into the car.

00:08:05.233 --> 00:08:06.900
We also think that
the phone and the car

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.480
will actually work
together better over time

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.470
to create the best experience
possible for drivers

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.925
and passengers.

00:08:15.925 --> 00:08:17.550
You can see some of
that today already,

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:20.575
as cars rely on phones for
things like making phone calls.

00:08:20.575 --> 00:08:22.950
And we think that experience
will get better and tighter,

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:25.350
so that when you do have
your phone with you,

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.583
the entire experience
of the phone of the car,

00:08:27.583 --> 00:08:29.250
working together will
be truly seamless.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.750
So with that, I want
to focus on Android

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.789
Auto for a couple
of minutes and talk

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:38.770
about the fantastic
momentum that we've

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.970
been seeing over the last year.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.630
And I'll touch on how the
momentum is coming together

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.015
through growth,
hardware, and software.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.330
In terms of global
reach, Android Auto

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.480
is available today
in 36 markets.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.000
We added five more markets
in the last few months,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.920
and rest assured,
we know that there

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.750
are many more markets
to reach out there,

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:05.410
and we are working hard to get
into many, many more of those

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:06.480
in the coming months.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.590
On the partnership
front, Android Auto

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:15.850
is already available in more
than 500 car models from more

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.970
than 50 different brands.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:21.130
Earlier this year,
Toyota announced

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:24.100
that they will be shipping cars
with Android Auto from later

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.490
this year.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.210
We are very, very excited to
have them on board and working

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:33.570
together to reach
more and more drivers.

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:37.650
With Toyota onboard, nearly
every major global automotive

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.650
OEM is now shipping Android
Auto compatible cars,

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.290
and together, these
committed partners

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:47.350
represent more than
95% of the industry.

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:49.060
So thank you to our
amazing partners

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.110
for helping us bring this
fantastic, safe, and seamless

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:54.270
experience to every
driver on the road.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:02.960
Google I/O would, of course,
not exist without developers,

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.118
and we've already seen
fantastic momentum here,

00:10:05.118 --> 00:10:07.160
and it's one of the great
reasons for the success

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.180
of Android Auto.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.810
We're continuing to see many,
many more apps join the Android

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:15.000
Auto list of compatible
apps, and I just

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.490
want to highlight a few
notable names that have

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.800
appeared over the last year.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.380
With our launch
in South Korea, we

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:27.610
saw local media apps Bugs and
Melon support Android Auto,

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:31.560
and we also welcomed Apple
Music, YouTube Music,

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.340
and Google Podcasts to the
list of compatible apps.

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.380
Thank you to all the
amazing developers

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.350
for helping make Android Auto
such a fantastic experience

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.010
for drivers out there.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.620
We have a dedicated
session for you,

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.660
also tomorrow morning,
where we talk much more

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:50.220
about how to build and
adapt your app for cars.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:54.990
And we continue to invest
in making our platform

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:58.973
and enabling newer and
better experiences on top

00:10:58.973 --> 00:11:01.140
of the solid base that we've
already built together.

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:07.060
All of these great
partnerships and new markets

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.380
add up to one big number for us.

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:15.060
We are on track to have
Android Auto in more than 100

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.300
million cars in the next year.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.850
We are super proud and
excited to be able to get this

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:24.215
far with all of your support.

00:11:24.215 --> 00:11:25.590
As I've said in
the beginning, we

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:27.360
know that being in
automotive requires

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.260
a long-term commitment.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:33.330
So getting from our first car
in 2015 to our 100 millionth car

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:37.170
in 2020 hopefully shows you that
we are here for the long run.

00:11:41.395 --> 00:11:43.020
Switching to hardware
improvements that

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.730
are allowing us to
reach more drivers,

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.280
we recently launched
support for a touchpad

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.832
as an input mechanism.

00:11:48.832 --> 00:11:50.790
So if you have a car with
one of these devices,

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:56.590
you can now effortlessly
navigate the Android Auto UI.

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.630
We expect more of our
partners to be shipping

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.510
touchpad in their cars,
so enabling this now

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:05.530
lets us reach more drivers, and
more users, and the more cars

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.330
starting today.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.860
The wireless support, which
we announced last year,

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.330
has been an absolute
game changer

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:13.933
for how you use this product.

00:12:13.933 --> 00:12:15.600
You no longer have
to take the phone out

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.880
of your pocket or your
bag and plug it in.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.105
You can get in your car and
have Android Auto ready to go

00:12:22.105 --> 00:12:23.355
by the time you want to drive.

00:12:25.983 --> 00:12:27.900
We've already seen great
support from partners

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.330
like JVC, Kenwood,
and Pioneer, who

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:36.000
have been shipping aftermarket
head units over the last year.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.830
And if you are in the
market for a new car,

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:42.300
you'll be excited to know that
the first cars with the Android

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.090
Auto wireless support
built in will be shipping

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:46.830
before the end of this year.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.340
And switching to
software improvements,

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.410
we've hit some pretty
big milestones just

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:58.690
since last year, and I want to
highlight a couple of things.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.980
First, we launched a
new and improved UI

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:04.510
for browsing and
playback of media.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.940
Second, we launched support
for search in media apps,

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.600
so that a driver can
easily find the exact song

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.180
or podcast that
they're looking for.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.773
And third, we launched
and enabled support

00:13:17.773 --> 00:13:19.440
for group messaging,
so it's much easier

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.750
to stay in touch with
friends and family

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:26.640
when you're on the go with
a voice-powered experience.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.220
We also released
an update recently

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.430
for widescreens, where
Android Auto can now

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:35.360
offer a much better
seamless experience.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.820
For ultra widescreens,
as shown here,

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.680
it can also have Maps and
media running side by side,

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.000
allowing the driver to
accomplish more tasks easily,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.320
while keeping their
focus on the road.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.980
So beyond some of
these features,

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.430
We also continue
to invest deeply

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:56.530
in our core UI for Android Auto.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.620
Yesterday, we announced
some big design improvements

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.360
to the Android Auto
experience that

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.720
make it easier for consumers
to see and access the apps

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.280
and information that they want.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.032
So I'd like to
invite Ian Barlow,

00:14:08.032 --> 00:14:10.240
one of our lead designers,
who's been working on many

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.460
of these changes to come and
share some more about what

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.168
we're doing here.

00:14:13.168 --> 00:14:15.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:20.240
IAN BARLOW: Thanks, Mickey.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.820
We have a lot of really big
changes coming to Android Auto

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:26.310
soon, and I'm so excited
to show them to you today.

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:29.330
But before I do, I'd
like to talk a little bit

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.250
about how we got
to them, give you

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:34.720
a little bit of the backstory.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.150
As Mickey mentioned,
Android Auto

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:40.030
has really become
an industry standard

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.880
for automotive
infotainment experiences.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.600
People are actually basing their
new car purchase decisions on

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.610
whether the car
has Android Auto.

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.530
Well, that's amazing.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:53.710
But we also know that there's
still room for improvement.

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:56.230
And we haven't gotten
everything right along the way.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:59.590
We've heard from our users that
there are some core usability

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:01.780
problems with the
current system,

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.390
and it hasn't really been
updated in the last four years,

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:06.770
and it feels kind
of out of date.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:09.130
And so we've been
thinking about this a lot.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:12.550
How do we evolve the user
experience of the product

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.610
to feel more intuitive,
and how do we

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:18.770
elevate the design language
to feel more modern,

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:22.550
and like it's actually
made for the car?

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.000
Some of you may even
remember last year at I/O,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.440
we previewed some
of the concepts

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.330
that we've been working on.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.730
Well, today I'm going to
go into a lot more detail,

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:35.860
and show you specifically what's
coming next on Android Auto.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:39.430
We've completely overhauled
the design language,

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:42.190
we've built a system that's
more scalable and flexible and

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:45.240
adapts to more screen
sizes and inputs,

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.860
and we've refined a lot
of those usability issues,

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.950
and crafted an experience
that's much more intuitive

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.230
and feels like a
natural extension

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:55.960
of your phone in the car.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.930
So let's start with
the design language.

00:15:57.930 --> 00:15:59.980
For those of you who
use Android Auto,

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:03.160
you probably know it looks
like an earlier version,

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.840
like earlier material
design product.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.390
It has really
bright, poppy colors.

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:09.250
It has kind of a
lighter UI theme,

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:10.840
and it looks pretty cool.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:14.500
But it also doesn't really
fit that well in the car.

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.487
It looks a little
bit out of place.

00:16:16.487 --> 00:16:18.320
And so we've been
thinking about that a lot.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.100
And when we set out to
refine the design language,

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.470
we wanted to make something
that felt where seamlessly

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:25.415
integrated into the car.

00:16:25.415 --> 00:16:27.040
And so we drew a lot
of our inspiration

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.650
from automotive
interior design--

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:32.755
the dark color palettes,
the neutral themes,

00:16:32.755 --> 00:16:36.970
the sophisticated materials, the
way textures and accent colors

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:38.630
draw attention to
core functions--

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:41.080
but that the whole experience
is designed to sit back

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.950
and focus the drivers
attention on the road.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:46.210
And we took that inspiration,
and we combined it

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:50.080
with the best of material design
to craft an all-new Google

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.350
design language for driving,
a dark UI theme that

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:57.060
looks right at home in the car.

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.280
And so to do that,
we actually adapted

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.360
parts of material design.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.720
We took the gray values
that existed today,

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.930
and we expanded them to
create a richer spectrum

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:10.560
in the dark range that helped
us build a more flexible UI,

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:14.770
and something that looks
much more sophisticated.

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:17.589
We even refined the
material Accent Blue

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:20.470
to make sure that it
displayed properly in cars

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.630
and met contrast.

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:26.530
And we've also improved the
legibility of the system

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.660
by moving to a more
extended typefaces

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:32.350
like Robot Regular and
Medium and even Google Sans.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.150
We also layered that
into a type scale

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.930
that's easily glanceable and
adheres to our strict driver

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.790
distraction and
safety guidelines.

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:45.780
And so all of this coalesces
into a new visual system that

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:49.558
looks right at home in the
car, minimizes distraction,

00:17:49.558 --> 00:17:50.475
and it looks gorgeous.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:54.860
Now this new system
is also designed

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.030
to be much more
scalable, and designed

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:01.030
so that it can fit into
the wider, and larger,

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:04.130
and taller screens that
are coming into cars today.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:06.490
So the idea is you can plug
your phone into any car,

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:09.690
and it'll always be
recognizably Android Auto,

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.820
but it will always also make the
best possible use of the screen

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.750
that it's on.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:16.960
But as I was saying--

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:21.350
oh, sorry-- it also supports
voice and any other input

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.780
your car supports, whether
it has a touch-screen,

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.720
uses a rotary controller,
or as Mickey was mentioning,

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.560
uses a touchpad.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.780
But this redesign
went so much deeper

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:35.440
than aesthetics and
scalability alone.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.420
We've also made great
strides towards improving

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.670
the overall usability
of the system.

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:41.470
We've heard from
people today that it's

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:43.012
hard to switch media apps.

00:18:43.012 --> 00:18:45.220
When messages come in, they
don't know where they go.

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.273
It's hard to find.

00:18:46.273 --> 00:18:48.190
And that the whole system
feels like something

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:50.080
that has to be
learned, and doesn't

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.310
feel as intuitive as it could.

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:56.220
And so we asked ourselves,
how can we improve that?

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:59.430
How can we help people get
started faster on their drive?

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.530
How can we simplify
the kinds of key tasks

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.570
that people do while driving?

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:06.300
How do we provide the right
information at a glance,

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.950
and make it easier
for people to access

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.620
their content and
their apps, and create

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.960
a more intuitive
experience that feels more

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.880
like your phone in the car?

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.440
And so all of these things--

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.470
the new design language,
better scalability,

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:23.480
usability improvements--

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:27.390
are effectively the building
blocks of this new experience.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:28.937
And when you put
them all together,

00:19:28.937 --> 00:19:30.020
here's what it looks like.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:43.250
A brand new version
of Android Auto

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:46.990
that's easier to use than ever.

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:49.690
For drivers, it's
a gorgeous new UI

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:52.440
that provides the right
information at the right time,

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.090
and for developers, this
is an all-new system

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:56.590
that's going to
increase exposure

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:59.050
to your products in
the car, and also lays

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:03.850
the groundwork for
future innovation.

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:05.760
So let's take a closer look.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.090
First of all, we've completely
redesigned the navigation bar

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:12.750
to make it easier to access
your apps, your notifications,

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:14.370
and your Google Assistant.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:17.380
And it's quite a bit
simpler than it is today.

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:18.990
And we did this
partly so that we

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:21.720
could develop a new
kind of system widget

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.670
that lets you control
ongoing content while you're

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:26.670
in another app.

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.260
And so what that
means is, you could

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.830
be using Maps to navigate,
and still have one-tap access

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:35.950
to skip songs in your media
app, to skip back or forward

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:39.070
in your podcast or audio book.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:41.350
You can even control
an ongoing phone call,

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:45.620
all while keeping a full view
of your map on the screen.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.292
And if you do leave
Maps for a second,

00:20:47.292 --> 00:20:49.000
let's say to find
something new to listen

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.213
to, well, that
widget adapts itself,

00:20:51.213 --> 00:20:53.380
so you'll always see important
next-turn information

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.270
on screen.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.938
This is a really
powerful new feature,

00:20:57.938 --> 00:20:59.980
and it provides drivers
with the information they

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.140
need at exactly the right time.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.660
We've been driving around with
this for the last few months,

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.390
and I have to say it
is a game changer.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:10.210
Tasks that used to take
three or four taps in the car

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:12.943
can now be completed
with a single tap.

00:21:12.943 --> 00:21:14.610
And what's even better
is that if you're

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:17.970
a developer who already has a
media app that runs on Android

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:21.060
Auto, this new widget feature
will automatically work

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:23.047
with your app from day one.

00:21:23.047 --> 00:21:24.630
There is nothing
extra you need to do.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:30.180
We're also making it faster
and more intuitive for drivers

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:33.630
to access their favorite Android
Auto apps through this newly

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.578
redesigned launcher.

00:21:35.578 --> 00:21:37.620
This addresses another
one of those key usability

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:39.200
concerns I had
mentioned earlier,

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.700
where people have a hard time
finding the rest of their apps

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.160
in the system.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.510
And for developers, this
will also drive more usage

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:48.270
for your product because
they'll be displayed much more

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:51.490
prominently in the
Android Auto system.

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.872
So the launcher is great for
starting new experiences.

00:21:54.872 --> 00:21:56.330
But what about
responding to things

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.130
as they come into the car?

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:01.250
Well, the new Android Auto
still supports notifications

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:02.600
as it does today.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.780
You never miss out on a new
phone call as it comes in,

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:07.590
or a new message.

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:10.190
But what's more is
we've also moved these

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:13.130
into a new dedicated
Notification Center that's

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:16.770
always a single tap away
in the navigation bar.

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:19.217
So when you're driving,
you can focus on the road,

00:22:19.217 --> 00:22:21.050
and you won't have to
worry about responding

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:23.720
to that message right away
if it's not the right time,

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.790
because you can always
easily get back to it

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:26.670
with a single tap.

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:31.290
Now when this new
Android Auto system,

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:34.460
we're also still
leveraging the same APIs

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.250
for both notification-based
messaging apps,

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:41.090
as well as our templatized
media app experiences.

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:43.600
So again, if you're already
along for the journey with us

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.340
and you've developed an app
either in media or messaging

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.025
that works for
Android Auto today,

00:22:48.025 --> 00:22:49.400
there's nothing
new that you need

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.650
to do as part of
this new system.

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:53.890
Your app will still
work, and as you can see,

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:58.340
it will look great, like
it was made for the car.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:01.730
We are so excited about this
update for Android Auto.

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:05.690
It'll be available this summer
in all Android Auto-enabled

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:06.900
vehicles.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.770
But in the meantime, please make
sure to swing by our sandbox

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:11.720
for a demo in our Hyundai Kona.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.673
We'd love to show
you more about it.

00:23:13.673 --> 00:23:15.590
Now I'm going to hand
it back to Mickey, who's

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:17.720
going to tell you what else
we're doing to bring Android

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.260
into cars.

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:27.660
MICKEY KATARIA: Thank you, Ian.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.700
The new UI looks awesome
Please come check it out.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:35.250
And we cannot wait to share it
with you starting this summer.

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:38.070
I'd like to go back now just
for a second to our vision

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:41.280
statement and really
focus on the seamless part

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.800
of the statement.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.260
With a phone-powered
UI that's running side

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:50.500
by side with the built-in or
native experience in the car,

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.280
we see clear seams in
the user experience,

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.850
where our driver has the switch
between the native system

00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:01.270
and the phone system to be able
to accomplish all their tasks.

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:04.020
For example, you might be
using the built-in system

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.450
to adjust the cabin
temperature, and then you

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:08.430
switch into Android
Auto when you want

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:09.825
to use Google Maps or Spotify.

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:17.380
So also, as infotainment
expands into multiple screens,

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.670
like in the cluster display
I was showing earlier,

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:23.195
and it gets more and more
deeply integrated into the car,

00:24:23.195 --> 00:24:25.070
it gets more challenging
to be able to create

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:28.580
one unified seamless
experience just from the phone.

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.080
So we knew that we
had a lot of work

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.080
ahead of us to continue
to enable this vision

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.620
statement of creating a unified,
seamless-- completely seamless

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:39.210
experience.

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:41.960
So a few years ago, we
started to talk to car makers

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:45.320
about how we could
work together to create

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.160
this unified,
seamless experience.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.410
Not surprisingly,
many car makers

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:52.810
were already
experimenting with Android

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:55.360
or using it in their
cars for infotainment,

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.480
but there was a lot of
work to be done to adapt

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:02.100
Android from mobile to the car.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.950
So we started to
invest at that time

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:08.340
in making Android
a turnkey solution

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.430
that industry partners could
take and bring into the car

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:15.060
easily without having to
make significant changes,

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:18.330
without having to change any
of the core framework or APIs

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:21.840
that make the Android platform
so great for developers today.

00:25:24.457 --> 00:25:26.540
You may have seen some of
the demos and prototypes

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.165
that we showed the
last couple of years

00:25:28.165 --> 00:25:31.040
with Android running under
the hood and many Google

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:35.300
and third-party
apps running on top.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.490
One of the first
partners who we spoke

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:40.790
with who got very excited about
working with us on this project

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.540
was Volvo.

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.340
We engaged with them
a couple of years ago

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:47.790
and formally announced
our partnership last year

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:51.810
to bring Android, and Google
Maps, the Google Assistant,

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:54.120
and the third-party
app ecosystem

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:58.660
through the Google Play
Store to all of their cars.

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:02.920
Volvo, in turn, introduced
us to their performance

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:06.530
and electric brand Polestar.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:09.790
And just a few weeks ago,
at the Geneva Auto Show,

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:14.030
they unveiled the Polestar
2 that you see here.

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:18.520
This will be the first consumer
vehicle launching in 2020

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:22.090
to ship with the seamless
experience that brings together

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:28.440
Android, Google Apps, and the
third party app ecosystem.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.410
To tell you more about
the car, the technology,

00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:36.270
and our partnership, we asked
Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:38.190
to join us here today.

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:41.970
Thomas has been the CEO of
Polestar since June 2017,

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:44.730
and also serves as the Chief
Design Officer of Volvo Car

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:46.710
Corporation.

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:50.040
Previously, he was a Senior Vice
President of Design at Volvo

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.310
and has been the
inspiration behind Volvo's

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:56.640
award-winning design
renaissance for years.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.978
Welcome, Thomas.

00:26:57.978 --> 00:27:00.468
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:02.923 --> 00:27:04.090
THOMAS INGENLATH: Thank you.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:06.760
Thanks, Mickey.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:07.263
Hi.

00:27:07.263 --> 00:27:08.430
My name is Thomas Ingenlath.

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:11.230
I'm the CEO of Polestar.

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:20.120
Polestar is the new electric
car brand from Sweden.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:24.450
We are the rebellious
child of Volvo,

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:34.810
and we want to make Polestar
the guiding star of the new era

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:35.965
in the automotive industry.

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:43.110
With outstanding design,
that is our religion.

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:46.680
This is the Scandinavian
pure progressive design

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.720
that we bring with
our great products.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.540
And this is the Polestar 2.

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:52.300
Mickey said it.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:55.890
We launched it a couple
of weeks ago in Geneva,

00:27:55.890 --> 00:28:01.310
and we brought it here
today to the Google I/O.

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:04.280
We are very enthusiastic
about the joy

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:08.962
and the fun that the electric
propulsion brings to the car

00:28:08.962 --> 00:28:09.462
industry.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:18.560
And we take the safety--

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.570
the protection of your life--

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:21.480
very serious.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:25.030
So we take the battery and--

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:30.700
like a Lego brick, we build
it into a very tight unit

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:35.170
with the car body, and that
is the superb foundation

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:37.810
for the outstanding
safety of our cars.

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:46.610
Range, 300 miles was a 78
kilowatt-hours battery,

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:52.460
and power of 300 kilowatts, on
front and rear axle, 660 Newton

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:52.960
meter.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:58.820
So it's a very powerful,
fast, and fun-to-drive car.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:02.150
For us, the seamless integration
into your digital life

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:03.060
is very important.

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:07.010
So we have the Polestar app,
which from the first browse,

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:12.950
to the car configurator, to
the offer of a subscription

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:18.050
of our car, and ordering
on-demand services like pickup

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:21.850
and delivery-- all of
that done through one app,

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:22.850
with the Polestar brand.

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:28.440
So the great design
on the exterior

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:33.730
with the iconic graphics and
the clear-cut architecture.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.500
It's not on the outside.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:41.920
It's as well our strong,
powerful point in the interior.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:45.580
And while I drive that
video here to you,

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.580
with great details of our
Scandinavian interior,

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:52.930
I want to tell you another story
about what is great, what you

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:54.640
experience inside the Polestar.

00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:02.790
Because we have promised for
a long, long time, navigation

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:04.740
that would be
intuitive, navigation

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:08.550
that would be up to date,
and we actually failed.

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:11.880
We failed big time from car
generation to car generation.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:16.230
The same with voice recognition.

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:18.830
So with the Polestar,
to be new, we

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:23.540
have to do something radically
different in that field,

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.360
and we did.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:32.170
We teamed up with Google,
and it was a great journey.

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:33.100
Thanks a lot, Google.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:36.790
It was an amazing
partnership, and we, I think,

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:38.740
achieved something amazing here.

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:43.510
We put an infotainment system
that is powered by Android

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:52.420
into the car, bringing built-in
apps and optimized-for-the-car

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:58.440
apps and services
for our customers.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:03.310
And that includes
Google Assistant,

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:10.540
that includes the Google Maps,
and of course, the Google Play

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:12.090
Store--

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:14.352
all integrated into the car.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:35.030
So our customers, they
can enjoy the superb

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:39.530
artificial intelligence
of the Google Assistant

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:45.260
fast-learning voice recognition
to operate all the great apps

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:49.520
and functions, having the
hands on the steering wheel,

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:54.020
and having the eyes on the
road, using it all through voice

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:55.550
activation.

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:58.280
And I want to demonstrate
to you a couple

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.350
of examples of how that works.

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:04.400
So please.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.122
Hey, Google, show us the
way to a Pizzeria Roma.

00:32:07.122 --> 00:32:08.080
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Sure.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:12.050
Getting the fastest
route to Pizzeria Roma.

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:14.150
THOMAS INGENLATH:
So you get the way

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:17.150
without knowing the
name of the street,

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:18.890
without knowing the town.

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:21.790
Just say the restaurant
where you want to go.

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:29.066
Another example, connected to
living with an electric car.

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.700
Hey, Google.

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:39.215
Show charging stations nearby.

00:32:39.215 --> 00:32:40.590
GOOGLE ASSISTANT:
Showing results

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:41.925
for charging stations nearby.

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:47.620
THOMAS INGENLATH: So that
is a nice, reassuring list

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:49.260
of charging stations
that you get.

00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:05.980
So you can navigate,
you can plan your day,

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.750
you can search for things--

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:11.890
all using the time in
your car efficiently

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:15.220
without being distracted.

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:21.790
I think that's a really great
major improvement of safety

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:25.000
while using your car
infotainment system.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:32.530
Out of the Google Play Store,
you can download the apps

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:36.400
that you like into one of the
four tiles, and, of course,

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:40.090
you can swap in between
these tiles with the apps.

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:43.180
The car is always
connected, so you do not

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.872
have to use your phone.

00:33:47.524 --> 00:33:53.130
The Polestar 2 software
will be updated over the air

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:56.970
regularly, so that the car
will always stay up to date.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.950
We have Polestar 2 standing
here in the sandbox.

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:05.020
Please come and have a look.

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:14.199
Join the coaching sessions, and
from today on, it's up to you

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:17.440
to develop new apps
and be creative.

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:22.060
Come up with new great ideas
for apps used in the car.

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.230
Visit our website.

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:26.830
We have some inspiring
proposals, ideas,

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:30.980
how apps could be used
in the car in the future.

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:35.830
So please join the community
and use the opportunities

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:41.120
that we have with the
infotainment system

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.580
operated by--

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:45.440
powered by Android.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:50.900
Now I would end
the session here,

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.870
thanking you for having the
opportunity to come on stage

00:34:53.870 --> 00:35:00.290
and present, and I will do that
with a last voice-activated

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:03.080
action and that goes like that.

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:08.810
Google, please play
"At Last" on Spotify.

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:10.591
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Sure.

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:36.080
MICKEY KATARIA:
Thank you, Thomas.

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.745
We're very excited about
the car, and the technology,

00:35:38.745 --> 00:35:40.370
and bringing it to
consumers next year,

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:42.470
and thank you for bringing
one here for all of us

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:44.370
to see as well.

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:46.430
I'm looking forward to
driving one very soon too.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.670
The clicker is not working.

00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:59.580
Here we go.

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:02.420
So in addition to
Polestar and Volvo,

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:04.550
we also announced our
partnership last year

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:07.400
with the Renault Nissan
Mitsubishi Alliance

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.700
to bring Android and the
third-party app ecosystem

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:13.100
to their global range of cars.

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.090
And we're not going
to stop there.

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:17.000
We know that having
a large footprint

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.840
is very important for developers
to adapt your apps and services

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.150
for these cars, so
we continue to work

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:26.920
with the rest of the industry
as well on further adoption.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.420
I'm excited to say
that we're seeing

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:30.050
a ton of interest and momentum.

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:34.370
So please stay tuned
for more news on that.

00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:37.700
As we finish up, I want to recap
the three in-car products where

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:39.710
we're investing
and offering users

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:42.430
and our partners a choice.

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:44.710
On the phone screen
itself, you heard today

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:47.273
about the Google
Assistant's Driving Mode.

00:36:47.273 --> 00:36:49.690
That will be the next step in
the evolution of the Android

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:52.510
Auto phone-screen experience.

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:55.360
There's Android Auto for
the car screen, which,

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.990
since launching in 2015, has
virtually become an industry

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:01.660
standard, and it's
on its way to being

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:04.840
in more than 100 million cars.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:08.192
And last but not least,
the Android Automotive OS,

00:37:08.192 --> 00:37:11.260
our in-car embedded
platform that

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:14.110
will be coming to market
next year with the Polestar

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:19.710
2, and many more vehicles
and partners soon after.

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:21.440
So we covered a lot
today about what

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.470
we're doing to bring
Android into cars.

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:26.870
Thank you, Thomas again
for joining us from Sweden

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:29.180
and sharing your car with us.

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:32.120
Thank you, Ian, for coming
up and sharing the fantastic

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:36.110
insights behind the
new Android Auto UI.

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:39.200
You can check out both the
Polestar and the Android Auto

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:42.170
new UI in our sandbox today
and the rest of the week

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:43.410
here at I/O.

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:45.410
Also, if you're interested
in the details of how

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:47.510
to build apps for
these cars, please

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:51.140

session tomorrow morning,

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:54.947
