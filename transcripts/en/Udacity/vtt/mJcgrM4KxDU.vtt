00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.620
In the previous lesson, we discussed the fundamental

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.380
concepts behind software verification in general, and software testing

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.470
in particular. In this lesson, we will discuss

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.310
one of the two main testing approaches. Black box

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.180
testing, also called functional testing. We will cover

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.180
the main characteristic of black box testing, its pros

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.260
and cons, and discuss some commonly used black

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.350
box testing techniques. We will conclude the lesson with

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.520
a practical exercise in which we will apply a specific black

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.520
box testing technique to a real program. We will derive test

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.980
cases for the program and assess how the use of a

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.690
systematic approach, in contrast to a brute force approach, can help.
