MANDY WAITE: Welcome to
Google Developers

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.140
Live from Campus London.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.865
I'm Mandy Waite.

00:00:15.865 --> 00:00:18.940
I'm a developer advocate for the
cloud platform at Google.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:19.465
EMMA JACKSON: I'm
Emma Jackson.

00:00:19.465 --> 00:00:21.320
And I look after Google's
education

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.560
programs in emerging markets.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.210
And this is the next in our
series of Women Techmakers.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.400
We're delighted to have Trisha
Gee with us today.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.770
Trisha is a developer at 10gen,
the MongoDB company.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.790
She has expertise in Java high
performance systems, is

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.880
passionate about enabling
developer productivity, and

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.520
has a wide breadth of industry
experience from the 12 years

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.670
she's been a professional
developer.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.080
She's a leader in the London
Java community and also

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.835
involved in graduate developer
community.

00:00:48.835 --> 00:00:49.860
And welcome Trisha.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.570
TRISHA GEE: Thank you.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.690
Thank you for having me.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.940
MANDY WAITE: Yeah.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.570
It's great to have you along
to Women Techmakers.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.190
So the first question is
basically just kind of find

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.030
out a bit more about you.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.850
You work at 10gen--

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.120
TRISHA GEE: Yes.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.306
MANDY WAITE: --just down the
road from here, just down the

00:01:01.306 --> 00:01:02.830
road from Campus London.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.100
Tell us a bit more about the
work that you do at 10gen.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.820
TRISHA GEE: So, I'm a Java
developer at 10gen.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.580
So 10gen make MongoDB.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.610
It's one of the new
No-SQL databases.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.560
And as many databases have, it
has a number of drivers for

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.930
developers to work to code their
application against.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.620
Because you can't just talk
directly to database.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.270
You've got to talk something
from your

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.560
application to the server.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.200
And 10gen have got 12 maintained
drivers and a

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.940
number of other community
drivers in

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.140
12 different languages.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.660
And I'm look after the Java one,
along with another guy.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.590
So it's interesting because
we're working in an

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.630
environment of lots of different
languages, and I'm

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.840
used to working in a very
Java-y environment.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.070
And it's really cool, because
you can learn some different

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.936
stuff off different languages,
different people with

00:01:48.936 --> 00:01:49.990
different backgrounds.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.930
MANDY WAITE: So what other
languages are you

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:52.740
working with at 10gen?

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.570
And which ones particularly
interest you

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.840
most other than Java?

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.170
TRISHA GEE: Well, so I work
quite closely with the C# guys

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.430
because the Java and C# drivers,
we want them to be

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.160
fairly similar.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.060
We want them to feel the same.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.510
So that's interesting, because
we've got a lot of

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.420
similarities.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.600
But the C# platform has
some things that Java

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.110
doesn't have yet.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.190
So, for example, they do have
some lambda type functions,

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.630
and Java won't get that 'til
the end of this year.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.450
Like Node.js is really
interesting, because it's

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.520
single threaded and
asynchronous, and it's a

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.330
totally different
way of working.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.250
But there's no reason that you
can't get Java to look a

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.100
little bit like Node.js
if you wanted to.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.600
So you can borrow some stuff off
them in terms of how they

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.260
do their asynchronous
callback type stuff.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.840
And then you look at some of
the dynamic languages.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.110
And they work in an entirely
different way.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.060
For the first time I actually
feel a little bit jealous of

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.180
them, because they've got real
flexibility as to how they

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.170
take stuff from one thing and
turn it into another.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.470
Because as a driver, what you
do is you take it from here

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.670
and turn it into this.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.340
Normally in enterprise
applications it

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.890
doesn't work that way.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.330
You've got your Java
application.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.230
Then you do your proper
domain driven design.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.230
And you've got your domain
model, and you

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.060
code it all in Java.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.290
And you shouldn't be turning
things from this into this,

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.440
because it means you've done it
wrong in the first place.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.885
So when you're writing an
application where the only job

00:03:06.885 --> 00:03:09.290
is to turn it from this into
this, you're like, oh, Java's

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.730
not really easy to do
that sort of thing.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.140
You've got to worry about
garbage collection

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.620
and things like that.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.630
So yes, for once I'm kind
of a little bit jealous.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.490
MANDY WAITE: Little
bit jealous.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.240
OK.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.490
All right.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:20.803
EMMA JACKSON: What actually
excites you about the work

00:03:20.803 --> 00:03:22.610
that you're doing at the
moment with 10 gen?

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.360
TRISHA GEE: Well, I'm in a
lucky position actually.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.950
I got hired at the point
in time when we want to

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.525
effectively rewrite the Java
driver, which is not really

00:03:31.525 --> 00:03:32.360
what I signed up for.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.330
I kind of signed up for doing
some Java stuff and some

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.290
evangelist type stuff.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.600
So I've got this dual role where
I do coding like a real

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.200
developer and go out to
conferences and do

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.410
presentations and do blogging.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.630
And I very much wanted
a role where I could

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.290
have those two things.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.360
It's quite difficult to be taken
seriously by developers

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.545
when you're going out there and
talking to them if you're

00:03:54.545 --> 00:03:55.740
not doing code as well.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.930
So it's important to do both
things at the same time.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.630
However, I didn't really realize
that we were going to

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.970
do a whole rewrite of the Java
driver, which is both a curse

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:04.940
and a blessing.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.420
Because it's cool, because you
get to look at something which

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.520
is currently in use, that
real people are using.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.200
And you've got a specification
there because you've got

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.540
something that already works.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.529
But you get to do it the way
that you want to do it.

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:17.680
And that's really cool.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.040
But it's quite a lot of work.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.190
And also, we do have a lot of
people using the existing one,

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.680
and you don't want to
alienate those guys.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.010
And you want them to be
able to migrate to

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.810
the new world order.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.372
And you don't want them to say
nasty things about you.

00:04:28.372 --> 00:04:29.354
MANDY WAITE: That's awesome.

00:04:29.354 --> 00:04:29.845
OK.

00:04:29.845 --> 00:04:30.340
So.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.060
EMMA JACKSON: So, yeah, let's
talk a bit about how you got

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.190
to where you are in your career
at the moment-- so this

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.860
little path that you
took to get there.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.540
And I guess it started
with your

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.840
degree in computer science.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.400
What factored into that decision
to study that?

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.690
TRISHA GEE: I didn't want to.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.280
I wanted to be an
astrophysicist.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.720
EMMA JACKSON: Oh, wow.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.160
MANDY WAITE: Oh, wow,
astrophysicist.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.280
TRISHA GEE: I was really into
science fiction and stuff.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.670
So I guess I was a bit of
a geek as a teenager.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.350
And I wanted to go to Mars.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.955
And I wanted to be
an astronaut.

00:04:58.955 --> 00:05:01.690
And I knew that probably wasn't
really going to happen.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.260
But I thought astrophysicist is
a good way to look into the

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.600
stars and find out about
the universe out there.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.545
MANDY WAITE: Oh, definitely.

00:05:09.545 --> 00:05:11.500
TRISHA GEE: So I did maths,
physics, and computer science

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.200
at A level thinking that that's
a good platform for

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.450
almost any degree that
you want to do.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.960
I kind of came from a difficult
background.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.120
It's not like family wise.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.635
My parents are going
to kill me, no.

00:05:25.635 --> 00:05:26.880
It was fine.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.700
But when I did my GCSEs, I did
10 very different subjects.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.530
I did maths and science
and English and

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.910
French and PE and art.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:43.450
Now, almost no one else did well
in the art and the PE and

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.610
the maths and science
and English.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.275
So I had 10 subjects, and I
got A's in all of them.

00:05:49.275 --> 00:05:51.430
It's like, oh, well,
that's great.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.230
But where am I going
to go from here?

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.940
And in terms of my sixth form
choices, I wanted to do

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:57.730
various other--

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.066
I would have liked to have
carried on with art

00:05:59.066 --> 00:06:00.070
and things like that.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.490
But in terms of actual career
prospects, I decided that

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.610
maths, physics, and something
else would allow me to choose

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.320
pretty much whatever
I wanted to.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.410
So although it looks like you
are narrowing yourself down,

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.780
in actual fact I picked them
because it wouldn't force me

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.930
to narrow down very early on.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.260
If I wanted to go on and do
journalism, I could probably

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.800
still go on and do journalism.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.890
If I wanted to be an artist, I
probably didn't need a degree

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.450
in art, for example.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.700
So I did maths, physics, and
computer science thinking that

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.060
maybe I can go on and be
an astrophysicist,

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.350
and that'd be awesome.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:27.900
And physics was kind of hard.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.400
And the maths was a bit like,
oh, well, it's just more

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.050
imaginary numbers.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.670
I mean seriously, who needs
an imaginary number?

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:34.930
It's hard enough with
the real numbers.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:35.665
MANDY WAITE: Matrixes.

00:06:35.665 --> 00:06:35.950
TRISHA GEE: Yeah.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:36.640
MANDY WAITE: My favorite.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.440
TRISHA GEE: And all
that stuff.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.210
And I did well enough in the
maths and physics, but I knew

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.720
I didn't want to do
that going on, so.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.290
And the computing, it turned out
that I actually not only

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.550
was good at programming, but
I enjoyed the programming.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.650
And it's fun, because it's a
bit like the maths and the

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.060
physics, because it has got
right and wrong answers, and

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.900
it's logical.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.495
But it's a bit more fun than
that, because you can play

00:06:55.495 --> 00:06:57.420
around and see, oh, no one's
ever done this before.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.340
And I can try and do this.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.440
And how about that?

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.690
And it was much more
exploratory.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:01.570
And it was more creative.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.950
So it allowed me to bring in
some of the creative stuff

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.140
from when I was doing writing
and when I was doing art, but

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.310
doing it in a logical fashion.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.460
So I thought it was the
best of all worlds.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.660
So that's why I picked
computer science.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.450
But I picked computer
science and AI--

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:15.730
MANDY WAITE: And AI, yeah.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.140
TRISHA GEE: --because I still
was liking my science fiction.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.460
And I still wanted
to do something--

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.200
I didn't want to be
a programmer.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.020
I wanted to do something cool
and interesting, and I didn't

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.150
think being a programmer
was cool and

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:27.610
interesting at the time.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:28.060
MANDY WAITE: Well, OK.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:28.510
EMMA JACKSON: Do you
think that now?

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.030
MANDY WAITE: That's really
interesting.

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:29.715
TRISHA GEE: Well, yeah.

00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:32.110
Well, I mean that's it.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.050
I didn't really realize.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.810
I didn't really know what being
a programmer was about.

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.800
And I definitely didn't want
to sit behind a desk for 40

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.360
hours a week behind a computer,
because I was very

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.750
active, and I did
lost of sports.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.710
And my dad's a basketball
coach.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.370
I didn't want to be sat
down all the time.

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.160
I just wasn't that
sort of person.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.740
I didn't want to be
a programmer.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:57.030
But the thing that it does offer
you is this variety of

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.360
solving other people's problems
and telling the

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.370
computer to do something.

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.410
And when it finally gets around
to doing it, it's like,

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.240
yay, it did that cool thing.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.880
And there's lots of--

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.690
like I said-- lots of
creativity, even if you're not

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:08.410
doing front-ends.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.380
I was doing quite a lot
of front-end stuff

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.450
early on, web stuff.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.400
But even if you're not doing
something graphical, you're

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.200
sort of thinking, how can
I shape this problem?

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.010
How can I fix this?

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:17.260
How do I design that?

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.110
You are sat behind a computer
when you're programming.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:24.390
But that's not what
it's about.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.980
It's about getting up at the
whiteboard and talking to your

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:27.500
colleagues.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.100
And it's about collaborating
with people to say, look, I

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:30.800
need to do this.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.159
But there's going to be
four of us doing it.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.380
So how do we work together
to make this work?

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.400
It's about talking to the
business and saying, when you

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.309
said you wanted this, did
you really want that?

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:40.590
What is it you're
trying to do?

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:43.370
And how can I help you do
what you want to do?

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:47.420
So there's lots of this kind
of talking to people stuff

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.730
that you don't realize happens
when you're a programmer.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.260
You sort of think you're
communing with the computer.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.110
But you're not.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:56.300
Communing with the computer is
the easy bit, right, because

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.360
it does what you tell it to
even if you tell it to do

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.670
something stupid, right?

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.820
But ultimately, that's
the logical bit.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.235
You say do this, and
it says yes or no.

00:09:04.235 --> 00:09:06.570
So that's kind of--
not mechanical--

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:07.430
but that's the easy bit.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.880
The difficult bit is I told it
to do this, but did that guy

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.380
over there, is that what he
wanted, or did he really mean

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.110
something else?

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:17.590
So you have the difficult bit of
translating from the fluffy

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:21.500
human stuff into the easy,
logical computer stuff.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.100
MANDY WAITE: So I guess this is
where one of my questions I

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.780
had kind of framed up was the
fact that you're a developer

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.990
and that there's a kind of
a difference between a

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.040
programmer and a developer.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:30.440
TRISHA GEE: Yes.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.690
MANDY WAITE: And so let's talk
about the difference between a

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:33.505
programmer and developer.

00:09:33.505 --> 00:09:39.260
So being a developer is much
more holistic than actually

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.950
just cutting code
and programming.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.410
It's more about testing,
debugging, writing.

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:45.800
But what else does the
role of developer

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.450
specifically mean to you?

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.180
TRISHA GEE: It means--

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.470
I hate this phrase--

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:53.740
it means being involved in all
aspects of the software

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.210
lifecycle, right?

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:56.440
And you see it on people's CV.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.740
And I think if you're not
involved in all aspects of the

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.005
software lifecycle, then
you're not a developer.

00:10:01.005 --> 00:10:02.580
You're just a programmer.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.530
And it means talking
to users or maybe

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:06.190
your business analyst.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.070
It depends on the size
the company.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:09.310
It depends on what you're
trying to do.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:12.050
It means talking to people,
finding out what they want.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:15.070
It means figuring out some
sort of design or

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:16.590
specification.

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.430
It doesn't have to be a
big design document.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.870
It could just be a whiteboard
design.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:24.605
Will this fit your needs?

00:10:24.605 --> 00:10:26.500
Does the team think this is
going to work with the

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.880
existing architecture?

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.810
That's kind of a different
sort of puzzle.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.600
And then it's the
coding stuff.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.020
And I've done a lot of pair
programming in my last place.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.440
Pair programming is totally
different to programming on

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.190
your own because you're sat
physically next to the person.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.820
And you have to not want
to kill each other.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.170
You have to be able
to communicate.

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:45.750
You have to be able to
say, look, I'm trying

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:46.500
to do it this way.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.840
And what I've got in my head is
this, this, and this, which

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.650
is quite difficult.

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:50.660
Because normally when
you're coding on

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.830
your own, you explore.

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.430
You don't really know exactly
what you're trying to achieve.

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:56.580
You just explore.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.500
But when you're coding with
someone else, you need to be

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.190
able to at least attempt
to communicate--

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:03.910
well, I'm doing this because I
saw this, and I thought this,

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:05.890
and I was thinking
maybe about that.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:08.430
And then that's great, because
they can tell you early on

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.480
something like, no, no actually,
that's not really

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.400
applicable because of this.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.770
And you're like, oh, yeah, I
didn't think about that.

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:14.820
Or, oh, great idea.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:15.950
Why don't you look over here?

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:17.240
Because I know something
over here is the

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.260
same sort of thing.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.080
So being able to communicate
what you're doing while you're

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.830
typing is quite tricky.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:28.780
And being able to negotiate
over the design as you're

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.180
coding it is tricky too because

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.070
you're like, I'm right.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:31.690
No, I'm right.

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:32.560
No, I'm right.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.470
And you're both right.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.000
And there are good
and bad points.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.910
One of the best things I thought
about pair programing

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:38.690
is that when I used to code on
my own, I'd be like, right,

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:40.200
I'm going to do it this way.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:40.710
No, no, no.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.122
I'm going to do it this way.

00:11:42.122 --> 00:11:43.480
No, I prefer it the
other way better.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.450
I'm going to do it this way.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:46.210
No, but what about
the third way?

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:48.340
And when you're coding, you
have those conversations

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.570
before you start typing
anything.

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:50.960
And then eventually,
you'll end up with

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.930
something a bit better.

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:55.000
But it's not the same as what
you think of as programming.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.630
You have to have these
interpersonal skills.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.070
And no one tells you you need
interpersonal skills as a

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:00.820
programmer.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.420
In fact, they often tell
you the opposite.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.290
It's not true.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:05.766
You need to be able to
speak to people.

00:12:05.766 --> 00:12:06.099
MANDY WAITE: Exactly.

00:12:06.099 --> 00:12:06.212
Yeah.

00:12:06.212 --> 00:12:08.140
Definitely.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.600
I guess I'm just going to
quickly follow up with one of

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.990
my questions, because it's
kind of related.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:15.560
So programmer/developer
is one kind of track

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.600
through computer science.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.960
Was it evident to you while you
were going through your

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.610
computer science degree that
there are other ways you can

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.647
go within computer science other
than just developing and

00:12:25.647 --> 00:12:26.180
programming?

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:26.370
TRISHA GEE: Yeah.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.410
I mean, at university, no.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:29.940
It wasn't evident
to me at all.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.755
And in actual fact, I was a
little bit depressed for a

00:12:32.755 --> 00:12:34.340
while, because I was learning
Java at university.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.046
And I thought, right, well
that's it, I'm going to be a

00:12:36.046 --> 00:12:37.910
Java programmer for like
the rest of my life.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:39.160
That's what I've been
trained to do.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.390
And 12 years later, I am still
a Java programmer.

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:43.670
But that's not the point.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.910
Many of my other friends left
university and started off

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.830
being Java programmers, because
those are the skills

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.220
we've been given.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.095
But they've ended up being
technical authors.

00:12:53.095 --> 00:12:55.590
Or they've ended up being
technical project managers.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:56.930
Or they've ended up being BAs.

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:58.930
Or they've ended up
being programmers

00:12:58.930 --> 00:12:59.920
in different languages.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.180
Or they've ended up starting
their own company, or being a

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.860
consultant.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.720
Consultancy is interesting,
because it means lots of

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.640
different things, right?

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.510
It can either be going in and
hand waving at people saying,

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:13.310
oh, you should think
about this.

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:15.740
Or it could be going on site,
working with a team, and doing

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.070
coding with them.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:18.620
There are very different
sorts of roles

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.460
just in that one umbrella.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.070
So it wasn't evident
to me at all.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.480
And one of the things that
we've been doing in the

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.870
graduate developer community
is doing this

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.660
meet and mentor project.

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.970
So you get people in the
software industry at the

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:32.700
moment, and they go
into universities.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:36.800
And we sit down with students,
and they ask us questions.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.620
And often they don't really know
what questions to ask.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.310
So you sort of seed it with
this is what I do.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.410
This is what my job
really involves.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.520
Do you have any more questions
around what it means to be a

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.590
Java developer?

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.920
And then I will often drop
in the conversation--

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.410
like because they'll be
thinking, I still don't know

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:56.330
what I want to be when I grow
up-- and then you'll say,

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.700
there are other paths.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.200
There are other things
you can do.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.470
And not just with computer
science.

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:02.540
Because at the end of the day,
you've got a degree.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:04.810
And you've got a scientific-ish
degree.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.630
So that opens up lots
of different paths.

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.610
And you can do a master's in
almost anything, right?

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:10.150
So you can cross train
to something else.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.620
At least you got a degree.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:12.600
MANDY WAITE: Well, thank you.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.070
EMMA JACKSON: So thinking
about your path

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:14.640
to where you are--

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.610
I guess you started off wanting
to go to Mars, and you

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:17.690
ended up a Java developer.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:21.300
But did you feel like you had
a plan once you went through

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.310
university and the steps that
you took, the career changes?

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.200
Or is it sort of happy
accidents--

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.450
TRISHA GEE: I sort of had an
iterative plan, really.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:30.950
I mean, I still don't
know what I want to

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:31.770
be when I grow up.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.670
I mean, it scared me when you
said I've got 12 years of

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:34.100
experience.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:34.870
I'm like, oh, no.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.930
That means I graduated
a long time ago.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:37.800
EMMA JACKSON: You could
still get to Mars.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.380
Don't worry.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:39.260
TRISHA GEE: I could
still go to Mars.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.800
I could send something
that goes to Mars.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.680
So, no, I certainly didn't have
a "this is where I want

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.610
to be" or "this is what I want
to do." And even now, my

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:51.300
horizon's probably two years
out, maybe five.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.540
There it gets--

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.440
you can be more directed within
six months to a year.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.190
You got a good idea of
where you want to go.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:57.740
And then two years, yeah.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.540
And then five years,
well, is these--

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.270
I want to make sure I don't
cut off these options.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.570
So I think the main thing I had
was, in terms of planning

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.360
my career, it was always try
not to cut things off.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:13.810
Try not to exclude things, which
is why I picked my A

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.800
levels, which is why I picked
computer science, because it

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.040
wasn't going to stop me
following various paths.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.240
And similarly, I did consultancy
for a while,

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.710
because I thought that
would open up a lot

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:25.470
more stuff to me.

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:27.370
And I could work in different
industries.

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:29.500
I could get a feel of how
different teams work.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.090
I could get a feel for the
difference between working in

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:36.770
banking versus manufacturing
versus education.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:40.330
And that way I have
more options.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:45.700
So I guess my main career thing
has not been, I want to

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.790
get here, but I want to make
sure I can get there if I want

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:52.400
to, and there and there.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.540
And the way you do that--
instead of being overwhelmed

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.870
by all those choices-- is,
well, where am I now?

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:58.030
What skills do I have?

00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:59.880
What do I like doing?

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:04.540
And what can I do for the next
sort of one to two years which

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.390
will either move me closer
to a particular goal.

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:10.420
Or more likely, what am I going
to do in the next one to

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:12.760
two years which I enjoy doing?

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.850
Because that means then I'm
going to carry on enjoying

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:16.910
doing what I'm doing and
learning more about the stuff

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:17.600
I'm enjoying.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.700
And so, if you're ever stuck,
you just think,

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:21.640
what do I like doing?

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.490
I don't like doing that.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:23.720
Don't do it any more then.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.200
MANDY WAITE: Exactly.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:24.500
Yeah.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.102
Good point.

00:16:26.102 --> 00:16:28.474
So, I guess I have one kind of
question going back to what we

00:16:28.474 --> 00:16:32.170
were talking about a little
while ago about CS and CS

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:33.000
skills in general.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.450
So it seems that CS skills are
applicable in a multitude of

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:38.190
different roles nowadays.

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:40.280
You could be not just
technology.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.220
I don't have any specific
examples other than maybe

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.620
finance and spreadsheets and
scripts and spreadsheets.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:49.250
And scripting seems to be a
big thing that's becoming

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:50.100
fairly common nowadays.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.580
But it seems that CS skills are
something that we should

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:56.510
be learning at a very early
age, being very young, and

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:59.040
maybe even broken out of
computer science completely,

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.020
the basic program and the
ability to put programs

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.440
together and to code things and
to control your world and

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.900
your environment from
technology.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.150
So do you feel the same?

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:10.890
Do you feel similar?

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:14.440
Are we now at the point where CS
skills are vital for a wide

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.660
variety of different roles?

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:17.030
TRISHA GEE: Yeah.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:18.560
I mean, I would say yes.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.480
I do agree.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.460
I think what you said
was interesting.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.670
I never really thought
about it that way.

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:26.710
How can we extract the really
reusable bits from CS?

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:28.590
It's a very computer science
thing to want to do, right,

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.770
extract the reusable stuff,
the usability.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:33.120
But what is applicable?

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.400
Maybe programming, per
se, might not be.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.550
But maybe algorithms generally
is quite useful.

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:41.530
I did some psuedocoding back
when I was still 16 doing

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:42.870
algorithmic stuff.

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.800
And, it's a definitely reusable
skill to be able to

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.580
think, right, I have
a particular

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:48.620
problem that needs solving.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.580
I have a particular set
of skills and a

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:52.510
particular set of tools.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:54.950
So maybe it's Excel, or
maybe it's Office.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:57.410
Or maybe it's I've got friends
over there I can

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:58.520
call who can do stuff.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.630
And the ability to break down
the steps needed to get from

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:04.325
here to here--

00:18:04.325 --> 00:18:06.380
whether it's because you're
trying to plan your wedding or

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:10.110
because you're trying to
organize your team or whether

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:11.720
it's because you're trying
to write a program--

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.000
those sorts of skills are
definitely useful.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.330
But I also think that
things like--

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.340
I mean, I think the
mathematical

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.140
logic stuff is useful.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:27.390
And I think data structure is
absolutely fundamental if

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:29.380
you're going to do anything
even slightly computer

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:32.370
sciencey, but probably
not so reusable.

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:34.570
But I think that sort of thing
should be taught in school.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:37.880
And the UK government's been
doing some stuff around that

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.690
area in terms of changing
the focus from

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:42.685
ICT to computer science.

00:18:42.685 --> 00:18:44.110
And I think that's the
right thing too.

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:46.020
I think technical skills
are really important.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.200
I think you should be able
to type for start, right?

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.140
And I think you should be able
at use Word and PowerPoint and

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:50.900
Excel and things.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.310
Excel, in particular, is used in
a lot of different places.

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:59.690
But I think teaching computer
science as a separate thing to

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:02.910
ICT is important, because
learning to use a tool is one

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.070
thing, but learning to create
the tool is an entirely

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:07.200
different set of skills.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.600
And I think that we as
developers and as technical

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:14.900
professionals, we need to help
teachers teach that, because

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.630
they don't have the time to.

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:19.720
We spent 10 years developing
these skills, right?

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.320
We know them.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.690
We do them day in, day out.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:23.500
And teachers, they
teach very well.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.670
They do that day in, day out.

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:25.730
But they have to
teach all these

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:26.560
different subjects, right?

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:26.800
MANDY WAITE: Right.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:26.880
Yeah.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:27.250
Exactly.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.860
TRISHA GEE: And I think if
you're going to teach computer

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.590
science well, you need to get
computer scientists in to

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:32.740
teach computer science well.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.490
So I think it's a really good
idea to try and reach out to

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:37.180
schools and say, do
you need any help?

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.135
I can offer you some hours
per week to do that.

00:19:39.135 --> 00:19:40.060
MANDY WAITE: In terms of
volunteer programs.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:40.602
That kind of thing.

00:19:40.602 --> 00:19:40.715
Yeah.

00:19:40.715 --> 00:19:41.770
TRISHA GEE: Yeah.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:43.360
MANDY WAITE: Sharing your
abilities and your knowledge

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.000
with students and such.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:45.670
Really cool idea.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:47.960
I mean, we do some of that
at Google already.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.340
TRISHA GEE: Yeah.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:50.800
There's lots of different
projects for it.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.210
And that's the interesting
thing.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:53.780
There's lots of little
seeds of ideas.

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:55.830
And I wonder if there's scope
at some point to be able to

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:57.990
start putting this together
and saying, if you want to

00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:59.970
work in this area or in this
technology or with these

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:02.440
schools, then these are the
programs which are available,

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.950
and this is how you get in.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:07.830
Because you have to do things
like you have to have your CRB

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:10.010
check, and you need to be
cleared to work with kids and

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:11.290
things like that.

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:14.280
It'd be great to have some
central place to say, how do I

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.157
get involved with this
sort of thing?

00:20:15.157 --> 00:20:15.574
MANDY WAITE: Yeah, definitely.

00:20:15.574 --> 00:20:16.502
Some kind of registry
or something like

00:20:16.502 --> 00:20:17.720
that where you say--

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.040
some kind of volunteer registry
where you can say,

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.220
I'm able to to do this.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.980
I'm able to supply these
kind of skills and--

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:22.480
TRISHA GEE: Yeah.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.690
Like a sort of match.com for--

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:25.340
MANDY WAITE: Yeah, definitely.

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:27.800
TRISHA GEE: --for schools
of computer science.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.060
MANDY WAITE: Some of us are
actually scared of actually

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:32.340
standing in front of a classroom
of children and

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:36.735
being exposed to that and having
your primal instincts

00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:37.860
kind of like challenged.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:38.330
TRISHA GEE: Of course.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:39.700
MANDY WAITE: This is my
nightmare, standing in front

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.020
of a group of children.

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:42.780
And they can ask me questions
I can't answer.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:42.890
TRISHA GEE: Exactly.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:45.140
And kids don't really have the
same sort of barriers that

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:45.580
adults have.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.310
They'll ask all sorts
of stuff.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:50.280
I mean, that's the stuff
that teachers are

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.320
really good at, right?

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.980
So that's what we can learn
off the teachers.

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.700
And the teachers can
learn some computer

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:56.556
science stuff off us.

00:20:56.556 --> 00:20:56.889
MANDY WAITE: Yeah.

00:20:56.889 --> 00:20:57.002
OK.

00:20:57.002 --> 00:20:57.450
Excellent.

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:59.542
EMMA JACKSON: This is a good
idea for a new start-up, the

00:20:59.542 --> 00:21:02.820
match.com of technology
professionals in schools.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:03.500
That's good.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:03.790
TRISHA GEE: Obviously

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:05.926
integrated with Google AdWords.

00:21:05.926 --> 00:21:06.414
EMMA JACKSON: Of course.

00:21:06.414 --> 00:21:08.440
Yes.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.860
So while we're talking about
education actually, I was

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:14.920
thinking there's been so many
advancements in technology for

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.950
education lately, things like
these massive open online

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:19.760
courses and things like
this and apps

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.430
you can get for education.

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:23.880
What are your thoughts
on this and how it's

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.260
changing how we educate?

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.600
TRISHA GEE: I think
it's amazing.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.330
My parents are teachers, so I'm
really interested in the

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:29.730
education side of stuff.

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:33.320
And I think that--

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.620
I've got so many thoughts going
through my head, I don't

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.410
know how to face them all.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:40.510
So 10gen are running online
education for

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:41.900
MongoDB at the moment.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.905
They ran a course
using Python.

00:21:44.905 --> 00:21:46.710
And we're now running
one using Java.

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:49.530
So it's definitely something
that me and my day job, I'm

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:51.280
actually recently involved in.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.710
And we've found it very,
very useful, because

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:54.980
it scales much better.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:58.600
Now, we could hire a bunch of
consultants, teach them how to

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.970
teach MongoDB, teach them how
to teach developers how to

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:04.690
code, and then we could
sell those consultants

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:06.830
into places of work.

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:09.040
And we could make loads
of money off that.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.690
But it's not very scalable.

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:13.170
And the ability to make sure
that all your consultants are

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:15.770
teaching the same sort of thing,
the consistency, the

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:18.070
branding, it's a little
bit more difficult.

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:20.280
And actually if you're a
software firm, sure you could

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.330
make money doing that, but it's
probably not the best

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:23.190
thing to do.

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:25.380
So as a software firm, what you
should do is provide an

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:28.370
online training platform.

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:30.750
You could charge for it if you
wanted to, but why should you?

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.850
Because the point is you're
training people up on how to

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:33.970
use your technology.

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:36.850
And if people want to use your
technology and know how to use

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:39.300
it properly, your support
costs are lower.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:40.840
They're using your technology.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.660
They're spreading the word and
saying that you're amazing.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.700
It's just a very, very
good thing to do.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:45.880
And like I said,
it's scalable.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.910
You can put this online course
there with lectures.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:52.760
And then really the interaction
is you can still

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:53.960
have emails and things
like that.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.580
So you still need people
at the end of the line.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:58.120
But you don't have to send
someone in to train someone

00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.150
for like a week.

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:03.420
So from a corporate point of
view, it's almost a no-brainer

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.960
if you can invest
the time in it.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:11.480
From like a more widespread
point of view, the internet

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.850
opens up so much
for us, right?

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:15.220
We could do so much now.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.680
We can learn stuff we never
could have learned before.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.516
We can find out about things
we never could have found

00:23:19.516 --> 00:23:21.580
about before.

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:22.760
Things like the Open University

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.555
stuff has totally changed.

00:23:23.555 --> 00:23:25.630
You don't have to get
loads of packets of

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:27.550
information, pieces of paper.

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:28.280
You can do it online.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.980
And you can do stuff
in your own time.

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:34.090
And I think it allows you to
improve yourself and educate

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:36.460
yourself at your own pace.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.980
And I think anything which is
about learning and improving

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.800
is a good thing.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.070
I've been approached by a bunch
of people about creating

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:48.270
software for home schooling
kids, particularly in America.

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:50.930
And I find that really, really
interesting too.

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:52.760
I'm not sure how much I agree
with that, because I think

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.880
kids need to learn how to
interact with people.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.030
I think that's the most
important thing

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:56.780
you learn at school.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.500
I don't think it's maths
and science.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:02.360
I think it's how people are
different to your family unit.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.170
And you need to learn to
negotiate with those people

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:07.490
and play nicely with others.

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:11.310
But if we're worried about
consistency of teaching in

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:14.480
schools across the UK or across
the US or whatever, you

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.022
can plug some of those holes
by providing some home

00:24:17.022 --> 00:24:19.790
schooling stuff or some online
education stuff.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:22.120
And it doesn't matter, then,
where you live or what school

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:26.300
your kid goes to or even
necessarily what background

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.610
you're from.

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:30.810
You can provide your kid with
opportunities to improve

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:33.270
themselves and move on and do
stuff they couldn't have done

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:34.810
20 years ago.

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:36.230
So I think it's really
exciting.

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:38.190
And I'm using Rosetta Stone to
learn Spanish at the moment.

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:41.060
And that's amazing.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.350
It's very well designed.

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:43.520
It's a very well designed
piece of software.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.420
And I keep thinking in my head,
I'm like, I wonder how

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:47.090
they did this?

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:49.840
And it's really amazing how
they've planned the material

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.300
to be really sensibly
organized.

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.646
And I'm reporting bugs as well--
that doesn't work.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:00.770
I've been thinking about
learning a new

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:02.700
language for 10 years.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.340
And being able to put aside the
same hour of every week to

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:10.240
go to a class to learn it is
never going to happen.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.790
Even before I was traveling all
over the world, that was

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:14.300
just never going to happen.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.240
Because sometimes on a Thursday
at 6 o'clock, I might

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.840
not want to.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.620
I might want to have pizza and
sit at home and watch tele.

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:24.140
So I think the online stuff
just allows you to be more

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:25.400
flexible about learning.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.670
MANDY WAITE: So I guess you
talked earlier about--

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:28.220
offline--

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:31.950
you talked about gamification,
and also one other thing would

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:35.570
be the social aspects of
education materials, things

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:37.520
like Rosetta Stone where you can
interact with other people

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.805
online, people who may be at the
same level as you, people

00:25:40.805 --> 00:25:42.630
that you can speak with
and practice and

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:43.730
converse with there.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:44.540
That's really interesting.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.200
So, do you do much of the social
interaction side on

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.580
Rosetta Stone with
other people?

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.620
TRISHA GEE: No, because I say,
oh, I'm going to meet with my

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:52.140
Spanish friends, and I'm going
to talk Spanish to those guys,

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.470
which I don't.

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:55.650
But the fact that it is there.

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:58.200
And the fact that you could sort
of speak to someone who

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:02.330
knows that you're a loner, who's
there to help you and

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:05.620
correct you if necessary, I
think that's a good thing, if

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:06.610
you like that sort of thing.

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:07.520
Me, I'm a bit shy.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.140
And I'm like, I don't want
to speak to someone

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:11.360
in my rubbish Spanish.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.970
I'd rather speak
to the machine.

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:14.770
And that's one of the other
good things about online

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:19.880
learning is that you can guide
according to what your

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.190
preferences are.

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:22.580
Me, I don't want to talk
to real people.

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.730
So when I talk to the machine,
it's much better.

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:26.550
MANDY WAITE: One down side of
that is that ultimately when

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:27.860
you're going to speak Spanish,
you're going to be speaking to

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:28.646
other people [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:28.646 --> 00:26:29.640
TRISHA GEE: I know.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.160
But I'll cross that bridge
what I get good enough to

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.300
speak to those people.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:34.760
MANDY WAITE: And just quickly
mention as well, the Open

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.620
University, I'm up on
the Open University

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:38.560
for like five years.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:39.490
TRISHA GEE: Right.

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:41.170
MANDY WAITE: Their materials
and their website and such

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:43.150
like is so well up
to date now.

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:45.235
The materials out there-- they
have Android applications and

00:26:45.235 --> 00:26:47.460
iOS applications for
reading material.

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.800
So they're really up to speed.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.360
They've done a great job of
making things happen.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.097
And I know they're kind of
resource constrained and

00:26:54.097 --> 00:26:55.230
struggling to get budget
and such like.

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:57.420
But they're doing a really,
really good job.

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:59.270
TRISHA GEE: I think having the
different platforms is really

00:26:59.270 --> 00:26:59.950
interesting as well.

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:02.920
I wanted to pick a language
learning tool that I could use

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:06.540
on my phone, on my iPad,
and on my laptop.

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.730
And the only thing that I'm
struggling with is that most

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:10.710
of them don't work offline.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:13.960
And of course in London on the
Tube, you're not online.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.620
And so lots of iPad apps are
great because most of them are

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.990
designed to work
on and offline.

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:20.303
And then you can just
do it like, oh,

00:27:20.303 --> 00:27:21.100
I've got five minutes.

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.200
I'm on the train, and I'll read
this, or I'll do this

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.540
exercise or whatever.

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:25.700
And I think that's something
we didn't

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.830
have three years ago.

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:28.530
MANDY WAITE: Yeah, definitely.

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:30.340
At the same time, I'm
learning Japanese.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:33.962
And I have like six or seven
applications on my Android

00:27:33.962 --> 00:27:37.310
phone that I use constantly when
I'm in situations like

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:38.160
standing up on the train--

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:38.560
TRISHA GEE: Right.

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.120
MANDY WAITE: --and I want
to just quickly test my

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.340
vocabulary or practice my verbs
and that kind of thing,

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:44.650
I just fire up the application
and just stand and do

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:45.465
something useful with
that time--

00:27:45.465 --> 00:27:45.720
TRISHA GEE: Right.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.855
MANDY WAITE: --which otherwise
would have been wasted.

00:27:46.855 --> 00:27:47.490
TRISHA GEE: Yeah, actually.

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:48.990
You'd just be playing Sudoku
on your phone,

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:50.590
which is what I'm doing.

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:53.280
And you wouldn't open up your
laptop and get started on

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:53.870
something which is really--

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:54.090
MANDY WAITE: Exactly.

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:54.293
Yeah.

00:27:54.293 --> 00:27:55.310
Not if you're standing
up definitely.

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:55.710
TRISHA GEE: Yeah.

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:57.140
It just changes the way
that you learn.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.068
It changes everything.

00:27:58.068 --> 00:27:58.299
MANDY WAITE: OK.

00:27:58.299 --> 00:27:58.376
Yeah.

00:27:58.376 --> 00:27:59.460
It's fantastic.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.960
So I guess on that same
subject-- and I think that

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.203
question is kind of a follow up
to this one, but I think we

00:28:04.203 --> 00:28:06.890
can still talk about it-- is
technology is [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:09.610
I think you said it permeates
everything that we do.

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:11.870
It's used to build the fabric
for our clothes.

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:13.665
These fibers that we have in
our clothes are crazy.

00:28:13.665 --> 00:28:15.210
And they're all nanotechnology,

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:15.990
that kind of thing.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:18.620
It's used to process our food.

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:22.380
Hopefully, beef, maybe,
and not horse meat.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:23.540
It's used to condition
our air.

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:29.720
And computer science is really
enabling technology

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:30.470
everywhere.

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:33.380
And it's no longer just about
creating large software

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.820
applications such as
Microsoft Office.

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.190
Computer science and technology
is about a much

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:38.690
larger thing.

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:41.120
It's kind of permeating
everything that we do.

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.388
So what do you see as the role
of computer science in the

00:28:43.388 --> 00:28:44.680
modern world--

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:44.850
TRISHA GEE: Well--

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:45.940
MANDY WAITE: --not
just education?

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:46.081
TRISHA GEE: Yeah.

00:28:46.081 --> 00:28:48.030
I mean I think you
kind of said it.

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:50.205
It's that it's everywhere.

00:28:50.205 --> 00:28:52.310
It impacts everything.

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:55.040
It impacts where you're going
to dig a well in Africa.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.695
It impacts, like you say,
how your clothes

00:28:58.695 --> 00:29:00.260
are designed or how--

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:03.330
I mean, I don't think IKEA could
be as cheap for tables

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:06.170
if they didn't have-- like
they've obviously got CAD

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:08.490
software, but they've probably
got also really cool--

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:09.550
I've seen this at Ford--

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:12.100
they've got cool pieces of
software which design the way

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.870
that you're going to plug stuff
together, tells you the

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:16.510
order in which you should plug
stuff together, and then can

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:18.570
create a manual for that
sort of thing.

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:21.680
And this is the sort of thing
that allows you to then hire a

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.950
particular type of person to be
able to do that very easily

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:26.720
or to sell it to people and
say, look, that's just go.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.530
It's just there for you.

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:32.190
And computer science that's done
right makes all of our

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:33.510
lives easier, right?

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:35.670
But it does mean that there's
actually going to be more and

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:37.570
more computer science type jobs,
and they're all going to

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:39.100
be really different
sorts of jobs.

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.370
So I think that was a worry
maybe in then '90's, maybe in

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:48.200
some of the noughties, that when
we come from coding BASIC

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.360
in the '80s, it was kind of you
knew you could write your

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.140
little application.

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:52.830
It might be a game, or it
might be something.

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:54.778
And you could sort of hold the
whole thing in your head and

00:29:54.778 --> 00:29:57.940
code it all in BASIC, and
you're sort of done.

00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:00.860
In the '90s, things got bigger
and more modular when we

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:03.325
started coding, and we
started using PCs.

00:30:03.325 --> 00:30:05.350
So you couldn't always see what
was under the covers.

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:07.510
You couldn't just type BASIC
into the command line.

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:09.900
And there was this kind of
concern that computer science

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.700
was getting so big and almost so
enterprise that there's no

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:16.260
way you could start really
easily write a little thing

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.390
and grow from there.

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:20.210
Because you were going to have
to be working on Microsoft

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:23.970
Word or some banking payroll
application, or it was going

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:25.770
to be some big enterprise
thing.

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:29.900
I think that everything has
changed in the last decade,

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.840
maybe, because what we've seen
is that some of those things

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.580
have got bigger, and we've
got these platforms.

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:37.670
These things go up here, and
then something has to fill

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:38.320
that space.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.860
And then these things grow
over here into clothing

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:41.440
technology.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:45.120
Or into home automation.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.370
How cool is that?

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:48.730
I can get my iPad, and
I can like open my

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:49.780
curtains from work.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.920
I don't know why I'd need to do
that, but I might need to.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.120
And this is crazy cool stuff.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.220
And Raspberry Pi and
all these things.

00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:59.860
And it allows you to--

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.720
if you're interested in
mechanical stuff, because I

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.930
know some people find
the computer

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:04.450
science a bit abstract--

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:08.040
if you want to see something
happen, you can do robotics

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.620
and Raspberry Pi and
home automation.

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:13.440
If you want to do something
which is quick and visual, you

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:17.270
could do like a Facebook game,
or you could do Android apps

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:19.190
are quite easy to write
and things like that.

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:22.470
But if you want to do something
like really more

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:24.690
mathematical and abstract, you
could go and write the

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:26.080
matching engine in
a bank somewhere

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.030
or a trading algorithm.

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:29.270
It's just so much.

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:31.920
Whatever you want to do, there's
going to be something

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:35.670
there that interests you.

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:37.940
I think that's a message which
isn't really getting across.

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:40.260
I think we still think of
programmers as sort of sitting

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:43.470
down and writing Java code and
writing payroll applications

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:45.405
for banks instead of
thinking about, you

00:31:45.405 --> 00:31:47.480
know, I don't know--

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:48.860
like I said, the home automation
stuff is cool.

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:52.370
I just think that's awesome,
being able to almost program

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:55.060
your own house to do whatever
it wants to, take over the

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:58.030
world, I don't know.

00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:01.820
MANDY WAITE: I guess we've had
conversations about the

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:05.655
creative aspect of computer
science as opposed to

00:32:05.655 --> 00:32:09.360
programming being of itself just
something that you do as

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.150
being a means to an end.

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:11.730
You know, actually there's
something you

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:12.220
can build from it.

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:16.260
It's like knitting or crochet
or Lego bricks.

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:17.610
You can actually build
something with it.

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:20.540
I think there's always been this
kind of illusion that you

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:21.780
can just program.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:25.030
And it didn't have to have an
end goal or have a goal.

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:27.190
But now people are using
it to be creative.

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:31.280
And I think the more of that
that you see everywhere, the

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.810
better it will get, and the
more things will change.

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:35.380
And more people will see that
the options when it comes to

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:37.020
choosing roles within
computer science are

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:38.550
much more varied now.

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:40.390
TRISHA GEE: I think
this is one of my

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:41.540
long-term stretch goals.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.440
I would like Hollywood to change
the image of computer

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.850
programmers.

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:49.210
Because I think they still
portray people as being coding

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:52.710
for the sake of coding or some
sort of magician who does his

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:55.060
magic thing over here and no one
else-- and when I say his,

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:56.520
I obviously mean his--

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:59.980
magic thing over there and no
one else will understand that.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:02.930
No one else understands me,
because I'm a magic, secret

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:03.840
computer programmer.

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:08.280
And I'd like to see people
express how creative it is and

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:13.360
how you can do something because
your mom says I really

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.110
need something to help
map my family tree.

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:18.840
And you can write a
family tree app in

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:20.220
whatever you want to.

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:23.335
I need something which is
like, I don't know--

00:33:23.335 --> 00:33:24.280
like recipe apps.

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.275
I think they're kind of cool.

00:33:25.275 --> 00:33:26.550
Sounds pretty girly,
doesn't it?

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:27.460
No, but, like--

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:28.374
MANDY WAITE: But
they are cool.

00:33:28.374 --> 00:33:29.820
They are cool.

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:31.810
TRISHA GEE: I would love to see
something where you say,

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:33.980
right, I've got these things
in my cupboard.

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:36.520
Can you tell me what
I can make?

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:39.460
And it'll tell you you can make
a Victoria spongecake

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:40.546
with cheese on top.

00:33:40.546 --> 00:33:43.240
That's not quite what
I wanted, but--

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.390
Yeah.

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:48.350
I think it's very,
very creative.

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:50.520
I'd like more people to be aware
of how creative it is.

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:51.306
MANDY WAITE: Yeah, definitely.

00:33:51.306 --> 00:33:52.830
OK.

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:54.300
EMMA JACKSON: So we talked a
little bit about when you were

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.690
talking about your career
path and how you got

00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:58.070
from where you are.

00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:59.430
And it sounded like you've
made these really wise

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:01.700
decisions along the way to sort
of keep your options open

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:04.620
and not to be tied down into
these kind of areas.

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:07.880
But has there been someone
that's influenced your life?

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.380
What's the best advice you've
been given to help you make

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:12.989
those decisions?

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:13.719
TRISHA GEE: I had
lots of advice

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:14.469
along the way, obviously.

00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:19.364
And each bit of advice was the
best advice, given my position

00:34:19.364 --> 00:34:21.840
at that moment in time and for
where I was going to go.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:26.610
So there's two examples,
actually, because in some ways

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:28.389
they're the same, and in some
ways they're different.

00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:31.889
When I started, I worked
at Ford Motor Company.

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:36.070
And there were a lot of guys
there who were from various

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:37.840
consultancies, because they're
one of these large

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.340
organizations that gets
consultants into help them.

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:43.239
And one of the consultants said
to me-- this was my very

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:44.139
first placement.

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:44.769
I was still at university.

00:34:44.769 --> 00:34:47.659
So it was my three-month
vacation placement.

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:53.699
And he said, if you want to get
ahead, you have to play a

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:54.249
bit of politics.

00:34:54.249 --> 00:35:00.280
And I'm like I'm this geek girl
programmer who like likes

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.820
science fiction and the logical
bit of computers, but

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.660
also I'm a creative
artistic type.

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:05.730
I don't want to play politics.

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:07.990
That's exactly what I
don't want to do.

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:11.890
I don't want to play games
and things like that.

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:12.990
But he kind of explained
it to me.

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:16.880
And he said, look, you're in a
difficult position, because

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.110
you're sat behind a computer
all day every day.

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:21.610
And you could be doing the best
work ever, you could be

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:24.200
doing the worst work ever, and
no one will know unless you

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.390
tell people.

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:28.200
You're going to have to tell
people that you're good.

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.670
And I'm like, yeah, but
what if I'm not good?

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:32.390
He said, it doesn't matter.

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:35.490
If you want to get on, you're
going to have to tell people

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:37.640
what you're good at and
how good you are.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.220
And of course, being the sort
of person who doesn't really

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.860
lie about things like that, then
I'll tell them the things

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:42.450
I'm good and the things
I'm bad at.

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:45.990
And to me that translated to
actually just being visible.

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:47.260
So getting involved in--

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:51.515
because I was one of the
undergraduates at Ford, we

00:35:51.515 --> 00:35:52.910
used to rotate between
placements.

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:54.990
So I helped some of the
placement rotation.

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:57.090
And that was self-serving,
because I wanted to make sure

00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:58.180
I got a good placement.

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:01.590
But it was also self-serving
because management would see

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:03.880
these undergraduates are helping
with the process, and

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.720
they have these skills to be

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.360
management material or whatever.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.410
So I got more involved with that
sort of thing just for

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:10.160
the visibility.

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.090
And it ended helping my career,
not just for the

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:14.430
visibility but because
I got a bit more

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:15.360
control over my career.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.590
Because I was in a position
where I could

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:18.430
influence my own career.

00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:19.360
So that was good.

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:22.590
And I learned that politics
does matter if you're a

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:23.360
programmer.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.530
And that's kind of depressing.

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:26.950
But I'm sorry, but that's
just the way it is.

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:29.140
The other best piece of advice
I have which changed my life

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:33.320
in the last two years is I was
complaining about one of the

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.220
conferences--

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:34.990
when would this be?

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:37.070
Maybe three years ago,
maybe two years ago.

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:38.450
Not that long ago.

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:42.260
One of the conferences only
had white men speaking.

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:45.160
And actually, there was a woman,
but she didn't have her

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:45.840
icon up there.

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.820
So you couldn't see her
face in this whole

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:49.840
sea of white males.

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.340
So I was complaining about
this to Martin Fowler who

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:54.340
works at ThoughtWorks.

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:57.240
And he'd come over to
ThoughtWorks UK, and he was

00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:58.610
meeting with a few people.

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:00.760
And I was really star struck,
because I'm like, this is like

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.470
Martin Fowler.

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:03.180
He's written books
and everything.

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:04.970
And I was complaining
about this thing.

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:07.640
And he said, well, why don't
you volunteer to speak?

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.192
And I was like, well.

00:37:09.192 --> 00:37:10.640
He said, well, look.

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:13.510
You're in absolutely the right
position to change that.

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:16.220
You are a female technical
person.

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:20.290
And the conference organizers
don't think they've excluded

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:22.530
people like you on purpose.

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:24.820
If you go to them and say, can
I talk, and they say no, then

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:26.010
you can start saying, oh, these

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:27.050
people are really unfair.

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:30.990
But don't just complain to me in
a pub about there not being

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:33.362
enough women speakers
when you're a woman.

00:37:33.362 --> 00:37:34.570
I was like, oh, OK.

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:40.930
So by the end of that year
another colleague-- my boss,

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:42.380
actually-- was speaking
at Java One.

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:43.300
And he said, do you want
to come up and

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:44.360
co-present with me?

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:49.030
And I was like, no,
don't be silly.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:53.970
And because of what Martin
Fowler had said and because of

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:57.410
the original comment about
being visible and about

00:37:57.410 --> 00:37:59.360
telling people--

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:03.970
giving visibility on what you
may or may not be good at and

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:07.470
because it scared
the absolute--

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:10.660
I was like that sounds like a
really terrible thing to do--

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:13.220
I said yes, and I did it.

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.860
And that's why I am where I am
right now, because I decided,

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:19.215
oh, this is quite-- it's not
easy by any means-- but this

00:38:19.215 --> 00:38:20.110
is quite good actually.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:24.610
And you get to travel and meet
people and talk to them.

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:27.570
And that's as much fun as
programming in some ways.

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:30.490
And that's how I
got my new job.

00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:33.030
MANDY WAITE: I think it's kind
of something that's kind of

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:34.510
ingrained in us when
we're young that we

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:35.430
can't change things.

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:37.620
The world is the way it
is, and we can't do

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:38.380
anything about it.

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.860
And I think my time at Google,
I've found that I can actually

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:42.370
change things--

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:44.910
and probably for the first time
in my life-- that I can

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:46.720
say, we're not doing
this right.

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:47.450
Let's do it differently.

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:49.430
And people would listen
and take action.

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:53.240
I think it's something that it
takes a long time and a lot of

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.930
experience to realize what
you can actually do.

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:57.970
And it probably takes some
successes as well.

00:38:57.970 --> 00:38:59.390
You can probably
get frustrated.

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:00.030
I need to change that.

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:01.240
I can't change it.

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.640
There's no way for
me to change it.

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.820
But then when the opportunity
comes along and you take it,

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:07.640
then it can be really enabling,
because suddenly you

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.220
realize you can change pretty
much everything.

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:10.450
It can be pretty [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:10.950
TRISHA GEE: Yeah, exactly.

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:15.220
And I think that as technical
programming type people, we're

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:16.970
almost exactly the right people
to change things.

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:20.640
We're used to taking a piece
of code and changing it or

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:21.640
getting it to work in
a different way.

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.120
We're used to systems
thinking.

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:26.110
We're used to thinking, OK, this
goes to this goes to this

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:27.800
goes to this consequently
that.

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:28.680
Oh, that's not right.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:29.740
Let's do this.

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:31.910
And we're exactly the right
people to go, OK, so if this

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:34.900
is what's happening, if this is
how things work, it doesn't

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:36.030
have to work that way.

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:39.510
My job is to change stuff,
whether it's at the byte level

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:41.620
or whether it's people level.

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:44.510
If you present to people
sometimes the system that has

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:46.360
led to this conclusion and say,
well, you know what, if

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.430
we did this bit a little
bit differently,

00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:49.070
things might change.

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:50.840
People will go, oh, OK.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.700
But as you said, successes
are kind of important.

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:54.680
And the first few times
you do that--

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:56.970
first many times you do that--
chances are pretty good

00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:58.680
someone will say what
do you know.

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.890
And then that's fine,
because you haven't

00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:01.680
proved anything yet.

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:02.990
You just have to keep
doing until you

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:04.410
get a couple of successes.

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:06.410
And then when you've got a few
successes you say, well, I

00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:07.880
don't know anything about
it, but I did this over

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:10.430
here, and it worked.

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:12.860
Just keep going.

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:14.320
MANDY WAITE: I think that brings
me onto one of the

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.140
questions I kind of pulled from
your bio because you said

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:18.200
something that is obviously
important to you.

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:21.340
You believe that people
shouldn't always have to make

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:23.300
the same mistakes
again and again.

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:25.990
So my question to you is do
you mean that by this we

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:28.490
should learn from our own
experiences, or do you mean

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:30.760
that through sharing, knowledge,
and experience we

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:33.695
can help others not to make the
same mistakes again and

00:40:33.695 --> 00:40:34.820
again and again?

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.990
TRISHA GEE: Well,
both of course.

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:39.820
I mean, how often do you kick
yourself when you've made the

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:40.990
same mistake the third time?

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:42.930
I don't necessarily mean
mistyping the wrong thing.

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:44.110
It might be mistyping
the wrong thing.

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:45.060
Or it might be--

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:47.056
MANDY WAITE: Remove
minus r star and--

00:40:47.056 --> 00:40:47.254
TRISHA GEE: Yeah.

00:40:47.254 --> 00:40:47.386
Oh, god.

00:40:47.386 --> 00:40:48.180
I've done that.

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:49.440
I've done that in a--

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:50.180
MANDY WAITE: You only
do that once.

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:50.620
TRISHA GEE: --production--

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:51.910
Yes, you only do that once.

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:53.300
I've done that in a
production-like environment,

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:55.240
and I've never made the
same mistake again.

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:55.590
So, yeah.

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:57.930
I mean, you always want to learn
from your own mistakes.

00:40:57.930 --> 00:41:01.880
And it might be dumb stuff like
I came into work when I

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.590
was feeling ill again, and I'm
not doing anything again.

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:07.390
Next time I'm not going
to do that.

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:10.300
But I feel quite a lot like I've
learned a lot of things

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:10.990
the hard way.

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:12.470
I mean, I've had good
advice from various

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:13.590
people along the way.

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:15.610
But like I said, it always seems
to be sort of just in

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:16.740
time advice.

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:19.890
And I kind of feel like some
of the stuff that I learned

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:22.880
the hard way without that
advice, I'd like to tell

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:26.500
graduates or undergraduates
or kids that stuff now.

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:27.320
Not like everything.

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.030
I don't need to download
12 years of

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:30.280
experience into their brains.

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:37.430
Because I was always
on this sort of

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:38.740
one to two year horizon.

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:41.520
I was always frantically trying
to take chances to make

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:42.650
sure they didn't escape.

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:44.780
I have to do this, this, this,
and this because I might never

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:46.590
get a chance to do
it ever again.

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:49.540
And it's not true, because
you'll come back later.

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:54.350
Your career works in cycles and
your life works in cycles.

00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:56.160
And a chance, if it's
the right chance,

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:56.920
will come up again.

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:59.720
Or it disappears off the radar,
and it turns out it

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:00.970
wasn't that important anyway.

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:13.140
I'd like to share with people,
yeah, lots of stuff I kind of

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:13.670
learned the hard way.

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:17.520
But it's not like this is how
you do domain-driven design.

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:20.580
It's more like this is what you
might want to bear in mind

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:21.300
when you manage your career.

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:22.960
Not like this is how you
manage you're career.

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.870
But, don't worry about this.

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:25.700
Do worry about that.

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:25.990
This is important.

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:27.230
MANDY WAITE: The kind
of Confucian wisdom.

00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:29.890
It's like you're kind
of making a point.

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:33.160
And that you can apply this to
your life in some way, but

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.660
it's not a kind of rigid thing
that you have to kind of

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:35.490
adhere to completely.

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:36.000
TRISHA GEE: Right.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.620
It's much more like a set
of things that have you

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:39.700
considered this?

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:42.075
Did you think about that?

00:42:42.075 --> 00:42:46.220
If there is a question, your
correct answer might be yes or

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:48.430
your correct answer might be no,
but the point is did you

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:49.667
consider the question?

00:42:49.667 --> 00:42:50.054
MANDY WAITE: OK.

00:42:50.054 --> 00:42:50.830
EMMA JACKSON: I like
that approach.

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:53.210
I know you're talking about
learning from mistakes.

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:56.210
It's probably things that-- we
talked about successes and how

00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:58.372
that propels you forward some
way, but often you probably

00:42:58.372 --> 00:43:00.560
learn more from your
failures than your

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:01.670
successes in a lot of ways.

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:03.255
And it's good to share that
with others and--

00:43:03.255 --> 00:43:03.710
MANDY WAITE: Absolutely.

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:04.600
TRISHA GEE: I think so.

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:08.300
And in fact, I proposed a track
at QCon London called--

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:10.900
well, it was going to be called
Learning From Failure,

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:12.310
because when you go
to conferences--

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:14.110
and I've been to a few in
the last year or so--

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:16.745
you get a lot of people saying,
we did this this way,

00:43:16.745 --> 00:43:17.680
and it worked.

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.810
And you're like, great,
but we're not you.

00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:21.110
We don't have your team.

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:23.090
We don't use those
technologies.

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:24.440
What lessons am I going
to take from

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.840
this particular thing?

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:29.090
So I said how about we have a
few brave souls step up and

00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:32.500
say, we did this, and it was
rubbish, and we tried that,

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:35.710
and it didn't work?

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:38.040
We experimented with this
technology, and it didn't work

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.010
for us because--

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:41.740
not like this technology's
rubbish, but because we didn't

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:43.610
consider the business needs,
or our team wasn't

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:45.090
skilled on it, or--

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:47.550
And I think that it's much
easier to learn from those

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:48.580
things than it is--

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:51.153
because I reckon for every
success, there's got to be, I

00:43:51.153 --> 00:43:52.780
don't know, 90 failures.

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:56.480
Even if it's two failures, the
number of failures massively

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.000
outweighs the number
of successes.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.060
And learning from that one
success that happened in one

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:04.090
time and at one place with
those people, you can't--

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:05.970
if you reproduce what
happened to get

00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:07.600
there, you'll get there.

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:08.570
And they're already there.

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:09.970
You don't want to be there.

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:11.330
You want to be where
you want to be.

00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:14.860
So you want to make sure that
you don't do the failure stuff

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:16.546
that happened around
those cases.

00:44:16.546 --> 00:44:16.900
EMMA JACKSON: Yeah.

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:20.343
I like to talk about that too,
because, I don't know, you

00:44:20.343 --> 00:44:23.330
might get disheartened if you
sort of try something that

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:25.522
doesn't work, and you make these
mistakes and just to not

00:44:25.522 --> 00:44:26.820
let it set you back.

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:28.440
That's a key piece
of going forward.

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:30.612
TRISHA GEE: It's as an easy
thing to say to say, oh, don't

00:44:30.612 --> 00:44:31.020
worry about it.

00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:33.300
But like, but I am
worried about it.

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:34.840
And you should worry about it.

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:36.820
Because if you don't think about
it, you will make the

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:37.470
same mistake again.

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:40.600
But I think this is particularly
important for--

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.260
this is going to be a gross
generalization and

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:42.810
stereotype--

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:44.700
but for British people
because the

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:46.360
Americans are a bit better.

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:49.150
Americans, specifically, are a
bit better at understanding

00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:50.800
that success comes
with a price.

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:52.870
And you could have nine start-up
failures, and the

00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:54.730
10th one might be
the right one.

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:55.950
And they're OK with that.

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:59.130
They're kind of OK with trying
again and again and again.

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:02.310
I think for the Brits, if you
fail one, it's like, oh, well.

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:04.530
If you fail twice, it's like,
well, you're never going to

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:05.910
get anywhere, right.

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:09.820
And I think that we should be
much better at saying, yes,

00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:11.425
but the second time I failed,
I didn't fail

00:45:11.425 --> 00:45:12.420
for the same reason.

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:13.930
And the third time I fail,
it'll be for a different

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:16.890
reason again, and to see that
incremental change.

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:17.383
MANDY WAITE: Interesting.

00:45:17.383 --> 00:45:17.876
Yeah.

00:45:17.876 --> 00:45:19.830
OK.

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:23.330
So I guess one other question
I have, probably the last

00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:26.370
question, is talking about
role models, which is

00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:29.260
primarily for me one of the
main reasons we do Women

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:32.080
Techmakers is present people
with role models.

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.630
So how do you think we can do
more to establish, using

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:37.640
programs like Women Techmakers
and such like that, establish

00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:41.660
role models, aspirational
people, to young people

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:44.870
looking to decide whether to get
into technology, to choose

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:48.260
technology as an educational
path or career path?

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:50.580
What more can we do to establish
role models for

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:52.160
young people?

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:53.610
TRISHA GEE: I think there's
two sides to it.

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:57.430
I think lots of organizations,
lots of communities, lots of

00:45:57.430 --> 00:46:00.985
educational groups are very keen
on creating and promoting

00:46:00.985 --> 00:46:03.140
role models-- well, not creating
them, finding them

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:04.040
and promoting them.

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:07.470
But I think that the thing that
I've been trying to tell

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:11.820
people is to tell people that
they are role models.

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:15.780
Because you get people saying,
yes, I think we should have

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:16.310
more women.

00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:20.010
Or yes, we should have less
white people at the top.

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:22.540
And I'm like, yeah, but
you're a woman.

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:23.750
Do you want to come and talk
at this conference?

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:25.000
No.

00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:30.360
I mean, I don't even want to
really talk about the race

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:34.970
thing because we're all like
white, right, but if people

00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:38.270
start complaining about their
particular minority being not

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:40.900
well represented, like I was
complaining about no women

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:44.790
speakers, then it's really
up to you to step up and

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:46.000
represent that--

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.930
well, OK, so yes you can
represent that minority.

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:50.980
And one of the things that makes
me really uncomfortable

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:53.700
is every time someone asks me to
speak for women developers.

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:55.960
OK, yeah, but I can't
really do that.

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.280
I can speak for me.

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:00.840
And I am a woman developer,
and some people might find

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:01.880
that what I say is the truth.

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.720
And some people might go,
I completely disagree.

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:06.990
If someone completely disagrees
with my viewpoint

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:09.520
and completely disagrees with
me representing women

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:12.700
techmakers, then I would love
to see them step up and

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:13.730
represent their viewpoint.

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:14.480
And that's great.

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:16.640
It gives you the balance
and say there's

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:17.630
more than one of us.

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:19.870
We do lots of different
things.

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:23.120
So I think people need to step
up the same way I was

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.060
told to step up.

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:26.980
I think that you can do it.

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:28.290
It is important.

00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:30.380
And you are a role model.

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:32.880
And you're a role model probably
because you're not

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:35.080
like everyone else, probably
because there isn't someone

00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:38.820
out there who looks like you.

00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:42.130
And if you step up and you are
that role model, you get to

00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:43.090
represent your viewpoint.

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:46.085
It's the same thing I said about
the getting involved in

00:47:46.085 --> 00:47:48.020
the rotations thing, right?

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:49.810
By stepping up and representing
your viewpoint

00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:52.940
and having a voice, you get to
change things so that it works

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:53.880
for you, right?

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:55.820
So you could do it for all those
people who want to look

00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:57.540
at you and be a role model if
you want, but basically it's

00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:57.965
good for you.

00:47:57.965 --> 00:47:58.390
MANDY WAITE: Completely.

00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:59.240
Yeah.

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:02.565
EMMA JACKSON: It's great
inspiring words to end on.

00:48:02.565 --> 00:48:03.850
MANDY WAITE: So I guess my last
point is when are you

00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:05.450
going to Mars?

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:06.200
I want to go with you.

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:08.060
TRISHA GEE: Maybe next year.

00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:09.280
MANDY WAITE: I'm really
keen to go to Mars.

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:11.280
Even if it's a one-way trip.

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:11.970
I'd probably go.

00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:12.440
TRISHA GEE: I know.

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:13.650
I thought about terraforming
Mars.

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:15.610
How cool would that be and
being like a colonist?

00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:16.740
That'd be awesome.

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:19.960
But I actually spoke to
some NASA people at--

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:21.260
when was that--

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:22.840
[INAUDIBLE] last year.

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:25.690
They had some NASA people coming
in doing some of the

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:27.720
coding for kids at
[INAUDIBLE].

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.340
And I was like, can I
have a job in NASA?

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:31.140
Please, please, please?

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:33.715
And they said, do you have
an American green card?

00:48:33.715 --> 00:48:35.280
I said no.

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.260
Oh, well.

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:39.660
We do have some people in some
university in London doing

00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:40.100
some coding.

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:42.590
I said, yeah, but I don't really
want to be stuck in

00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:44.750
some university in London doing
some coding, not that

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:45.700
there's anything wrong
with that.

00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:47.416
I want to go to Mars.

00:48:47.416 --> 00:48:49.225
MANDY WAITE: You should join
the British space program.

00:48:49.225 --> 00:48:51.100
TRISHA GEE: Didn't they collapse
that a few years ago?

00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:52.456
MANDY WAITE: They
may have one.

00:48:52.456 --> 00:48:52.910
We should have one.

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:53.720
We should have a secret one.

00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:55.190
TRISHA GEE: We should
have one.

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:56.440
MANDY WAITE: We should
probably form one.

00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:57.840
TRISHA GEE: That's
my next startup.

00:48:57.840 --> 00:48:58.340
EMMA JACKSON: Yeah.

00:48:58.340 --> 00:48:59.340
That would be good.

00:48:59.340 --> 00:48:59.460
MANDY WAITE: OK.

00:48:59.460 --> 00:48:59.900
Well, brilliant.

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:01.950
So, thank you ever
so much, Trisha.

00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:03.070
It's been really wonderful
talking to you.

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:04.590
It's been such a lot of fun.

00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:06.428
I don't know how long this has
gone on for but [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:06.428 --> 00:49:07.820
TRISHA GEE: It's been fun.

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:09.670
MANDY WAITE: So that's
awesome.

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:10.000
OK.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.720
So that's the end of our session
with Trisha Gee.

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:13.980
Thanks for joining us.

00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:18.137
And look out for more sessions
from the UK Women Techmakers.

00:49:18.137 --> 00:49:19.510
EMMA JACKSON: From
Campus London.

00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:20.230
Thanks.

00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.540
MANDY WAITE: Cheers.

00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:21.790
Bye-bye.

00:49:25.348 --> 00:49:26.598
Fantastic.
