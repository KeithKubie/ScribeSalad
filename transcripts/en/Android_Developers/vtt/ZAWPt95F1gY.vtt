00:00:04.857 --> 00:00:06.940
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Hi,
this is Natalie Villalobos

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.000
from Big Android
BBQ in Hurst, Texas,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.860
and I'm here with Marie Schweiz.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.500
She is a visiting designer.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.710
She's a speaker here
at Big Android BBQ,

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.170
and I wanted to just
get some inside tips,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.820
so that all designers
of the world

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.030
know how to best
design for Android.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.900
Welcome, Marie.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.040
MARIE SCHWEIZ: Hi.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.206
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: So, can
you tell us a little bit

00:00:25.206 --> 00:00:26.910
about how you got into design?

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.701
MARIE SCHWEIZ: I was
a front end developer.

00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:32.759
I earned my little money
with HTML and markup.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.160
And I tried to
get to university.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.060
At that point, agencies
were too interested in me,

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.150
and I already got a
job as a designer,

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.300
because I had too
much talent for that.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.384
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: So what was
your first successful project?

00:00:46.384 --> 00:00:47.800
MARIE SCHWEIZ:
What is successful?

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.175
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Well, you
could also say challenging,

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:52.620
but I thought successful might
have a good story with it.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.370
MARIE SCHWEIZ: My first
successful project

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.300
was, I think, on Android, with
a hacker community in Berlin,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.950
Blinkendroid.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.080
I helped them to
clean up the interface

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.577
and we had a world
record, I think.

00:01:04.577 --> 00:01:06.160
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
A world record of?

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.076
MARIE SCHWEIZ: They're
holding a world record.

00:01:08.076 --> 00:01:11.090
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: For the
hackathon, or maybe apps built?

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.100
MARIE SCHWEIZ: No, Blinkendroid
is an application where phones

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.660
build a huge mosaic
off tiny displays,

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.600
and they built the
biggest one, so I just

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.342
helped them to clean up.

00:01:22.342 --> 00:01:23.800
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Can you tell us

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.340
what the mosaic image was of?

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.702
MARIE SCHWEIZ: I think an image
of our hacker's base in Berlin.

00:01:29.702 --> 00:01:30.660
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: OK.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.867
So not like the Mona Lisa.

00:01:31.867 --> 00:01:33.450
MARIE SCHWEIZ: Not
like the Mona Lisa.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.750
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: All right.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.870
But just as cool.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.480
How many people participate in
the hacker community in Berlin?

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.294
MARIE SCHWEIZ: Oh, I can't say.

00:01:41.294 --> 00:01:43.210
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Because it's confidential?

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.910
MARIE SCHWEIZ: No,
not confidential.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:45.620
It's too huge.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.030
If you take, for instance,
the [? C base ?] in Berlin,

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.610
they have 500 members.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.560
And from 500 members,
100 are active per week.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.185
You don't know how many members
are actually living and working

00:02:01.185 --> 00:02:01.903
in Berlin.

00:02:01.903 --> 00:02:03.027
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Got it.

00:02:03.027 --> 00:02:05.640
And so, if a
designer were wanting

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.520
to start building for
Android, or just stepping

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.230
into their career, what are
some of the tips and tricks

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.111
that you would give a designer
that's just getting started?

00:02:15.111 --> 00:02:17.610
MARIE SCHWEIZ: I would say, try
to befriend your colleagues,

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.140
because collaboration is
all you have to learn.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.550
And very often designers stay
in their own comfort zone

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.280
and in their own space.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.620
And the best you can do is
pick your colleague's mind,

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.330
and start learning about
the technology itself.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.290
You don't have to code it, but
you have to learn what it is.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.957
I think that's the best advice
I can give to young designers.

00:02:39.957 --> 00:02:41.540
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Yeah, I absolutely

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.650
agree on the
collaboration front.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.520
Designers are integral
to the process

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.960
of creating a beautiful
mobile app, or, I think,

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.520
really any successful
technology project.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.180
I think a lot of times
developers and software

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.790
engineers don't really know
that-- just how integral you

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.730
are to the success.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.720
MARIE SCHWEIZ: A designer has
an empathy role in a team.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.590
He is using a lot of empathy
to design and create,

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.860
and he's using empathy
to communicate.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.469
So that's some sort of
part of our job, I think.

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:13.510
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.470
And so, your talk
yesterday was a bit

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.590
about creating beautiful,
intuitive user experiences.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.790
Can you tell us a little
bit about your talk,

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.280
and what you wanted the
audience to walk away with?

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.030
MARIE SCHWEIZ: OK.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.610
I was talking about
animation for interfaces,

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.250
and very often I get,
OK, that's too expensive,

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.760
that's too complicated,
we should do it later

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.570
when time is left.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.600
And my point is, that's
the wrong approach.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.900
It's one of the most important
and powerful tools we have,

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.160
and it's not very
complicated to do.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.630
And I was showing
the audience how

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.542
to do it with just
pen and paper,

00:03:50.542 --> 00:03:51.750
and they shouldn't be afraid.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.450
And I had a lot of
developers in my talk,

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.040
so I was encouraging
them to join the topic,

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.872
and be designers, and
do interaction design.

00:04:03.872 --> 00:04:06.080
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: One of
the points that you hit on

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.820
was, really, that
anyone can animate.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.210
And I think that the
prototyping element

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.920
of what you were gifting to the
audience was really important.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.269
I think a lot of people
can feel overwhelmed

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.560
with being an artist, right?

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.840
If maybe that's not
their first calling.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.150
So, do you have any tips
of overcoming that fear?

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.900
MARIE SCHWEIZ: Yes and no.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.530
Overcoming, being a good artist,
is something about practice,

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.000
practice, practice.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.910
And I was just
recently asked, how

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.420
did you become as good
as you are right now?

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.110
And I just said, stubbornness.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.980
Stubbornness,
stubbornness, stubbornness.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.600
You have to practice.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.260
That's how it is.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.020
And all I can say is,
don't be afraid of failing,

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.665
because in every discipline
you have to fail.

00:04:55.665 --> 00:04:57.040
And if you look
at great artists,

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.910
you can see they
had their time, too.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.610
So look at them.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.320
Look deeply and ask them.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.410
They will encourage you.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.580
That's what I can promise.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.510
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Do
you think that having

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.520
a more beautiful, well
designed, intuitive app

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.370
will lead to more successful
apps and, therefore, more money

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.995
for developers?

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.610
MARIE SCHWEIZ: It happened--
I just know that works.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.230
This is what I would
tell my clients.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.330
I just say, you know what?

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.350
If you want to have more
money, we need to do this.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.580
That's just how it is.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.880
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Awesome.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.004
No, I really appreciate it.

00:05:34.004 --> 00:05:36.170
So I guess that's really
the pro-tip, right?

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.252
Incorporating design.

00:05:37.252 --> 00:05:38.710
And I think a lot
of the principles

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.970
that you touched on yesterday
in your talk-- which

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.279
is online somewhere right?

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:43.070
MARIE SCHWEIZ: Yes.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.830
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: OK, great.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:44.230
So--

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.430
MARIE SCHWEIZ: It's recorded.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.013
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: I think if
people look at your principles,

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:50.940
they too can incorporate
design from a prototyping side,

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.830
bring it into development,
and then, long-term,

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.480
they'll be more successful as
developers because of a lot

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.990
of the--

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.656
MARIE SCHWEIZ: Not
just more successful.

00:05:59.656 --> 00:06:03.220
What I say is, throwing
all the technology

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.170
you have into your application
doesn't make it better,

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.920
and it doesn't make
it cheaper to develop.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.110
It makes it more expensive.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.630
I was picking on the
name "meaningful."

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.030
Make it meaningful.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.660
As soon as you have a
meaningful application

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.940
and a meaningful design, you
can have less development time,

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.820
less cost, and still
the same success.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.376
So it's, I would
say, optimization.

00:06:28.376 --> 00:06:30.250
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: And
so, are you for hire?

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.405
Like, if people want to bring--

00:06:31.405 --> 00:06:31.920
MARIE SCHWEIZ: I'm a freelancer.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.169
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: All right.

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:36.697
So hopefully the developers
of the world reach out to you.

00:06:36.697 --> 00:06:38.155
Can you tell us
your Twitter handle

00:06:38.155 --> 00:06:41.090
and where we can see
more about your work?

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.690
MARIE SCHWEIZ: I'm reachable
on G+ as Marie Schweiz.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:45.692
That's how I work.

00:06:45.692 --> 00:06:47.400
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
What is your website?

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.605
MARIE SCHWEIZ: My
website is dvsty.com.

00:06:50.605 --> 00:06:54.051
So my brand is diversity.

00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:56.425
That's how I'm reachable, and
where you can find my talk.

00:06:56.425 --> 00:06:57.280
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Awesome.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.240
Well, thanks so much for
sitting down with us today.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.614
And thank you so much for
flying all the way from Germany

00:07:01.614 --> 00:07:02.969
to be here at Big Android BBQ.

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:04.260
MARIE SCHWEIZ: It's a pleasure.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.824
Thank you.

00:07:04.824 --> 00:07:07.240
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: So, again,
this is Natalie Villalobos,

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.740
sitting here with
Marie Schweiz, who

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.591
is a successful, freelance,
interaction visual designer,

00:07:12.591 --> 00:07:14.340
who's visiting us here
at Big Android BBQ.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:14.930
Stay tuned.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.050
We're going to have more great
interviews coming up soon.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.000
