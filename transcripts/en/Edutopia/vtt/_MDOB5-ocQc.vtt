00:00:05.086 --> 00:00:07.616
&gt;&gt;Pam: One of the things that we've
discovered is that Maker Education

00:00:07.616 --> 00:00:10.806
with kids gets them engaged, gets
them passionate about the work,

00:00:10.806 --> 00:00:13.526
gives them opportunities to pursue
things that they're interested in.

00:00:13.526 --> 00:00:19.236
And as a result, it really raises the
level of work that kids are doing,

00:00:19.376 --> 00:00:20.576
and it starts to make sense.

00:00:20.816 --> 00:00:22.316
School makes sense.

00:00:32.875 --> 00:00:34.236
&gt;&gt;Ali: This is actually my
first year at this school.

00:00:34.236 --> 00:00:38.276
I thought this would be a great
program that they're doing here,

00:00:38.276 --> 00:00:41.556
letting you build your own stuff, and
have more freedom than other schools.

00:00:41.906 --> 00:00:43.786
I feel like I'm learning
way more doing this.

00:00:44.156 --> 00:00:46.606
&gt;&gt;Ira: When we tell students what to do,

00:00:47.106 --> 00:00:49.776
all they're learning
is to comply with us.

00:00:50.496 --> 00:00:55.106
But there's nothing more powerful to
build that sense of intrinsic motivation

00:00:55.106 --> 00:00:57.696
than making something that
really matters to you.

00:00:58.296 --> 00:01:00.096
&gt;&gt;Nick: And these are your analog pins.

00:01:00.506 --> 00:01:02.606
This is my Pitcher Helper.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:06.226
It has eleven lasers
right here on your side,

00:01:06.226 --> 00:01:08.136
and seven lasers on the
bottom right here.

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:11.986
And they both shoot up into
some photo resisters right here.

00:01:11.986 --> 00:01:13.926
&gt;&gt;Terry: The sixth grade,
we really struggled.

00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:18.456
He struggled in science and
math a little bit last year.

00:01:18.456 --> 00:01:20.036
&gt;&gt;Nick: Usually, I just
wake up, be like, "Well,

00:01:20.036 --> 00:01:21.136
why do I want to go to school?

00:01:21.196 --> 00:01:23.176
All we're going to do
is sit in the class."

00:01:23.426 --> 00:01:26.996
Mr. Redder in the Technology Room
says, "Learn with your hands."

00:01:27.176 --> 00:01:29.116
And I built the entire code by myself.

00:01:29.336 --> 00:01:32.186
I'm pretty proud, because I
didn't think I could get anything

00:01:32.186 --> 00:01:33.446
of this caliber done.

00:01:33.896 --> 00:01:36.286
&gt;&gt;Terry: That really
lit a fire under him.

00:01:37.106 --> 00:01:41.176
I knew he had it in him, I just
didn't think I'd see it so quickly.

00:01:41.416 --> 00:01:42.906
You know, it's kind of open
your eyes a little bit.

00:01:43.126 --> 00:01:44.716
Like there are other
ways of doing things.

00:01:45.476 --> 00:01:49.366
&gt;&gt;Ira: He's just learning because he's
doing something that matters to him.

00:01:49.926 --> 00:01:51.026
And that's what we believe in.

00:01:52.296 --> 00:01:56.096
&gt;&gt;Pam: Making provides a
different pathway to learning.

00:01:56.496 --> 00:01:59.326
And one off the things that we
know as we watch our kids make,

00:01:59.656 --> 00:02:03.986
they oftentimes are bringing in
all of the different content areas.

00:02:03.986 --> 00:02:06.766
But what it's doing is giving
them a context for learning.

00:02:06.766 --> 00:02:07.726
&gt;&gt;Eric: Right, it'll be
a little bit shorter.

00:02:08.236 --> 00:02:12.226
&gt;&gt;Eric: I had a girl last year who
was redoing some stools for us.

00:02:12.456 --> 00:02:15.736
And we were measuring the circles,
and as she's cutting them, she goes,

00:02:16.086 --> 00:02:17.946
"This is the thing we did in geometry!"

00:02:18.116 --> 00:02:20.706
That she did fine on her
homeworks, got an A in the class.

00:02:20.706 --> 00:02:25.346
But not until she was making this really
beautiful stool did she say, "Holy-moly!

00:02:25.346 --> 00:02:28.106
This makes sense!"

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:30.876
&gt;&gt;Karen: What I think is
probably the most impactful

00:02:30.986 --> 00:02:34.336
to me is watching the students
who come in in a classroom

00:02:34.336 --> 00:02:36.426
who haven't felt really
successful in school.

00:02:36.546 --> 00:02:38.496
All of a sudden, these kids who
might struggle with reading,

00:02:38.496 --> 00:02:41.186
but who are really strong at
building something with their hands,

00:02:41.186 --> 00:02:44.266
where they can kind of envision things
three steps ahead, they're starting

00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:45.656
to be looked at by other
kids, like, "Wow!

00:02:45.656 --> 00:02:46.666
I didn't know you could do that!"

00:02:46.986 --> 00:02:50.196
Because just they had not had an
opportunity necessarily to show

00:02:50.546 --> 00:02:52.226
that kind of strength that they had.

00:02:52.416 --> 00:02:54.096
&gt;&gt;Student: We need to make
that a little longer than that.

00:02:54.096 --> 00:02:56.966
&gt;&gt;Kendra: We were able to see some
kids that were building aqueducts.

00:02:56.966 --> 00:02:58.556
Well, last year this time, four

00:02:58.556 --> 00:03:01.746
of those students were having
major behavior problems

00:03:01.746 --> 00:03:03.726
about this time of the school year.

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:07.416
So it just shows the
power of engagement.

00:03:07.416 --> 00:03:08.416
The power of choice.

00:03:08.416 --> 00:03:09.646
And Maker allows for that.

00:03:09.996 --> 00:03:13.386
&gt;&gt;Pam: The choice in the kinds
of projects that kids do is one

00:03:13.386 --> 00:03:15.036
of the things that we
believe is really critical.

00:03:15.036 --> 00:03:17.646
That kids should have a
chance to really think about,

00:03:17.646 --> 00:03:21.036
"How do I want to show what
it is that I'm learning here?"

00:03:21.036 --> 00:03:24.446
&gt;&gt;Jack: We're building
a coliseum from Rome.

00:03:24.446 --> 00:03:30.106
&gt;&gt;Alexis: I really like architectural
structures, and hands-on things.

00:03:30.156 --> 00:03:34.236
&gt;&gt;Jackson: Minecraft is a game that
you use blocks to build things.

00:03:34.806 --> 00:03:39.096
So we're building a Roman
coliseum in Minecraft.

00:03:39.176 --> 00:03:40.976
&gt;&gt;Pam: What we try to do is
to give the kids the tools.

00:03:40.976 --> 00:03:46.286
And that can be as simple as cardboard,
or as sophisticated as 3D printers,

00:03:46.386 --> 00:03:50.796
and music production studios, and
basically say, "Let's turn people loose

00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:52.436
and unleash the potential to make."

00:03:52.836 --> 00:04:01.256
&gt;&gt;Kolion: What I do with my
school work, is I rap everything.

00:04:01.396 --> 00:04:04.836
I started writing music to
my homework assignments,

00:04:04.836 --> 00:04:08.156
and then now they say I can
write my music to projects.

00:04:08.286 --> 00:04:10.766
&gt;&gt;Kolion: I would never
have a grade by me.

00:04:11.006 --> 00:04:15.346
Get in a couple bands now, Making me so
lifting my grades for a couple of fans.

00:04:15.426 --> 00:04:18.096
&gt;&gt;Kolion: There's one way
of learning things is listen

00:04:18.096 --> 00:04:19.496
to somebody else explain it to you.

00:04:19.816 --> 00:04:23.006
But if you do it yourself, look up
your own research and everything else,

00:04:23.006 --> 00:04:24.536
you start getting it by yourself,

00:04:24.536 --> 00:04:27.266
and it helps you progress
and remember it better.

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:28.646
&gt;&gt;Kolion: Because I'm
working hard.

00:04:28.826 --> 00:04:30.426
My stress is finally running out.

00:04:30.456 --> 00:04:33.946
&gt;&gt;Pam: And so for me, it's not
about the cardboard or the glue gun.

00:04:33.946 --> 00:04:35.886
When kids become agents
of their own learning,

00:04:35.886 --> 00:04:39.706
when they embrace their own learning,
when they own their future, that,

00:04:39.926 --> 00:04:46.676
for me, is giving kids a lifetime
off learning that will carry them

00:04:46.676 --> 00:04:50.726
through job after job; through learning
experience after learning experience

00:04:50.836 --> 00:04:54.156
into workforce; into
post-secondary education;

00:04:54.156 --> 00:04:55.866
into their homes; into
their communities.

00:04:56.066 --> 00:04:57.106
It's all important.

00:04:57.106 --> 00:04:57.696
&gt;&gt;Student: Wrapping these colors.

00:04:57.696 --> 00:04:59.026
&gt;&gt;Student: Like all of them together.

00:04:59.026 --> 00:04:59.786
&gt;&gt;Student: I think so.
