Take a look at the concept map for Lesson Four that's laid out for

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.650
you right here. Again there are some blanks, for you to fill in as

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.360
we go throughout the lesson. I'd love for you to print this off. You

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.980
can find it in the instructor's notes here on this page. If you do need

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.140
the complete version now, because it helps you learn better, you can just skip

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.430
to the end of the lesson, download it from the instructor's notes. And then

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.510
use that. But for the rest of you, I really want you to print

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.490
this off with the blank and fill them in as we go through the lesson

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.210
as we get to that part and figure out what the answer is because at the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.520
end of the lesson we'll have a chance

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.120
for you to assess your knowledge one more time.
