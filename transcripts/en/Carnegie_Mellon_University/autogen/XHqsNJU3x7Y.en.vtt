00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.000
110 as a psychology major I'm of wire
type 1 10 I totally thought what there

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010
type 1 10 I totally thought what there
 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.740
type 1 10 I totally thought what there
was a ridiculous requirement so I was a

vacation since my freshman year and so
then I was like I was talking about

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469
then I was like I was talking about
 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.600
then I was like I was talking about
advisor about it and she was like you

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610
advisor about it and she was like you
 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.619
advisor about it and she was like you
know what do it over the summer if

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629
know what do it over the summer if
 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.209
know what do it over the summer if
you're this nervous because then you can

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219
you're this nervous because then you can
 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.700
you're this nervous because then you can
just pour all your focus into 110 um and

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710
just pour all your focus into 110 um and
 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.380
just pour all your focus into 110 um and
honestly like the experience I'm so I

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390
honestly like the experience I'm so I
 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.240
honestly like the experience I'm so I
now understand why to requirement for

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250
now understand why to requirement for
 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.100
now understand why to requirement for
psychology majors I kind of think it

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110
psychology majors I kind of think it
 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.330
psychology majors I kind of think it
should be requirement for everyone who

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340
should be requirement for everyone who
 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.090
should be requirement for everyone who
goes to CMU just because at least a lot

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100
goes to CMU just because at least a lot
 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.200
goes to CMU just because at least a lot
of times especially in the west coast

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210
of times especially in the west coast
 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.119
of times especially in the west coast
when I tell people I go to CMU every

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129
when I tell people I go to CMU every
 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.590
when I tell people I go to CMU every
single person's like oh you're an

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600
single person's like oh you're an
 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.750
single person's like oh you're an
engineer oh your computer science you

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760
engineer oh your computer science you
 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.030
engineer oh your computer science you
know person like well actually I'm

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040
know person like well actually I'm
 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.770
know person like well actually I'm
sitting psychology but you're right

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780
sitting psychology but you're right
 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.020
sitting psychology but you're right
you're one of our string yeah I was like

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030
you're one of our string yeah I was like
 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.330
you're one of our string yeah I was like
you're right a lot of my peers are so I

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340
you're right a lot of my peers are so I
 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.130
you're right a lot of my peers are so I
think it's really good because I I don't

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140
think it's really good because I I don't
 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.690
think it's really good because I I don't
know like the CMU label kind of comes

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700
know like the CMU label kind of comes
 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.390
know like the CMU label kind of comes
with this technical idea in this

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
with this technical idea in this
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.770
with this technical idea in this
technical background so now I feel like

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780
technical background so now I feel like
 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.230
technical background so now I feel like
I've participated even a super small

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240
I've participated even a super small
 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.179
I've participated even a super small
part of it like makes me feel like I

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189
part of it like makes me feel like I
 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.340
part of it like makes me feel like I
deserve the title a little more now I

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350
deserve the title a little more now I
 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.990
deserve the title a little more now I
think that's and one of the things was

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000
think that's and one of the things was
 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.999
think that's and one of the things was
trying to get out into the class was

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009
trying to get out into the class was
 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.590
trying to get out into the class was
that notion that you know you really are

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600
that notion that you know you really are
 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.380
that notion that you know you really are
participating and one of the men with a

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390
participating and one of the men with a
 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.640
participating and one of the men with a
lot of great traditions here but I think

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650
lot of great traditions here but I think
 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.410
lot of great traditions here but I think
that the the work we've done in CS is

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420
that the the work we've done in CS is
 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.179
that the the work we've done in CS is
just you know it's this enormous river

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189
just you know it's this enormous river
 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.350
just you know it's this enormous river
and maybe you're just dipping your foot

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360
and maybe you're just dipping your foot
 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.520
and maybe you're just dipping your foot
into it but you're a part of it now and

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530
into it but you're a part of it now and
 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.260
into it but you're a part of it now and
that's the really exciting I mean

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270
that's the really exciting I mean
 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.060
that's the really exciting I mean
obviously the course at least the way

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070
obviously the course at least the way
 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.499
obviously the course at least the way
that we were doing it in the summer and

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509
that we were doing it in the summer and
 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.580
that we were doing it in the summer and
I think them in the way it's being

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590
I think them in the way it's being
 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.260
I think them in the way it's being
introduced now in the in the in the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270
introduced now in the in the in the
 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.690
introduced now in the in the in the
phone spring semesters is able to take

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700
phone spring semesters is able to take
 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.249
phone spring semesters is able to take
advantage of a lot of the work coming

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259
advantage of a lot of the work coming
 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.450
advantage of a lot of the work coming
out of the Simon initiative which

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460
out of the Simon initiative which
 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.670
out of the Simon initiative which
includes the oli courses and so I'm

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680
includes the oli courses and so I'm
 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.770
includes the oli courses and so I'm
curious how did that compare to some of

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780
curious how did that compare to some of
 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.850
curious how did that compare to some of
the other classes you've taken of

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860
the other classes you've taken of
 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.370
the other classes you've taken of
courses that didn't have the ability to

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380
courses that didn't have the ability to
 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.160
courses that didn't have the ability to
use some of the EdTech pieces i would

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170
use some of the EdTech pieces i would
 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.949
use some of the EdTech pieces i would
say in other classes where they didn't

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959
say in other classes where they didn't
 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.360
say in other classes where they didn't
use all I

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370
use all I
 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.220
use all I
which was pretty much every class except

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230
which was pretty much every class except
 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.190
which was pretty much every class except
for computing at CMU and if you took it

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200
for computing at CMU and if you took it
 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.330
for computing at CMU and if you took it
in the summer there wasn't even a

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340
in the summer there wasn't even a
 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.280
in the summer there wasn't even a
professor so this is cool because it

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290
professor so this is cool because it
 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.339
professor so this is cool because it
kind of combined having professors you

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349
kind of combined having professors you
 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.860
kind of combined having professors you
can ask questions too but also the oli

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870
can ask questions too but also the oli
 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.530
can ask questions too but also the oli
modules and that's different because I'm

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540
modules and that's different because I'm
 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.720
modules and that's different because I'm
not it was hard kind of doing that all I

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730
not it was hard kind of doing that all I
 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.330
not it was hard kind of doing that all I
completely on my own for the computing

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340
completely on my own for the computing
 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.170
completely on my own for the computing
at CM but with other classes I'd say

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180
at CM but with other classes I'd say
 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.660
at CM but with other classes I'd say
it's kind of tough like see you are

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670
it's kind of tough like see you are
 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.039
it's kind of tough like see you are
tired during lecture or something like

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049
tired during lecture or something like
 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.110
tired during lecture or something like
that or for some reason you miss a

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120
that or for some reason you miss a
 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.420
that or for some reason you miss a
lecture and lecture is really rich but

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430
lecture and lecture is really rich but
 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.520
lecture and lecture is really rich but
there's not really a way to get like

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530
there's not really a way to get like
 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.460
there's not really a way to get like
those notes and I feel like oli has like

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470
those notes and I feel like oli has like
 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.140
those notes and I feel like oli has like
a backup if something like that happen

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150
a backup if something like that happen
 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.670
a backup if something like that happen
it's not like you should miss lecture

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680
it's not like you should miss lecture
 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.949
it's not like you should miss lecture
anything but in the case that you do or

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959
anything but in the case that you do or
 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.509
anything but in the case that you do or
that something doesn't work out you're

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519
that something doesn't work out you're
 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.899
that something doesn't work out you're
able to go to the oli modules and you're

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909
able to go to the oli modules and you're
 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.149
able to go to the oli modules and you're
able to like kind of get caught up or

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159
able to like kind of get caught up or
 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.740
able to like kind of get caught up or
like at least get a buffer for what

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750
like at least get a buffer for what
 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.349
like at least get a buffer for what
you'd missed and I like that

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359
you'd missed and I like that
 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:09.289
you'd missed and I like that
accessibility to have that great yeah I

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299
accessibility to have that great yeah I
 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.880
accessibility to have that great yeah I
totally agree I think for me that oh I

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890
totally agree I think for me that oh I
 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.770
totally agree I think for me that oh I
was really helpful because I could do it

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780
was really helpful because I could do it
 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.660
was really helpful because I could do it
before class then I felt like I kind of

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670
before class then I felt like I kind of
 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.640
before class then I felt like I kind of
knew what I was getting into in class

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650
knew what I was getting into in class
 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.390
knew what I was getting into in class
and then if I ever was kind of confused

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400
and then if I ever was kind of confused
 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.129
and then if I ever was kind of confused
from the the in-class portion I knew

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139
from the the in-class portion I knew
 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.960
from the the in-class portion I knew
that like it wasn't the end I'll be

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970
that like it wasn't the end I'll be
 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.520
that like it wasn't the end I'll be
loved that moment like I had to learn

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530
loved that moment like I had to learn
 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.050
loved that moment like I had to learn
and understand in that moment like I had

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060
and understand in that moment like I had
 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.930
and understand in that moment like I had
time and structured time in which I

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940
time and structured time in which I
 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.750
time and structured time in which I
could learn it by myself or with the

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760
could learn it by myself or with the
 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.390
could learn it by myself or with the
guide of the ol I modules okay and did

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400
guide of the ol I modules okay and did
 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.640
guide of the ol I modules okay and did
you feel like the online materials in

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650
you feel like the online materials in
 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.409
you feel like the online materials in
the supporting tech blended fairly well

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419
the supporting tech blended fairly well
 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:40.819
the supporting tech blended fairly well
with with the traditional class time

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829
with with the traditional class time
 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.740
with with the traditional class time
yeah did we get those synced up fairly

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750
yeah did we get those synced up fairly
 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.409
yeah did we get those synced up fairly
well yeah I think so i think um the i

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419
well yeah I think so i think um the i
 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:46.939
well yeah I think so i think um the i
always loved at the end the question

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:46.949
always loved at the end the question
 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:48.319
always loved at the end the question
that was like what do you want your

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329
that was like what do you want your
 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.509
that was like what do you want your
instructor to spend more time on because

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519
instructor to spend more time on because
 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.400
instructor to spend more time on because
at least the way you didn't you really

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410
at least the way you didn't you really
 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.900
at least the way you didn't you really
talked about that and you really use

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910
talked about that and you really use
 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.640
talked about that and you really use
that and that was it kind of made you

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650
that and that was it kind of made you
 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.050
that and that was it kind of made you
feel like you're learning experience was

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060
feel like you're learning experience was
 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.300
feel like you're learning experience was
like being valued and that like you

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310
like being valued and that like you
 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.930
like being valued and that like you
weren't necessarily expected to 100%

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940
weren't necessarily expected to 100%
 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.050
weren't necessarily expected to 100%
understand everything that had happened

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060
understand everything that had happened
 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.819
understand everything that had happened
during the oh I module or during class

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829
during the oh I module or during class
 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.939
during the oh I module or during class
yeah and I think if that's used properly

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:10.949
yeah and I think if that's used properly
 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:12.890
yeah and I think if that's used properly
it can be pretty nice because I've just

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900
it can be pretty nice because I've just
 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.080
it can be pretty nice because I've just
been thinking about this semester people

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090
been thinking about this semester people
 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.120
been thinking about this semester people
do not like asking questions in lecture

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130
do not like asking questions in lecture
 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.819
do not like asking questions in lecture
at CMU because everybody's afraid that

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829
at CMU because everybody's afraid that
 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.589
at CMU because everybody's afraid that
you're there asking the dumb question

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599
you're there asking the dumb question
 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.180
you're there asking the dumb question
when in reality there has to be at least

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190
when in reality there has to be at least
 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.110
when in reality there has to be at least
one other person

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120
one other person
 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.100
one other person
lecture hall that feels the same way so

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110
lecture hall that feels the same way so
 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.120
lecture hall that feels the same way so
even though it would be nice to have

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130
even though it would be nice to have
 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.800
even though it would be nice to have
that problem be fixed it's nice because

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810
that problem be fixed it's nice because
 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.780
that problem be fixed it's nice because
this gives an opportunity where you

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790
this gives an opportunity where you
 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.030
this gives an opportunity where you
don't just like stay silent in fear of

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040
don't just like stay silent in fear of
 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.909
don't just like stay silent in fear of
being judged necessarily you can just

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919
being judged necessarily you can just
 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.340
being judged necessarily you can just
type in like hey like this is me to you

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350
type in like hey like this is me to you
 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.320
type in like hey like this is me to you
as my professor could you please spend

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330
as my professor could you please spend
 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.909
as my professor could you please spend
some more time on this whereas other

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919
some more time on this whereas other
 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.280
some more time on this whereas other
ways you might not have time to talk to

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290
ways you might not have time to talk to
 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.930
ways you might not have time to talk to
your professor about that after class in

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940
your professor about that after class in
 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.080
your professor about that after class in
some cases with a short 10 minute

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090
some cases with a short 10 minute
 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.909
some cases with a short 10 minute
transitions and I think it just comes in

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919
transitions and I think it just comes in
 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.860
transitions and I think it just comes in
handy to be able to at least get that

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870
handy to be able to at least get that
 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.409
handy to be able to at least get that
information across so I think there we

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419
information across so I think there we
 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:58.730
information across so I think there we
talk a lot about the availability of the

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740
talk a lot about the availability of the
 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.040
talk a lot about the availability of the
technology to eliminate the back row or

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050
technology to eliminate the back row or
 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.450
technology to eliminate the back row or
to bring the back row students forward

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460
to bring the back row students forward
 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.070
to bring the back row students forward
metaphorically and I think that that's a

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080
metaphorically and I think that that's a
 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.390
metaphorically and I think that that's a
piece of it right i mean it's but it's

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400
piece of it right i mean it's but it's
 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.400
piece of it right i mean it's but it's
also i think normalizing that piece of

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410
also i think normalizing that piece of
 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.629
also i think normalizing that piece of
learning that requires you to

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639
learning that requires you to
 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:12.950
learning that requires you to
acknowledge hey i don't know exactly

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960
acknowledge hey i don't know exactly
 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.060
acknowledge hey i don't know exactly
what's happening here i need to ask

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070
what's happening here i need to ask
 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.590
what's happening here i need to ask
questions and so it gives you a vehicle

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600
questions and so it gives you a vehicle
 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.270
questions and so it gives you a vehicle
for doing that and it ties it a little

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280
for doing that and it ties it a little
 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.250
for doing that and it ties it a little
more directly to what you've just

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260
more directly to what you've just
 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.719
more directly to what you've just
learned right so there's that close

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729
learned right so there's that close
 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.010
learned right so there's that close
relationship to have just had this

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020
relationship to have just had this
 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.050
relationship to have just had this
practice things unclear i can get that

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060
practice things unclear i can get that
 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.520
practice things unclear i can get that
information out and then hopefully

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530
information out and then hopefully
 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.279
information out and then hopefully
benefit from faculty so it's it's it's

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289
benefit from faculty so it's it's it's
 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.080
benefit from faculty so it's it's it's
affirming to hear that that's you know

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090
affirming to hear that that's you know
 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.190
affirming to hear that that's you know
that it plays out the way that it's

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200
that it plays out the way that it's
 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.350
that it plays out the way that it's
supposed to in the theory yeah i think

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360
supposed to in the theory yeah i think
 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.200
supposed to in the theory yeah i think
particularly the activity portion when

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210
particularly the activity portion when
 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.029
particularly the activity portion when
you're not graded on but there's the

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039
you're not graded on but there's the
 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.230
you're not graded on but there's the
check one at the end which is obviously

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240
check one at the end which is obviously
 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.610
check one at the end which is obviously
graded an important feedback from the

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620
graded an important feedback from the
 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.650
graded an important feedback from the
instructor but the the portion that you

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660
instructor but the the portion that you
 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.120
instructor but the the portion that you
know likes it goes you know appears

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130
know likes it goes you know appears
 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.320
know likes it goes you know appears
green if you've gotten a write or read

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330
green if you've gotten a write or read
 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.820
green if you've gotten a write or read
if you've gotten it wrong but that you

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830
if you've gotten it wrong but that you
 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.279
if you've gotten it wrong but that you
know you can kind of try it again makes

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289
know you can kind of try it again makes
 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:50.960
know you can kind of try it again makes
it a lot less intimidating because if

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970
it a lot less intimidating because if
 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.790
it a lot less intimidating because if
it's immediately graded then there's

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800
it's immediately graded then there's
 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.170
it's immediately graded then there's
you're still kind of stressed out right

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180
you're still kind of stressed out right
 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.460
you're still kind of stressed out right
the whole experience because you know

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470
the whole experience because you know
 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.950
the whole experience because you know
like this is a one-shot moment but the

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960
like this is a one-shot moment but the
 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.230
like this is a one-shot moment but the
thief the feedback I think in particular

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240
thief the feedback I think in particular
 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.779
thief the feedback I think in particular
is really helpful because most other

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789
is really helpful because most other
 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:04.339
is really helpful because most other
feedback you get in a classroom is

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:04.349
feedback you get in a classroom is
 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:06.110
feedback you get in a classroom is
graded feedback just because that's the

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120
graded feedback just because that's the
 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.150
graded feedback just because that's the
nature of school but it kind of offers a

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160
nature of school but it kind of offers a
 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.529
nature of school but it kind of offers a
unique opportunity for non-graded

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539
unique opportunity for non-graded
 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:11.270
unique opportunity for non-graded
feedback for the activities was there

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280
feedback for the activities was there
 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.279
feedback for the activities was there
anything any specific pieces of it that

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.289
anything any specific pieces of it that
 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.020
anything any specific pieces of it that
really stood out as you know what were

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030
really stood out as you know what were
 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.430
really stood out as you know what were
some of the best ones we tell me the

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440
some of the best ones we tell me the
 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.529
some of the best ones we tell me the
worst ones too is what really worked for

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:18.539
worst ones too is what really worked for
 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:20.150
worst ones too is what really worked for
you I think for me the ones where you

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160
you I think for me the ones where you
 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.670
you I think for me the ones where you
could actually code in Python in the in

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680
could actually code in Python in the in
 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.469
could actually code in Python in the in
the module itself and it would give you

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479
the module itself and it would give you
 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:27.980
the module itself and it would give you
feedback I really appreciate it because

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990
feedback I really appreciate it because
 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.950
feedback I really appreciate it because
the whole idea of coding even literally

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960
the whole idea of coding even literally
 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.380
the whole idea of coding even literally
just sending enough on my computer was

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:33.390
just sending enough on my computer was
 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.209
just sending enough on my computer was
intimidating to me so the fact that you

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:35.219
intimidating to me so the fact that you
 

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:37.730
intimidating to me so the fact that you
could do it just like in the web browser

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740
could do it just like in the web browser
 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.409
could do it just like in the web browser
in the module so the only thing you

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:39.419
in the module so the only thing you
 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:41.689
in the module so the only thing you
needed to focus on with actually whether

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:41.699
needed to focus on with actually whether
 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:44.180
needed to focus on with actually whether
your code was working or not was really

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190
your code was working or not was really
 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.040
your code was working or not was really
helpful to me and then I think the other

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050
helpful to me and then I think the other
 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.629
helpful to me and then I think the other
thing I appreciated especially about

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639
thing I appreciated especially about
 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:50.089
thing I appreciated especially about
that piece is that eat so if you got it

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:50.099
that piece is that eat so if you got it
 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:51.350
that piece is that eat so if you got it
wrong it would give you a hint and it

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360
wrong it would give you a hint and it
 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.150
wrong it would give you a hint and it
would kind of like point you towards the

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160
would kind of like point you towards the
 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.339
would kind of like point you towards the
right answer but eventually like either

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:55.349
right answer but eventually like either
 

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:56.749
right answer but eventually like either
if you did eventually get your own

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:56.759
if you did eventually get your own
 

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:59.089
if you did eventually get your own
version right where your code ran or you

00:06:59.089 --> 00:06:59.099
version right where your code ran or you
 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:00.499
version right where your code ran or you
just really couldn't get it like the

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:00.509
just really couldn't get it like the
 

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:02.600
just really couldn't get it like the
right answer was eventually given to you

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.610
right answer was eventually given to you
 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:03.920
right answer was eventually given to you
which i think is really important

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:03.930
which i think is really important
 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.080
which i think is really important
because I think sometimes in classroom

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.090
because I think sometimes in classroom
 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.460
because I think sometimes in classroom
settings professors don't want to give

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:07.470
settings professors don't want to give
 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:08.960
settings professors don't want to give
the right answer because there's this

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:08.970
the right answer because there's this
 

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.399
the right answer because there's this
idea like oh you want the student to

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:10.409
idea like oh you want the student to
 

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:12.980
idea like oh you want the student to
figure it out themselves but if it's so

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:12.990
figure it out themselves but if it's so
 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.719
figure it out themselves but if it's so
out of reach that they're never going to

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:14.729
out of reach that they're never going to
 

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:17.089
out of reach that they're never going to
get there by themselves then that really

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:17.099
get there by themselves then that really
 

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:18.680
get there by themselves then that really
only serves to intimidate the student

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:18.690
only serves to intimidate the student
 

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:19.850
only serves to intimidate the student
more because then they're like oh I'm

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:19.860
more because then they're like oh I'm
 

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.080
more because then they're like oh I'm
expected to eventually get to the right

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.090
expected to eventually get to the right
 

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.999
expected to eventually get to the right
answer and I am not so one thing I

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:23.009
answer and I am not so one thing I
 

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:24.409
answer and I am not so one thing I
really appreciate about what it was that

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:24.419
really appreciate about what it was that
 

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:26.300
really appreciate about what it was that
you did get the right answer in the end

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:26.310
you did get the right answer in the end
 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.360
you did get the right answer in the end
and even if sometimes if I was really

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:29.370
and even if sometimes if I was really
 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.950
and even if sometimes if I was really
stuck I would eventually get to the

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960
stuck I would eventually get to the
 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.210
stuck I would eventually get to the
right answer and then I would just look

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220
right answer and then I would just look
 

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.140
right answer and then I would just look
at the right answer and I would just

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:33.150
at the right answer and I would just
 

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.899
at the right answer and I would just
rewrite it and that even helped me learn

00:07:35.899 --> 00:07:35.909
rewrite it and that even helped me learn
 

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:37.909
rewrite it and that even helped me learn
the structure of it I think so one of

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919
the structure of it I think so one of
 

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:40.159
the structure of it I think so one of
the other things that's important about

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:40.169
the other things that's important about
 

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:41.420
the other things that's important about
about the way that the larger Simon

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:41.430
about the way that the larger Simon
 

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.189
about the way that the larger Simon
initiative works is this ability to take

00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199
initiative works is this ability to take
 

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:44.839
initiative works is this ability to take
some of the data that's coming from your

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:44.849
some of the data that's coming from your
 

00:07:44.849 --> 00:07:46.430
some of the data that's coming from your
experiences with these materials and

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440
experiences with these materials and
 

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.050
experiences with these materials and
feed it back into the research space and

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:48.060
feed it back into the research space and
 

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.360
feed it back into the research space and
curious as to how that felt to you I

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:50.370
curious as to how that felt to you I
 

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.310
curious as to how that felt to you I
mean work through the consent form I

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:52.320
mean work through the consent form I
 

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.499
mean work through the consent form I
talked a little bit about this does that

00:07:54.499 --> 00:07:54.509
talked a little bit about this does that
 

00:07:54.509 --> 00:07:56.060
talked a little bit about this does that
change the experience at all is it does

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:56.070
change the experience at all is it does
 

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.830
change the experience at all is it does
it feel important to you I think it's

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:57.840
it feel important to you I think it's
 

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.029
it feel important to you I think it's
kind of cool to know that you're

00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039
kind of cool to know that you're
 

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:00.950
kind of cool to know that you're
participated in something like that um

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960
participated in something like that um
 

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.230
participated in something like that um
and I think it makes I don't know I

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.240
and I think it makes I don't know I
 

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.820
and I think it makes I don't know I
think it's a little motivating because

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:04.830
think it's a little motivating because
 

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:08.209
think it's a little motivating because
like you want you want like to represent

00:08:08.209 --> 00:08:08.219
like you want you want like to represent
 

00:08:08.219 --> 00:08:12.260
like you want you want like to represent
you know the tip like a student that's

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:12.270
you know the tip like a student that's
 

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:13.610
you know the tip like a student that's
actually helpful you don't even like if

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:13.620
actually helpful you don't even like if
 

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.860
actually helpful you don't even like if
you like I don't know for me because I

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:15.870
you like I don't know for me because I
 

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.300
you like I don't know for me because I
felt like I was probably not in the

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:17.310
felt like I was probably not in the
 

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.860
felt like I was probably not in the
strongest half of the class like

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:18.870
strongest half of the class like
 

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.409
strongest half of the class like
understanding why I wanted to make sure

00:08:21.409 --> 00:08:21.419
understanding why I wanted to make sure
 

00:08:21.419 --> 00:08:23.510
understanding why I wanted to make sure
like I was still you know like carrying

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520
like I was still you know like carrying
 

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.920
like I was still you know like carrying
through my part of the bargain even if I

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:24.930
through my part of the bargain even if I
 

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.290
through my part of the bargain even if I
wasn't understanding everything um so I

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:27.300
wasn't understanding everything um so I
 

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.339
wasn't understanding everything um so I
think it does i think it's like a

00:08:28.339 --> 00:08:28.349
think it does i think it's like a
 

00:08:28.349 --> 00:08:30.170
think it does i think it's like a
motivational thing for students I know

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:30.180
motivational thing for students I know
 

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.620
motivational thing for students I know
sometimes like I'm for research in sight

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:33.630
sometimes like I'm for research in sight
 

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.089
sometimes like I'm for research in sight
especially with younger kids like we

00:08:35.089 --> 00:08:35.099
especially with younger kids like we
 

00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:36.709
especially with younger kids like we
worry a lot about like what effect that

00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719
worry a lot about like what effect that
 

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:38.000
worry a lot about like what effect that
has on them like it's potentially

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:38.010
has on them like it's potentially
 

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.740
has on them like it's potentially
negative effect but I think especially

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:39.750
negative effect but I think especially
 

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.810
negative effect but I think especially
in like a research university it can

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:41.820
in like a research university it can
 

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.040
in like a research university it can
really only have a positive effect

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:43.050
really only have a positive effect
 

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:44.540
really only have a positive effect
because it means that you're learning

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:44.550
because it means that you're learning
 

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.670
because it means that you're learning
experience is being valued yeah you're

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680
experience is being valued yeah you're
 

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.330
experience is being valued yeah you're
pretty you're participating in that

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:48.340
pretty you're participating in that
 

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.000
pretty you're participating in that
yes yeah it's kind of cool to be on the

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.010
yes yeah it's kind of cool to be on the
 

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.090
yes yeah it's kind of cool to be on the
front line or at least the liq a long

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:54.100
front line or at least the liq a long
 

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.820
front line or at least the liq a long
line of progress for a new initiative in

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:56.830
line of progress for a new initiative in
 

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.910
line of progress for a new initiative in
general just like I don't really think

00:08:58.910 --> 00:08:58.920
general just like I don't really think
 

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.140
general just like I don't really think
like you can mention the consent form

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:01.150
like you can mention the consent form
 

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.330
like you can mention the consent form
doesn't really bother me to think that

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:03.340
doesn't really bother me to think that
 

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:05.580
doesn't really bother me to think that
like the way answer things like how I do

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:05.590
like the way answer things like how I do
 

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:07.530
like the way answer things like how I do
in the class is being like used in

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:07.540
in the class is being like used in
 

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.140
in the class is being like used in
research I mean like I said when I

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:10.150
research I mean like I said when I
 

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:11.970
research I mean like I said when I
whenever I didn't pass 112 it kind of

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:11.980
whenever I didn't pass 112 it kind of
 

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.500
whenever I didn't pass 112 it kind of
just had to be honest with people and I

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:13.510
just had to be honest with people and I
 

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:14.970
just had to be honest with people and I
think honesty is important and it's

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:14.980
think honesty is important and it's
 

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.760
think honesty is important and it's
important for learning as well so no big

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:17.770
important for learning as well so no big
 

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:21.060
important for learning as well so no big
deal whatsoever for me like if I have

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:21.070
deal whatsoever for me like if I have
 

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:22.440
deal whatsoever for me like if I have
some trouble in one area like that's

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:22.450
some trouble in one area like that's
 

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:23.580
some trouble in one area like that's
okay it's going to help students down

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:23.590
okay it's going to help students down
 

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:25.290
okay it's going to help students down
the road that that's actually helpful to

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:25.300
the road that that's actually helpful to
 

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.880
the road that that's actually helpful to
that right it means know a little bit

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:26.890
that right it means know a little bit
 

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:28.680
that right it means know a little bit
about how we can optimize learning

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:28.690
about how we can optimize learning
 

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:32.010
about how we can optimize learning
process for yeah i think that the so

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:32.020
process for yeah i think that the so
 

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.990
process for yeah i think that the so
beyond the oli pieces there were the the

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000
beyond the oli pieces there were the the
 

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.700
beyond the oli pieces there were the the
tutors that sat outside so that's

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:35.710
tutors that sat outside so that's
 

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.650
tutors that sat outside so that's
actually a kelly rivers is a PhD student

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:37.660
actually a kelly rivers is a PhD student
 

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.420
actually a kelly rivers is a PhD student
here and she's been doing a lot of work

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:39.430
here and she's been doing a lot of work
 

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.070
here and she's been doing a lot of work
on how to build software that can

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:41.080
on how to build software that can
 

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.390
on how to build software that can
automatically give you hints and

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:42.400
automatically give you hints and
 

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.660
automatically give you hints and
feedback and the notion that what's

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:45.670
feedback and the notion that what's
 

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:48.390
feedback and the notion that what's
driving this research is students

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:48.400
driving this research is students
 

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.130
driving this research is students
participating in the work which is being

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:50.140
participating in the work which is being
 

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.100
participating in the work which is being
done by a student really yeah it creates

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:53.110
done by a student really yeah it creates
 

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.870
done by a student really yeah it creates
pretty exciting cycle it says that the

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.880
pretty exciting cycle it says that the
 

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.550
pretty exciting cycle it says that the
knowledge that's being that that's being

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:56.560
knowledge that's being that that's being
 

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.540
knowledge that's being that that's being
created here is actually being

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:57.550
created here is actually being
 

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:59.040
created here is actually being
co-created and the students are an

00:09:59.040 --> 00:09:59.050
co-created and the students are an
 

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:00.480
co-created and the students are an
essential part of this right it changes

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:00.490
essential part of this right it changes
 

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.240
essential part of this right it changes
what a university community looks like I

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:02.250
what a university community looks like I
 

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:07.850
what a university community looks like I
think that's pretty neat yeah so how

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:07.860
think that's pretty neat yeah so how
 

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.710
think that's pretty neat yeah so how
imaginative play this kind of work more

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:10.720
imaginative play this kind of work more
 

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.390
imaginative play this kind of work more
broadly we could get more courses and

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:12.400
broadly we could get more courses and
 

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.190
broadly we could get more courses and
more materials out how do you think the

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:14.200
more materials out how do you think the
 

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.480
more materials out how do you think the
use of this kind of stuff could change

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:15.490
use of this kind of stuff could change
 

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.000
use of this kind of stuff could change
they experience at CMU I think it would

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.010
they experience at CMU I think it would
 

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.940
they experience at CMU I think it would
definitely allow students to like take

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:20.950
definitely allow students to like take
 

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:22.680
definitely allow students to like take
more responsibility of their learning

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:22.690
more responsibility of their learning
 

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:24.690
more responsibility of their learning
and that because they're given this

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:24.700
and that because they're given this
 

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.070
and that because they're given this
choice of when to engage in the material

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:26.080
choice of when to engage in the material
 

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.050
choice of when to engage in the material
it's a little bit more on them to engage

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:28.060
it's a little bit more on them to engage
 

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.550
it's a little bit more on them to engage
in the material outside of class and a

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:29.560
in the material outside of class and a
 

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.280
in the material outside of class and a
more kind of self-motivated way than for

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:32.290
more kind of self-motivated way than for
 

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:35.580
more kind of self-motivated way than for
a grade for instance um so I don't know

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:35.590
a grade for instance um so I don't know
 

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:37.890
a grade for instance um so I don't know
and I do think it really d stresses and

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:37.900
and I do think it really d stresses and
 

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.500
and I do think it really d stresses and
like the whole situation of morning

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:40.510
like the whole situation of morning
 

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.030
like the whole situation of morning
because you have this other opportunity

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:42.040
because you have this other opportunity
 

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.860
because you have this other opportunity
to learn that then incorporated into the

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:43.870
to learn that then incorporated into the
 

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:47.340
to learn that then incorporated into the
classroom yeah I think the really really

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:47.350
classroom yeah I think the really really
 

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:50.010
classroom yeah I think the really really
important thing for me um like I think

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:50.020
important thing for me um like I think
 

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.710
important thing for me um like I think
best conjunction was for sure having a

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720
best conjunction was for sure having a
 

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.730
best conjunction was for sure having a
professor and oli on top of it but one

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:56.740
professor and oli on top of it but one
 

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.590
professor and oli on top of it but one
thing like students my friends and I've

00:10:58.590 --> 00:10:58.600
thing like students my friends and I've
 

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.630
thing like students my friends and I've
been talking about even this year is

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:00.640
been talking about even this year is
 

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.040
been talking about even this year is
like each prefer

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:02.050
like each prefer
 

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:03.870
like each prefer
has a different style doing things some

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:03.880
has a different style doing things some
 

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.639
has a different style doing things some
professors make you feel overwhelmed by

00:11:05.639 --> 00:11:05.649
professors make you feel overwhelmed by
 

00:11:05.649 --> 00:11:07.350
professors make you feel overwhelmed by
how quickly they're moving through the

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360
how quickly they're moving through the
 

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.870
how quickly they're moving through the
material and everything like that and as

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:09.880
material and everything like that and as
 

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.360
material and everything like that and as
I said before a lot of students aren't

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:12.370
I said before a lot of students aren't
 

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.340
I said before a lot of students aren't
going to be willing to say oh my gosh

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:14.350
going to be willing to say oh my gosh
 

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:15.990
going to be willing to say oh my gosh
like that was too fast can you please

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.000
like that was too fast can you please
 

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.579
like that was too fast can you please
slow down or can you say that again

00:11:17.579 --> 00:11:17.589
slow down or can you say that again
 

00:11:17.589 --> 00:11:19.980
slow down or can you say that again
because nobody wants to feel like the

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:19.990
because nobody wants to feel like the
 

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:22.100
because nobody wants to feel like the
odd one out that didn't understand

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:22.110
odd one out that didn't understand
 

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:24.780
odd one out that didn't understand
whatever the professor just said I think

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:24.790
whatever the professor just said I think
 

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.810
whatever the professor just said I think
it's definitely a better use of time to

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:27.820
it's definitely a better use of time to
 

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.970
it's definitely a better use of time to
be able to somehow use something like

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:29.980
be able to somehow use something like
 

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.639
be able to somehow use something like
oli to allow there to be more of a

00:11:32.639 --> 00:11:32.649
oli to allow there to be more of a
 

00:11:32.649 --> 00:11:34.440
oli to allow there to be more of a
connection between the professor and the

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:34.450
connection between the professor and the
 

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:37.500
connection between the professor and the
students at hand alright so I think

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:37.510
students at hand alright so I think
 

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:39.150
students at hand alright so I think
thanks for coming and being able to talk

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:39.160
thanks for coming and being able to talk
 

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.650
thanks for coming and being able to talk
about this I think the feedback is

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:40.660
about this I think the feedback is
 

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.449
about this I think the feedback is
really important and you know we talked

00:11:42.449 --> 00:11:42.459
really important and you know we talked
 

00:11:42.459 --> 00:11:44.340
really important and you know we talked
a lot about feedback loops inside of oli

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:44.350
a lot about feedback loops inside of oli
 

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:45.900
a lot about feedback loops inside of oli
and getting this kind of qualitative

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:45.910
and getting this kind of qualitative
 

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:47.400
and getting this kind of qualitative
feedback loops pretty important to the

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:47.410
feedback loops pretty important to the
 

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.889
feedback loops pretty important to the
work but you know thanks for coming in

00:11:49.889 --> 00:11:49.899
work but you know thanks for coming in
 

00:11:49.899 --> 00:11:51.480
work but you know thanks for coming in

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:51.490
as well because I haven't seen you in a
 

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:52.769
as well because I haven't seen you in a
few weeks I'm glad you had a good summer

00:11:52.769 --> 00:11:52.779
few weeks I'm glad you had a good summer
 

00:11:52.779 --> 00:11:54.060
few weeks I'm glad you had a good summer
