00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.800
This right here is a fresco by
Raphael of Plato hanging out

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.180
with his best
student, Aristotle.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.150
And you may or may not
know that these two

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.670
fellows, along with
Plato's teacher,

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.800
Socrates, are considered the
fathers of Western philosophy.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.060
But that's not what
this video is about.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.130
This is actually just
a small little video

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.860
about different dates, or maybe
a better way to think about it,

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.790
different ways to specify
dates or dating mechanisms.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.130
And so, if you were to
look up Plato's birth,

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.730
you might get either 428 or
427, but we'll go with 428.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.950
If you were to look
up Plato's birth,

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.600
you might see it
written as 428 BC,

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.570
or you might see it
written as 428 BCE.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.350
And the natural question is,
what's the difference here?

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.940
They both have a
BC, but this one

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.790
has an E. It's the
same year right now.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.240
And the answer is that
these are referring

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.900
to the exact same
year in history,

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.320
but the acronyms here do
stand for different things.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.610
BC literally stands
for Before Christ.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.120
So if the date is
written 428 BC,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.580
the implication is
that this is 428 years

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.500
before the birth of Christ.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.380
We'll see in a second that
that's not exactly right,

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.260
but that's what
the implication is.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.500
If someone writes
BCE, they're saying

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.710
something very different.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.305
The B still stands for before.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.600
But the CE, the C in CE does
not stand for Christ anymore.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.640
It now stands for common.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.347
And so the CE part
is Common Era.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.360
Even though it's not
referring to Christ anymore--

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.590
and the intention here is so
that it's less religious than

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.830
the term "Before Christ"-- it's
still putting an importance

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.280
on Christ's birth, because it's
saying that the common era is

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.800
the time period after
the birth of Christ,

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.170
which we'll see in a
second isn't exactly right.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.530
But there's essentially the
same exact dating scheme.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.130
One not directly
referring to Christ, one

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.900
that is directly
referring to Christ.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.340
Similarly, this right
here is a painting

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.800
of Christopher Columbus.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.950
And if you were to look
up in history books, when

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.270
was his first voyage and when
did he first show up in the New

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.350
World, finding an
island in the Bahamas?

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:47.086
You would see it written as
either 1492 or AD 1492 or 1492

00:02:47.086 --> 00:02:47.585
CE.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.540
And once again, these are all
referring to the same year,

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.780
just using different acronyms.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.820
One of them's a little
bit more religious,

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.610
or more directly
refers to Christ.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.870
And one is a little
less religious.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.050
So AD, some people think
it refers to after death.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.580
It does not refer
to after death,

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.580
because if you think about
it, if you have years

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.150
before the birth of Christ,
and if you started numbering

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.350
after his death, how
would you number the years

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.830
during his life?

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.850
So AD does not stand
for after death.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:30.200
It stands for Anno Domini,
which literally means,

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.920
anno means year, and domini
means lord, or the lord's.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.500
So it's the year of the Lord
or the year of our Lord.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.140
So it's years since.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.420
And 1 Anno Domini would be the
year of Jesus Christ's birth.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.450
So not after death.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.780
It stands for Anno Domini, but
literally year of our Lord.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.390
So years since Jesus was
born, with year one implicitly

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.530
starting with his birth.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.770
And we'll see in a second
that's not exactly right.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.070
CE stands for Common Era.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.910
Once again, 1 CE is
the same thing as AD 1.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.730
Sometimes we now write,
instead of writing AD 1492,

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.990
we'll write 1492
AD, all referring

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.740
to the exact same thing.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:23.530
Now, all of these things we
refer to, when we say 428 BC it

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.060
implies 428 years before
the birth of Christ.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.990
1492 AD, that's in the
year of our Lord 1492,

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.120
it implies 1492 years
since the birth of Christ.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.110
But the reality
is that we're not

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.700
really quite sure
when Christ was born.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.830
And so these aren't exactly.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.960
Columbus didn't sail
across the Atlantic

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.530
exactly 1492 years after
the birth of Christ.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.520
Most historians put the birth
of Christ at 7 to 2 BC or BCE,

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.340
depending on how
you want to view it.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.740
Remember BC is Before Christ,
which is a little ironic,

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.140
because we're talking about
the actual birth of Christ.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.490
BCE is Before the Common Era.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.580
And they put his death at 30
to 36 AD, which is 30 to 36

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.490
in the year of our
Lord, or-- that's

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.340
what this stands
for, Anno Domini--

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.540
or in the Common Era, CE.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.120
Now some people, they
obviously don't like BC.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.300
They don't like the BC,
AD naming mechanism,

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.810
because it's
explicitly referring

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.070
to Christ in every year.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.342
It makes Christ the central
figure in all of history.

00:05:36.342 --> 00:05:38.425
So they'll say that this
is clearly too Christian.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.390
And they would
prefer the situation,

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.490
they would prefer the less
Christian naming scheme

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:54.680
where you use BCE and CE.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.146
But a lot of people would still
say, hey, look you change.

00:05:57.146 --> 00:05:59.020
Well, you know, first
of all, some Christians

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.300
wouldn't like this that you
removed the direct references

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.110
to the birth of Christ,
or being in the years

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.930
since Christ's birth.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.922
But even here, and they'll
say, you've removed it.

00:06:10.922 --> 00:06:12.630
But even here, some
people would complain

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.963
that although you've made the
direct reference that this

00:06:14.963 --> 00:06:18.671
is saying Before the Common
Era, and the Common Era,

00:06:18.671 --> 00:06:20.670
even though you've removed
the direct reference,

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.000
it still makes Christ's birth
the central thing in all

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.010
of history.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:30.540
But this is the convention
whether people like it or not.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.500
In order to have the same
reference point and it's

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.440
too logistically difficult
to switch it this time,

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.370
everyone has essentially
settled on this.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.750
It's really just a
matter of letters

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.906
of which naming scheme you pick.

00:06:43.906 --> 00:06:45.280
But the whole
point of this video

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.230
is that you don't get
confused between BC and BCE.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.160
You don't think that AD
stands for after death, it

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.570
stands for Anno Domini,
in the year the Lord,

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.590
or the year of our Lord.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.940
And CE stands for Common Era.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:04.930
But this and this are referring
to essentially the same count

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.800
after Christ, after
the birth of Christ,

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.620
or this theoretical
birth of Christ,

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.828
which we don't really know
when it actually happened.

00:07:11.828 --> 00:07:17.830
It probably did not happen at
the beginning of 1 AD or 1 CE.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:24.290
And these two things also
refer to the same direction

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:25.630
in the timeline.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.870
One last thing I want to point
out is that there is no year 0.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:34.740
So if you take either
of these naming schemes,

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.520
you have, so let's go
very close to the year 1.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.660
So there's just some point, this
theoretical birth of Christ,

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.810
which was probably not the
actual birth of Christ,

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:50.040
but at that theoretical
point-- so New Year's,

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:55.830
so you have December 31 of the
previous year, all of a sudden,

00:07:55.830 --> 00:08:03.820
now, you are on January
1 of 1 AD or CE,

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.920
depending on how you
want to refer to it.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:17.400
And the year before
that was 1 BC or BCE,

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.360
depending on how you
want to refer to it.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:23.400
So there is no year
0 in this scheme.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.460
And then the last thing
I want to emphasize--

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.540
and it might be obvious to
you-- is the larger a number

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.470
you have here, the further
back you're going in time.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.070
Because this is
saying how many years

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.750
before this theoretical
birth of Christ,

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.000
and obviously larger
numbers here, you have here,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.690
this is the further you're
going off into the future.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.680
And if you wanted to figure
out how many years passed

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.590
between Plato's
birth and Columbus

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:54.690
sailing across the Atlantic
to find the New World,

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:57.180
you would say, well,
look, it took 428 years

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.570
to go from Plato's birth to this
theoretical birth of Christ.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:04.260
And then you have
another 1492 years

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.170
to wait until Columbus
gets his ship together.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:08.830
So the total number
of years would

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:12.490
be-- I'll do it right
over here-- 428 years

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.630
to get to Christ
from Plato's birth,

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:19.990
and then you have another 1492
years to wait for Columbus.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.047
So let's see, 8
plus 2, that is 10.

00:09:22.047 --> 00:09:24.380
As you can see, I just wanted
to add a little arithmetic

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.710
in this video.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.690
So 1 plus 2 plus 9 is 12.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.740
And then we have
9, 1 plus 4 plus 4.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:37.790
So 1,920 years between
Plato's birth and Columbus

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.340
sailing across the Atlantic.
