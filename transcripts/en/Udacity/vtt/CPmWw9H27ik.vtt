00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
HTML markup is made up of things called tags.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Tags look something like this.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The way a tag is structured is,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
you've got a less than symbol,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the tag name, a greater than symbol,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the tag contents--which can actually be other tags--

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
or it could just be text--another less than symbol,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
a slash, the name, and a greater than symbol.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
There's two ways I might refer to this.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We would call this the opening tag;

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
this one, the one with the slash in front of the name,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
we'd call this the closing tag.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The names are always the same,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and the only difference is the closing tag

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
has a slash in front of the name.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So you've always got name, contents, name.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Opening tag, contents, closing tag.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now--I'll also refer to this whole thing as an element.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And--you know--this isn't something I'm really going to quiz you on,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I just want you to--you know--understand that

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
when I'm talking about HTML, I may refer to a tag,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
or I may refer to the whole thing as the elements,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
or sometimes I kind of switch the words a little bit,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
but, that's what I'm referring to--

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I'm just referring to this structure here.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Let's learn about our first tag.
