this when we dug deeper we found that

this when we dug deeper we found that

this when we dug deeper we found that
there are a number of factors at play

there are a number of factors at play

there are a number of factors at play
but they are all generally tied to one

of three things space time and cost and

all three of these are directly tied to

app size now what do I mean by space

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:15.590

crash occurs in pre-launch reports it is

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:28.560
crash occurs in pre-launch reports it is
 

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.020
crash occurs in pre-launch reports it is
already happening in the real world

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:30.030
already happening in the real world
 

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:32.660
already happening in the real world
you'll be informed and you'll be able to

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:32.670
you'll be informed and you'll be able to
 

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:35.780
you'll be informed and you'll be able to
jump from PLR to vitals to see the

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:35.790
jump from PLR to vitals to see the
 

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:39.140
jump from PLR to vitals to see the
real-world impact of the crash so how

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:39.150
real-world impact of the crash so how
 

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:41.750
real-world impact of the crash so how
would you use this so we think this can

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760
would you use this so we think this can
 

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.850
would you use this so we think this can
be really helpful for you in terms of

be really helpful for you in terms of
 

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:46.340
be really helpful for you in terms of
prioritizing prioritizing issues that I

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:46.350
prioritizing prioritizing issues that I
 

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:48.950
prioritizing prioritizing issues that I
identified in PLR because you'll be able

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960
identified in PLR because you'll be able
 

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:52.040
identified in PLR because you'll be able
to quickly assess which issues that PLR

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:52.050
to quickly assess which issues that PLR
 

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:55.190

so Android vitals and pl are linking is

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:02.280
so Android vitals and pl are linking is
 

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.000
so Android vitals and pl are linking is
a really powerful tool but it's really

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:05.010
a really powerful tool but it's really
 

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:07.310
a really powerful tool but it's really
only as powerful as the amount of your

tools we've got right now you can see
 

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:53.849
tools we've got right now you can see
here that Android compatibility sits in

the pre-launch report pier benchmarks
 

00:34:56.829 --> 00:34:59.190
the pre-launch report pier benchmarks
and app size are found in vitals and

clearly PLR and fighters linking can be

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:02.140
clearly PLR and fighters linking can be
 

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:08.190
clearly PLR and fighters linking can be
accessed from either direction and I

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:08.200
accessed from either direction and I
 

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.900
