00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.940
Okay, Michael. So this notion of having different features or different

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:10.460
dimensions throw us off has a name and it's called the Curse of Dimensionality.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.970
&gt;&gt; Oh, nice audio effect.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.940
&gt;&gt; I did like that effect in post-production. And

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.320
it refers to well, a very particular thing. So let

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.320
me just read out what it refers to. As

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.370
the number of features or equivalently ,uh, dimensions grows that

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.100
is as we add more and more features we go x of 1, x of two then

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.600
we add x of three, add more and

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.830
more of these features. As those features grows or

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.710
as the number of dimensions grow ,the amount of data ,that we

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.630
need to generalize accurately also grows exponentially. Now this

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.590
is a problem of course because Exponentially means, bad in computer science land

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.100
because when things are exponential they're effectively untenable.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.070
You just, you just, you sort of can't win.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.060
&gt;&gt; I think everybody knows that in the sense that if you look,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.120
I've done this experiment actually, if you look in the popular press like,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.120
you know, Time Magazine Or New York Times, USA Today. People will use

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.130
the word exponentially sometimes to mean

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.060
exponentially, and sometimes to mean, a lot.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah that's actually a pet peeve of mine.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.750
The whole notion of,

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.300
&gt;&gt; Me too.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.260
&gt;&gt; Oh, it's exponentially bigger. No,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.410
that's, that's not meaningful. If you're

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.420
saying I have one point. And then I have another point, and I

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.380
want to say this one point is exponentially bigger than this one. That's

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.870
meaningless! It's also liberally bigger than

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.980
that one. Exponentially refers to a trend.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.420
&gt;&gt; Again, their,their,their not talking about the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.399
mathematical relationship. They just mean a lot.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.760
&gt;&gt; Okay, so they're wrong. And it bothers me deeply but

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.320
I'm willing to accept it for the purposes of this discussion. Okay.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.140
Exponentially means bad. It means that we need more, and more, and more,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.960
and more data as we add features and dimensions. Now as a machine

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.380
learning person this is a real problem right, because What you want to do,

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.610
or like what your instinct tells you to do is, oh ,we've

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.470
got this problem, we've got a bunch of data, we're not sure what's

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.870
important. So why don't we just keep adding more and more and more

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.850
features. You know, we've got all these sensors and we'll just add this

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.380
little bit and this little bit, and we'll keep

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.860
track of GPS location and we'll see the time of

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.320
the day and we'll just keep adding stuff and then

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.720
we'll figure out which ones are important. But the curse

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.770
of dimensionality says that every time you add another one

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.410
of these features. You add another dimension, to your input

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.020
space, you're going to need exponentially more data, as you add

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.940
those features, in order to be able to generalize accurately.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:25.810
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.090
&gt;&gt; This is a very serious problem, and it sort

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.310
of captures, a little bit of what the difficulties are

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.030
in k and n. If you have a di, if you have distance function

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.950
or a similarity function, that assumes that

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.180
everything is Relevant, or equally relevant, or

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.110
important, and some of them aren't. You're going to have to see a lot of

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.690
data before you can figure that out, sort of before it washes itself away.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.341
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]

00:02:49.341 --> 00:02:50.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it seems a little scary. So, you know, I think you

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.620
can say these words, and the words sort of make sense, but I think

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.740
it helps to kind of draw a picture,

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.260
and so I'm going to draw a little picture. Okay?

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.760
&gt;&gt; All right.
