00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.850
Welcome back.

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.059
Or maybe you didn't even watch
the last video, but anyway, we

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:07.540
are on problem number 15.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.450
The Acme Plumbing Company will
send a team of three plumbers

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.390
to work on a certain job.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.040
The company has four
experienced

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.720
plumbers and four trainees.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.500
If a team consists of one
experienced plumber and two

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.810
trainees, how many such
teams are possible?

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.670
So we're going to send three
plumbers, right?

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.420
Three plumbers.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.240
So it's one, two, three.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.220
And one of them has to be
experienced, right?

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.900
And then these are

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.290
inexperienced, these are trainees.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.490
So this is the team, one
experienced and two trainees.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.630
And now we're going to have
to pick from a set.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.790
Let's say my four experienced
plumbers are

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.150
plumbers A, B, C, D.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.400
These are experienced.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:13.020
And let's say my trainees
are E, F, G, H.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.270
So these four are trainees.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.130
So how many different
experienced plumbers can I

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.920
have heading up the team?

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.170
Well, there's four
possibilities, right?

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.520
So there's four different people
I can stick in here.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.660
Four choices, or four
possibilities.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.380
Now, independent of who I put
into the experienced slot, how

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.740
many trainees-- let's say this
is trainee slot one and

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.100
trainee slot two, not that
there's a difference-- so now

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.000
if I'm picking who can go into
trainee slot one, how many

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.480
choices do I have?

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.040
Well, I have four choices
because none of them have been

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.660
staffed yet.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.700
So I can put four people here.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.960
Not four people, I'm putting one
person, but I can pick one

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.840
of four, so there's four
possibilities here.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.760
Once I've already filled trainee
slot one, one of these

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.790
people are going to disappear.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.949
Then the set is going to
be one less, right?

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:11.630
There's only going to be three
trainees left once

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.810
I've filled slot one.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.960
So how many trainees can
I put in slot two?

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.570
Well, there's only three
possibilities I could put

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.940
because I already stuck
one in slot one.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.480
So there's four possible
experienced people, four

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.540
possible choices for trainee
in slot one.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.560
And then since one trainee will
already have been staffed

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.060
in slot one, there's only three
choices for slot two.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.920
So it's 4 times 4 times 3.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.700
So what is that?

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.340
4 times 12, which is
48 possibilities.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.590
Next problem.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.880
And the trick here is just
realizing that once you staff

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.890
one of the trainees, you only
have 3 left that you can put

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.730
in the other one, in the
second trainee slot.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:54.980
Next problem.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.500
Problem 16.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.720
All right, we've got some
circles going on here.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.890
Let me draw a circle.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.100
So they have one circle
like that.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.930
And they have a bigger circle
that looks something like--

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.040
oh, I don't know if I--
no, let me undo that.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.600
Edit, undo.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.350
OK, let me see if I can
make it more even.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.670
That's pretty good.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.700
OK, let me fill it in with
a pleasant color.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:29.800
All right.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.780
The figure above consists
of two circles that

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.380
have the same center.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:45.890
If the shaded area is 64 pi
square inches and the smaller

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.730
circle has a radius of 6 inches,
so that distance right

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.960
there is 6, what is the
radius in inches

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.650
of the larger circle?

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.740
So, we want to figure out radius
of the larger circle.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.570
Radius of the larger circle I'll
do in this green color.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.120
Let's call that x.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.430
So what's going to be the area
of the shaded circle?

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.880
How would we figure it out if
we knew the radius of the

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.880
larger circle?

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.390
What would be the area
of the large circle?

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.600
Area of the large circle minus
the area of the small circle

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.550
is going to equal
64 pi, right?

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.310
Because if the whole thing was
filled in in mauve or whatever

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.810
color this is, then it would
just be the area of the large

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.420
circle, but we're subtracting
out the area of the small

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.810
circle to get the
mauve region.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.760
So what's the formula for the
area of the large circle?

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.440
It's pi times its
radius squared.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.560
So we already set that radius to
be equal to x, so it's pi x

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.370
squared-- and that's what we're
trying to figure out in

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.690
this problem-- minus the area
of the small circle.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.310
What's the area of
the small circle?

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.120
Well, its radius is 6 so
it's pi r squared, so

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.060
it's pi times 6 squared.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.010
And that is going to
be equal to 64 pi.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.930
And just to simplify things, we
can just divide both sides

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.380
by pi just to get them
out of the way.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.270
But you don't have to do that,
that just simplifies things

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.990
for my simple mind.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.080
So you get x squared minus
36 is equal to 64.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.860
Add 36 to both sides, you get
x squared is equal to 100.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.260
So x could be equal-- if you
just solved it, it would be

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.790
plus or minus 10, and of course,
a radius can't be

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.190
negative, so it's plus 10.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.550
So x is 10, or the radius of
the larger circle is 10.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:43.440
Next problem.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:51.210
Problem 17.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.910
If p, r, and s are three
different prime numbers

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.990
greater than two-- let me just
write them down, p r, and s--

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.950
three different prime numbers
greater than two and n is

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:09.810
equal to p times r times s, how
many factors including one

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.510
and n does n have?

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.430
How many factors?

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.190
This is a good problem.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:25.300
This is essentially the prime
factorization of n, right?

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.400
And we want to know how many
positive factors including 1

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.290
and n, right?

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.010
So what are all of
the factors here?

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:39.530
So if we just made a factor
tree-- let's make a

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.660
combination of all the numbers
that when I multiply the pair

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.050
can equal n.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.950
So one times n is equal to n.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:55.660
Another number that would equal
n is pr times s would

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.420
also equal n, right?

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.880
Because obviously p times r
times s is n, so p times r

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.270
times s is n, but I'm saying p
times r is a number, right?

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.740
Hopefully that makes
some sense.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:14.420
Similarly, we could say that
p times rs is equal to n.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.090
Same logic.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.130
I'm saying r times s
is a number, right?

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.810
Some number.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:27.950
And then finally we could say
that sp times r, with sp as a

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:32.990
number, is also equal
to n, right?

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:42.100
So all of these numbers that I
said-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.800
8-- all of these numbers
are factors of n.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.940
So that's how many factors there
are, there are eight

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.310
factors including 1 and n.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:54.270
If this seemed a little bit
abstract to you, try it out

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:56.590
with some numbers.

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:58.640
Actually, that's the best way
you could do it if this was

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.690
too abstract.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:09.920
You could say, what if p is
3, r is 5, and s is 7.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.410
Then what is n?

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:15.530
Well, n is going to
be 15 times 7.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.200
So n is 15 times 7,
what is that?

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.480
70 plus 35, n is 105.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.930
So if n is 105, this
is 1 times 105.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.810
pr, this is 15 times 7.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:32.450
This would be 3 times 35.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.980
Is that right?

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.280
Oh no, sorry, 85.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.650
No, sorry.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:49.330
If 5 times 7 is 35 times 3,
oh right, it's 105, right?

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:57.210
So we would write 3 times 35,
and sp is 21 times 5.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:58.580
So those would be the
actual numbers.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.380
So hopefully that makes a little
bit more sense to you.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.100
But this is the way you could
do it in a general way.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.820
It looks like I'm running out
of time, so I will do number

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:10.470
18 in the next video.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:13.920
But this is a little bit of
a non-intuitive problem.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.300
Just remember, this is the prime
factorization, and then

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.500
you can construct its--
what I call the normal

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.560
factorization-- you can
construct that by just taking

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.570
combinations of the
prime numbers.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.560
And hopefully the actual numbers
make a little bit more

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.950
sense to you.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:28.200
See you in the next video.
