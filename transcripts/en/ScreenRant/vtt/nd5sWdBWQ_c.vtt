00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:10.950
When parents or kids are looking for some
good clean fun, nothing's a safer bet than

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.950
a Disney movie.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.429
Made for kids, parents, or the whole family,
everyone knows that some jokes or references

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.770
are aimed squarely at parents.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.070
But take a closer look, and you'll be shocked
at how many dirty jokes snuck by you the first

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.070
time.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.250
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Hidden Adult Jokes
in Popular Disney Films.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.330
Ratatouille

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.160
Having a rat running around in your pants
leads to plenty of adult humor on its own,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.750
but when the stars of Ratatouille take a secret
meeting inside a produce cooler, they have

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.120
to scramble for an excuse.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.699
The chef's reply is too subtle for kids to
catch, but think about it for even a second,

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.070
and it's clear this joke is implying something
that no kids movie could even come close to

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.659
commenting on.

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:52.659
Hercules

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:57.120
The son of Zeus' and his journey from zero
to hero is based on the Greek myth, but it's

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.030
not the only classical story alluded to.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.050
There's no question Hercules has some family
drama to deal with, but one character makes

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.530
his problems seem like child's play.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.140
Since the play he's referring to stars a king
who marries his own mother, and has four children

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.240
with her, it's a joke we're glad kids won't
understand.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.240
Aladdin

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.579
The friendship between Aladdin and his Genie
is one for the ages, and it's a safe bet that

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.270
more than half of Robin Williams' jokes or
references go over kids' heads.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.869
When you combine that comedy with the male
leads, you wind up with Genie letting Aladdin

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:39.280
know just how much he means to him - but making
it clear that he only likes him... as a friend.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.200
We never would have even though about it,
until now.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.299
Cars

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.420
Pixar's tale of a world of cars has more dirty
jokes buried within it than will probably

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.929
ever be found, but not all of them are hidden
- or polite.

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.520
When Lightning McQueen comes across one of
his racing heroes, he lets Mater know just

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.289
how many Piston Cups he won in his career.

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.710
Mater can't help but make a joke that isn't
exactly clever - but it's definitely not suitable

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.580
for kids.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.580
The Lion King

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.690
Fans have been looking for hidden references
in The Lion King for years, from words written

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.510
floating in the air, to secret messages.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.069
But one of the most adult moments is so obvious,
only an innocent child could miss it.

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.650
When Simba is reunited with his childhood
friend, Nala, romance isn't far behind.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.670
They start by wrestling like they did as kids,
until Nala gives the hero a look that makes

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.040
her real intentions painfully obvious to every
adult in the room.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.760
Honestly, it's hard to believe the animators
were never told to at least tone it down.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.930
Tangled

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.849
It's true that when people go looking for
sinister or adult images or messages in Disney

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.150
movies, they're willing to call almost anything
cold, hard proof.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.159
But sometimes, it's hard to dismiss their
evidence.

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.370
Take, for example, a promotional poster used
for Disney's Tangled, where Rapunzel is using

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.830
her hair to entangle Flynn Rider, her future
husband.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.370
You might think her hair spelling "S-E-X"
is a stretch, but considering the hair could

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.879
have made virtually any shape, it's definitely
suspicious, at the very least, especially

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.299
since it happened with The Lion King before...

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.250
Beauty and the Beast

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.269
Every Disney fan knows that "No One Drinks
Like Gaston," with the burly brawler's drinking

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.040
just one sign of his manliness.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.040
The other?

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.209
That he's never even heard of shaving his
chest... or anything else.

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.681
It might sound like a harmless line meant
for fun, not a sexual reference... but when

00:03:24.681 --> 00:03:28.650
you notice the obvious wink Gaston throws
as he says the word "inch," you'll never hear

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.459
the line the same way again.

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.200
Wreck-it Ralph

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.610
This video game story may not be cute or cuddly,
but it's definitely not trying to offend any

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.799
younger or older viewers with edgy humor.

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.030
Or is it?

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.050
When ralph returns home to find he's the only
person not invited to a party in his own game,

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.240
he has some choice words for Pac-Man, who's
apparently on the guest list.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.909
The words may describe Pac-Man's gameplay,
but the risky use of the word “cherry”

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:02.769
apparently got the blessing from everyone
behind the scenes.

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.069
Toy Story 3

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.140
An adult joke doesn't need to be complicated
to be funny, and it doesn't have to be raunchy

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.530
to warrant a second look.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.319
When Ken and Barbie first meet in the third
Toy Story adventure, they can't help but notice

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.359
they're made for each other.

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:21.050
While Ken gives Barbie a dose of charm, she
goes for a more... direct approach.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.550
It's not as wild as some of our other entries,
but it's too blunt to think that even kids

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.910
would miss it completely.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.140
Frozen

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.190
Disney's story of two sisters called out other
classic love stories, with Else thinking it

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.480
crazy that Anna would marry a man she just
met.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.820
The skepticism is shared by Kristof, who tries
to prove she hardly knows her soon to be husband

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.340
- including his foot size.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.080
It's a safe bet the women in the audience
gave the line a giggle, since it's an obvious

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.830
play on the idea that "size doesn't matter"
when it comes to a man's.....equipment.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.750
Those are the best adult jokes we found hidden
in Disney movies, but are there any we missed?

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.130
