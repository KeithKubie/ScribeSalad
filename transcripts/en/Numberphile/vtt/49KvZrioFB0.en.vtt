00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.950
- You are Mondrian's worst art critic 100 years ago.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:10.870
You tell him he can no longer create art where two rectangles have the same dimension.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.220
That's just wrong.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.840
You're going to say, okay, I am going to score
each of your pieces of art.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.670
We're going to insist that all of the rectangles have got different dimensions.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.780
And your score is going to be equal to

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.860
your largest area of rectangle minus your smallest area of rectangle.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.560
Your smallest score possible is what you want to go for.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.880
The other condition is you have to tile the whole canvas.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.400
So let's start out.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.130
Brady, how big do you want this first rectangle to be?

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.670
- [Brady] Three by two. 
- [Gordon] Three by two, okay.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.320
There's a three by two.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.080
So we can no longer make a two by three or three by two anywhere else.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.920
But I can make a six by one?

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.190
You can make a six by one.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.420
In fact, why don't we do that?

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.820
There we go. There is a six by one.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.260
What else would you like in here?

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.800
- [Brady] Should we make that little square, two by two? 
- [Gordon] Two by two? Yeah.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.410
If you were to stop right now, this is area 20.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.660
So if you were to stop right now, your score would be 20.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.260
That's your biggest minus your smallest, four.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.760
Your score would be 16 and that is not very good.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.120
You want low and 16 is not low enough.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.420
So what we could we do?

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.100
We could split this into an 8 here and a 12.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.650
We could do that. And so now our score is 12 minus 4 is equal to 8.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.970
You can tell Mondrian you are scoring this an eight.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.290
You can score five.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.160
So let me show you this one.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.970
Your largest rectangle is eight, minus your smallest, it is three.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.890
So that score is five,

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.380
and that is the best possible score that you can get for a six by six Mondrian art puzzle.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.920
Of course, you have to ask yourself,
what about a seven by seven?

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.500
What about an eight by eight?

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.740
What about an n by n?

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.040
What is the optimal?

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.430
Ed Pegg has happened to prove solutions.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.780
He's proven that we have these optimal solutions, beautiful results

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.850
and great for algebra class as well 
to come up with general solutions.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:26.760
So for example, for an odd square, let's say that you are dealing with a square 101 by 101.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.470
Well, at least you know for sure that you can split this nearly in two.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:39.890
So this is a rectangle 50 by 101

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.090
And this rectangle is 51 times 101.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.710
And you can see right away that your score for any odd square,

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.320
You can see that it's just the edge length.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.210
So you can see can guaranteed that you can at least do 101.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.620
You can actually do a lot better than 101.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.270
But you can at least do 101.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.220
An unsolved problem here is when this number ever goes to 0?

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.770
You wpi;d think, well, this has got to increase.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.620
But it doesn't always increase.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.960
For example, 17 by 17, the score for that is only 8.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.610
And the score for 16 by 16, 15 by 15, I think they're larger.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.960
So this does not continue to increase.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.290
It's a very complicated function.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.640
And it is not clear that this, for example, doesn't go to zero.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.570
- [Brady] Presumably called the Holy Grail

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.610
is some kind of generalization for an n by n square.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.460
The solution will always be n cubed minus four plus four.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.300
- [Gordon] Oh, that would be a joy again!

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.960
But good luck.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.940
(laughs) Good luck. Dream on.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.610
- [Brady] You can follow it all the way through.
