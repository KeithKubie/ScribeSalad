00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.449
Now, the goal of this unit will be for you to write a PhysicsEngineClass to

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.882
manage the interaction of Box2D to your game engine. Now, first things first,

00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:11.054
is that we'll need to create a new PhysicsEngineClass and create a global

00:00:11.054 --> 00:00:16.232
instance variable for it. Now the core of Box2D simulation is a variable type

00:00:16.232 --> 00:00:20.482
called World. Which is used as the main handle to the rest of the APIs. As

00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:24.252
such, we need to add a create function to our class. And inside here, create a

00:00:24.252 --> 00:00:28.322
new instance of the World object. Note, that typically, the World constructor

00:00:28.322 --> 00:00:31.870
takes a vector that represents the gravity of the world. Since now, we're a top

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.160
down game, we really don't need a 2D gravity vector. So we're just going to

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.417
leave this as 0, 0 for now. Now, the second variable in the constructor, is a

00:00:38.417 --> 00:00:41.342
boolean, which tells Box2D, if an object is allowed to sleep or not, given some

00:00:41.342 --> 00:00:45.862
time threshold tolerance for the computation. Now, for our purposes, we don't

00:00:45.862 --> 00:00:49.892
want to let objects sleep, so we set this, to false. The core of Box2D

00:00:49.892 --> 00:00:54.385
simulation is a variable type called World. Now, this is going to be used as

00:00:54.385 --> 00:00:57.940
the main handle to the rest of the API's that we're going to use. As such, we

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.890
need to add a create Function to our class, and inside of there create an

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.352
instance of the World object. So, to move on, go ahead and create an instance

00:01:05.352 --> 00:01:09.140
of the World object passing in a vector and a boolean value.
