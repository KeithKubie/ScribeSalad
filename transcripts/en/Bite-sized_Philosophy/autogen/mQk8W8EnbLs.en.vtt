they come into the bed-and-breakfast and

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829
they come into the bed-and-breakfast and
 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.470
they come into the bed-and-breakfast and
they speak with each other quite calmly

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480
they speak with each other quite calmly
 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.779
they speak with each other quite calmly
but it's more walking on eggs call and

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789
but it's more walking on eggs call and
 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.850
but it's more walking on eggs call and
while they're speaking with each other

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860
while they're speaking with each other
 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.000
while they're speaking with each other
calmly their physiology is like they're

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010
calmly their physiology is like they're
 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.189
calmly their physiology is like they're
very aroused and so they're sort of

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199
very aroused and so they're sort of
 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.930
very aroused and so they're sort of
aroused like someone who's facing a

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940
aroused like someone who's facing a
 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.579
aroused like someone who's facing a
predator so you might think of an

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589
predator so you might think of an
 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.520
predator so you might think of an
unhappy couple as predator and prey to

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530
unhappy couple as predator and prey to
 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.190
unhappy couple as predator and prey to
each other and so the words are there

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200
each other and so the words are there
 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.480
each other and so the words are there
mostly to stop predatory activity not to

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490
mostly to stop predatory activity not to
 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.039

actually communicate anything it's just

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049
actually communicate anything it's just
 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.039
actually communicate anything it's just
to keep the surface calm so then you

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049
to keep the surface calm so then you
 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.210
to keep the surface calm so then you
might think well what's under the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220
might think well what's under the
 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.480
might think well what's under the
surface and what's under the surface so

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490
surface and what's under the surface so
 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.789
surface and what's under the surface so
Freud would say it's what's under the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799
Freud would say it's what's under the
 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.810
Freud would say it's what's under the
surface is unconscious and but you can

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
surface is unconscious and but you can
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.490
surface is unconscious and but you can
say well what's under the surface is one

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500
say well what's under the surface is one
 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.410
say well what's under the surface is one

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420
of these hierarchies that's all banged
 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.690
of these hierarchies that's all banged
up and twisted and and and not in

up and twisted and and and not in
 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.210
up and twisted and and and not in
reasonable shape and so people don't

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220
reasonable shape and so people don't
 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.270

want to open the door to that so but

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280
want to open the door to that so but
 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.520
want to open the door to that so but
they do this is a Freudian slip so let's

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530
they do this is a Freudian slip so let's
 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.440
they do this is a Freudian slip so let's
say this is goes to the second part of

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450
say this is goes to the second part of
 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.170

is you are so what the good couples do

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650
is you are so what the good couples do
 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.319
is you are so what the good couples do
the couples that you know stay together

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329
the couples that you know stay together
 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.780
the couples that you know stay together
is they respond to each other's bids he

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790
is they respond to each other's bids he
 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.330
is they respond to each other's bids he
calls them bids and so if one person

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340
calls them bids and so if one person
 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.849
calls them bids and so if one person
wants to share some little trivial daily

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859
wants to share some little trivial daily
 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.680
wants to share some little trivial daily
positive thing with the other the other

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690
positive thing with the other the other
 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.589
positive thing with the other the other
you know isn't carrying around a bloody

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599
you know isn't carrying around a bloody
 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.369
you know isn't carrying around a bloody
cartload of resentment and is able to

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379
cartload of resentment and is able to
 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.110
cartload of resentment and is able to
respond to that in a positive way and

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120
respond to that in a positive way and
 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.289
respond to that in a positive way and
that way the general interactions

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299
that way the general interactions
 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.029
that way the general interactions
between the couples stay positive but

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039
between the couples stay positive but
 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.339
between the couples stay positive but

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:18.349
that's also because they've worked this
 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:21.069
that's also because they've worked this
out now you know it's got to be because

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079
out now you know it's got to be because
 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.750
out now you know it's got to be because
they work it out because the couples who

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760
they work it out because the couples who
 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.480
they work it out because the couples who
are physiologically reactive to each

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490
are physiologically reactive to each
 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.320
are physiologically reactive to each
other they're

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330
other they're
 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.540
other they're
communicating but there's all sorts of

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550
communicating but there's all sorts of
 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.029
communicating but there's all sorts of
horror underneath the surface and we're

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039
horror underneath the surface and we're
 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:32.230
horror underneath the surface and we're
trying to figure out well what is it

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240
trying to figure out well what is it
 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.510
trying to figure out well what is it
that's underneath the surface what's the

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520
that's underneath the surface what's the
 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.409
that's underneath the surface what's the
structure of the unconscious well that's

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419
structure of the unconscious well that's
 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:40.179
structure of the unconscious well that's
the structure of the unconscious and

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:40.189
the structure of the unconscious and
 

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:42.219
the structure of the unconscious and
it's either well structured and

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229
it's either well structured and
 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.159
it's either well structured and
functional and mutually agreed upon and

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169
functional and mutually agreed upon and
 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.990
functional and mutually agreed upon and
as explicit as possible or it's this

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000
as explicit as possible or it's this
 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
