00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.540
the Internet of Things is an idea that's

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550
the Internet of Things is an idea that's
 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.420
the Internet of Things is an idea that's
been around for I don't know maybe 10 15

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430
been around for I don't know maybe 10 15
 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.900
been around for I don't know maybe 10 15
years or so and I think the first time I

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910
years or so and I think the first time I
 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.690
years or so and I think the first time I
heard about it there was some discussion

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700
heard about it there was some discussion
 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.589
heard about it there was some discussion
of a European appliance manufacturer who

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599
of a European appliance manufacturer who
 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.439
of a European appliance manufacturer who
had a refrigerator that was connected to

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449
had a refrigerator that was connected to
 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.429
had a refrigerator that was connected to
the network the the Internet and I think

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439
the network the the Internet and I think
 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.400
the network the the Internet and I think
the the scenarios that were playing out

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410
the the scenarios that were playing out
 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.609
the the scenarios that were playing out
there were ok what if the refrigerator

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619
there were ok what if the refrigerator
 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.330
there were ok what if the refrigerator
was smart and knew that that was new

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340
was smart and knew that that was new
 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.250
was smart and knew that that was new
enough to adjust temperatures maybe it

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260
enough to adjust temperatures maybe it
 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.799
enough to adjust temperatures maybe it
knew enough to to send a request or a

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809
knew enough to to send a request or a
 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.840
knew enough to to send a request or a
message to the manufacturer saying hey

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850
message to the manufacturer saying hey
 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.380
message to the manufacturer saying hey
the compressors going bad that was kind

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390
the compressors going bad that was kind
 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.440
the compressors going bad that was kind
of the first time I had heard about this

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450
of the first time I had heard about this
 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.290
of the first time I had heard about this
idea of connecting a product to the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300
idea of connecting a product to the
 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.299
idea of connecting a product to the
network a product that wasn't a

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309
network a product that wasn't a
 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.279
network a product that wasn't a
traditional computer wasn't something

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289
traditional computer wasn't something
 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.840
traditional computer wasn't something
that we thought was supposed to be

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850
that we thought was supposed to be
 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.639
that we thought was supposed to be
connected to the network or

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649
connected to the network or
 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.529
connected to the network or
interconnected and that started to open

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539
interconnected and that started to open
 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.200
interconnected and that started to open
up a lot of people's eyes I think to to

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210
up a lot of people's eyes I think to to
 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.389
up a lot of people's eyes I think to to
this idea it may not have been the first

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399
this idea it may not have been the first
 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.310
this idea it may not have been the first
theoretical time that it was discussed

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320
theoretical time that it was discussed
 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.990
theoretical time that it was discussed
but it was the first time that I think

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000
but it was the first time that I think
 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.510
but it was the first time that I think
popular media and culture started

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520
popular media and culture started
 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.969
popular media and culture started
talking about this idea but for whatever

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979
talking about this idea but for whatever
 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.640
talking about this idea but for whatever
reason that connected refrigerator

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650
reason that connected refrigerator
 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.190
reason that connected refrigerator
really didn't take off the idea really

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200
really didn't take off the idea really
 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.929
really didn't take off the idea really
didn't kind of explode I think then we

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939
didn't kind of explode I think then we
 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.640
didn't kind of explode I think then we
started hearing about the connected

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650
started hearing about the connected
 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.109
started hearing about the connected
washing machine in the same kind of

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119
washing machine in the same kind of
 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.580
washing machine in the same kind of
context and I think that that idea of

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590
context and I think that that idea of
 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.800
context and I think that that idea of
the Internet of Things then started to

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810
the Internet of Things then started to
 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.260
the Internet of Things then started to
refine a bit and we heard about machine

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270
refine a bit and we heard about machine
 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.080
refine a bit and we heard about machine
to machine communication the idea that

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090
to machine communication the idea that
 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.620
to machine communication the idea that
instead of human to machine so sort of

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630
instead of human to machine so sort of
 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.600
instead of human to machine so sort of
through a screen or through a web page

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610
through a screen or through a web page
 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.240
through a screen or through a web page
or through our mobile phones or whatever

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250
or through our mobile phones or whatever
 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.679
or through our mobile phones or whatever
that machines would talk to one another

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689
that machines would talk to one another
 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.819
that machines would talk to one another
and so the idea of a stock quote

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829
and so the idea of a stock quote
 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:50.929
and so the idea of a stock quote
generating a message that would be sent

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939
generating a message that would be sent
 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.730
generating a message that would be sent
to another machine that might think

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740
to another machine that might think
 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.560
to another machine that might think
about ok now I may need to make a trade

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570
about ok now I may need to make a trade
 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.530
about ok now I may need to make a trade
so the automated trading world or a

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540
so the automated trading world or a
 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.350
so the automated trading world or a
weather forecast that's reported online

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360
weather forecast that's reported online
 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.330
weather forecast that's reported online
triggering a message to another system

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340
triggering a message to another system
 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.270
triggering a message to another system
that's going to adjust stock levels so

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280
that's going to adjust stock levels so
 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.740
that's going to adjust stock levels so
this idea that machines might talk to

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750
this idea that machines might talk to
 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.080
this idea that machines might talk to
one another without a human in between

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090
one another without a human in between
 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.240
one another without a human in between
was sort of a refinement I think of the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250
was sort of a refinement I think of the
 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.120
was sort of a refinement I think of the
Internet of Things idea and now over

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130
Internet of Things idea and now over
 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.220
Internet of Things idea and now over
last handful of years we're seeing more

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230
last handful of years we're seeing more
 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.700
last handful of years we're seeing more
consumer facing ideas and concepts and

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710
consumer facing ideas and concepts and
 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.770
consumer facing ideas and concepts and
products coming out that I think has

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780
products coming out that I think has
 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.840
products coming out that I think has
regenerated interest in this in this

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850
regenerated interest in this in this
 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.510
regenerated interest in this in this
machine to machine communication so now

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520
machine to machine communication so now
 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.790
machine to machine communication so now
we're hearing things about the connected

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800
we're hearing things about the connected
 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.810
we're hearing things about the connected
car and the connected thermostat in the

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820
car and the connected thermostat in the
 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.200
car and the connected thermostat in the
smart home and so now that the the

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210
smart home and so now that the the
 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.800
smart home and so now that the the
consumer side of things is is heating up

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810
consumer side of things is is heating up
 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.110
consumer side of things is is heating up
we're also asking ourselves from a

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120
we're also asking ourselves from a
 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.060
we're also asking ourselves from a
business perspective what is the

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070
business perspective what is the
 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.520
business perspective what is the
Internet of Things for a business maybe

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530
Internet of Things for a business maybe
 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.140
Internet of Things for a business maybe
where you don't have a consumer product

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150
where you don't have a consumer product
 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.320
where you don't have a consumer product
or a thing a widget that you sell maybe

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330
or a thing a widget that you sell maybe
 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.030
or a thing a widget that you sell maybe
you're a services company or a bank what

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040
you're a services company or a bank what
 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.530
you're a services company or a bank what
is the Internet of Things mean for a

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540
is the Internet of Things mean for a
 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.060
is the Internet of Things mean for a
business like that a particularly a

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070
business like that a particularly a
 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.090
business like that a particularly a
services company and so for for

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100
services company and so for for
 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.570
services company and so for for
companies that aren't as a consumer

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580
companies that aren't as a consumer
 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.360
companies that aren't as a consumer
facing or product oriented I think you

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370
facing or product oriented I think you
 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.040
facing or product oriented I think you
know there there's more opportunity but

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050
know there there's more opportunity but
 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.950
know there there's more opportunity but
more sort of clouds around what that

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960
more sort of clouds around what that
 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.510
more sort of clouds around what that
what the Internet of Things means for

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520
what the Internet of Things means for
 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.180
what the Internet of Things means for
business and I think that anything that

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190
business and I think that anything that
 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.470
business and I think that anything that
we that we think about that we estimate

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480
we that we think about that we estimate
 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.740
we that we think about that we estimate
that we operate in that the places we

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750
that we operate in that the places we
 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.940
that we operate in that the places we
work in people we work with we think

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950
work in people we work with we think
 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.030
work in people we work with we think
about the effectiveness of those things

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040
about the effectiveness of those things
 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.770
about the effectiveness of those things
the effectiveness of our workplace the

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780
the effectiveness of our workplace the
 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.120
the effectiveness of our workplace the
effectiveness of a warehouse the

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130
effectiveness of a warehouse the
 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.070
effectiveness of a warehouse the
effectiveness of routes that a truck

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080
effectiveness of routes that a truck
 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.460
effectiveness of routes that a truck
takes or that a forklift makes and we

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470
takes or that a forklift makes and we
 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.220
takes or that a forklift makes and we
make guesses about the right ways to to

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230
make guesses about the right ways to to
 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.490
make guesses about the right ways to to
design a workspace or design a logistics

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500
design a workspace or design a logistics
 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.360
design a workspace or design a logistics
path design a warehouse and the question

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370
path design a warehouse and the question
 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.020
path design a warehouse and the question
is can we use the idea of sensors to

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030
is can we use the idea of sensors to
 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.449
is can we use the idea of sensors to
collect data about things that we were

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459
collect data about things that we were
 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.160
collect data about things that we were
just guessing about before that we were

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170
just guessing about before that we were
 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.110
just guessing about before that we were
estimating that we were that we were

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120
estimating that we were that we were
 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.290
estimating that we were that we were
sort of like using our gut to design can

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300
sort of like using our gut to design can
 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.360
sort of like using our gut to design can
we collect real data about performance

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370
we collect real data about performance
 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.670
we collect real data about performance
of people and places and processes that

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680
of people and places and processes that
 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.160
of people and places and processes that
can give us more insight into optimizing

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170
can give us more insight into optimizing
 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.530
can give us more insight into optimizing
and evolving our designs for the way our

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540
and evolving our designs for the way our
 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.449
and evolving our designs for the way our
business works and that's what I call

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459
business works and that's what I call
 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.039
business works and that's what I call
the internet of business things it's not

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049
the internet of business things it's not
 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.470
the internet of business things it's not
the consumer-facing stuff it's the

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480
the consumer-facing stuff it's the
 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.020
the consumer-facing stuff it's the
business stuff most of the data we think

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030
business stuff most of the data we think
 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.630
business stuff most of the data we think
about from a an enterprise perspective

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640
about from a an enterprise perspective
 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.380
about from a an enterprise perspective
is is sort of modular its transactional

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390
is is sort of modular its transactional
 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.950
is is sort of modular its transactional
its

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960
its
 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.249
its
it's a call center call or it's a web

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259
it's a call center call or it's a web
 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.650
it's a call center call or it's a web
transaction or it's a sale or it's a

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660
transaction or it's a sale or it's a
 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.529
transaction or it's a sale or it's a
quote or it's a piece of data about a

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539
quote or it's a piece of data about a
 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:39.409
quote or it's a piece of data about a
product but the Internet of Things will

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419
product but the Internet of Things will
 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.650
product but the Internet of Things will
be creating streams of data so one of

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660
be creating streams of data so one of
 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.740
be creating streams of data so one of
the analogies is is how social media

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750
the analogies is is how social media
 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.060
the analogies is is how social media
creates streams of data so we've got

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070
creates streams of data so we've got
 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.110
creates streams of data so we've got
tweets and we've got flows on our on our

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120
tweets and we've got flows on our on our
 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.659
tweets and we've got flows on our on our
wall and such that are more streams of

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669
wall and such that are more streams of
 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.010
wall and such that are more streams of
information and so think about a sensor

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020
information and so think about a sensor
 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.040
information and so think about a sensor
that might be on a door in a warehouse

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050
that might be on a door in a warehouse
 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.650
that might be on a door in a warehouse
every time the door opens the sensor

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660
every time the door opens the sensor
 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.450
every time the door opens the sensor
records a door opening a time of day a

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460
records a door opening a time of day a
 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.760
records a door opening a time of day a
day of week maybe it creates some other

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770
day of week maybe it creates some other
 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.129
day of week maybe it creates some other
ambient information like it records the

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139
ambient information like it records the
 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.100
ambient information like it records the
temperature in the in the facility or it

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110
temperature in the in the facility or it
 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.930
temperature in the in the facility or it
records how long the door was open or

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940
records how long the door was open or
 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.159
records how long the door was open or
whatever so these are little bits of

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169
whatever so these are little bits of
 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.290
whatever so these are little bits of
data that are happening every time the

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300
data that are happening every time the
 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.969
data that are happening every time the
door is open and that door might be open

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979
door is open and that door might be open
 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.760
door is open and that door might be open
a lot of times during an hour or a day

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770
a lot of times during an hour or a day
 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.950
a lot of times during an hour or a day
or a week or a month but it's creating

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960
or a week or a month but it's creating
 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.990
or a week or a month but it's creating
these streams of data and it's it's not

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000
these streams of data and it's it's not
 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.120
these streams of data and it's it's not
like that one piece of data might be

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130
like that one piece of data might be
 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.400
like that one piece of data might be
that interesting but it's the trends and

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410
that interesting but it's the trends and
 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:32.870
that interesting but it's the trends and
the patterns and things that we're

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880
the patterns and things that we're
 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.060
the patterns and things that we're
looking for in the data that may be what

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070
looking for in the data that may be what
 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.189
looking for in the data that may be what
we're looking for so I want to know you

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199
we're looking for so I want to know you
 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:40.339
we're looking for so I want to know you
know how often is that room used during

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:40.349
know how often is that room used during
 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:42.379
know how often is that room used during
the morning the afternoon certain days

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389
the morning the afternoon certain days
 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:44.060
the morning the afternoon certain days
of the week weeks of the month that you

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070
of the week weeks of the month that you
 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.129
of the week weeks of the month that you
know months of the year to help me be

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139
know months of the year to help me be
 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:47.629
know months of the year to help me be
more efficient about the way I staff

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639
more efficient about the way I staff
 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.930
more efficient about the way I staff
people in that office or the temperature

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940
people in that office or the temperature
 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.879
people in that office or the temperature
or the cooling or the electricity that I

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889
or the cooling or the electricity that I
 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:55.510
or the cooling or the electricity that I
feed to that part of my of my facility

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520
feed to that part of my of my facility
 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.159
feed to that part of my of my facility
so that data that's created these

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169
so that data that's created these
 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:01.790
so that data that's created these
streams of data are sets of data that I

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800
streams of data are sets of data that I
 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.210
streams of data are sets of data that I
may not already have a technology

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220
may not already have a technology
 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.610
may not already have a technology
platform to process I don't know how to

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620
platform to process I don't know how to
 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.830
platform to process I don't know how to
process streams maybe so now I have to

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840
process streams maybe so now I have to
 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.050
process streams maybe so now I have to
think about a new architecture a new way

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060
think about a new architecture a new way
 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.149
think about a new architecture a new way
to process a stream of data not just a

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:14.159
to process a stream of data not just a
 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:16.070
to process a stream of data not just a
stream but you know maybe I have a

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080
stream but you know maybe I have a
 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.080
stream but you know maybe I have a
hundred facilities that I have these

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090
hundred facilities that I have these
 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.999
hundred facilities that I have these
sensors in and they're creating these

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:20.009
sensors in and they're creating these
 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:22.820
sensors in and they're creating these
streams of data so now I've got a new

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830
streams of data so now I've got a new
 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.249
streams of data so now I've got a new
challenge around data one of the

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:25.259
challenge around data one of the
 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:27.950
challenge around data one of the
challenges starts to feed and link into

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960
challenges starts to feed and link into
 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.180
challenges starts to feed and link into
the big data topic

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190
the big data topic
 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.520
the big data topic
so as I'm collecting these individual

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530
so as I'm collecting these individual
 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.330
so as I'm collecting these individual
sensor data points over hundreds or

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340
sensor data points over hundreds or
 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.800
sensor data points over hundreds or
thousands or tens of thousands of

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810
thousands or tens of thousands of
 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.469
thousands or tens of thousands of
sensors every minute or every second

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479
sensors every minute or every second
 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:41.719
sensors every minute or every second
I've now got these these the

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:41.729
I've now got these these the
 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:43.129
I've now got these these the
parallel streams of data I have to

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:43.139
parallel streams of data I have to
 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:46.579
parallel streams of data I have to
process and so it's unclear exactly how

00:06:46.579 --> 00:06:46.589
process and so it's unclear exactly how
 

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:48.799
process and so it's unclear exactly how
much data I would want to keep for how

00:06:48.799 --> 00:06:48.809
much data I would want to keep for how
 

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:51.469
much data I would want to keep for how
long but it's certainly a new kind of

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:51.479
long but it's certainly a new kind of
 

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:53.899
long but it's certainly a new kind of
data architecture and for some companies

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:53.909
data architecture and for some companies
 

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:55.640
data architecture and for some companies
will be a big data problem because

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:55.650
will be a big data problem because
 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.320
will be a big data problem because
there's going to be a lot of this data

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.330
there's going to be a lot of this data
 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.629
there's going to be a lot of this data
for large companies for a lot of sensors

00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639
for large companies for a lot of sensors
 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:01.700
for large companies for a lot of sensors
and a lot of facilities or a lot of

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710
and a lot of facilities or a lot of
 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.200
and a lot of facilities or a lot of
products that they want to track or

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.210
products that they want to track or
 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.309
products that they want to track or
whatever it is that they want to get

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319
whatever it is that they want to get
 

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:06.679
whatever it is that they want to get
more insight into by putting tags or

00:07:06.679 --> 00:07:06.689
more insight into by putting tags or
 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:10.790
more insight into by putting tags or
sensors on them so to me this is one of

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800
sensors on them so to me this is one of
 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.610
sensors on them so to me this is one of
the sort of subset subdomains of big

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.620
the sort of subset subdomains of big
 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.399
the sort of subset subdomains of big
data around sensor data streams of data

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:16.409
data around sensor data streams of data
 

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:17.719
data around sensor data streams of data
that we're going to have to think about

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:17.729
that we're going to have to think about
 

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.119
that we're going to have to think about
new architectures and new designs for a

00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:20.129
new architectures and new designs for a
 

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:22.309
new architectures and new designs for a
new technologies for capturing them

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319
new technologies for capturing them
 

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:24.769
new technologies for capturing them
storing them processing them aggregating

00:07:24.769 --> 00:07:24.779
storing them processing them aggregating
 

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:26.839
storing them processing them aggregating
them analyzing them and so on so I think

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:26.849
them analyzing them and so on so I think
 

00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:27.889
them analyzing them and so on so I think
it's going to be a real interesting

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:27.899
it's going to be a real interesting
 

00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:30.950
it's going to be a real interesting
evolution to see how the Big Data

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960
evolution to see how the Big Data
 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.529
evolution to see how the Big Data
technologies and technologies in general

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:33.539
technologies and technologies in general
 

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:37.939
technologies and technologies in general
are emerging to deal with streams of of

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:37.949
are emerging to deal with streams of of
 

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:40.550
are emerging to deal with streams of of
sensor data
