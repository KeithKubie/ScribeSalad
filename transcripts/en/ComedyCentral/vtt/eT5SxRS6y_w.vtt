00:00:02.735 --> 00:00:05.772
ANNOUNCER:<i> Ladies and gentlemen,
 the 45th and final</i>

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:08.107
<i>President of the United States.</i>

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.076
(cheers and applause)

00:00:12.878 --> 00:00:14.647
Wow.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.549
Unbelievable.

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:17.850
-Mr. President!
-Mr. President! -Mr. President!

00:00:17.883 --> 00:00:19.786
-Unbelievable. -Mr. President.
-Mr. President.

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:21.120
You're welcome.

00:00:21.153 --> 00:00:23.122
Thank you. Thank you.

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:25.591
First, let me just take a moment

00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:27.960
to insult Jeff Sessions.

00:00:27.993 --> 00:00:31.898
Jeff, you look like a melting
Gap Kids mannequin.

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:33.066
Okay, Jeff?

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:34.200
You got it?

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:35.968
Moving on.

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:38.137
How do you respond
to criticism of your ban

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.273
of transgender people
in military service?

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:41.607
Like this:

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.342
I'd like to introduce you

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:45.378
to my favorite new team member

00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:47.447
who I will eventually betray,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.515
Anthony Scaramucci.

00:00:49.548 --> 00:00:50.716
(cheers and applause)

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:51.751
-Thank you.
-Wow.

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:53.986
Thank you. Thank you.

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.122
-Wow. Wow.
-Thank you. Thank you.

00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:57.356
Thank you.

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:59.125
I love the president. Thank you.

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:01.794
-I love the president.
I love it. -I love you.

00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:03.663
-I love you. I love you.
-I love you.

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:05.331
-I love you.
-I freaking love you.

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:06.933
(sighs)

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.202
(cheering and applause)

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.837
Thank you.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.306
I'm gonna fire so many people.

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:15.541
I don't know
who it's gonna be-- Reince--

00:01:15.574 --> 00:01:16.976
but I'm gonna get to the bottom

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.377
of the leakage
in the White House.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.246
You hear me, Reince?

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:21.948
There's an old
Italian expression

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:24.083
my mother used to use
when somebody hurt her.

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:26.919
She'd say,
"Stick the umbrella up my ass

00:01:26.952 --> 00:01:29.222
-but don't open it.”
-Wow.

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:31.757
I love ethnics.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.193
And I love President Chump.

00:01:34.226 --> 00:01:37.196
He's the love of my life,
and I love love.

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.297
I love love.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.166
I can suck my own (bleep).

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:42.268
Can you comment...
can you comment on the fact

00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:45.505
that only a few years ago,
you supported Democrats,

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:48.040
were pro-choice
and pro-gun control?

00:01:48.073 --> 00:01:49.308
You talking to me or him?

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:50.810
Because we both did that.

00:01:50.843 --> 00:01:52.578
It's like looking in a mirror.

00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:54.447
-Ooey, ooey, ooey,
ooey, ooey, ooey! -(laughs)

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.582
-Snap out of it!
-(gasps)

00:01:56.615 --> 00:01:59.485
(laughter)

00:01:59.518 --> 00:02:01.454
This guy is phenomenal.

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:03.723
I've seen him
at Madison Square Garden

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:06.225
in a topcoat,
hitting foul shots.

00:02:06.258 --> 00:02:07.660
Swish, swish.

00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:08.995
It swished.

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:12.498
I've also seen him eat
a live raccoon, bones and all,

00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:14.700
and (bleep) out
a Siamese house cat.

00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:15.968
Wow.

00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:17.970
Who is this guy?
He sounds phenomenal.

00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:19.372
-It's you!
-It's me?

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:20.840
(laughs)

00:02:20.873 --> 00:02:23.643
Yes, yes, my love.

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:26.212
This is the new reality,

00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:28.347
which brings us
to tonight's theme.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.149
Tell them the theme, Mooch.

00:02:30.182 --> 00:02:31.384
Joe Paterno.

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:33.586
What?

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:35.154
<i> Scusa</i> me.

00:02:35.187 --> 00:02:36.956
The theme is reality.

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.891
That's right, reality.

00:02:38.924 --> 00:02:41.627
I started out on reality TV,

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.130
and now I'm getting you
to face the reality

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:46.832
that Russia is good,
Europe is bad

00:02:46.865 --> 00:02:50.269
and America is a sewer
full of cesspools

00:02:50.302 --> 00:02:52.405
overflowing with carnage.

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:53.873
It's terrible. It's terrible.

00:02:53.906 --> 00:02:55.975
I don't like it.
Correction, I love it.

00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:57.410
I love it, too.

00:02:57.443 --> 00:03:00.479
I can barely tell
where you end and I start.

00:03:00.512 --> 00:03:02.114
-I'm the president!
-We're the president!

00:03:02.147 --> 00:03:03.482
-Would you believe it?
-Can you believe it?

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:04.581
BOTH:
Let's roll!
