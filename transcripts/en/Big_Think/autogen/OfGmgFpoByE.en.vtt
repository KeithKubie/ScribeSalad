and chemical communication which is
 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.860
and chemical communication which is
important and among animals which is

so I was working on that in the ants and

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559
so I was working on that in the ants and
 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.330
so I was working on that in the ants and
helping to dis decode we were we were

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340
helping to dis decode we were we were
 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.720
helping to dis decode we were we were
decoding the ant pheromone language well

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730
decoding the ant pheromone language well
 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.709
decoding the ant pheromone language well
about that time the army decided that it

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719
about that time the army decided that it
 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.189
about that time the army decided that it
wasn't literally it wanted to literally

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199
wasn't literally it wanted to literally
 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.420

sniff out the enemy in Vietnam because

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430
sniff out the enemy in Vietnam because
 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.500
sniff out the enemy in Vietnam because
there was so much danger you know and

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510
there was so much danger you know and
 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.620
there was so much danger you know and
these Rascals coming out of their their

these Rascals coming out of their their
 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.740
these Rascals coming out of their their
tunnels suddenly or or advancing on you

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750
tunnels suddenly or or advancing on you
 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.710

slowly through the jungle and they

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720
slowly through the jungle and they
 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.749
slowly through the jungle and they
didn't know how to pick them up figure

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759
didn't know how to pick them up figure
 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.810

out when an attack was coming so there

was actually and I had only a marginal

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220
was actually and I had only a marginal
 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.620
was actually and I had only a marginal
amount of this I hardly any at all but

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630
amount of this I hardly any at all but
 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.030
amount of this I hardly any at all but
but I kept on I knew about it was to

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040
but I kept on I knew about it was to
 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.859
but I kept on I knew about it was to
analyze the odor of a human being as we

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869
analyze the odor of a human being as we
 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.840
analyze the odor of a human being as we
had been analyzing the odors and the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850
had been analyzing the odors and the
 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.340
had been analyzing the odors and the
chemicals released by ants to

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350
chemicals released by ants to
 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.210
chemicals released by ants to
communicate and to then have what was

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220
communicate and to then have what was
 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.359
communicate and to then have what was
what's called a sniffer scope which

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369
what's called a sniffer scope which
 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.819
what's called a sniffer scope which
would be set up and so that downwind you

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829
would be set up and so that downwind you
 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.090
would be set up and so that downwind you
would turn the red light on when human

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100
would turn the red light on when human
 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.090
would turn the red light on when human
odor came into it and there were more

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100
odor came into it and there were more
 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.920

never heard that the sniffer scope was

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290
never heard that the sniffer scope was
