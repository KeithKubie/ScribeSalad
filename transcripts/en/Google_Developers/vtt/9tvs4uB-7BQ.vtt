00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:01.755
Well, hi there.

00:00:01.755 --> 00:00:02.755
My name is Nick Butcher.

00:00:02.755 --> 00:00:06.640
I'm a designer and developer on
the Google Developer Relations

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.190
team.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.220
I'm based out of London,
but I'm here right now

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.960
in I/O in the Moscone
center, soaking up

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.020
the amazing atmosphere, the
carnival playground atmosphere,

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.519
which I think you could call it.

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:18.560
So it's great to be here.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.460
This is my fourth I/O,
I think, I've been to.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.335
And it's actually quite
fun for me this year,

00:00:22.335 --> 00:00:23.540
because I'm not speaking.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.140
So I haven't had
the massive amount

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.870
of nerves and preparation
to get my talk out there.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.910
But I've actually been spending
all my time in the design area.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.700
There's a whole area just to
talk about design and share

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.070
material design insights.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.361
And I've just been meeting
a whole bunch of developers.

00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:39.496
We've been looking at
apps, giving them feedback,

00:00:39.496 --> 00:00:40.870
chatting about
their apps, how we

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.870
can make it cooler, how
we could make it better,

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.954
how we could make it fit
better into the platform.

00:00:44.954 --> 00:00:46.370
So I've had a great
I/O. Just have

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.150
met a whole ton of
people, had a whole lot

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.647
of great conversations.

00:00:49.647 --> 00:00:51.730
I've been super excited
about a bunch of the stuff

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.640
we've shared.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.340
We've opened up-- just in
the last couple of days,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.600
there's a tsunami, an
avalanche of content.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.220
I know it's hard to keep up.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.860
But some of the highlights
for me-- obviously, we

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.910
talked about Android
M for the first time,

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.160
so some really, really great
stuff for users in there.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.050
I think Permissions are a
big, big fundamental change.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.279
For me, with design
being core to my heart,

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:14.820
I think the UX of how you ask
for those permission changes is

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.090
going to be really interesting
and something that we

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.200
need to look at and learn from.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.040
I'm really excited about all
the amazing stuff going on

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.830
with material design.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.417
So Matias Duarte gave
a great talk last night

00:01:27.417 --> 00:01:29.750
where he shared some numbers
about how things have gone,

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.208
and how many apps
have embraced it,

00:01:31.208 --> 00:01:35.179
and how they found that it has
helped them improve their app.

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:36.720
For the developer
me, I'm also really

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.000
excited about the new design
support library, which

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.500
is going to make it so much
easier for Android developers

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.440
out there to implement
all these material design

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.440
components in a consistent way.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.397
So that's really,
really exciting.

00:01:49.397 --> 00:01:51.730
But it's really, really great
to be back here at Moscone

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.184
and soak it all up,
meet the developers.

00:01:54.184 --> 00:01:56.100
It's a very different
look and feel this year.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.720
Hopefully you can see
there's a kind of rustic--

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.730
there's lots of cardboard
and corrugated iron.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.320
It feels a lot more friendly.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.580
Everyone's just really
enjoying it, hanging out,

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.360
chatting to each other,
lots of great conversations.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.197
For those of you who
couldn't make it here, sorry.

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:12.530
I hope you can make it one year.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.160
It's an amazing
experience, do try.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.840
But hopefully you
can follow along

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.110
with a lot of the content on
our Google Developers YouTube

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.802
channel.

00:02:21.802 --> 00:02:22.760
What else should I say?

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.510
Oh, you should also
definitely, definitely

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.400
check out the brand new website
we launched for Google Design.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.010
So if you go to
google.com/design,

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.020
there's a shiny new website
where we've added a whole bunch

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.940
of new content.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.390
Some of my favorite stuff
is a wonderful video

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.285
about how we made
material design, how

00:02:38.285 --> 00:02:40.660
to work with your brand and
material design, some really,

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.090
really great content there.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.010
But yeah, thanks very
much for joining me here

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.390
on the Moscone floor.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.300
I'm Nick Butcher, and yeah,

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.830

Developers channel to keep up
