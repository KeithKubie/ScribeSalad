1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,270
I mean belt or really now is like it's
a major player and they have like major,

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,670
major talent. Absolutely.
Very interesting. Yeah.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,510
I mean they don't get as much credit.
Obviously they're not those big promotion,

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,670
but they have some of the best
fighters. Yeah. They got, I mean look,

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,280
they've got gay guard sauce, you know,
they got Rory Macdonald. Macdonald. Yeah.

6
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:21,360
You can go down the list.

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,950
How about fucking Ryan Bader
Kayo and food with that crazy.

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,390
I thought Baylor was going to win.

9
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:30,180
I thought I was going to use this
pressure and just wear on him and mount

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,800
wrestling. Um, but yeah, that's crazy. 10
seconds. Well he clipped him with that.

11
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:39,300
Crazy. It's like a level chap. Yeah.
Level Change. Half Hook, Half Jab.

12
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,170
I think he was getting federal to think
that he was in drop for a shot and

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,820
looped to hook over the top.
Right.

14
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,230
It seemed like he wanted
to get fade or to do that.

15
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,410
Isn't that how I got the knockout? The
fight before that too, right, exactly.

16
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:51,810
And plaintiff took, yeah. Yeah.
I think it was a level change.

17
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:54,380
Left Hook and people are thinking like,
oh shit, he's coming for a take down.

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,770
What has a heavyweight man,
he's a motherfucker. I looks
good. He looks fantastic.

19
00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:01,920
Body looks good. You. Yeah. I mean
he looks like a heavyweight. Yeah.

20
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,760
And you know he's weighing two 35
ish, somewhere around there. You know,

21
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,860
which is a great weight
for heavyweight things.

22
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:09,660
The best way for that weight class.
Yeah.

23
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,700
There's that point of diminishing returns.
Right?

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,920
You get to like two 60
unless you're in Ghana.

25
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,370
Well see in Ghana who doesn't know how to
wrestle. So that's part of the problem.

26
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:20,770
But, but if he did holy fuck, but as,

27
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,790
as agile as you need to be arrested,
I don't know if he can move that fast.

28
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,580
He can move fast, man. That
kind of moves like a cat. Damn.

29
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,920
He scares the shit out of me.
Cause like if that guy knew,

30
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:35,190
he knew like what everybody else knew.
I just think he's so physically gifted.

31
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,690
Yeah. I mean when you see him punch
people it's like it's a different thing.

32
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,410
It's different. Yeah. Just a
lunchbox coming at your head.

33
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,340
The power is just preposterous. Just
doesn't even make any sense. Yeah.

34
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,690
If that guy could get with
a guy like Dwayne and start
moving and just, you know,

35
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,720
not just rely on throwing hammers but set
and stuff up and switching stances and

36
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,360
I don't know if you can do that
with that kind of weight. You know,

37
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,930
like how long can a guy like that move?
You know,

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,530
that Sam can get them to move that
long. I guarantee you dude, Sam,

39
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:10,380
like I'm telling you,
like if I'm going like from my body mass,

40
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:12,690
if I'm able to walk around with
a 65 and the lactate threshold,

41
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,620
he's told me I can have,

42
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,530
I guarantee you you can do it
with the big guy like that. Wow.

43
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:19,860
That would be insane. Well, there's
not a lot of big guys like that.

44
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:22,170
That's the thing too.
It's like who does he have to train with?

45
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:24,250
It's going to push him.
Yeah. You know, the I,

46
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,240
that is a giant problem with heavyweights,

47
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,860
whether it's in wrestling
or Jujitsu or anything,

48
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:32,760
it's finding someone that they could train
with. It's that heavy. That's that big.

49
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:37,510
I mean, he's, he's a legit
natural 265 pound man. Yeah.

50
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,170
You know what I mean? Well, I feel like
if you're getting hit by another 200 seat,

51
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:42,150
if I'm home man two it's
going to take more out of you.

52
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,440
Even if a to 65 and you're getting hit
by another guy's to 65 I still feel like

53
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:47,970
your head can only take so much.
