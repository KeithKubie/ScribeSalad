00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970
yeah absolutely
 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.640
yeah absolutely
so it can be a tough sell for you know

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650
so it can be a tough sell for you know
 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.199
so it can be a tough sell for you know
product that doesn't exist that may

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209
product that doesn't exist that may
 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.030
product that doesn't exist that may
never exist that's out there in this

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040
never exist that's out there in this
 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.220
never exist that's out there in this
kind of prototype form but I think what

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230
kind of prototype form but I think what
 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.229
kind of prototype form but I think what
really sold it internally was that the

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239
really sold it internally was that the
 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.729
really sold it internally was that the
key benefit or you know the

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739
key benefit or you know the
 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.409
key benefit or you know the
differentiator between this technology

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:37.419
differentiator between this technology
 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:39.539
differentiator between this technology
and what we have currently was so

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549
and what we have currently was so
 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.159
and what we have currently was so
profound that it really enabled the

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169
profound that it really enabled the
 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:42.809
profound that it really enabled the
shopping experience at home to be better

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819
shopping experience at home to be better
 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.909
shopping experience at home to be better
than at the store so when you think

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919
than at the store so when you think
 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:46.439
than at the store so when you think
about you know I want to buy a new couch

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449
about you know I want to buy a new couch
 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:48.089
about you know I want to buy a new couch
you get to measure the space you get to

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099
you get to measure the space you get to
 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:49.379
you get to measure the space you get to
figure out how it's going to fit in your

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389
figure out how it's going to fit in your
 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.089
figure out how it's going to fit in your
home then you get to go to the store you

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099
home then you get to go to the store you
 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:52.439
home then you get to go to the store you
get to see the product imagine it in

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449
get to see the product imagine it in
 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.300
get to see the product imagine it in
your space and often times you go to a

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310
your space and often times you go to a
 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.680
your space and often times you go to a
furniture store and it's like huge

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690
furniture store and it's like huge
 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.210
furniture store and it's like huge
ceilings and you know you get the big

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220
ceilings and you know you get the big
 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.580
ceilings and you know you get the big
spaced out things and the giant couch

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590
spaced out things and the giant couch
 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.199
spaced out things and the giant couch
looks small until you get it in your

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209
looks small until you get it in your
 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.610
looks small until you get it in your
home and then you realize it's too big

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620
home and then you realize it's too big
 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.099
home and then you realize it's too big
so I thought that was a great use case

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109
so I thought that was a great use case
 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.409
so I thought that was a great use case
for us to say here's the exact product

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:07.419
for us to say here's the exact product
 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:09.960
for us to say here's the exact product
in your space fitting exactly as it

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970
in your space fitting exactly as it
 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.939
in your space fitting exactly as it
needs to fit and I think then you know

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:11.949
needs to fit and I think then you know
 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.189
needs to fit and I think then you know
the long-term vision for that is that

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:14.199
the long-term vision for that is that
 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:16.020
the long-term vision for that is that
this technology is going to be in every

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030
this technology is going to be in every
 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.580
this technology is going to be in every

have that product online versus the

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150
have that product online versus the
 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.520
have that product online versus the
traditional store where you go in and

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530
traditional store where you go in and
 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.589
traditional store where you go in and
what you see is what you get basically

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599
what you see is what you get basically
 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:27.969
what you see is what you get basically
there's a limited amount of space you

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979
there's a limited amount of space you
 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:30.610
there's a limited amount of space you
can put the product in yet it's only 7%

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620
can put the product in yet it's only 7%
 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.260
can put the product in yet it's only 7%
right now and I think part of the

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270
right now and I think part of the
 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.029
right now and I think part of the
barrier is that you want to see exactly

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039
barrier is that you want to see exactly
 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:35.560
barrier is that you want to see exactly
how it's going to look in your space and

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570
how it's going to look in your space and
 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:36.969
how it's going to look in your space and
then you want to be able to sit on and

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979
then you want to be able to sit on and
 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:38.800
then you want to be able to sit on and
touch it and that's another even more

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810
touch it and that's another even more
 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.899
touch it and that's another even more
future facing technology but I feel like

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:40.909
future facing technology but I feel like
 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:42.969
future facing technology but I feel like
you know one win at a time and yeah they

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979
you know one win at a time and yeah they
 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:45.339
you know one win at a time and yeah they
are you know use case of like this is

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:45.349
are you know use case of like this is
 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:46.899
are you know use case of like this is
how it's going to look is only going to

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:46.909

and right fit for the IP and everything
 

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.590
and right fit for the IP and everything
so it sounds like you're more about

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600
so it sounds like you're more about
 

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.870
so it sounds like you're more about
enriching the lives of the people

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:17.880
enriching the lives of the people
 

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.570
enriching the lives of the people
playing and using the apps I mean that's

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:20.580
playing and using the apps I mean that's
 

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.730
playing and using the apps I mean that's
it's it's providing something the

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:22.740
it's it's providing something the
 

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.500
it's it's providing something the
technology is simply a tool but what

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:24.510
technology is simply a tool but what
 

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:25.850
technology is simply a tool but what
you're actually trying to do is enrich

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:25.860
you're actually trying to do is enrich
 

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.370
you're actually trying to do is enrich
their lives yeah absolutely yeah yeah

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:28.380
their lives yeah absolutely yeah yeah
 

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.040
their lives yeah absolutely yeah yeah
that point so you know since you're both

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:31.050
that point so you know since you're both
 

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:33.050
that point so you know since you're both
the product owners of your respective

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:33.060
the product owners of your respective
 

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.180
the product owners of your respective
app and game I'm wondering if you could

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:35.190
app and game I'm wondering if you could
 

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.320
app and game I'm wondering if you could
if we could have a little bit of a

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:36.330
if we could have a little bit of a
 

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.230
if we could have a little bit of a
discussion about what the design and and

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240
discussion about what the design and and
 

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.430
discussion about what the design and and
production and development challenges

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:40.440
production and development challenges
 

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.130
production and development challenges
were so let's take design first

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:43.140
were so let's take design first
 

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.230
were so let's take design first
so was there was there something about

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:45.240
so was there was there something about
 

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.570
so was there was there something about
your hypothesis of the design of each of

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:47.580
your hypothesis of the design of each of
 

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.280
your hypothesis of the design of each of
your products that you found along the

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:49.290
your products that you found along the
 

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.440
your products that you found along the
way you know you needed to change or

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:51.450
way you know you needed to change or
 

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.210
way you know you needed to change or
that you learned in the process of

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:53.220
that you learned in the process of
 

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.350
that you learned in the process of
creating needed to be changed in term

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360
creating needed to be changed in term
 

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.569
creating needed to be changed in term
design yeah absolutely so one of the

00:10:57.569 --> 00:10:57.579
design yeah absolutely so one of the
 

00:10:57.579 --> 00:10:59.730
design yeah absolutely so one of the
things we like to do now is open office

00:10:59.730 --> 00:10:59.740
things we like to do now is open office
 

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.350
things we like to do now is open office

employees in Boston to just come up and

00:11:07.079 --> 00:11:07.089
employees in Boston to just come up and
 

00:11:07.089 --> 00:11:08.910
employees in Boston to just come up and
play around and see what we're doing and

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:08.920
play around and see what we're doing and
 

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.340
play around and see what we're doing and
that's been great user testing because

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:11.350
that's been great user testing because
 

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.319
that's been great user testing because
we can get this like you know hands-on

00:11:13.319 --> 00:11:13.329
we can get this like you know hands-on
 

00:11:13.329 --> 00:11:15.509
we can get this like you know hands-on
test especially with tango where it's

00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:15.519
test especially with tango where it's
 

00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:17.040
test especially with tango where it's
something we can't just send out to

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:17.050
something we can't just send out to
 

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:18.569
something we can't just send out to
people's devices we actually have to see

00:11:18.569 --> 00:11:18.579
people's devices we actually have to see
 

00:11:18.579 --> 00:11:19.920
people's devices we actually have to see
them interact with them and give them

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:19.930
them interact with them and give them
 

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.350
them interact with them and give them
the device but getting outside of

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:22.360
the device but getting outside of
 

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.819
the device but getting outside of
engineering and getting people that are

00:11:23.819 --> 00:11:23.829
engineering and getting people that are
 

00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:25.410
engineering and getting people that are
you know working with products and

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:25.420
you know working with products and
 

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.940
you know working with products and
they're shopping at home and they're

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:26.950
they're shopping at home and they're
 

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.670
they're shopping at home and they're
organizing these categories getting them

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:29.680
organizing these categories getting them
 

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.710
organizing these categories getting them
to use the app was really rewarding and

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:31.720
to use the app was really rewarding and
 

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.110
to use the app was really rewarding and
interesting and I think we iterated a

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:34.120
interesting and I think we iterated a
 

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.139
interesting and I think we iterated a
lot on the UI and the design based on

00:11:37.139 --> 00:11:37.149
lot on the UI and the design based on
 

00:11:37.149 --> 00:11:38.699
lot on the UI and the design based on
you know those conversations and that

00:11:38.699 --> 00:11:38.709
you know those conversations and that
 

00:11:38.709 --> 00:11:40.710
you know those conversations and that
feedback and working with you know

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720
feedback and working with you know
 

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.329
feedback and working with you know
people just giving them the device and

00:11:42.329 --> 00:11:42.339
people just giving them the device and
 

00:11:42.339 --> 00:11:44.280
people just giving them the device and
not saying anything saying go you know

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:44.290
not saying anything saying go you know
 

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.650
not saying anything saying go you know
use it seeing where the pitfalls were

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:46.660
use it seeing where the pitfalls were
 

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.930
use it seeing where the pitfalls were
what gestures worked like for example we

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:48.940
what gestures worked like for example we
 

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.750
what gestures worked like for example we
had a two finger rotation thing first so

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760
had a two finger rotation thing first so
 

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.550
had a two finger rotation thing first so
you swipe left and right to rotate the

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:53.560
you swipe left and right to rotate the
 

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.639
you swipe left and right to rotate the
product no one could figure it out so we

00:11:56.639 --> 00:11:56.649
product no one could figure it out so we
 

00:11:56.649 --> 00:11:58.139
product no one could figure it out so we
realized like everyone's trying to

00:11:58.139 --> 00:11:58.149
realized like everyone's trying to
 

00:11:58.149 --> 00:12:00.120
realized like everyone's trying to
circle like do the circle rotate even

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:00.130
circle like do the circle rotate even
 

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.250
circle like do the circle rotate even
though it didn't necessarily match what

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:02.260
though it didn't necessarily match what
 

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.079
though it didn't necessarily match what
we were thinking and when we switched to

00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:04.089
we were thinking and when we switched to
 

00:12:04.089 --> 00:12:05.639
we were thinking and when we switched to
that we found that people naturally got

00:12:05.639 --> 00:12:05.649
that we found that people naturally got
 

00:12:05.649 --> 00:12:07.710
that we found that people naturally got
it a lot faster so like little things

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:07.720
it a lot faster so like little things
 

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.960
it a lot faster so like little things
like that I think the user testing goes

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:09.970
like that I think the user testing goes
 

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.030
like that I think the user testing goes
a long way right on yeah

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:12.040
a long way right on yeah
 

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.519
a long way right on yeah
Tatsu I guess for us one of the big

00:12:14.519 --> 00:12:14.529
Tatsu I guess for us one of the big
 

00:12:14.529 --> 00:12:16.410
Tatsu I guess for us one of the big
thing is when we started the project we

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:16.420
thing is when we started the project we
 

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.210
thing is when we started the project we
thought we can just stop have the

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:18.220
thought we can just stop have the
 

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.980
thought we can just stop have the
pokemons running around you know on the

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:19.990
pokemons running around you know on the
 

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.819
pokemons running around you know on the
map yeah

00:12:20.819 --> 00:12:20.829
map yeah
 

00:12:20.829 --> 00:12:22.980
map yeah
tried it obviously didn't work because

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:22.990
tried it obviously didn't work because
 

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.560
tried it obviously didn't work because
we have I have to as a player running

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:25.570
we have I have to as a player running
 

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.180
we have I have to as a player running
around chasing pokemons just doesn't

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:27.190
around chasing pokemons just doesn't
 

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:28.500
around chasing pokemons just doesn't
work in the real world that's something

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:28.510
work in the real world that's something
 

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:31.050
work in the real world that's something
we finally found out but in terms of

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:31.060
we finally found out but in terms of
 

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.900
we finally found out but in terms of
design we because it's a game we expect

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:33.910
design we because it's a game we expect
 

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.230
design we because it's a game we expect
people to play in the outside we really

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:37.240
people to play in the outside we really
 

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.389
people to play in the outside we really
tried hard to make the whole old

00:12:39.389 --> 00:12:39.399
tried hard to make the whole old
 

00:12:39.399 --> 00:12:43.400
tried hard to make the whole old
gestures or UI reachable from your thumb

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:43.410
gestures or UI reachable from your thumb
 

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:45.449
gestures or UI reachable from your thumb
that's why the Pokemon game you've

00:12:45.449 --> 00:12:45.459
that's why the Pokemon game you've
 

00:12:45.459 --> 00:12:47.610
that's why the Pokemon game you've
opened it most of the major tasks you

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:47.620
opened it most of the major tasks you
 

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.250
opened it most of the major tasks you
can accomplish by just one finger that's

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:50.260
can accomplish by just one finger that's
 

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.689
can accomplish by just one finger that's
something we've tried really hard and

00:12:51.689 --> 00:12:51.699
something we've tried really hard and
 

00:12:51.699 --> 00:12:55.650
something we've tried really hard and
with that we like there's one unique

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:55.660
with that we like there's one unique
 

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.840
with that we like there's one unique
gesture in our game where you can use

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:57.850
gesture in our game where you can use
 

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:00.930
gesture in our game where you can use
one finger to rotate the map like even

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:00.940
one finger to rotate the map like even
 

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.569
one finger to rotate the map like even
internally we had some debate some

00:13:03.569 --> 00:13:03.579
internally we had some debate some
 

00:13:03.579 --> 00:13:06.180
internally we had some debate some
people were thinking that is not

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:06.190
people were thinking that is not
 

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:08.670
people were thinking that is not
sounding something people used to maybe

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:08.680
sounding something people used to maybe
 

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.699
sounding something people used to maybe
we should not do it but after

00:13:10.699 --> 00:13:10.709
we should not do it but after
 

00:13:10.709 --> 00:13:13.740
we should not do it but after
implemented and tested with various

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:13.750
implemented and tested with various
 

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.199
implemented and tested with various
people everybody liked it so and we

00:13:16.199 --> 00:13:16.209
people everybody liked it so and we
 

00:13:16.209 --> 00:13:17.880
people everybody liked it so and we
decided to do that so there are a lot of

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:17.890
decided to do that so there are a lot of
 

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:20.309
decided to do that so there are a lot of
like what you said you know trial and

00:13:20.309 --> 00:13:20.319
like what you said you know trial and
 

00:13:20.319 --> 00:13:22.800
like what you said you know trial and
error about during the process but in

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:22.810
error about during the process but in
 

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:24.480
error about during the process but in
your case though it seemed like there

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:24.490
your case though it seemed like there
 

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.100
your case though it seemed like there
was quite a bit more involved with the

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:26.110
was quite a bit more involved with the
 

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:29.340
was quite a bit more involved with the
throw mechanic so I mean people of all

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:29.350

seems to naturally get that and get a

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:33.370
seems to naturally get that and get a
 

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:35.130
seems to naturally get that and get a
lot of thrill out of that but it wasn't

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:35.140
lot of thrill out of that but it wasn't
 

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:36.990
lot of thrill out of that but it wasn't
a very simple thing right right yeah

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:37.000
a very simple thing right right yeah
 

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.760
a very simple thing right right yeah
yeah that was that part actually was

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:38.770
yeah that was that part actually was
 

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:41.910
yeah that was that part actually was
pretty hard even if you think it is just

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920
pretty hard even if you think it is just
 

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.680
pretty hard even if you think it is just
you know flicking your finger how hard

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:43.690
you know flicking your finger how hard
 

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:46.530
you know flicking your finger how hard
that is but uh it took I think we did

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:46.540
that is but uh it took I think we did
 

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.290
that is but uh it took I think we did
three or four iterations just to get it

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:49.300
three or four iterations just to get it
 

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.180
three or four iterations just to get it
right because you know on the phone

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:51.190
right because you know on the phone
 

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:52.500
right because you know on the phone
they're different people have different

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:52.510
they're different people have different
 

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:56.040
they're different people have different
phone size and have different resolution

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:56.050
phone size and have different resolution
 

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:59.280
phone size and have different resolution
so to make it work full across the

00:13:59.280 --> 00:13:59.290
so to make it work full across the
 

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:01.889
so to make it work full across the
devices that was very challenging is I

00:14:01.889 --> 00:14:01.899
devices that was very challenging is I
 

00:14:01.899 --> 00:14:04.699
devices that was very challenging is I
think we can still improve it but uh

00:14:04.699 --> 00:14:04.709
think we can still improve it but uh
 

00:14:04.709 --> 00:14:10.199
think we can still improve it but uh
like one of the thing we really Oh was

00:14:10.199 --> 00:14:10.209
like one of the thing we really Oh was
 

00:14:10.209 --> 00:14:14.160
like one of the thing we really Oh was
difficult is the the rate of the

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:14.170
difficult is the the rate of the
 

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:17.220
difficult is the the rate of the
sampling we're using a unity in our app

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:17.230
sampling we're using a unity in our app
 

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:20.059
sampling we're using a unity in our app
the unity sample samplers

you know kit has some room for

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480
you know kit has some room for
 

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.759
you know kit has some room for
improvement so we we we we had to work

00:14:26.759 --> 00:14:26.769
improvement so we we we we had to work
 

00:14:26.769 --> 00:14:29.100
improvement so we we we we had to work
you know work around it to make sure

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:29.110
you know work around it to make sure
 

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:32.220
you know work around it to make sure
that when you flick it goes it's a 2d

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:32.230
that when you flick it goes it's a 2d
 

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.400
that when you flick it goes it's a 2d
map into 3d so make it sure that you

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:35.410
map into 3d so make it sure that you
 

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:38.579
map into 3d so make it sure that you
feel like you are doing it right so okay

00:14:38.579 --> 00:14:38.589
feel like you are doing it right so okay
 

00:14:38.589 --> 00:14:42.150
feel like you are doing it right so okay
now you're working with tango for the

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.160
now you're working with tango for the
 

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.130
now you're working with tango for the
first time AR is still a relatively new

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:44.140
first time AR is still a relatively new

to your production schedule or to your
 

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.470
to your production schedule or to your
budget in in kind of working through

budget in in kind of working through
 

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.500
budget in in kind of working through
some of the kinks of AR I don't know

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:55.510
some of the kinks of AR I don't know
 

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:57.150
some of the kinks of AR I don't know
that we had I mean our team's a little

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:57.160
that we had I mean our team's a little
 

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.860
that we had I mean our team's a little
bit unique in the sense that were like a

00:14:58.860 --> 00:14:58.870
bit unique in the sense that were like a
 

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:01.350
bit unique in the sense that were like a
dedicated R&amp;D team so it's kind of

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360
dedicated R&amp;D team so it's kind of
 

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.480
dedicated R&amp;D team so it's kind of
expected that we're gonna be hacking

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:03.490
expected that we're gonna be hacking
 

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:06.269
expected that we're gonna be hacking
things together and working with teams

00:15:06.269 --> 00:15:06.279
things together and working with teams
 

00:15:06.279 --> 00:15:08.069
things together and working with teams
like Google for example was working

00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:08.079
like Google for example was working
 

00:15:08.079 --> 00:15:10.740
like Google for example was working
closely with us to identify issues for

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:10.750
closely with us to identify issues for
 

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.990
closely with us to identify issues for
like the tango core and things that the

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:13.000
like the tango core and things that the
 

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.809
like the tango core and things that the
device was doing at a lower level and so

00:15:15.809 --> 00:15:15.819
device was doing at a lower level and so
 

00:15:15.819 --> 00:15:17.850
device was doing at a lower level and so
that was I think for us going into it

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:17.860
that was I think for us going into it
 

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.860
that was I think for us going into it
kind of expected we weren't looking for

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:19.870
kind of expected we weren't looking for
 

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.960
kind of expected we weren't looking for
this perfect out-of-the-box solution it

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:21.970
this perfect out-of-the-box solution it
 

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:23.400
this perfect out-of-the-box solution it
was more like okay we're going to be

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:23.410
was more like okay we're going to be
 

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:26.340
was more like okay we're going to be
investing our D to cutting-edge tech so

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:26.350
investing our D to cutting-edge tech so
 

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:28.230
investing our D to cutting-edge tech so
you know one of the things that comes

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240
you know one of the things that comes
 

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.019
you know one of the things that comes
with that is this kind of unknown around

00:15:31.019 --> 00:15:31.029
with that is this kind of unknown around
 

00:15:31.029 --> 00:15:33.269
with that is this kind of unknown around
like development time where you know in

00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279
like development time where you know in
 

00:15:33.279 --> 00:15:35.970
like development time where you know in
general as an engineer like I find a lot

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:35.980
general as an engineer like I find a lot
 

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:36.990
general as an engineer like I find a lot
of times it's really hard to estimate

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:37.000
of times it's really hard to estimate
 

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.120
of times it's really hard to estimate
how long a particular task is going to

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:39.130
how long a particular task is going to
 

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.400
how long a particular task is going to
take because you might come to a quick

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:41.410
take because you might come to a quick
 

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.019
take because you might come to a quick
conclusion or something might just work

00:15:43.019 --> 00:15:43.029
conclusion or something might just work
 

00:15:43.029 --> 00:15:45.600
conclusion or something might just work
and that's awesome but a lot of times it

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:45.610
and that's awesome but a lot of times it
 

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:46.710
and that's awesome but a lot of times it
doesn't and then you have to kind of

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720
doesn't and then you have to kind of
 

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.449
doesn't and then you have to kind of
like investigate and pick and poke and

00:15:48.449 --> 00:15:48.459
like investigate and pick and poke and
 

00:15:48.459 --> 00:15:50.429
like investigate and pick and poke and
figure out why something that isn't

00:15:50.429 --> 00:15:50.439
figure out why something that isn't
 

00:15:50.439 --> 00:15:51.809
figure out why something that isn't
working isn't working and then

00:15:51.809 --> 00:15:51.819
working isn't working and then
 

00:15:51.819 --> 00:15:53.429
working isn't working and then
eventually get to your solution that's

00:15:53.429 --> 00:15:53.439
eventually get to your solution that's
 

00:15:53.439 --> 00:15:54.840
eventually get to your solution that's
you know it's great to be an engineer

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:54.850
you know it's great to be an engineer
 

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.790
you know it's great to be an engineer
it's fun to get that Eureka moment but

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:56.800
it's fun to get that Eureka moment but
 

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.079
it's fun to get that Eureka moment but
there's a lot of time where there's that

00:15:58.079 --> 00:15:58.089
there's a lot of time where there's that
 

00:15:58.089 --> 00:16:00.449
there's a lot of time where there's that
kind of unknown window of is this gonna

00:16:00.449 --> 00:16:00.459
kind of unknown window of is this gonna
 

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:01.980
kind of unknown window of is this gonna
work is you know am i doing the right

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:01.990
work is you know am i doing the right
 

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:04.740
work is you know am i doing the right
thing is is this our code is this

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:04.750
thing is is this our code is this
 

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:06.929
thing is is this our code is this
Google's code is this a device problem

00:16:06.929 --> 00:16:06.939
Google's code is this a device problem
 

00:16:06.939 --> 00:16:09.210
Google's code is this a device problem
and I think a lot of that stuff has been

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:09.220
and I think a lot of that stuff has been
 

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:10.679
and I think a lot of that stuff has been
ironed out at this point which is great

00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:10.689
ironed out at this point which is great
 

00:16:10.689 --> 00:16:13.019
ironed out at this point which is great
but over the last you know with say

00:16:13.019 --> 00:16:13.029
but over the last you know with say
 

00:16:13.029 --> 00:16:14.519
but over the last you know with say
eight months or so while we were doing

00:16:14.519 --> 00:16:14.529
eight months or so while we were doing
 

00:16:14.529 --> 00:16:16.980
eight months or so while we were doing
the core development it was one of those

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:16.990
the core development it was one of those
 

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:18.689
the core development it was one of those
things that you know we just kind of

00:16:18.689 --> 00:16:18.699
things that you know we just kind of
 

00:16:18.699 --> 00:16:20.280
things that you know we just kind of
kept it like trial and error

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:20.290
kept it like trial and error
 

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:21.689
kept it like trial and error
see what works and try to make changes

00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:21.699
see what works and try to make changes
 

00:16:21.699 --> 00:16:24.150
see what works and try to make changes
and improvements and now it's like super

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160
and improvements and now it's like super
 

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.130
and improvements and now it's like super
solid so it's been it's been great what

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:26.140
solid so it's been it's been great what
 

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.049
solid so it's been it's been great what
would you recommend to people developing

00:16:28.049 --> 00:16:28.059
would you recommend to people developing
 

00:16:28.059 --> 00:16:29.880
would you recommend to people developing
AR with tango what would you suggest

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:29.890
AR with tango what would you suggest
 

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:32.460
AR with tango what would you suggest
that they plan for yeah core development

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:32.470
that they plan for yeah core development
 

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.949
that they plan for yeah core development
Windom I mean I think the first thing to

00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:34.959
Windom I mean I think the first thing to
 

00:16:34.959 --> 00:16:36.809
Windom I mean I think the first thing to
do is to actually just get a device in

00:16:36.809 --> 00:16:36.819
do is to actually just get a device in
 

00:16:36.819 --> 00:16:38.460
do is to actually just get a device in
your hands in your office and start

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:38.470
your hands in your office and start
 

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.139
your hands in your office and start
showing people some of the existing apps

00:16:40.139 --> 00:16:40.149
showing people some of the existing apps
 

00:16:40.149 --> 00:16:41.700
showing people some of the existing apps
that are out there

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:41.710
that are out there
 

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.400
that are out there
then with that device heavier developers

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:44.410
then with that device heavier developers
 

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:46.140
then with that device heavier developers
you know we use unity I think a lot of

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:46.150
you know we use unity I think a lot of
 

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:47.910
you know we use unity I think a lot of
companies do these guys using unity as

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920
companies do these guys using unity as
 

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.220
companies do these guys using unity as
well try the unity toolkit because

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:50.230
well try the unity toolkit because

Google provides like a great starting

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:52.030
Google provides like a great starting
 

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.700

so they came up with this business use
 

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:57.150

making the app is one thing but
supporting with content is the you know

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:22.690
supporting with content is the you know
 

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:24.990
supporting with content is the you know
in some cases the larger challenge was

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.000
in some cases the larger challenge was
 

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.880
in some cases the larger challenge was
that an internally developed 3d modeler

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:26.890
that an internally developed 3d modeler
 

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:30.510
that an internally developed 3d modeler
so what we did is ended up we're using

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:30.520
so what we did is ended up we're using
 

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:34.260
so what we did is ended up we're using
various like outsourcing opportunities

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:34.270
various like outsourcing opportunities
 

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:35.610
various like outsourcing opportunities
and now we're partnering with different

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:35.620
and now we're partnering with different
 

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.620
and now we're partnering with different
companies that specialize in 3d content

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:37.630
companies that specialize in 3d content
 

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:40.170
companies that specialize in 3d content
production great and so on average it

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:40.180
production great and so on average it
 

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.030
production great and so on average it
cost about 25 dollars for us to model a

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:42.040
cost about 25 dollars for us to model a
 

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.660
cost about 25 dollars for us to model a
3d product and it's is cost savings over

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:45.670
3d product and it's is cost savings over
 

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:47.850
3d product and it's is cost savings over
the photography but my team is also

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:47.860
the photography but my team is also
 

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:50.160
the photography but my team is also
developing a 3d scanning technology that

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:50.170
developing a 3d scanning technology that
 

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:51.690
developing a 3d scanning technology that
I think will further drive down costs

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:51.700
I think will further drive down costs
 

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.000
I think will further drive down costs
and ultimately push that technology into

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.010
and ultimately push that technology into
 

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:55.260
and ultimately push that technology into
the hands of our suppliers and vendors

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:55.270
the hands of our suppliers and vendors
 

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.330
the hands of our suppliers and vendors
right that have the products in their

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:57.340
right that have the products in their
 

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.220
right that have the products in their
you know facilities then they can do

00:20:59.220 --> 00:20:59.230
you know facilities then they can do
 

00:20:59.230 --> 00:20:59.600
you know facilities then they can do
that

00:20:59.600 --> 00:20:59.610
that
 

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:02.030
that
for us I think ultimately when we think

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:02.040
for us I think ultimately when we think
 

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.130
for us I think ultimately when we think
of an AR and VR a lot of its going to be

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:04.140
of an AR and VR a lot of its going to be
 

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.410
of an AR and VR a lot of its going to be
about the content and people start need

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:06.420
about the content and people start need
 

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.330
about the content and people start need
to think about you know the 3d aspect of

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:08.340
to think about you know the 3d aspect of
 

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.880
to think about you know the 3d aspect of
the content it's like a lot of ways is

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:10.890
the content it's like a lot of ways is
 

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:12.560
the content it's like a lot of ways is
like you know the web in their early

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:12.570
like you know the web in their early
 

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:14.060
like you know the web in their early
days when you want to start selling

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:14.070
days when you want to start selling
 

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:15.680
days when you want to start selling
stuff online you know it's like oh what

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:15.690
stuff online you know it's like oh what
 

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:16.970
stuff online you know it's like oh what
do I need to sell a product on the

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:16.980
do I need to sell a product on the
 

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:18.470
do I need to sell a product on the
Internet I need a picture I need some

Internet I need a picture I need some
 

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.660
Internet I need a picture I need some
descriptions and pricing sure and I

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:20.670
descriptions and pricing sure and I
 

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.160
descriptions and pricing sure and I
think if we want to sell stuff in a are

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:22.170
think if we want to sell stuff in a are
 

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.200
think if we want to sell stuff in a are
we need a 3d model and that's something

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:24.210
we need a 3d model and that's something
 

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:25.940
we need a 3d model and that's something
that in some cases it exists because

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:25.950
that in some cases it exists because
 

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:27.919
that in some cases it exists because
it's drawn and CAD but in other use

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:27.929
it's drawn and CAD but in other use
 

00:21:27.929 --> 00:21:30.560
it's drawn and CAD but in other use
cases it doesn't in ours for most of our

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:30.570
cases it doesn't in ours for most of our
 

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:32.480
cases it doesn't in ours for most of our
products they don't exist in 3d so

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:32.490
products they don't exist in 3d so
 

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:34.340
products they don't exist in 3d so
that's an additional challenge that

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:34.350
that's an additional challenge that
 

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:36.080
that's an additional challenge that
we've been trying to address and I think

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:36.090
we've been trying to address and I think
 

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:37.610
we've been trying to address and I think
over the next few years we'll see the

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:37.620
over the next few years we'll see the
 

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:39.919
over the next few years we'll see the
technology get there so that almost

00:21:39.919 --> 00:21:39.929
technology get there so that almost
 

00:21:39.929 --> 00:21:41.270
technology get there so that almost
every product is going to have a 3d

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280
every product is going to have a 3d
 

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.400
every product is going to have a 3d
representation but in order to you know

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:43.410
representation but in order to you know
 

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:44.659
representation but in order to you know
think about your application and what

00:21:44.659 --> 00:21:44.669
think about your application and what
 

00:21:44.669 --> 00:21:46.669
think about your application and what
content you're going to need yeah work

00:21:46.669 --> 00:21:46.679
content you're going to need yeah work
 

00:21:46.679 --> 00:21:48.560
content you're going to need yeah work

gaming no New Zealand and audio first
yes yes also we you know we didn't do

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:19.060
yes yes also we you know we didn't do
 

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:21.000
yes yes also we you know we didn't do
any advertisement because we were

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:21.010
any advertisement because we were
 

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:23.460
any advertisement because we were
worried that we'll get too much traffic

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:23.470
worried that we'll get too much traffic
 

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:25.950
worried that we'll get too much traffic
we wanted to expand it slowly to make

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:25.960
we wanted to expand it slowly to make
 

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.800
we wanted to expand it slowly to make
sure our servers don't meltdown so we

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:28.810
sure our servers don't meltdown so we
 

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:31.950
sure our servers don't meltdown so we

you know when you push the button on
 

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:37.440
you know when you push the button on
Google Play it takes it takes a couple

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:37.450
Google Play it takes it takes a couple
 

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:39.750
Google Play it takes it takes a couple
minutes or I actually longer like an

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760
minutes or I actually longer like an
 

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.790

hour to propagate and for people to find
out we take a little longer so when we

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080
out we take a little longer so when we
 

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.050
out we take a little longer so when we
just click along the botton and we

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:46.060
just click along the botton and we
 

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.570
just click along the botton and we
started monitoring the graph and like

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:48.580
started monitoring the graph and like
 

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:49.530
started monitoring the graph and like
nothing happens

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:49.540
nothing happens
 

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:53.400
nothing happens
oh wow and we were like yeah or people

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:53.410
oh wow and we were like yeah or people
 

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:55.740
oh wow and we were like yeah or people
you know we were we became a little bit

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:55.750
you know we were we became a little bit
 

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:57.810
you know we were we became a little bit
nervous watching the graph but after a

00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:57.820
nervous watching the graph but after a

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:05.500
autism were able to use Pokemon go to
 

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:08.160

happy that I can you know involved in
someone's can have some impact to

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:16.090
someone's can have some impact to
 

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:18.270
someone's can have some impact to
someone's life in a positive way

and recently I think it was a Stanford

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:21.250
and recently I think it was a Stanford
 

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:24.840
and recently I think it was a Stanford
and Microsoft they published a study

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:24.850
and Microsoft they published a study
 

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:29.640
and Microsoft they published a study
saying that Pokemon go users are we

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:29.650
saying that Pokemon go users are we
 

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:32.060
saying that Pokemon go users are we
extended Pokemon go players life

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:32.070
extended Pokemon go players life
 

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:37.260
extended Pokemon go players life
expectancy by like 40 43 days Wow guys

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:37.270
expectancy by like 40 43 days Wow guys
 

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:40.940
expectancy by like 40 43 days Wow guys
so all those numbers I think are very

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:40.950
so all those numbers I think are very
 

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:43.770
so all those numbers I think are very
important to us down down the

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:43.780
important to us down down the
 

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.470
important to us down down the
traditional stats it's yeah it sounds

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:46.480
traditional stats it's yeah it sounds
 

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.360
traditional stats it's yeah it sounds
like it has more to do with caring for

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:48.370
like it has more to do with caring for
 

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:50.300
like it has more to do with caring for
the people playing your game than

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:50.310
the people playing your game than
 

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:53.250
the people playing your game than
actually tracking conventional metrics

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:53.260
actually tracking conventional metrics
 

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.620
actually tracking conventional metrics
and you know in a funny way there's also

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:55.630
and you know in a funny way there's also
 

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:57.090
and you know in a funny way there's also
maps to what we were talking about a

00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:57.100
maps to what we were talking about a
 

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.990
maps to what we were talking about a
little bit it's not so much

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000
little bit it's not so much
 

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.450
little bit it's not so much
about the installs for you either at

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:02.460
about the installs for you either at
 

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.150
about the installs for you either at
least at an initial level how are you

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:05.160
least at an initial level how are you
 

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.700
least at an initial level how are you
guys measuring impact and says yeah yeah

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:07.710
guys measuring impact and says yeah yeah
 

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:09.230
guys measuring impact and says yeah yeah
so certainly we have like the long-term

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:09.240
so certainly we have like the long-term
 

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.450
so certainly we have like the long-term
view that this technology is going to be

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:11.460
view that this technology is going to be
 

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.310
view that this technology is going to be
there eventually and we want to start

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:13.320
there eventually and we want to start
 

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.640
there eventually and we want to start
building our 3d product catalog now and

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:16.650
building our 3d product catalog now and
 

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:18.710
building our 3d product catalog now and
the devices are just available now so

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720
the devices are just available now so
 

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.300
the devices are just available now so
I've like one of the Lenovo devices here

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:20.310
I've like one of the Lenovo devices here
 

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:22.130
I've like one of the Lenovo devices here
so you can buy them now and it'll be

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:22.140
so you can buy them now and it'll be
 

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.810
so you can buy them now and it'll be
interesting to see what the adoption

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:23.820
interesting to see what the adoption
 

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:25.520
interesting to see what the adoption
rate is like for that particular device

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:25.530
rate is like for that particular device
 

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:28.370
rate is like for that particular device
but no one's like expecting any ROI on

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:28.380
but no one's like expecting any ROI on
 

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:30.650
but no one's like expecting any ROI on
on what we've done so far it's like oh

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:30.660
on what we've done so far it's like oh
 

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:33.140
on what we've done so far it's like oh
this is an interesting experiment and in

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:33.150
this is an interesting experiment and in
 

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:34.910
this is an interesting experiment and in
a long term we see the value in the

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:34.920
a long term we see the value in the
 

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.260
a long term we see the value in the
short term it's been a lot more about

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:36.270
short term it's been a lot more about
 

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:38.300
short term it's been a lot more about
publicity for the company and just

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:38.310
publicity for the company and just
 

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:39.860
publicity for the company and just
showing that we're forward-thinking tech

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:39.870
showing that we're forward-thinking tech
 

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:42.170
showing that we're forward-thinking tech
company often times you know you think

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:42.180
company often times you know you think
 

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.310
company often times you know you think
of wafer you think of furniture you

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:43.320
of wafer you think of furniture you
 

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.570
of wafer you think of furniture you
think of you know the shopping

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:44.580
think of you know the shopping
 

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:46.790
think of you know the shopping
experience but at our core we consider

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:46.800
experience but at our core we consider
 

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.500
experience but at our core we consider
ourselves a tech company that happens to

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:48.510
ourselves a tech company that happens to
 

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:50.720
ourselves a tech company that happens to
sell furniture and so I think by doing

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:50.730
sell furniture and so I think by doing
 

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:52.250
sell furniture and so I think by doing
this type of initiative it's a great way

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:52.260
this type of initiative it's a great way
 

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:54.080
this type of initiative it's a great way
for you know not only recruiting but

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:54.090
for you know not only recruiting but
 

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:56.210

we're hand modeling the products and

00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:58.380
we're hand modeling the products and
 

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.030
we're hand modeling the products and
that weaves you know a certain sense of

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:01.040
that weaves you know a certain sense of
 

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:04.100
that weaves you know a certain sense of
artistic design let's say because

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:04.110
artistic design let's say because
 

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:06.140
artistic design let's say because
basically the 3d modelers looking at

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:06.150
basically the 3d modelers looking at
 

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:07.970
basically the 3d modelers looking at
photo references and they're not

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:07.980
photo references and they're not
 

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:09.740
photo references and they're not
necessarily looking at you know the real

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:09.750
necessarily looking at you know the real
 

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:11.180
necessarily looking at you know the real
product they're just looking at photos

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:11.190
product they're just looking at photos
 

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:13.280
product they're just looking at photos
of that product whereas the 3d scanning

you were developing is like you know

00:31:15.379 --> 00:31:15.389
you were developing is like you know
 

00:31:15.389 --> 00:31:17.210
you were developing is like you know
millimeter accurate and we looks

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:17.220
millimeter accurate and we looks
 

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.519
millimeter accurate and we looks
photorealistic and the actual great

00:31:19.519 --> 00:31:19.529
photorealistic and the actual great
 

00:31:19.529 --> 00:31:21.350
photorealistic and the actual great
representation of the product so I'm

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360
representation of the product so I'm
 

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.759
representation of the product so I'm
really excited about the future for that

00:31:22.759 --> 00:31:22.769
really excited about the future for that
 

00:31:22.769 --> 00:31:24.649
really excited about the future for that
but I wish we could have done that from

00:31:24.649 --> 00:31:24.659
but I wish we could have done that from
 

00:31:24.659 --> 00:31:26.239
but I wish we could have done that from
the beginning rather than had this

00:31:26.239 --> 00:31:26.249
the beginning rather than had this
 

00:31:26.249 --> 00:31:29.090
the beginning rather than had this
interment intermediary step of hand

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:29.100
interment intermediary step of hand
 

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.159
interment intermediary step of hand
modeling all the products but the

00:31:31.159 --> 00:31:31.169
modeling all the products but the
 

00:31:31.169 --> 00:31:32.659
modeling all the products but the
scanning technology is something that's

00:31:32.659 --> 00:31:32.669
scanning technology is something that's
 

00:31:32.669 --> 00:31:34.299
scanning technology is something that's
you know it's constantly being developed

00:31:34.299 --> 00:31:34.309
you know it's constantly being developed
 

00:31:34.309 --> 00:31:36.590
you know it's constantly being developed
Google had an internal scanning company

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:36.600
Google had an internal scanning company
 

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.330
Google had an internal scanning company
as well that I guess got the axe

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:38.340
as well that I guess got the axe
 

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.070
as well that I guess got the axe
unfortunately but it's one of those

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080
unfortunately but it's one of those
 

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.479
unfortunately but it's one of those
technologies that's like really

00:31:41.479 --> 00:31:41.489
technologies that's like really
 

00:31:41.489 --> 00:31:44.029
technologies that's like really
promising for the right product and then

00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:44.039
promising for the right product and then
 

00:31:44.039 --> 00:31:45.649
promising for the right product and then
really challenging for the wrong product

00:31:45.649 --> 00:31:45.659
really challenging for the wrong product
 

00:31:45.659 --> 00:31:47.479
really challenging for the wrong product
like this end table wooden scan well

00:31:47.479 --> 00:31:47.489
like this end table wooden scan well
 

00:31:47.489 --> 00:31:49.279
like this end table wooden scan well
because it's all white and when you try

00:31:49.279 --> 00:31:49.289
because it's all white and when you try
 

00:31:49.289 --> 00:31:50.450
because it's all white and when you try
to reconstruct it

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:50.460
to reconstruct it
 

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.599
to reconstruct it
there's no good references to to get it

00:31:53.599 --> 00:31:53.609
there's no good references to to get it
 

00:31:53.609 --> 00:31:55.340
there's no good references to to get it
looking good so we're working on

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:55.350
looking good so we're working on
 

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:57.560
looking good so we're working on
techniques to kind of enhance the

00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:57.570
techniques to kind of enhance the
 

00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:59.029
techniques to kind of enhance the
scanning process but I wish we could

00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039
scanning process but I wish we could
 

00:31:59.039 --> 00:32:00.889
scanning process but I wish we could
have had that like what we have today a

00:32:00.889 --> 00:32:00.899
have had that like what we have today a
 

00:32:00.899 --> 00:32:03.109
have had that like what we have today a
year ago and what we're going to have in

00:32:03.109 --> 00:32:03.119
year ago and what we're going to have in
 

00:32:03.119 --> 00:32:05.749
year ago and what we're going to have in
a year two years ago you know basically

00:32:05.749 --> 00:32:05.759
a year two years ago you know basically
 

00:32:05.759 --> 00:32:07.820
a year two years ago you know basically
that Ottoman with the geometric print

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:07.830
that Ottoman with the geometric print
 

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:10.580
that Ottoman with the geometric print
really presented well yeah showing me

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:10.590
really presented well yeah showing me
 

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:11.989
really presented well yeah showing me
yeah so that was a nice aw that was

00:32:11.989 --> 00:32:11.999
yeah so that was a nice aw that was
 

00:32:11.999 --> 00:32:14.029
yeah so that was a nice aw that was
again it was a hand model actually so is

00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:14.039
again it was a hand model actually so is
 

00:32:14.039 --> 00:32:16.519
again it was a hand model actually so is
an artist that kind of put together what

00:32:16.519 --> 00:32:16.529
an artist that kind of put together what
 

00:32:16.529 --> 00:32:18.259
an artist that kind of put together what
it looked like based on photos and you

00:32:18.259 --> 00:32:18.269
it looked like based on photos and you
 

00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:20.149
it looked like based on photos and you
know not to discredit the modelers they

00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159
know not to discredit the modelers they
 

00:32:20.159 --> 00:32:21.680
know not to discredit the modelers they
do a great job of making the products

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:21.690
do a great job of making the products
 

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:25.099
do a great job of making the products
look amazing but I I feel like you know

00:32:25.099 --> 00:32:25.109
look amazing but I I feel like you know
 

00:32:25.109 --> 00:32:26.539
look amazing but I I feel like you know
one of the big things we're trying to

00:32:26.539 --> 00:32:26.549
one of the big things we're trying to
 

00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:28.639
one of the big things we're trying to
push is that super accurate this thing

00:32:28.639 --> 00:32:28.649
push is that super accurate this thing
 

00:32:28.649 --> 00:32:30.710
push is that super accurate this thing
is exactly how it fits in your space and

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720
is exactly how it fits in your space and
 

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.840
is exactly how it fits in your space and
I think you lose some of the detail in

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:32.850
I think you lose some of the detail in
 

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:34.669
I think you lose some of the detail in
the precision by doing the hand modeling

00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:34.679
the precision by doing the hand modeling
 

00:32:34.679 --> 00:32:36.409
the precision by doing the hand modeling
approach versus the 3d scanning approach

00:32:36.409 --> 00:32:36.419
approach versus the 3d scanning approach
 

00:32:36.419 --> 00:32:38.749
approach versus the 3d scanning approach
so it's one of those things that we

00:32:38.749 --> 00:32:38.759
so it's one of those things that we
 

00:32:38.759 --> 00:32:40.070
so it's one of those things that we
still don't have a perfect solution for

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080
still don't have a perfect solution for
 

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.200
still don't have a perfect solution for
but I wish if I could go back in time we

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:42.210
but I wish if I could go back in time we
 

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:44.960
but I wish if I could go back in time we
had what we have now or even better to

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:44.970
had what we have now or even better to
 

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:47.359
had what we have now or even better to
use that to build our 3d models from the

00:32:47.359 --> 00:32:47.369
use that to build our 3d models from the
 

00:32:47.369 --> 00:32:49.789
use that to build our 3d models from the
beginning from 3d scan data fair enough

00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:49.799
beginning from 3d scan data fair enough
 

00:32:49.799 --> 00:32:52.759
beginning from 3d scan data fair enough
Tatsuo so you if you work you I'll

00:32:52.759 --> 00:32:52.769
Tatsuo so you if you work you I'll
 

00:32:52.769 --> 00:32:54.859
Tatsuo so you if you work you I'll
probably ask you to just give me a real

00:32:54.859 --> 00:32:54.869
probably ask you to just give me a real
 

00:32:54.869 --> 00:32:59.690
probably ask you to just give me a real
Pikachu the only thing you do is at the

00:32:59.690 --> 00:32:59.700
Pikachu the only thing you do is at the
 

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:04.039
Pikachu the only thing you do is at the
time I guess what we would have done is

00:33:04.039 --> 00:33:04.049
time I guess what we would have done is
 

00:33:04.049 --> 00:33:07.070
time I guess what we would have done is
so we probably would have increased our

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.080
so we probably would have increased our
 

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.580
so we probably would have increased our
server capacity to begin with

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:09.590
server capacity to begin with
 

00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:12.400
server capacity to begin with
all right to to the you know scale where

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:12.410
all right to to the you know scale where
 

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:15.010
all right to to the you know scale where
what we have today that's one thing we

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:15.020
what we have today that's one thing we
 

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:18.070
what we have today that's one thing we
would do but in terms of other things I

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080
would do but in terms of other things I
 

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.830
would do but in terms of other things I
think we we bear we just launched the

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:20.840
think we we bear we just launched the
 

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.320
think we we bear we just launched the
game like just a few months ago we still

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:23.330
game like just a few months ago we still
 

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:25.180
game like just a few months ago we still
planned a lot of things that we haven't

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:25.190
planned a lot of things that we haven't
 

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:29.500
planned a lot of things that we haven't
even done or you know haven't even get

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:29.510
even done or you know haven't even get
 

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:32.110
even done or you know haven't even get
to yet so even I don't think there's a

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:32.120
to yet so even I don't think there's a
 

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.120
to yet so even I don't think there's a
different things I would do differently

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:34.130
different things I would do differently
 

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:37.390
different things I would do differently
except the server potion yeah you're

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:37.400
except the server potion yeah you're
 

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:38.680
except the server potion yeah you're
kind of beginning your adventure now

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:38.690
kind of beginning your adventure now
 

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:42.190
kind of beginning your adventure now
aren't you yeah yeah so last question I

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:42.200
aren't you yeah yeah so last question I
 

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.290
aren't you yeah yeah so last question I
want to kind of take our official hats

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:44.300
want to kind of take our official hats
 

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.600
want to kind of take our official hats
off you know looking at it from the

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:46.610
off you know looking at it from the
 

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:48.660
off you know looking at it from the
point of view of being pioneers in AR

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:48.670
point of view of being pioneers in AR
 

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:53.530
point of view of being pioneers in AR
where do you Tatsuo and Mike think AR is

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:53.540
where do you Tatsuo and Mike think AR is
 

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:55.210
where do you Tatsuo and Mike think AR is
going or where should it go or what are

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:55.220
going or where should it go or what are
 

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:56.980
going or where should it go or what are
the forces that need to change in order

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:56.990
the forces that need to change in order
 

00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:59.950
the forces that need to change in order
to bring about an AR future that you see

00:33:59.950 --> 00:33:59.960
to bring about an AR future that you see
 

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:03.330
to bring about an AR future that you see
is rewarding in like five years or so

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:03.340
is rewarding in like five years or so
 

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:06.010
is rewarding in like five years or so
alright yeah I'll start so this is

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:06.020
alright yeah I'll start so this is
 

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.000
alright yeah I'll start so this is
something I've been thinking about like

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:07.010
something I've been thinking about like
 

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:09.280
something I've been thinking about like
most of my life and Google's been doing

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:09.290
most of my life and Google's been doing
 

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:10.660
most of my life and Google's been doing
a lot of interesting innovation in the

00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:10.670
a lot of interesting innovation in the
 

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:12.310
a lot of interesting innovation in the
space of mapping the world when you

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320
space of mapping the world when you
 

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.300
space of mapping the world when you
would go what's going on with like

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:13.310
would go what's going on with like
 

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:16.000
would go what's going on with like
Google Earth for example I think with AR

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:16.010
Google Earth for example I think with AR
 

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:17.850
Google Earth for example I think with AR
technology we can bring that to

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:17.860
technology we can bring that to
 

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.980
technology we can bring that to
interactive street-level technology

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:20.990
interactive street-level technology
 

00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:22.720
interactive street-level technology
essentially so when we're scanning a

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:22.730
essentially so when we're scanning a
 

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:24.940
essentially so when we're scanning a
space we can present that space in

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:24.950
space we can present that space in
 

00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:27.070
space we can present that space in
what's a virtual reality for example and

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:27.080
what's a virtual reality for example and
 

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:30.160
what's a virtual reality for example and
we can have this interaction in using AR

00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:30.170
we can have this interaction in using AR
 

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:31.720
we can have this interaction in using AR
with people that are in the same space

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:31.730
with people that are in the same space
 

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:33.610
with people that are in the same space
but in VR so they could teleport there

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:33.620
but in VR so they could teleport there
 

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.620
but in VR so they could teleport there
and be there with us we can walk around

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:35.630
and be there with us we can walk around
 

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:37.360
and be there with us we can walk around
the street together and you know look at

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:37.370
the street together and you know look at
 

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:38.980
the street together and you know look at
different things or pull in different

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:38.990
different things or pull in different
 

00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:41.380
different things or pull in different
objects so I think this idea of

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:41.390
objects so I think this idea of
 

00:34:41.390 --> 00:34:44.620
objects so I think this idea of
augmenting the world and creating a data

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:44.630
augmenting the world and creating a data
 

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:47.380
augmenting the world and creating a data
set a rich data set that lives on top of

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:47.390
set a rich data set that lives on top of
 

00:34:47.390 --> 00:34:49.720
set a rich data set that lives on top of
the real space that we're in will enable

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:49.730
the real space that we're in will enable
 

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:52.450
the real space that we're in will enable
us to connect better with people both in

00:34:52.450 --> 00:34:52.460
us to connect better with people both in
 

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:53.740
us to connect better with people both in
the real sense we were both together

00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:53.750
the real sense we were both together
 

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:55.900
the real sense we were both together
looking at a thing or landmark but also

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:55.910
looking at a thing or landmark but also
 

00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:57.160
looking at a thing or landmark but also
with a third person that could be

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:57.170
with a third person that could be
 

00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:59.050
with a third person that could be
somewhere else in be are experiencing

00:34:59.050 --> 00:34:59.060
somewhere else in be are experiencing
 

00:34:59.060 --> 00:34:59.560
somewhere else in be are experiencing
with us

00:34:59.560 --> 00:34:59.570
with us
 

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.380
with us
so I'm excited for you know that type of

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:02.390
so I'm excited for you know that type of
 

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:04.600
so I'm excited for you know that type of
technology that's coming from the

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:04.610
technology that's coming from the
 

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:06.580
technology that's coming from the
culmination of 3d scanning automatic

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:06.590
culmination of 3d scanning automatic
 

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:08.440
culmination of 3d scanning automatic
reality and virtual reality and you know

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:08.450
reality and virtual reality and you know
 

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:10.360
reality and virtual reality and you know
big data to be able to serve all of this

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:10.370
big data to be able to serve all of this
 

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:12.100
big data to be able to serve all of this
data so that we can actually get to that

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:12.110
data so that we can actually get to that
 

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:14.210
data so that we can actually get to that
point that sounds awesome

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:14.220
point that sounds awesome
 

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:18.140
point that sounds awesome
so yeah I think like the technology is

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:18.150
so yeah I think like the technology is
 

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.390
so yeah I think like the technology is
just emerging right now the tango is

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400
just emerging right now the tango is
 

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.760
just emerging right now the tango is
coming out in next year's I guess we'll

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:22.770
coming out in next year's I guess we'll
 

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:24.680
coming out in next year's I guess we'll
there will be new devices coming out but

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:24.690
there will be new devices coming out but
 

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:28.040
there will be new devices coming out but
even going a lot further eventually or

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:28.050
even going a lot further eventually or
 

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:30.380
even going a lot further eventually or
and hopefully I think you know the

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:30.390
and hopefully I think you know the
 

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:32.180
and hopefully I think you know the
device will become so small that you

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:32.190
device will become so small that you
 

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:34.700
device will become so small that you
don't know you for someone is wearing it

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:34.710
don't know you for someone is wearing it
 

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:36.980
don't know you for someone is wearing it
and you'll be able to basically you

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:36.990
and you'll be able to basically you
 

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:39.230
and you'll be able to basically you
won't be able to know whether this

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240
won't be able to know whether this
 

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:42.500
won't be able to know whether this
Pikachu is real or that it Q you know

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:42.510
Pikachu is real or that it Q you know
 

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:46.310
Pikachu is real or that it Q you know
missing with you so and I guess everyone

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320
missing with you so and I guess everyone
 

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.980
missing with you so and I guess everyone
like around my age or there are a lot of

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:48.990
like around my age or there are a lot of
 

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:51.010
like around my age or there are a lot of
game developers here today I think

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:51.020
game developers here today I think
 

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:53.570
game developers here today I think
imagined or had you know have this

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:53.580
imagined or had you know have this
 

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:57.920
imagined or had you know have this
fantasy that become hero or you know do

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:57.930
fantasy that become hero or you know do
 

00:35:57.930 --> 00:35:59.750
fantasy that become hero or you know do
things that you won't be able to do in

00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760
things that you won't be able to do in
 

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.780
things that you won't be able to do in
real life but with the AR technology you

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:02.790
real life but with the AR technology you
 

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:05.390
real life but with the AR technology you
can become something right that you are

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:05.400
can become something right that you are
 

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.400
can become something right that you are
it could be a pokemon trainer it could

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:07.410
it could be a pokemon trainer it could
 

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:09.830
it could be a pokemon trainer it could
be I'm not a big fan of a fast

00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:09.840
be I'm not a big fan of a fast
 

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.440
be I'm not a big fan of a fast
first-person shooter but if you want it

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:12.450
first-person shooter but if you want it
 

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:15.349
first-person shooter but if you want it
you can do that kind of gameplay as well

00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359
you can do that kind of gameplay as well
 

00:36:15.359 --> 00:36:17.500
you can do that kind of gameplay as well
so I think there are a lot of

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:17.510
so I think there are a lot of
 

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:19.700
so I think there are a lot of
interesting thing we can do in terms of

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:19.710
interesting thing we can do in terms of
 

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:23.050
interesting thing we can do in terms of
an entertainment gaming but besides that

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:23.060
an entertainment gaming but besides that
 

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:27.410
an entertainment gaming but besides that
like what I'd like to wear my official

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:27.420
like what I'd like to wear my official
 

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:29.540
like what I'd like to wear my official
hat a little bit but so like what

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:29.550
hat a little bit but so like what
 

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:32.470
hat a little bit but so like what
Niantic trying to do is really to how we

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480
Niantic trying to do is really to how we
 

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.430
Niantic trying to do is really to how we
thinking about how we can improve

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:34.440
thinking about how we can improve
 

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:39.020
thinking about how we can improve
people's you know life so not only doing

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:39.030
people's you know life so not only doing
 

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:42.680
people's you know life so not only doing
these tricks but like using the AR how

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:42.690
these tricks but like using the AR how
 

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:45.440
these tricks but like using the AR how
we can actually augment people's you

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:45.450
we can actually augment people's you
 

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:47.960
we can actually augment people's you
know life's realities if you will so

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:47.970
know life's realities if you will so
 

00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:51.290
know life's realities if you will so
that's the area I think that that part

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:51.300
that's the area I think that that part
 

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:54.079
that's the area I think that that part
will evolve a lot as well like you can

00:36:54.079 --> 00:36:54.089
will evolve a lot as well like you can
 

00:36:54.089 --> 00:36:59.210
will evolve a lot as well like you can
now like if you can have I have have

00:36:59.210 --> 00:36:59.220
now like if you can have I have have
 

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:01.940
now like if you can have I have have
this AR thing like what we do more

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:01.950
this AR thing like what we do more
 

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:04.220
this AR thing like what we do more
advanced version of what we do today the

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:04.230
advanced version of what we do today the
 

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:06.470
advanced version of what we do today the
local the real world is actually very

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480
local the real world is actually very
 

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.510
local the real world is actually very
interesting in your neighborhood what we

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:08.520
interesting in your neighborhood what we
 

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.240
interesting in your neighborhood what we
try to do - for you to discover these

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:11.250
try to do - for you to discover these
 

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:13.910
try to do - for you to discover these
things little things like landmark in

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920
things little things like landmark in
 

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.589
things little things like landmark in
your neighborhood you never never

00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599
your neighborhood you never never
 

00:37:15.599 --> 00:37:19.190
your neighborhood you never never
visited or like a restaurant in a corner

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200
visited or like a restaurant in a corner
 

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.290
visited or like a restaurant in a corner
that nobody knows like with a our

00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:21.300
that nobody knows like with a our
 

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.210
that nobody knows like with a our
technology you can guide people to those

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:23.220
technology you can guide people to those
 

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:24.410
technology you can guide people to those
places so

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:24.420
places so
 

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:27.100
places so
they can that will actually enhance the

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:27.110
they can that will actually enhance the
 

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:29.360
they can that will actually enhance the
augmented reality I think that's where

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:29.370
augmented reality I think that's where
 

00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:32.480
augmented reality I think that's where
the AR technology should be or will be

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:32.490
the AR technology should be or will be
 

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:34.850
the AR technology should be or will be
going to that's a beautiful vision I

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:34.860
going to that's a beautiful vision I
 

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:38.480
going to that's a beautiful vision I
think that's part of what everyone in

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:38.490
think that's part of what everyone in
 

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:41.000
think that's part of what everyone in
the EO AOR has this opportunity to do is

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:41.010
the EO AOR has this opportunity to do is
 

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:42.560
the EO AOR has this opportunity to do is
to bring people together in the real

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:42.570
to bring people together in the real
 

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:45.290
to bring people together in the real
world I think that's probably the best

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:45.300
world I think that's probably the best
 

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:47.330
world I think that's probably the best
