00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:25.400
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.950
Let's start off a quick
list of important concepts

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.000
for the week.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:01:02.860
Just-- and I'm going to
push you right along today.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.097
I want to get this done.

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:04.805
What do you got?

00:01:04.805 --> 00:01:06.570
AUDIENCE: Static
Equilibrium positions?

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.760
PROFESSOR: Static
equilibrium, OK.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:18.280
So EOMs from xstatic.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.570
OK, good.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.190
Another concept for the week?

00:01:40.394 --> 00:01:41.870
AUDIENCE: Damping.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.300
PROFESSOR: Damping, yeah.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.440
And what have we've been
talking about all week?

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.366
AUDIENCE: Vibration.

00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:49.690
PROFESSOR: Vibration.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:50.560
OK.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:59.415
So vibration, damping, OK.

00:01:59.415 --> 00:01:59.915
More?

00:02:04.114 --> 00:02:06.655
What's the whole general subject
that we've encased vibration

00:02:06.655 --> 00:02:07.110
in?

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.318
It's an introduction to what?

00:02:11.274 --> 00:02:11.940
Have to make it.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.440
We've been making an assumption
that we haven't made before.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.952
Yeah, linear.

00:02:21.952 --> 00:02:23.410
We've been studying--
this has been

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:33.995
an intro to-- linear systems.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.230
We can only do things
like transfer functions,

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.860
that sort of thing,
by assuming linearity.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.180
Anything else?

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.550
What have I just spent the last
two lectures deriving for you

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.380
and showing you?

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.335
Transfer functions.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.900
In fact, I've shown you three.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.440
All right?

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.640
All right.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.600
That's beginning to get at
what we've been talking about.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.710
So introduction
to linear systems.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.210
We've been studying vibration
as one implementation

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.330
or application of
linear systems.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.180
We've been looking at single
degree of freedom vibration

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.820
problems only so far.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.910
And we've found frequency
response functions.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.160
These frequency response
function tell you

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.800
the response of the system
to what kind of an input?

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.935
What are the
characteristics of the input

00:03:43.935 --> 00:03:46.807
that we've been looking at?

00:03:46.807 --> 00:03:47.890
What do we call harmonics?

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.530
Single frequency cosine
omega t-like input.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.510
Cosine omega t, sine
omega t, e the i omega t.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.410
One frequency, repetitive,
it's called a harmonic input.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.020
So for a linear system--
we've also we're

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.032
talking about what we call
the steady state response.

00:04:08.032 --> 00:04:08.740
What's that mean?

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.742
OK.

00:04:13.742 --> 00:04:14.575
Put that into words.

00:04:14.575 --> 00:04:15.535
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:21.475 --> 00:04:23.270
PROFESSOR: So you
turn the motor on,

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.600
the whole building
shakes, settles down,

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.010
and just has a steady
vibration you're dealing with.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.460
So after any startup
transients have died out,

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.880
it's the steady state response.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:42.960
If you have a linear system
and you're putting in some F0

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:50.820
e to the i omega t force, a real
part of steady state response,

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.842
what is the frequency
of the response?

00:04:54.842 --> 00:04:58.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.130
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.050
So for linear systems,
the steady state response,

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:10.930
the frequency of
the output always

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.710
it's a property of
a linear system.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.450
So a couple really important
things to remember here.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.510
Good.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:23.970
Now we're going to move
onto a problem-- Oh.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.390
And then one other thing
I usually do-- ask of you,

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.010
is are there any
major questions?

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.520
Something left
over from lecture.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.061
Something we've done
in the last week

00:05:31.061 --> 00:05:32.520
that just isn't going down.

00:05:35.845 --> 00:05:40.506
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
gravity [INAUDIBLE]?

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:41.880
PROFESSOR: How do
you get gravity

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.080
to go away in the equation?

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.680
Actually, this is the
most common question

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.888
that's been asked to the
TA's this week, of Professor

00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:48.490
Gossard, of me.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.090
So there still seems to be a
little bit of misunderstanding

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.600
about-- and this is the
subject of static equilibrium,

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.937
verses unstretched
spring kind of positions.

00:06:00.937 --> 00:06:02.770
I think I'll just deal
with that right away.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.670
You're familiar
with this problem?

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.550
K, C, M. And most of you are
comfortable with the notion

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.570
of measuring x from
the unstretched spring

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:19.620
position, right?

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.310
So that's what I've
done right here.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.874
Now you add gravity though,
and let it find its equilibrium

00:06:25.874 --> 00:06:27.290
position under
gravity, it's going

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.550
to be at some other location.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.510
And I'm just going
to call that xstatic.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.840
Static displacement.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.650
Now when you turn on
the harmonic excitation,

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.690
or even grab it and let it
go from initial condition,

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.410
where will it vibrate around?

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.135
It's going to vibrate around
the static equilibrium position.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.230
Here's my system.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.130
Here's my free body diagram.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.100
Got all the gravities and Cx's
and Kx's and x dots and so

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.410
forth in it complete, right?

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.229
I can write an
equation of motion

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:11.270
for that system, which
you've done lots of times.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.756
And it has a gravity in it.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:21.280
But now I'm going to say
look, here's my x-coordinate,

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.410
it stretches down xstatic.

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:28.240
And on top of that I'm going
to add a little dynamic motion.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.270
And I'm going to describe that
as x equals xstatic a constant,

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.515
plus the dynamic movement
with respect to xstatic.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.270
Take the time derivative of
it, because this is constant.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.890
It goes away.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:44.940
And two time derivative.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.390
So x dot is x dot
d, and x double dot

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:51.550
is x double dot, the
dynamic quantity.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:55.580
Take these three and
plug them into here.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.960
Mxd double dot, Cxd dot.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.690
But the K term, you
still have xstatic in it.

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:11.690
The original Kx breaks
into two pieces.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:16.720
And on the right hand side is
my Mg plus f of t, like before.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:22.700
But K xstatic must
be equal to Mg

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.585
in order for static
equilibrium to have existed.

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:30.460
Everybody agree with that?

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.620
Another way say that is let's
say there's no dynamic motion.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.720
This term goes away.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.970
This term goes away.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:37.390
This term goes away.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:38.690
Turn off the excitation.

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:41.159
You're left with
that equals this.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:43.760
And that's what says it sits
in the static equilibrium

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.320
position.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.220
If those two are equal, they
cancel, leaving you with this.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.520
So if you had understood
this in the beginning,

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:04.830
you could have said let's
make our inertial coordinate

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.060
from the static
equilibrium position.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:14.240
Just let the thing find its
static equilibrium position,

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.660
set the inertia coordinate
measured from there,

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:23.190
and you would get
to this equation,

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:27.270
with the possible
confusion of having to deal

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.440
with the free body diagram.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.120
Because the free
body diagram still

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.180
has on it Mg and the
spring force that

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.430
comes from the static position.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:41.440
So if I were doing
this, and just

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.030
say I want to go directly
to this equation,

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.330
I would draw the free
body diagram that

00:09:47.330 --> 00:10:04.610
would have Kxd Cxd dot, F MG,
but then I would also just

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:07.150
put in here-- there's
one more force.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:11.900
K times xstatic or delta or
whatever you want to call it.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.090
You know there's
some xstatic, and you

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:16.174
know-- because you're
doing this-- you

00:10:16.174 --> 00:10:17.340
know this about the problem.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.645
You know this cancels
that, and it won't appear

00:10:19.645 --> 00:10:20.728
in the equation of motion.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.050
So to be able to do--
anytime you're confronted

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:30.920
with a problem that has
gravity, which causes

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:36.960
a static deflection, or
results in a static equilibrium

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.560
position, it might be 0 in
your coordinate-like pendulum.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.470
You look at it, and you say,
now in the equation of motion

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.080
that you derived from the
unstretched spring force

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.670
position is the
Mg term a function

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:54.250
of the motion coordinate?

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.880
And in this case it is not.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.470
So it doesn't matter
what x becomes,

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.030
this force stays constant.

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:04.720
It doesn't enter into the
dynamics of the problem.

00:11:08.704 --> 00:11:10.370
If you ever write an
equation of motion,

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:13.240
and you come to an Mg term that
doesn't have a theta or an x

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.180
or any variable in it, you
know that there's another way

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.170
to write that equation
about static equilibrium,

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.660
and you'll be able
to get rid of it,

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.450
and simplify the math basically.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:31.710
OK, now we want to move on
to the problem of the day.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.430
And the problem of the
day, I've written up here.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.370
That's the last class's list.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.540
We've got a motor,
fan or something.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.480
It's got a rotating imbalance.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.625
It's got a flexible base.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.020
It's got a lot of
vertical vibration.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.830
Driving you crazy.

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.350
The rotation rate--
this is a pump

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:08.540
or something with a rotating--
some rotating mass inside.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.350
Has some eccentricity.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:13.120
So it's causing
some external force.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.690
Causing a force that results
in vertical vibration.

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:23.320
The rotation rate of
that fan is 1750 RPM.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.910
The weight of this motor sitting
on this frame is 500 pounds.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.970
When you set this motor and
bolt it down on that frame,

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:41.060
the frame deflects 0.026 inches.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:43.230
And this thing's
vibrating like crazy.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.700
Your assistant
comes in and says,

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.090
I got a solution for this.

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:54.690
We're going to put
braces in here,

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.360
and those braces will
double the K. The spring

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.900
constant of the thing.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:04.160
And he or she asserts
that he thinks

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.200
it will cut the amplitude
of response in half.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.240
Cut the vibration
amplitude in half.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.080
So you're going to do
the calculation today

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.260
to see whether or not
this is a good idea.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:17.440
And we're going to begin.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:25.780
So assignment 1 is come up with
a simple lump parameter model--

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:29.430
masses, springs, dash,
pots-- of this system

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:32.604
so that you can model it.

00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:35.020
So we've only been doing single
degree of freedom systems,

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.280
it's probably going to
look something like that.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.320
So come up with a lump
parameter model of that,

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.880
and we've got what?

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.910
4, 8, 12.

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:47.930
We could do four groups easily
here of four or five each.

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:50.040
So break into four groups.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.430
Come up first with
the-- and group 1--

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.600
we'll put group 1 right here.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.317
And group 2 here,
and 3 and 4 there.

00:13:58.317 --> 00:14:00.650
So come when you get-- when
your group figures this out.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:02.810
And we got to move right
along because there's

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:04.579
several parts to this.

00:14:04.579 --> 00:14:06.370
Just come up, sketch
your model that you're

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:09.630
going to do it with,
and then part 2 right

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:13.110
after that is to compute
the natural frequency

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:14.871
of the system.

00:14:14.871 --> 00:14:17.120
We're going to eventually
have to compute the transfer

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.370
functions and then
try out the fix.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:23.320
And see if the fix makes
things better or worse.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.560
First assignment, come up
with a lump parameter model

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.925
and find the natural frequency.

00:14:28.925 --> 00:14:30.300
Form your groups
and get talking.

00:14:38.976 --> 00:14:41.390
AUDIENCE: Who's is this?

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:42.790
OK, guys, what about the force?

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.660
And what is it?

00:14:53.602 --> 00:15:02.760
PROFESSOR: And it's really some
me omega squared cos omega t.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.600
And this comes from the
equivalent little mass

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.600
on some arm, e going
around and around inside.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:13.510
This is the equivalent
unbalanced mass here.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:14.630
So keep coming up.

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:15.630
Put your models up here.

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:16.130
Yeah?

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:18.462
AUDIENCE: You get the
[? mpd ?] [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:18.462 --> 00:15:20.010
PROFESSOR: Well, let's go back.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:21.690
We've done this problem
about four times

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:22.856
over the course of homework.

00:15:22.856 --> 00:15:26.730
And the term block with an
arm with a mass on the end.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:30.940
The e is the length of the
arm, and the mass on the end

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:34.170
is essentially the
location of the center

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:36.330
of mass of the rotating part.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.765
So the other three groups need
to draw a model up and come up

00:15:44.765 --> 00:15:45.890
with the natural frequency.

00:15:51.649 --> 00:15:53.190
One of the annoyances
of this problem

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:54.955
is it has nasty English units.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:03.145
You all remember what
g is in English units?

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.150
I want radians per second.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:23.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.939
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but why do--
convert English inches to feet

00:16:28.939 --> 00:16:29.605
and you're done.

00:16:29.605 --> 00:16:33.420
Because you know g in
feet per second squared.

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.805
So rather than do three
conversions, do one.

00:16:35.805 --> 00:16:38.595
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:38.595 --> 00:16:42.100
PROFESSOR: Well that's
one, and then you know g.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.380
So you can do it that way.

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:43.920
Sure.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.461
I don't care.

00:16:44.461 --> 00:16:58.730
I just want the result.

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:00.940
Which is group 1?

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:01.910
You guys are 1?

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:03.650
You got a number
you can give me?

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:07.859
How many MIT
students does it take

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:09.774
to convert from inches to feet?

00:17:09.774 --> 00:17:11.482
AUDIENCE: We got that,
but we're not sure

00:17:11.482 --> 00:17:14.779
if it's giving hertz
or radians afterwards.

00:17:14.779 --> 00:17:16.888
PROFESSOR: Well,
in this equation,

00:17:16.888 --> 00:17:18.304
does it give you
Hertz or radians?

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:25.640
Sure.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.500
And you just made this
substitution in here.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.425
So it hasn't done anything
to change to Hertz.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.220
Write that down.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.660
What a struggle!

00:17:58.940 --> 00:17:59.440
OK.

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:03.430
Good.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.930
That's good.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:05.330
You can leave it.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:05.830
All right.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:08.310
We've all converged
to about 121.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:09.730
That was quite a struggle.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.560
Was it the units, or was
it-- partly was Hertz?

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.920
And you guys haven't had--
you're dealing with nothing

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.380
but equations for weeks.

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.180
And to actually have to do
real engineering numbers

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.900
has thrown you a little bit.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.600
But so it's about 121.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.600
And that g over delta
thing is really handy.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:34.560
Now I want to know
what is the response

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:39.480
of this system to
this input given

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.516
the frequency of the
input is 1750 RPM?

00:18:43.516 --> 00:18:49.830
And RPM, N is often
written, how is

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:53.380
it related to frequency in
Hertz or cycles per second?

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.010
Anybody know?

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.830
This is revolutions per minute.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:01.050
What would be
revolution per second?

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:03.600
Is that same thing as Hertz?

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.680
So revolution is
something going around.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.050
One full time around is 2 pi.

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:11.090
It's one cycle.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:13.510
So if you do 60
cycles in a minute,

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:15.450
how many do you do in a second?

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:16.240
One.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:25.000
So this RPM divided by 60
equals f in cycles per second.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:25.630
Or Hertz.

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:33.595
RPM divided by 60 gives
you revolutions per second.

00:19:33.595 --> 00:19:35.375
AUDIENCE: That says RPS.

00:19:35.375 --> 00:19:37.250
PROFESSOR: Well, excuse me.

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:42.520
I was talking about--
get rid of that.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:43.760
That's the relation you want.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.665
And what's the relationship
between omega and f?

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:55.370
For every cycle, you
get 2 pi radians.

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:59.950
So now compute-- I want you to
give me an estimate-- find--

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:03.240
post my problem here.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.780
So part 1 you've done.

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:11.200
Part 2 here and to get an
estimate of the magnitude

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.650
of this steady state response.

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:21.090
And we've been talking
about transfer functions.

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:24.010
So it's probably a replica
applying a transfer function

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:24.510
here.

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:29.030
I would put your
symbolic answer up

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.450
first would be a terrific idea.

00:20:32.587 --> 00:20:34.420
Think you all-- when
you think you have kind

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.700
of a symbolic approach to this.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.379
Go write it up, and that
way I can know where

00:20:39.379 --> 00:20:40.670
you need a little help, if any.

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:03.170
That's OK.

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:21.760
So you don't know K.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:26.390
So just leave that has
an undetermined quantity.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:30.789
F0-- what is-- you guys
keep working for a second.

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:31.830
Then we'll talk about it.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:34.165
You don't know K, so just
leave it as an unknown.

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:38.310
Don't do that.

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:41.117
Just call it F0.

00:21:41.117 --> 00:21:43.200
But now plug in some numbers
for what you do know.

00:21:52.931 --> 00:21:54.430
So one quantity
you're going to need

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:57.920
to make over omega n, so write
that one down when you get it.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:03.510
What's omega over omega n,
and then move on from there.

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:10.900
Now there's a
little pitfall here

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.540
that you're all running into.

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:16.001
And that is you're taking
the positive square root as

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:16.500
written.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.000
It's that whole
quantity down there.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.505
Squared square root,
and you're writing

00:22:20.505 --> 00:22:22.197
it 1 minus omega squared.

00:22:22.197 --> 00:22:24.280
And this thing's going to
turn out negative on you

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:24.990
if you're not careful.

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:26.114
But you can flip it around.

00:22:26.114 --> 00:22:28.590
It's really the absolute
value of that quantity,

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:32.290
because it a-- quantity squared
square root, so it can be

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:32.990
plus or minus.

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:49.540
So you got 1.54-- 1.5 what?

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:50.840
1.5 is your ratio?

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:51.600
OK, write it down.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.550
Just write the ratio.

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:53.424
That's what you need.

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:08.080
1.5.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.080
And you've got--
this is 4/5 here?

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.480
That's what you guys
have worked out?

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:21.498
OK, so 0.8.

00:23:21.498 --> 00:23:23.913
AUDIENCE: How did they get 1.5?

00:23:23.913 --> 00:23:26.350
PROFESSOR: They calculated
omega over omega n.

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:31.842
You have 183 divided by--
what was your omega n?

00:23:31.842 --> 00:23:33.260
AUDIENCE: Oh, 60.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:33.760
OK.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.509
PROFESSOR: Not 60.

00:23:34.509 --> 00:23:35.830
AUDIENCE: Well, no.

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:39.234
I mean it's like 360 over 260.

00:23:39.234 --> 00:23:39.900
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:43.160
Well, you've got to divide
1750 by 60 to get F.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.170
And then you got to
multiply by 2 pi.

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:48.768
I'm doing it for the benefit
of everybody in the room here.

00:23:51.576 --> 00:23:54.050
0.8 F0 over K, all right.

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:56.370
Now we're getting somewhere.

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:57.520
0.8.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:58.280
0.8.

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.460
What do you guys have here?

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:01.370
You got 1 over 1.3.

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:04.070
How does that work out?

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:05.980
So about 0.8.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.240
OK, so you've come
to the conclusion

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.820
that the magnitude of that study
state response is about 0.8 F0

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.270
over K.

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:18.080
And we call that F0
over K-- in lecture,

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.010
I call it the static response.

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:23.060
The book calls it
the static response.

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:26.730
Is it the same static response
as we're talking about here?

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:30.220
Don't confuse the two.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.790
This was the effect of
gravity on the system.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:34.750
The static response
we're talking about here

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:37.550
is if the frequency
of this excitation

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:41.150
went to 0, then
the response-- this

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:44.650
would stretch that spring
by the amount we're calling

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:48.390
xstatic, F0 over K. All right.

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:50.660
So now you know that you're
operating at a frequency.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.410
What's the frequency
ratio that you found?

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:55.310
Omega over omega n.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:58.160
That was an
intermediate step here.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.680
All right, 1.5.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.780
All right, now you're going
to-- the proposed fixed

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:07.360
is to double the stiffness.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.350
Double the stiffness.

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:17.130
Now we want to
compute this result

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:18.786
if you double the stiffness.

00:25:18.786 --> 00:25:20.160
And the person
who proposed that,

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.180
thinks it's going to
half the response.

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.270
That's the proposal.

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:25.070
So double the stiffness.

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:26.900
And in order to
get finished here,

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:31.745
what effect does changing the
stiffness have on this system?

00:25:31.745 --> 00:25:33.565
AUDIENCE: Decreases
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:33.565 --> 00:25:36.330
PROFESSOR: Well, you jump into
an answer-- intermediate step

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:36.830
here.

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:40.324
What does it do to
the natural frequency?

00:25:40.324 --> 00:25:41.740
There's a natural
frequency change

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:44.030
if you change the stiffness.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:52.370
OK, so the natural frequency is
normally some kind of K over m.

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:54.195
Now we also know
it's g over delta.

00:25:57.134 --> 00:25:58.800
But we're going to
double the stiffness,

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.716
so what does that do to
the natural frequency?

00:26:00.716 --> 00:26:02.200
Does the m change?

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:06.610
OK, so what's the--
this is omega n before.

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:17.600
Omega n after equals right.

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.100
OK.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.300
And what does that do
to your frequency ratio?

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:29.930
So the effect of
changing the stiffness

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:32.910
changes the natural
frequency, and that

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:35.734
changes the ratio of
the input frequency

00:26:35.734 --> 00:26:37.150
to the natural
frequency, and that

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:39.450
will change this
calculation here, right?

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:41.400
So come up with a
new value for this.

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:51.540
Anybody got a number?

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.126
What's the frequency
ratio after?

00:26:54.126 --> 00:26:57.542
AUDIENCE: Uh, 1.1-- never mind.

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:01.934
I was doing the squared term.

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:07.770
PROFESSOR: I wanted to
know the frequency ratio.

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:10.690
This is after is
equal to the frequency

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:14.060
ratio that was something
to do with root 2 here.

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:16.090
The natural frequency is
going to go up or down

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:19.214
by a factor of root 2.

00:27:19.214 --> 00:27:21.700
If you double K, the
natural frequency

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:24.360
will go up by a
square root of 2.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.960
So the frequency ratio
after-- the natural frequency

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.360
goes up by the square root of 2.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.500
That's the same as
root 2 over 2 here.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.600
So the whole thing drops down.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.600
So 1.5 times square
root of 2 over 2.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.040
What is it?

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:40.760
All right.

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.310
1.07.

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:45.685
Now what is-- figure
out this quantity.

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.820
Pardon?

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.350
3.4.

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:55.521
And did you put in a 2 here?

00:27:55.521 --> 00:27:56.020
Right.

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:05.690
So this is the correct
expression to be using.

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:09.280
But now in this new
problem-- this was before.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:16.270
In this problem afterwards, x
is steady state is F0 over 2K

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:22.360
if double the stiffness,
all over this quantity omega

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:28.490
squared over omega
n squared minus 1,

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:30.480
but with the new
frequency ratio.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.890
This is now 1.07.

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:35.940
You do this number,
what do you get?

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:39.080
3.-- what did that say?

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.640
3.4 roughly,

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:47.290
F0 over K. So you have
apples and apple together.

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:51.070
You want to compare the F0
over K before and after.

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:52.440
End it was a factor of 3.4.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.845
So should you make the change?

00:28:54.845 --> 00:28:55.345
No.

00:28:55.345 --> 00:28:56.315
That's a bad idea.

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:00.400
You ran into a
situation like this

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.483
before, going to all that
trouble of cutting steel

00:29:02.483 --> 00:29:04.150
and getting out the torch.

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:06.260
The welding system.

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:09.990
Take yourself a great big
weight and walk up, and thump

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:11.430
some weight on
top of this thing,

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:13.197
and see if it gets
better or worse.

00:29:13.197 --> 00:29:15.780
Because if I double the mass of
the system, what would happen?

00:29:18.522 --> 00:29:21.580
It's going to go
the other direction.

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:24.670
This will go up by
a factor of root 2.

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:29.280
And then this denominator--
you're pushing it further out.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:32.622
And instead of being at
0.8, you'll be down further.
