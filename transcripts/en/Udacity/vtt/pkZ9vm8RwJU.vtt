00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It turns out what you need is a good timekeeping device or a chronometer and if it's not clear why,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
why don't we go to Leiden in the Netherlands and talk to Tjeerd Bucker.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You need a timekeeping device to find longitude because they the world turns on it's axis

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
in 24 hours, and we've probably seen the sun at its highest point at 12 o'clock.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
When you're, for instance at the ocean, and you look at the sun and you see it reached its highest point,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
you can say it's 12 o'clock and you look at the clock which you take with you

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
it shows the time of your home harbor.

00:00:37.000 --> 99:59:59.000
For each hour in difference there is a 15Â° difference in longitude.
