00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.180
If you have a stomach ache that’s no fun,
but it’s just your stomach that hurts.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.470
If you stub your toe, that sucks but at least
it’s just your toe!

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.840
But, if your head hurts it is all-consuming.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.450
You just want to crawl under a blanket and
stay there forever.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.750
Why is that?

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.700
What is it about head pain?

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.589
If you feel that way, you’re not alone;
research shows that a similar stimulus will

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:24.429
cause a stronger pain response in the head
than the rest of the body.

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:26.699
Scientists are finally starting to understand
why.

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.599
It’s not just about pain, it’s about emotions.

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.720
Ok, it’s partly emotions.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.940
It actually comes down to how the brain is
wired.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.730
Research has shown that sensory neurons that
connect to the head and face are routed directly

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.640
to the brain’s main emotional centre.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.410
Sensory neurons in the rest of the body are
also connected to this same brain region,

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.600
but their connection is indirect.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.690
This means that feelings of pain are tied
to emotions and emotional distress.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.960
This is regardless of where the pain is coming
from and whether sensory neurons in the head

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.670
are more sensitive to pain than those in the
body.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.160
The finding is supported by fMRI data that
compares head pain to body pain.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.540
They found more activity in the emotional
brain centre — the amygdala — for head

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.540
pain.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.700
The same thing was found with mice.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.970
The researchers found more activity occured
when pain stimulus was applied to the face,

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.799
rather than the paw.

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.000
Especially in a region linked to the brain's
instinctive and emotional centers.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.520
Again, this a result in-line with brain wiring,
consistent with face neurons having a more

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.600
direct link to emotional centers than body
neurons.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.310
Further study showed that activating the brain
pathways linked to emotions could prompt pain.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.469
And it spirals from there.

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:36.420
An external emotional trigger can cause a
headache, which can evoke a stress response

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.740
that makes the headache worse.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.009
Meanwhile, during these headache episodes,
the brain is abnormally sensitive to triggers

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.439
like light and sound.

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.479
The good news from this brain-pain connection
is that silencing those same pathways that

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.520
can cause pain, reduce the physical symptoms.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.211
This has some pretty interesting implications
for treating physical ailments, especially

00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:58.460
things like frequent migraines and any kind
of chronic neuropathic face pain.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.341
Because if there’s an emotional element
for head and face pain then dealing with the

00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:04.990
emotional element might actually lessen the
pain.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.220
Treatment could go beyond pain management
and seek to restore the chemical balance in

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.340
the brain to silence the pain pathway.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.300
Emotional pain can have some lasting effects,
for example -- men never really get over their

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.300
breakups.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.170
Trace and I eat ice cream and talk about it
here.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.130
Of course, if you’re lactose intolerant,
some research says that taking pain-relievers

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.530
for a headache during a breakup can actually
lessen the emotional pain!

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.250
Thanks for watching.
