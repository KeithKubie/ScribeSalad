00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.290
Do you ever wake up in the middle of the night
and wonder if you don’t have a similarly

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.790
sleepless friend that might be up for a game
of Boggle?

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.910
I know I do.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.610
Hey guys, a sort of tired Amy here with you
on DNews today.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.119
If you’ve ever woken up in the middle of
the night and been unable to fall back asleep

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.230
because your mind is racing with all the things
you’ve got on your to do list you’re certainly

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.349
not alone.

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.989
The middle of the night sleepless panic cycle
is one some of us know all too well, but why

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:31.269
do we wake up in the first place and suddenly
go into panic mode?

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.160
Panic attacks aren’t simply moments of anxiety,
thinking about that deadline that’s coming

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.070
up a little faster than you’d like.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.890
Feeling shaky, short of breath, or dizzy can
be a sign that you’re having a panic attack.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.300
But there are also physiological effects to
panic attacks, including an increased heart

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.670
rate and vascular reactions that can lead
to a tingly sensation.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.400
Panic attacks can come on completely without
warning.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.900
You can be watching TV and be hit with an
array of symptoms including increased heart

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.610
rate, shortness of breath, and an acute fear
of dying completely without warning.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.350
Our subconscious mind is a big part of the
problem.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.100
After experiencing something traumatic that
led you to panic, your subconscious mind can

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.090
mimic that pattern and send you into panic
mode once you’re removed from the situation.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.281
And because panic attacks can be brought on
at the subconscious level, you don’t have

00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:12.130
to be awake to experience one.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.010
Panic attacks can hit when you’re asleep,
sometimes sparked by dreams or nightmares

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.979
that call back to the same subconscious patterns
that bring panic attacks on for no reason

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.200
while you’re watching TV.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.719
The psychological and physiological reactions
-- rapid heart rate, shortness of breath,

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:28.450
dizziness, and sweating -- can combine to
wake you up and persist for minutes.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.420
This can start a cycle of insomnia: you worry
about what will happen if you lose sleep,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.360
but can’t sleep, so you worry more.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.729
Being isolated in a dark, quiet room (i.e.
your bedroom at night) doesn’t help alleviate

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.840
the sudden stress of waking up in a panic.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.350
Dealing with panic attacks isn’t easy, but
there are some tips and tricks to breaking

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.270
the midnight insomnia cycle.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.770
Experts say that getting out of bed, out of
your bedroom, and doing something to dispel

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.549
negative thoughts until you’re really tired
enough to fall asleep is best.

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.499
Do you guys have any tricks for dealing with
those late night bouts of sleeplessness?
