The last quiz then, brought up the subject of what values x can take on in this

00:00:04.372 --> 00:00:08.654
situation in order for it to make sense. So think about what constraints an

00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:13.090
architect would logically place on this variable x in this situation. And then

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.080
write out the possible values that we could plug in for x here using an

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.040
inequality notation in this box.
