00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:10.280
One man recorded over 5,000 movie trailers,
750,000 TV ads, and has a voice recognized

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.269
by millions. That man was..."me."

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.670
What The FAK. The Facts and Knowledge on Voice
Actors.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.710
Don La Fontaine was a legendary voice actor
whose nicknames included "Thunder Throat"

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.340
and "The Voice Of God." So many of his movie
trailers used the phrase "In A World" that

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.989
it has since become a cliche.

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.980
"80's are back, it's "Code Monkeys," coming
this spring.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.780
But another man's "In A World" is equally
famous, and that's Hal Douglas'. Douglas actually

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.469
won the Don La Fontaine Legacy Award in 2011
for his extensive voiceover work.

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.670
"In a world where laughter was king..."

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.319
Arguably the most influential person in all
of voice-acting was Mel Blanc. The voice of

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:05.950
Looney Tunes and many Hanna-Barbera cartoon
characters spent six-decades performing about

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.950
400 different voices. At the time of his death
in 1989 it was estimated that 20 million people

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.939
heard his voice every day.

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.750
(Cartoon Character Voice)

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.700
Giving life to many of the female characters
is June Foray. Her list of voice credits is

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.799
extensive, ranging from "Rocky" and "Natasha"
to "Granny" on Looney Tunes. She's still working

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.130
into her 90's and is the oldest entertainer
ever to be nominated for an Emmy award.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.200
"Why didn't you tell me before?"
"I didn't think you'd believe me!"

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.289
"I don't, but it sure helps the plot!"

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.429
Creating sounds for animals, aliens, robots,
and humans alike is Frank Welker- one of the

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:57.060
highest-grossing actors in all of Hollywood
due to the sheer amount of high-profile voiceover

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.939
work that he's done. Starting with Fred on
Scooby Doo, he's gone on to voice Abu in Aladdin,

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.390
Nibbler on Futurama, and Megatron on Transformers
in the animated series as well as the video

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.450
games. Here he is doing lion roars for Disney's
The Lion King.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.680
(Lion roars)

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.379
The voice of Walt Disney since 1983 is Mark
Elliot. He's done voice overs for so many

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.560
trailers, that his voice is synonymous with
Disney.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.150
"Disney's magical classic that taught us to
believe, only for a limited time."

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.280
Don Messick was responsible for an incredible
amount of the famous voices of Hanna-Barbara

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.280
cartoons including Scooby Doo, Papa Smurf,
Droopy, Bamm Bamm, Boo Boo Bear, and Astro.

(Funny cartoon voices)

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.810
The epic voice of the Transformer's Optimus
Prime belongs to Peter Cullen. Cullen also

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.120
voiced "Eeyore" from Winnie The Pooh, and
was the first person ever to provide a voice

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.030
for Donkey Kong as part of Nintendo's Saturday
Supercade in 1983.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:10.030
"I have witnessed their capacity for courage,
and though we are worlds apart, like us, there

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.519
is more to them than meets the eye."

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.530
The man trying to cheer up Eeyore was Jim
Cummings, whose long list of characters include

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.569
Winnie The Pooh and Tigger.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.379
(Winnie The Pooh voices)

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:33.379
When it came to voicing Muppets it starts
with Jim Henson and Kermit.

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:42.319
"Now the truth of the matter is that the frog
is a great deal more interesting to look at,

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.409
and, uh, who notices what the bearded man
is doing?"

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:50.920
But right alongside Henson was Frank Oz. Oz
not only worked the puppets, but voiced many

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.640

Cookie Monster, and even Yoda.

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.030
Today's cartoons have many dominating voice
actors, one of which is Billy West. Noted

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:30.030

"The point is, her costume linked her to me.
Why?"

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.520
One of the most recognized voices in all of
cartoons is Tom Kenny's Spongebob Squarepants.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.130
