00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.190
Hey look at this!  There's a broken canister of 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.050
mutant ooze leaking down into the sewers.  I got a 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.220
little too close, and this mysterious goo is all over 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.060
my hands now.  But don't worry because this sticky 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.180
slime is non-toxic, and it's so easy to make a 3 year 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.170
old can do it!

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.140
All you need for this project are some common 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.020
household items you probably already have.  A little 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.140
Borax detergent booster, yellow and green food 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.150
coloring, and a 5 oz bottle of some clear non-toxic 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.200
school glue like this one.  First we'll need to 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.020
measure out 1 cup of water, and carefully add 1/2 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.080
teaspoon of Borax.  Stir that in as best you can, and 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.130
now we'll need a separate bowl to hold 1/2 cup of 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.200
water.  This is the part where you can take the lid off 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.110
your glue bottle and dump the entire thing in.  Stir 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.230
the glue and water together so you get a good mix, 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.170
and grab your food coloring because we're going to 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.110
use 2 drops of green, and 5 drops of yellow.  The 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.290
yellow is going give this a slimy yellow-green look, 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.240
so stir it all together, but don't touch yet.  It's only 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.030
when you add the Borax mixture into the bowl that 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.220
the gelled ooze starts to form before your eyes.  You 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.180
can try and stir it together now, and what you're 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.130
going to find is a great green glob of flubber.  This 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.250
slime is so shiny, so stretchy, and so gooey and 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.170
green that it's nearly irresistible not to put it in your 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.160
mouth.  Luckily it's non-toxic and doesn't really taste 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.190
bad, but it's probably better if you kept it in your 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.270
hands.  When you can transfer your slime to a 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.050
different bowl, there will be a little water left over, 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.140
and that can be thrown away.  This stuff looks pretty 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.000
wet and sticky, and if you're not careful, it can get 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.290
everywhere, but if you dump it out on something like 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.090
a table and let it flatten out, the whole thing is firm 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.150
enough to pick up and flip over, like a pancake.  

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.010
Because we used clear glue, the slime itself is 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.030
transparent, and when you hold it up in front of a 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.170
light, it resembles some kind of alien experiments.  

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.170
That's kind of creepy.  We're going to need a way to 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.270
store our slime, and I tried putting it back in the glue 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.050
bottle, but this old Play-doh container is much 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.110
better.  One batch actually filled both these 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.230
containers.  But I want a canister that stands out.  

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.060
This looks like it should work.  It's just a couple of 2" 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.120
ABS clean out adaptors and plugs from the 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.070
hardware store, and some left over acrylic tubing.  If 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.170
you want to make this at home, there's a good 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.180
chance you don't have any acrylic, so I'm going to try 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.160
and imitate this with a clear 2L bottle.  First I'll need 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.180
to empty this bottle, and my wife really likes this 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.270
method.  Then after it's cleaned and dried I'm going 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.030
to grab some scissors.  I'm cutting off the bottom, the 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.240
side and top pieces so that I get this nice rectangle 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.170
sheet of plastic.  It naturally wants to roll up into a large 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.240
tube, so I'll use that to my advantage by placing 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.150
both ends inside the ABS adaptors, and letting it 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.270
expand.  I decided to use hot glue to try and hold 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.130
this overlapping bit together,  then remove the caps 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.190
and continue with the rest.  I'm just using the plugs 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.210
on the ends to keep the tube the right size as the 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.230
glue cools.  I also added some glue around the 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.050
edges to make it all a little stronger.  Now hot glue 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.060
can go on the ends, and the adaptors twisted on 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.160
overtop to ensure good contact with the glue, 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.000
making this an ooze-tight seal.  Well it's not as 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.220
perfect as a acrylic tube would be, but it's free!  Now 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.040
our slime can go inside, and when the cap is on, it's 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.030
actually looking pretty good!  The clear plastic 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.210
allows the ooze show through, and the ABS fittings 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.150
give it a more authentic look.  How do you think 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.160
your neighbors might react if they happened upon 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.210
something that looked like this?  Would they call the 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.110
police?  It's non-toxic and dissolves in water, so 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.170
should be pretty easy to clean up.  Just for fun, I 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.140
went to the dollar store and got some yellow glow 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.180
sticks to put inside.  I'll break them up to get the 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.000
chemicals mixing, and shake them until they glow.  

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.280
When I push one of the rods into the center of the 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.020
ooze, it glows an eery green light.  One is enough, 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.240
but I'll try two and put the cap back on.  I like how 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.040
this is looking.  You can lay this glowing mutant 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.100
ooze down in dark corners and people will have a 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.180
hard time figuring out what it is.  Well that was a fun 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.040
project, and a favorite new toy.  If you like these
