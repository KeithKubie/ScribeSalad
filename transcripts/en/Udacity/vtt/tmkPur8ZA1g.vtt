00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.680
In this lesson we have seen
that we don't need each core to

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.280
have it's own cache.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.630
But that these caches have
to be kept coherent so

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.310
shared memory programs can work.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.310
We then learned several ways
of keeping caches coherent.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.040
In the next lesson,
we will see what we need to do so

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.060
course can coordinate their
work in a parallel program.
