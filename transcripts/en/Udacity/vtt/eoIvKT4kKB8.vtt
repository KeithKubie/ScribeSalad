00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:00.985
All right so here's the mixed strategy.

00:00:00.985 --> 00:00:03.281
The mixed strategy is
that everyone just dares,

00:00:03.281 --> 00:00:05.723
chooses to dare with
probability one-third.

00:00:05.723 --> 00:00:06.533
&gt;&gt; Really?
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.843
that works out to be a Nash equilibrium.

00:00:08.843 --> 00:00:12.125
We'll leave it as an exercise to the
reader to convince themselves of that,

00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:14.315
but it does actually
work out to be the case.

00:00:14.315 --> 00:00:17.459
&gt;&gt; And so that means we both, okay,
we both dare with probably a third,

00:00:17.459 --> 00:00:20.018
which means two-thirds
of the time we chicken.

00:00:20.018 --> 00:00:23.190
So there's going to be some probability
that we both chicken, some probability

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.680
that I chicken and you don't,
some probably that you chicken and

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.160
I don't, and then the lowest
probability is we both dare, boom!

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.342
&gt;&gt; Right, so in fact, I'm glad you
said that, because that's exactly how

00:00:33.342 --> 00:00:36.929
we would figure out how good
a strategy this mixed strategy is.

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:37.871
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So, let's do this.

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:38.521
So, let me ask you a question.

00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:41.748
What's the probability
that we both chicken?

00:00:41.748 --> 00:00:43.548
&gt;&gt; Four-ninths.

00:00:43.548 --> 00:00:44.430
&gt;&gt; And how do you get four-ninths?

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.788
&gt;&gt; I looked at your notes.

00:00:45.788 --> 00:00:47.515
That's the problem with
being in the same place when

00:00:47.515 --> 00:00:48.621
we're doing these recordings.

00:00:48.621 --> 00:00:50.964
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm pretty impressed that
you can actually read my handwriting,

00:00:50.964 --> 00:00:51.582
I'm pretty sure.

00:00:51.582 --> 00:00:52.830
&gt;&gt; No, I cannot only not read it, but

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.645
my eyes are old enough that I can't read
it anyway even if you write it nicely.

00:00:55.645 --> 00:00:59.521
So, no, what I did is, I took if
the probability of dare is a third,

00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:02.381
then the probability of
chicken is two-thirds.

00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:05.779
And we're independently choosing that,
so the probability that both of us

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:08.720
choose it is two-thirds times
two-thirds, or four-ninths.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.305
&gt;&gt; So what's the probability
of one person chickening and

00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:13.512
the other person daring,
in particular C, D?

00:01:13.512 --> 00:01:16.170
&gt;&gt; C, D, so that's one-third times
two-thirds, which is two-ninths.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.914
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:16.914 --> 00:01:18.295
And by symmetry?

00:01:18.295 --> 00:01:19.359
&gt;&gt; Nine-seconds.

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:21.425
Sorry, two-ninths.

00:01:21.425 --> 00:01:21.960
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.390
&gt;&gt; And then dare, dare would be
one-ninth because it's dare times dare.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.924
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; And

00:01:25.924 --> 00:01:28.489
let's just double check that four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:29.208
Whoo-hoo!

00:01:29.208 --> 00:01:31.298
Wait, no not one-third,
the bottom thing.

00:01:31.298 --> 00:01:32.502
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:32.502 --> 00:01:36.285
And so, now we can figure out from
this what our expected, let's say,

00:01:36.285 --> 00:01:39.706
my expected reward would be for
playing this Nash equilibrium.

00:01:39.706 --> 00:01:42.210
&gt;&gt; Right, so
let's say you're player one.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.132
So this is you.

00:01:43.132 --> 00:01:47.220
So then if we do C, C, what is your,
actually you're the row.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.750
What is your a payoff?

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.306
&gt;&gt; 6.

00:01:49.306 --> 00:01:52.094
&gt;&gt; So,
we can just say 6 times four-ninths.

00:01:52.094 --> 00:01:54.670
What's the payoff if you chicken out and
I dare.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.912
&gt;&gt; 2.
&gt;&gt; 2.

00:01:55.912 --> 00:01:58.733
And what's the payoff if you dare and
I chicken out?

00:01:58.733 --> 00:01:59.732
&gt;&gt; 7.

00:01:59.732 --> 00:02:01.973
&gt;&gt; And
what's the payoff if we both dare?

00:02:01.973 --> 00:02:02.473
&gt;&gt; 0.

00:02:02.473 --> 00:02:03.807
&gt;&gt; 0.

00:02:03.807 --> 00:02:06.774
So we add all that up,
multiply these numbers, add them, and

00:02:06.774 --> 00:02:08.110
what do we end up with?

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:08.908
&gt;&gt; You're asking me?
[LAUGH]

00:02:08.908 --> 00:02:09.965
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:09.965 --> 00:02:11.092
&gt;&gt; You're the one who can do arithmetic.

00:02:11.092 --> 00:02:12.066
&gt;&gt; You're right, it's 4 and two-thirds.

00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:12.693
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:02:12.693 --> 00:02:15.050
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we just did that by
keeping the denominator the same.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.567
So, that's 24 plus 4,
which is 28, plus 14, right?

00:02:19.567 --> 00:02:20.252
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:20.252 --> 00:02:23.970
&gt;&gt; Which is 42, plus 0,
42 over 9 is 4 and two-thirds.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.320
&gt;&gt; This is actually pretty cool,

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.410
and the payoff is 4 and
two-thirds on average for you.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.730
And by symmetry it's actually 4 and
two-thirds.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.820
&gt;&gt; Which I like better than
both of us chickening out.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.010
&gt;&gt; Right, both of you chickening out is-
&gt;&gt; No, no, sorry, sorry.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.960
That's better.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.984
I like better than me chickening out.

00:02:38.984 --> 00:02:40.076
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:40.762
&gt;&gt; And then I'll only get two.

00:02:40.762 --> 00:02:44.325
&gt;&gt; Right, and so actually doing this,
even though occasionally we will, well,

00:02:44.325 --> 00:02:47.618
in the game we'll both die, but
of course we aren't going to die, we're

00:02:47.618 --> 00:02:51.199
just going to get 0 utility because all
that other stuff doesn't really matter.

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:53.021
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; We're going to do this.

00:02:53.021 --> 00:02:55.657
This is actually pretty good, right,
this is a pretty good pay-off.

00:02:55.657 --> 00:02:56.656
&gt;&gt; Okay, I agree with that.

00:02:56.656 --> 00:02:59.795
&gt;&gt; In fact, for either one of us, if we
get in the short end of the stick for

00:02:59.795 --> 00:03:02.043
the C,D,D,C,
this is actually better for us.

00:03:02.043 --> 00:03:05.223
&gt;&gt; That's true, the worst of us,
or sorry, not the worst of us.

00:03:05.223 --> 00:03:05.920
That doesn't sound right at all.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.565
But the least fortunate of us is much
happier with this outcome than the C, D.

00:03:11.565 --> 00:03:14.474
&gt;&gt; Right, and by the way, we're actually
happier with his outcome than if we had

00:03:14.474 --> 00:03:16.100
uniformly randomly chosen between them.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.486
&gt;&gt; And we're better off with this
outcome than if we had done C, D,

00:03:19.486 --> 00:03:23.090
and then like split the winnings,
which would be 4 and-a-half.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.981
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's the same thing as
doing half, or going by half, right?

00:03:25.981 --> 00:03:28.370
It's 4 and-a-half, 4 and-a-half
is less than 4 and two-thirds.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.526
Those are, in fact,
the same thing in this case.

00:03:29.526 --> 00:03:30.766
&gt;&gt; Got it.
&gt;&gt; This is why it's

00:03:30.766 --> 00:03:33.820
something like a third and
not something like a half.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:34.530
So, that's pretty cool.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.127
So, this seems like a pretty good win,
but

00:03:37.127 --> 00:03:39.516
I'm going to claim
that we can do better.

00:03:39.516 --> 00:03:40.131
&gt;&gt; Hm, okay.

00:03:40.131 --> 00:03:40.852
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:40.852 --> 00:03:45.059
So, let's remember this 4 and two-thirds
and keep it around for a little while,

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:48.020
and let me try to convince you
that we're going to do better.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.930
Okay?
&gt;&gt; Okay.
