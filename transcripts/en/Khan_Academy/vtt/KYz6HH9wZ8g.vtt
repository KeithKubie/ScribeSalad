00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.700
- [Instructor] Let's say
we have some type of hard,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.180
flat, frictionless
surface right over here.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.120
That's my drawing of a hard,
flat, frictionless surface.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.740
And on that, I have a block,

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.870
and that block is not
accelerating in any direction.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.230
It is just sitting there.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.580
And let's say we know
the weight of that block.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.030
It is a 10-newton block.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.020
So my question to you is,

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.570
pause this video, and think
about what are all of the forces

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.173
that are acting on this block?

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.560
All right, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.300
And to do it, I'm going to draw

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.420
what's known as a free-body diagram

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.250
to think about all of the forces.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.180
And the reason why it's
called a free-body diagram

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.230
is that we just focus on this one body.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.130
And we don't draw
everything else around it,

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.160
and we just draw the forces acting on it.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.150
And there's actually two typical ways

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.200
of drawing a free-body diagram.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.033
I'll do them both.

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:53.360
So first, I could draw it this way.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.053
So this is my block here.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.830
Now, I told you that it weighs 10 newtons.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.070
The weight of an object,

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.500
that's the force of gravity
acting on that object,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.990
and it would be downwards.

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:08.220
So we have, from this 10
newtons right over here,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.560
we know that there is a downward force,

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.730
the force of gravity

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.230
acting on the mass of
this object of 10 newtons.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.630
It has a magnitude of 10 newtons,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.820
and the force is acting downwards.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.580
We could say this is the
magnitude of the force of gravity.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.390
And when you draw a free-body diagram,

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.820
it's typical to show
your vectors originating

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.900
out of the center of that,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.930
of that object in your drawing.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:33.870
Now, my question to you is,

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.130
is that the only force acting on this?

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.600
If you think it is, what
would happen to the object?

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.640
Well, it would start

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.400
or it would be accelerating downwards.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.470
But I just said that this is not

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.860
accelerating in any direction.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.620
So there must be something
that counteracts this,

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.510
and there is.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.970
There's the normal force

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.510
of this surface acting on the block.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.570
That surface is what's keeping the block

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.270
from accelerating downwards.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.110
And I will do that with
this vector right over here.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.440
So it's going to be going upwards,

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.330
and it's going to have
the exact same magnitude,

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.070
just in the opposite direction.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.120
So I could say the magnitude
of the normal force,

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.340
the normal force is
magnitude right over here,

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.290
is also going to be equal to 10 newtons,

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.400
but it's going upwards.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.200
And we can see that these
two are going to net out,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.440
and so you have no net force

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.480
acting in this vertical dimension.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.540
And I have no forces,

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.320
I haven't thought about any or drawn any

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.560
in the horizontal direction.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.220
And so that's why you have
no net force in total,

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.090
and this thing isn't
going to be accelerated.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.760
Now, I mentioned that there's other ways

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.440
to draw a free-body diagram.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.680
Another way that you
might see it is like this,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.163
where you see the body.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.210
And from the outside of the body,

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.110
you see the vectors being drawn.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.503
So in this situation, you
have ten newtons downward,

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.830
and you would have ten newtons upward.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.730
This is another way that you might see

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.320
free-body diagrams drawn.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.720
Now, what I want to do is

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.140
do something interesting to this block.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.740
Let me redraw it.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.050
So I have my surface here,

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.460
my hard, frictionless
surface, and it's flat.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.760
And I still have my block here.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.320
It's my 10-newton block.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.840
But now I'm going to apply a force to it.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.840
I am going to apply a force

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.823
that is in this direction.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.320
It's in this direction, and its magnitude,

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.170
let's say its magnitude is 20 newtons.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.490
And just so that we know the direction,

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.700
this angle right over here,

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.560
let's say that that is 60 degrees.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.220
I'll say theta is equal to 60 degrees.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.790
The magnitude

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.540
of this force is equal to

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.880
20 newtons.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.800
So what would the free-body
diagram now look like?

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.430
Well, it might be tempting
to just draw the force

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.610
right on one of these free-body diagrams,

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.600
something like that,

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.090
something like that, and
that would not be inaccurate.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.730
But we would have to watch out

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.100
because this force is acting at an angle.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.270
So if we were to break it up

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.570
into its horizontal and
vertical components,

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.910
some part of that force
is acting downward.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.090
And so you're actually going
to have a larger normal force

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.330
to counteract that.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.720
And some other component is going

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.660
to be working horizontally.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.900
And so what we want to do
is actually break things up.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.010
'Cause if you leave it in this angle,

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.540
it gets very, very confusing.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.970
So what I want to do is I want to break up

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.360
this new blue force into its horizontal

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.940
and vertical components.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.870
And to do so, we just have to remember

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.390
a little bit of our basic trigonometry.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.900
If I have a force like this,

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.910
if I have a force like this

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.530
and it is acting at an
angle theta right over here,

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:43.880
with the horizontal,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.830
and I want to break it
up into its horizontal

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.470
and its vertical components,

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.600
and its vertical components,

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.940
if the magnitude of the
hypotenuse is capital F,

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.800
then the magnitude of the
adjacent side to this angle,

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.490
this comes straight out of soh-cah-toa,

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.310
from our right triangle trigonometry,

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.830
it would be the magnitude
of our hypotenuse

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.760
times the cosine

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.860
of this angle.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.380
And the magnitude of
the vertical component,

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.300
that would be the
magnitude of our hypotenuse

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.250
times the sine

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.270
of that angle.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.610
And you could think about
it the other way as well,

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.853
if the force was like this,

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.530
where it's just going in
the opposite direction.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.930
But once again, you have this angle theta.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.940
And now the components
would look like this,

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.830
where the vertical component
would have the same magnitude,

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.100
but now it would be pointing downwards.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.170
And the horizontal component
would have the same magnitude,

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.020
but now it is pointing to the left.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.670
It is the same idea.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.730
If this force has magnitude F

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.700
that's represented by the
hypotenuse of this triangle,

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.600
then the magnitude of
our horizontal component

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.730
is still going to be F cosine theta.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.780
The vector is not going
in the other direction.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.850
And the magnitude of our
vertical component here

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.970
is going to be

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.850
F sine theta.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.030
And so what about this scenario over here?

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.160
Well, in this scenario,

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.833
our vertical component
is gonna look like this,

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.230
and our horizontal component
is going to look like this.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.430
And so what's the magnitude
of our horizontal component?

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.300
Well, it's going to be the
magnitude of our hypotenuse

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.440
times the cosine of the 60 degrees.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.200
So this is going to be 20 newtons

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.200
times the cosine of 60 degrees.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.770
And it's really helpful,

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.290
both trigonometry and physics classes,

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.470
to know the values of
your sines, your cosines,

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.750
and your tangents at
angles like zero degrees,

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.900
30 degrees, 60 degrees,
90 degrees, 45 degrees.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.900
You could use a calculator
here, but it's useful to know

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.670
that the cosine of 60 degrees is 1/2.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.200
So 20 times 1/2,

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.710
this is going to be equal to 10 newtons.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.330
And if we want to know the magnitude

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.230
of our vertical component,

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.480
well, this is going to be 20 newtons

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.480
times the sine

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.860
of 60 degrees.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.350
Once again, this is useful to know.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.750
It is square root of three over two.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.010
And so 20 divided by two is 10.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:21.000
So this is going to be 10
square root of three newtons.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.760
And so we can use that information.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.040
We've broken up our original vector

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.220
into two component vectors
that, if you took their sum,

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.000
you would get your original one.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.500
But what's useful now is
that we've broken it up

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.090
into vectors that are parallel

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.080
or perpendicular to our surface,

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.760
which will allow us to think about

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.150
what nets against these things
that I already have in place.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.580
So let me draw that.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.930
So actually, I'll first draw
this type of free-body diagram.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.363
So there is my block.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.370
And I have the force of
gravity acting on it downwards.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.000
I will draw it right over here.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.530
So that's 10 newtons.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:57.680
That is the force of
gravity acting downwards.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.170
Now, is that the only thing
that I have acting downwards?

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.320
No, I also have the vertical component

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.720
of this applied force.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.350
And so this is going downwards

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.640
10 square roots of three newtons.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.780
And these aren't drawn perfectly to scale,

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.930
but hopefully you get the idea.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:16.640
So this is 10 square roots of
three newtons, just like that.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.410
And now what is our normal force,

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.010
assuming that our surface
is able to not be compressed

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:24.210
in any way, that it is a
hard, frictionless surface?

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:25.500
Well, now our normal force is going

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.420
to counteract both of these forces.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.690
Our normal force might
look something like this.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.800
Once again, I haven't drawn
it completely to scale.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.160
But this would be 10 plus

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:38.220
10 square roots of three newtons.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.900
And what about now in
the horizontal direction?

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.350
Well, I have this blue vector right here,

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.430
and so that is going to the right

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:50.050
with a magnitude of 10 newtons,

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:51.380
10 newtons.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.350
And so now you can hopefully appreciate

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:56.620
why a free-body diagram is
really, really, really useful.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:57.880
Just looking at this,

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.240
I can predict what's going
to happen to my block.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.020
I would say, look, this upward force

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.370
is completely netted out
by these downward forces,

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.250
or these downward forces
are completely netted out

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:08.490
by this upward force.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:10.750
And the only net force that I have

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.750
is ten newtons to the right.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.270
And so that lets me know that,

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.910
hey, since I have a
net force to the right,

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:21.393
this block is going to
accelerate to the right.
