00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.717
So 1 elegant answer to this problem was proposed by Nathan Bell and Michael Garland

00:00:03.717 --> 00:00:06.142
at the Supercomputing Conference in 2009,

00:00:06.142 --> 00:00:10.187
and their answer was, use both approaches, and here's how we're going to do that.

00:00:10.187 --> 00:00:12.817
We're going to divide the matrix into 2 pieces.

00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:17.307
One piece, the more regular piece, is going to use the thread per row approach.

00:00:17.307 --> 00:00:20.091
This right side here, the more irregular approach,

00:00:20.091 --> 00:00:22.810
is instead going to use the thread per element approach.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.996
And then we compute each of these separately

00:00:24.996 --> 00:00:27.499
and add the results back together at the very end.

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:30.731
So the final question is, where do we draw this line?

00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:33.873
What happens if we draw it too far to the left or draw it too far to the right?
