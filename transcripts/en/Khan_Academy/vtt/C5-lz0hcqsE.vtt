00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.330
We hopefully know at this point
what a differential

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.490
equation is, so now let's
try to solve some.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.000
And this first class of
differential equations I'll

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.270
introduce you to, they're called
separable equations.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.570
And I think what you'll find
is that we're not learning

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.420
really anything new.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.010
Using just your first year
calculus derivative and

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.300
integrating skills, you can
solve a separable equation.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.240
And the reason why they're
called separable is because

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.090
you can actually separate the
x and y terms, and integrate

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.330
them separately to get
the solution of the

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.170
differential equation.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.640
So that's separable.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.000
Separable equations.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.550
So let's do a couple, and I
think you'll get the point.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.600
These often are really more of
exercises in algebra than

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.120
anything else.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.110
So the first separable
differential equation is: dy

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.710
over dx is equal to x squared
over 1 minus y squared.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.420
And actually, this is a good
time to just review our

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.050
terminology.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.840
So first of all, what
is the order of this

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.060
differential equation?

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.090
Well, the highest derivative
in it is just the first

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.430
derivative, so the order
is equal to 1.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.390
So it's first order.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.020
It's ordinary, because we only
have a regular derivative, no

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.530
partial derivatives here.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.130
And then, is this linear
or non-linear?

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.580
Well, first you say, oh well,
you know, this looks linear.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.910
I'm not multiplying
the derivative

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.050
times anything else.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.280
But if you look carefully,
something

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.160
interesting is going on.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.100
First of all, you have
a y squared.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.610
And y is a dependent variable.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.440
y is a function of x.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.740
So to have the y squared, that
makes it non-linear.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.660
And even if this was a y, if you
were to actually multiply

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.280
both sides of this equation
times 1 minus y, and get in

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.740
the form that I showed you in
the previous equation, you

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.060
would have 1 minus y squared.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.630
This is actually the first step
of what we have to do

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.150
anyways, so I'll
write it down.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.020
So if I'm just multiplying both
sides of this equation

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.620
times 1 minus y squared, you get
1 minus y squared times dy

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.820
dx is equal to x squared.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.120
And then you immediately see
that even if this wasn't a

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.020
squared here, you'd be
multiplying the y times dy dx,

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.770
and that also makes it
non-linear because you're

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.640
multiplying the dependent
variable times the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.690
derivative of itself.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.890
So that also makes this
a non-linear equation.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.300
But anyway, let's get back
to solving this.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.690
So this is the first step.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.480
I just multiply both sides
by 1 minus y squared.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.310
And the real end goal is just
to separate the y's and the

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.200
x's, and then integrate
both sides.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.450
So I'm almost there.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.720
So now what I want to do is I
want to multiply both sides of

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.940
this equation times dx, so I
have a dx here and get rid of

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.375
this dx there.

00:02:34.375 --> 00:02:37.790
Let me go here, I don't want
to waste too much space.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:47.440
So you get 1 minus y squared dy
is equal to x squared dx.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.190
I have separated the x and
y variables and the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.420
differentials.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.510
All I did is I multiplied both
sides of this equation times

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.850
dx to get here.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.160
Now, I can just integrate
both sides.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.680
So let's do that.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.080
Whatever you do to one side
of the equation you

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.930
have to do the other.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.790
That's true with regular
equations or

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.560
differential equations.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.180
So we're going to integrate
both sides.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.640
So what's the integral of this
expression with respect to y?

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.350
Let's see.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.730
The integral of 1 is y, the
integral of y squared, well

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:27.210
that's minus y to the
third over 3.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.230
And I'll write the plus c here
just to kind of show you

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.730
something, but you really don't
have to write a plus c

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.020
on both sides.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.145
I'll call the plus the
constant due to y.

00:03:37.145 --> 00:03:38.750
The y integration.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.420
You'll never see this in a
calculus class, but I just

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.670
want to make a point here.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.840
I just want to show you that
our plus c has never

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.720
disappeared from when we were
taking our traditional

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.780
antiderivatives.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.030
And what's the derivative
of this?

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.420
Well that's x to the
third over 3.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.300
And this is also going
to have a plus c

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.600
due to the x variable.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.390
Now, the reason why I did this
magenta one in magenta and I

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.070
labelled it like that, is
because you really just have

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.380
to write a plus c on one
side of the equation.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.900
And if that doesn't make a lot
of sense, let's subtract this

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.740
c from both sides, and we get y
minus-- let me scroll down a

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.650
little bit, my y
looks like a g.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:29.370
y minus y to the third over 3
is equal to x to the third

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.270
over 3 plus the constant when we
took the antiderivative of

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.380
the x, minus the constant of
the antiderivative when we

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.450
took the y.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.500
But these two constants,
they're just constants.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.480
I mean, we don't know
what they are.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.430
There are arbitrary constants.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.170
So we could just write
a general c here.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.170
So you could have just-- you
have to have a constant, but

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.310
it doesn't have to be on both
sides of the equation, because

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.580
they're arbitrary.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.140
cx minus cy, well, that's still
just another constant.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.900
And then if we want to simplify
this equation more,

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.230
we can multiply both sides
of this by 3, just

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.430
make it look nicer.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:04.510
And you get 3y minus y to the
third is equal to x to the

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.580
third plus-- well, I could
write 3c here.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.190
But once again, c is an
arbitrary constant.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.570
So 3 times an arbitrary
constant, that's just another

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:14.555
arbitrary constant.

00:05:14.555 --> 00:05:18.610
So I'll write the c there.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.690
And there you have it.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.460
We have solved this differential
equation.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.520
Although it is in implicit
form right now, and it's

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.290
fairly hard to get it out
of implicit form.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.550
We could put the c on one side,
so the solution could be

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:37.180
3y minus y to the third minus x
to the third is equal to c.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.660
Some people might like that
little bit better.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:39.900
But that's the solution.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.780
And notice, the solution, just
like when you take an

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.930
antiderivative, the solution
is a class of implicit

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.230
functions, in this case.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.320
And why is it a class?

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.520
Because we have that
constant there.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.090
Depending on what number
you pick there, it

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.360
will be another solution.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.440
But any constant there will
satisfy the original

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.780
differential equation,
which was up here.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.540
This was the original
differential equation.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.370
And if you want to solve for
that constant, someone has to

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.630
give you an initial condition.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:15.860
Someone has to say, well,
when x is 2, y is 3.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.920
And then you could
solve for c.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.880
Anyway, let's do another
one that gives

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.950
us an initial condition.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.180
So this one's a little bit--
I'll start over.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.990
Clear image, different colors,
so I have optimal space.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.690
So this one is the first
derivative of y with respect

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:49.940
to x is equal to 3x squared
plus 4x plus 2 over 2

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.100
times y minus 1.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.030
This is a parentheses, not
an absolute value.

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.280
And they give us initial
conditions.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.640
They say that y of 0 is
equal to negative 1.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.010
So once we solve this
differential equation, and

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.860
this is a separable differential
equation, then we

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.830
can use this initial condition,
when x is 0, y is

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.520
1, to figure out the constant.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.220
So let's first separate
this equation.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.610
So let's multiply both sides
by 2 times y minus 1.

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:25.340
And you get 2 times y minus 1
times dy dx is equal to 3x

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.620
squared plus 4x plus 2.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.040
Multiply both sides times dx.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.560
This is really just an
exercise in algebra.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:39.030
And I can multiply this one out,
too, you get 2y minus 2,

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.940
that's just this, dy.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:47.390
I multiplied both sides times
dx, so that equals 3x squared

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:52.730
plus 4x plus 2 dx.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.740
I have separated
the equations.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.990
I've separated the independent
from the dependent variable,

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.690
and their relative
differentials, and so now I

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:01.570
can integrate.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:02.840
And I can integrate
in magenta.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.950
What's the antiderivative
of this expression

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:09.650
with respect to y?

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:10.080
Well, let's just see.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.100
It's y squared minus 2y.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.450
I won't write the plus
c, I'll just do it on

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:17.200
the right hand side.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.995
That is equal to 3x squared.

00:08:19.995 --> 00:08:25.400
Well, the antiderivative is x to
the third, plus 2x squared,

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.580
plus 2x plus c.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.010
And that c kind of takes care of
the constant for both sides

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.159
of the equation, and hopefully
you understand why from the

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.080
last example.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:39.270
But we can solve for c using the
initial condition y of 0

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.480
is equal to negative 1.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.870
So let's see.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.950
When x is 0, y is negative 1.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:50.090
So let's put y as negative 1,
so we get negative 1 squared

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:55.870
minus 2 times negative 1, that's
the value of y, is

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.500
equal to when x is equal to 0.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.890
So when x is equal to 0, that's
0 to the third plus 2

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:04.760
times 0 squared plus
2 times 0 plus c.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.260
So this is fairly
straightforward.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.280
All of these, this is all 0.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:14.940
This is, let's see, negative
1 squared, that's 1.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:20.600
Minus 2 times minus 1, that's
plus 2, is equal to c.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:25.170
And we get c is equal to 3.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.710
So, the implicit exact solution,
the solution of our

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.080
differential equation-- remember
now, it's not a

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.880
class, because they gave us an
initial condition-- is y

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:43.170
squared minus 2y is equal to x
to the third plus 2x squared

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:46.260
plus 2x plus 3.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.730
We figured out that's
what c was.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:50.460
And actually, if you want, you
could write this in an

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.800
explicit form by completing
the square.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.180
This is just algebra
this point.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:54.510
You're done.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.450
This is an implicit form.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.450
If you wanted to make it
explicit, you could add 1 to

00:09:58.450 --> 00:09:58.890
both sides.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.660
I'm just completing
the square here.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:04.480
So y squared minus 2y plus 1.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.060
If I add 1 to that side, I have
to add 1 to this side, so

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:13.090
it becomes x to the third plus
2x squared plus 2x plus 4.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.940
I just added 1 to both sides
of the equation.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:15.770
Why did I do that?

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:17.680
Because I wanted this
side to be a perfect

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.240
square in terms of y.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:24.590
Then I can rewrite this side as
y minus 1 squared is equal

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:30.500
to x to the third plus 2x
squared plus 2x plus 4.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:35.110
Then I could say y minus 1 is
equal to the plus or minus

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:39.950
square root of x to the
third plus 2x squared

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:43.210
plus 2x plus 4.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:46.520
I can add 1 to both sides, and
then I can get y is equal to 1

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:52.080
plus or minus the square root
of x to the third plus 2x

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.926
squared plus 2x plus 4.

00:10:55.926 --> 00:10:58.470
And it has plus or minus here,
and if we have to pick one of

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.335
the two, we'd go back to
the initial condition.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:08.800
Well, our initial condition told
us that y of 0 is equal

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.200
to negative 1.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:16.710
So if we put 0 here for x, we
get y is equal to 1 plus or

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:19.065
minus 0 plus 4.

00:11:19.065 --> 00:11:22.100
So 1 plus or minus 4.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.740
So if y is going to be equal to
negative 1, so we get y is

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.580
equal to 1 plus or
minus-- sorry, 2.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.090
If this is going to be equal to
negative 1, then this has

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:33.830
to be 1 minus 2.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:37.160
So the explicit form that
satisfies our initial

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.490
condition, and we're getting a
little geeky here, you could

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.970
get rid of the plus, it's 1
minus this whole thing.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.340
That's what satisfies our
initial condition.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.430
And you could figure out where
it's satisfied, over what

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:50.910
domain is it satisfied.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.300
Well, that's satisfied when this
term is positive, this

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.130
becomes negative, and you get
it's undefined in reals, and

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:56.470
all of that.

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:57.950
But anyway, I've run
out of time.

00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:59.970
See you in the next video.
