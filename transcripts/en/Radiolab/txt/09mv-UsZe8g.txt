Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Maybe all of us can sit on the couch. I can or I can pull that chair over. So we're going to start with a story from our producer, Pat Walters about a couple, oh my word. It's the lady. I'm Janet. This is the guy. So I don't need you to introduce yourself. That's usually the thing we do, but we're not telling people who you are. We're going to call him Kevin. Kevin, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, yeah, that's my name. That's suspicious at all. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:24       It's not as real name. No. Makes Sense. Why we're not using his real name in a second.

Speaker 1:          00:00:29       Okay. You know, this one starts a few summers ago. It was July, 2006. Jan and Kevin were at home and uh, some people you don't know show up and maybe out start with you

Speaker 3:          00:00:41       when they show up at the door. So we were, it was a, we were getting ready to go down the shore. It was a Friday. So we, so we're in the kitchen and they come to the back door.

Speaker 1:          00:00:49       I thought the, I thought that they were fundraising. I thought they might've been farming just by, you know, the, the blue shirt, the blue shirt and then realized that, uh, that they, they were, they were law enforcement

Speaker 4:          00:01:00       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:01:01       two women and a, I think two men more came up from around the, you know, the side of the house and they show us their badges or are they cops or they were homeland security. They took me outside and they kept me and they asked me to stay in the kitchen and they had a, a woman with me. I didn't know what was going on. Nobody said anything.

Speaker 1:          00:01:19       What are they saying to you on the porch? Meanwhile, when they, when they showed up, like after to the door, you said, you know why we're here. I said, yeah, I do. I was expecting you

Speaker 4:          00:01:32       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:01:33       and I showed him where everything was.

Speaker 2:          00:01:38       This story about Kevin and his wife, Janet inspired us to do the entire hour because one of the most basic things that we do as people is we judge, we judge one another, could judge what's right, what's wrong, but this story and the two that follow, they will make you judge how you judge or at least they had that effect on us. We're calling our show

Speaker 5:          00:02:00       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:02:01       blame him, Jab and Ron. I'm Robert Krulwich and we'll go back to pat. Before we do, you should know that this show contains some graphic difficult descriptions in a few spots. If you're not in the mood or if you have kids around, you might want to sit this one out.

Speaker 1:          00:02:16       Okay. So what happened in that first scene and what happens next? Only makes sense. If we go back a little first about 15 years, it's just an ordinary day. Kevin's going home from work and um, I was driving home going about 65 70 in the fast lane when suddenly there was a thump in my chest. Then he just a heat boating. After that. He said suddenly he had this thickness in my tongue and my throat than about taste in his mouth. Then my hearing, feed it out. Any thoughts? It's back when I finally did come to, uh, he sees his car smashed into the side of an apartment building. I do recall the officers telling you you've been in an accident, you've been at an end. He remembers one of them insisted that he smelled alcohol. And I was talking through clenched teeth cause I had bit my tongue and uh, and my cheeks. I was saying over and over again, I had a seizure. I had a seizure.

Speaker 6:          00:03:28       [inaudible] Kevin's got epilepsy. He's had it since he was a teenager. But two years before this all happened, he'd had surgery to remove the part of his brain that was causing the seizures and it seemed to have worked. He was doing great. Essentially wasn't having seizures anymore until suddenly you,

Speaker 1:          00:03:48       he was lost your license. I lost my license for a year. Things had kind of taken a nose dive. Like here he is, he's 35 years old. I'm living with my brother, I'm divorced. And I have to call my daddy and ask him now to drive me to and from work and you think I need to do something, this is not sustainable. No, no, don't, don't need that. So I walked into the office as the HR person where he works for a list of all the employees, give me a list of everybody and where they're from. So she pulled it up, I go down the list and I get to Janet Woodruff Littlefield only one that's really close to me five minutes away. So I walk to her cube, knocked on the, on the wall and uh, introduced myself like, Hey, my name is Kevin. I also work here. I've got this thing though. It's Kinda awkward. I can't drive. And I was wondering if you'd give me a ride. And uh, she said yes.

Speaker 7:          00:04:48       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:04:48       I really passed by his street, I mean, on the way to work. So it was like right on history pretty much. But I made it clear, you know, I'll do it when I can. And as they drove together, they started talking, finding out little bit more about each other.

Speaker 1:          00:05:00       Notice pretty quickly we'd like to say music.

Speaker 3:          00:05:02       And that was unique because I sort of liked music that was probably more in his error. Kevin was seven years older than Jan. What kind of music are you listening to? Jackson Brown, mostly a lot of Jackson Brown. James Taylor just call um, funny rate. It's a little, you know, Elton John it down themselves.

Speaker 1:          00:05:25       Sing along to the lyrics. You cannot sing with somebody day in and day out and not have something happened.

Speaker 3:          00:05:31       We wound up as the spring came, you know, it's getting nice out. So now it's like, well let's not go home. Let's go out for a beer after work. We're becoming good friends. We liked each other. But for Kevin, yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:05:40       it was a little more serious than that. I'm thinking about her starting to wake up at night and one day in May as Jenna is dropping him off, Kevin turns to her and he says, Hey, I really appreciate what you've done for me. Let me take you to dinner just as friends, just as friends. Jen says.

Speaker 1:          00:05:54       Sure. So May 30th, 1992. Hi. Long pavilion, nicest restaurant in town,

Speaker 3:          00:06:00       so your friends takes you to a four star restaurant. You're thinking right away he thinks this is a date. We're going on a date, come on. So now I'm panic stricken. We have our dinner, we leave. We had a wonderful time.

Speaker 1:          00:06:11       He drops me off and I handed her the poem. What did the poem say? You still have it? Yeah, I do. Okay. This is a little slower. Each time we sing on the way home, I pray that traffic backs up so we can sing together just a little longer and the harmony can go on forever and each time we reach my door I feel robbed because we're always in mid song or mid thought. If only I could. He gets out and goes inside and probably thinks, asked them. I gave her that poem. She's going to be so smitten with me and you go home and what

Speaker 3:          00:06:46       want to throw up. I just thought, Oh God, you know, next day I just looked at him and said, listen, we got to clarify. This is clearly just going to be a friendship. He was seven years older than me. He had these, uh, brain, uh, you know, surgery. He has epilepsy, he's divorced. He has two children, parish in here. You're catching the compassion here. Try, I'm trying. And he's just like, I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm asking you to go out on a few dates. Exactly. If you go out with me like four times in the next six months, I'm ahead of the game. He just handled it and I don't think it was long at all. I can't even remember. But it wasn't long at all before we were like a couple and Kevin, um, I'm dopey. Dopey in love. Oh yeah. Yeah. Doing romantic things for her all the time. Flowers, poems and painting. Illustration of the Jackson Brown cover. And within a year we were engaged,

Speaker 1:          00:07:42       but all the while Kevin is having seizures. Yeah. Since the car accident more and more, there was a point where we were obviously dating, she was helping to make his bed and um, he said she pulled off the pillow case. It's covered with blood and one, two, three, four, five, six of you can count the number of seizures that I had in vitro, my tongue and bled.

Speaker 3:          00:08:04       I knew nothing about epilepsy. I had never seen anybody have a seizure in my past. Those would have been big red flags that I would've just walked away. But I just went with it

Speaker 1:          00:08:13       and they both went with it for a few years until finally Kevin and Jan decide this is enough. I wanted to be done with it. I just needed to be done with it. So they schedule a brain surgery.

Speaker 8:          00:08:24       Uh Huh.

Speaker 1:          00:08:26       Which sounds like a big deal and obviously it is, but they had every reason to think that this wouldn't

Speaker 3:          00:08:32       change him. I honestly thought that he was going to come out of it fine. Better

Speaker 1:          00:08:37       cause that's what happened the first time. Kevin had actually gone through brain surgery much like this one once before and he'd come out pretty much the same guy. He was still himself. In fact, he made sure of it. I had a, I was awake for the surgery and that's crazy. It was. I had to be awake, had to do with music. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:08:59       Kevin is a musician and the doctors told him, they said that if I lost anything, I was going to lose my appreciation for music, that it would be like music would be white noise. I said, you know, no. For me music was no is part of my personality. It was how I coped with my darkest moments in dealing with epilepsy and seizures. At 18 years old, I'd have a seizure. I take my harmonica and I'd find a place with decent reverb somewhere and be right where I needed to be. I didn't want to lose that part of me. So as the doctors were doing the brain surgery, they had his head open, fast, him to save. You remember what you're saying? Um, and do the innocence, some James Taylor and while he's saying they would tickle different parts of his brain and if they ever touched the part that made him stop singing, they'd say, okay, that's a part we can not take out. Wow. Yeah. And in the end, I think they ended up taking out like four and a half centimeters. Like a girl, you know, a little bit bigger than a golf ball. Wow. But afterwards, as he was recovering, I had my keyboard in the room and I tried playing right away, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah Dah. And it worked. The part of him that he really cared about was still there.

Speaker 3:          00:10:12       Exactly. Yeah. He's the man I fell in love with after the first surgery. So I thought, well, you know, now that you've got to do the second surgery, he's already been there on this road, we're fine.

Speaker 1:          00:10:22       And after that second surgery, he did seem fine. Janet didn't have her brother sneak my, my keyboard up to the room. Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:10:28       Yeah. He was very, very adamant that he wanted that keyboard. Played a little,

Speaker 9:          00:10:35       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:10:35       just noodle. A couple of notes, played a couple of things and it was like, okay, I'm there, still me. I was ready to go. So you go home and like it seems to have worked.

Speaker 3:          00:10:45       Yeah. As far as seizures go, we thought, okay, this is it. We're home free. And uh, I was just happy to have some normalcy.

Speaker 1:          00:10:51       But then in the winter, by beginning in the middle of January, Kevin noticed he wanted to eat my physical appetite a lot more than usual. Got like insane.

Speaker 3:          00:11:01       This is a guy who didn't eat breakfast. He had minimal lunch and you'd have a sensible dinner, maybe a snack. That was it, but now I could eat the couch. It just was odd. It was not him normally, but you know, you're like, okay. She thought maybe it's just a side effect from the medications, but then the piano, you play the piano for hours. Same songs. They used to sing in the car together. He has stuck on a piece. He would play for hours. How many hours? Eight. Eight, nine and then there was sex. You know, we were happy, healthy couple. Kevin's nodding. Yeah. Yeah, it was fine. But what was abnormal was it was, it was anywhere. Clearly. It wasn't like, oh, we're in the supermarket, let's have sex here. I mean, it wasn't like that, but I mean it was like I could just walk in the kitchen from banging out of work and he'd be like, Oh, you, let's go here. Which struck her as weird, but then again we were thinking, you know, let's try to have a family. So the timing made things confusing

Speaker 1:          00:11:55       and more than that, it wasn't like any of this stuff was out of character. Exactly. In fact, it was all stuff that she liked about him. Yeah. Except now it was all turned up to 11 all the things that were wonderful became chores

Speaker 1:          00:12:11       and that's pretty much where things are at. When those federal agents showed up in July of 2006 I was just completely blindsided. I said, you know why we're here. I said, yeah, I do. I was expecting you. Kevin took the agents upstairs. I took them right into here where my computer was and they arrested him for what was on that computer. I gave it up to him right away. Warning A, this next passage contains some graphic imagery. I mean, I, I had an, I don't know if I had fully, like I think I had just like let child porn be this kind of vague thing that meant as someone younger than 18, but then I read some of the court documents and they were like toddlers. They were picked videos of two, three, and four year olds. They're, they're at these sites had the most despicable, disgusting things you can, you can imagine infants on throw, um, you know, preach preteen and you know, pre-adolescent you know, in a, in adolescence and you bought these things and put them on your computer. I, yeah, yeah. It, it, it bothers me. It bothers me.

Speaker 1:          00:13:26       Like I said, initially it was, you know, it was just your basic, your basic, you know, Hetero Heteros, heterosexual playboy, like penthouse, like sites. And then windows were just start to open up and pretty soon he says he was going everywhere. There was gay sex. They were, I mean, there was, there was bondage, there was a dedication. Sex, there was animal sex, Zino sex. I went everywhere that a button came up to push. I, I still don't understand it. I still, I still don't understand it. He say it disturbed you and you feel terrible, but I just like wonder, like, how do you detail yourself? Like, that wasn't me. Like how do you explain it to yourself too so that you can kind of, I dunno, not feel like you're as bad as the person who goes there without a brain injury is, you know, like, oh, I know. I say that again. Ask that question. I guess I'm just wondering, I don't know. Like knowing that that's a thing that you did and it sounds like obviously you know, that that was bad. It was a wrong thing. Terrible thing. Um, but it was, it was you who did it? Or was it not? I don't know. You know what I mean? No, it, it was, it was me who did it, but it was me with a complete lack of neurological control.

Speaker 1:          00:14:58       Yeah. I mean, I, I know, I know who I am. I did idiotic things that I couldn't stop myself from doing. I didn't want to do it. There would be nights where it would be four or five, six hours of going to the same site and and, and downloading one or two files and then deleting them, going back a minute later, downloading the same files, deleting them. I would download those files a dozen times and delete them a dozen times cause I didn't want to be there, knew I shouldn't be there and couldn't help myself from going back. I'm not an idiot. I mean I'm, I'm, I'm a smart guy. I'm not an idiot, but I know I had no control

Speaker 6:          00:15:39       and that's when he would argue in court, can we plead guilty? But at the sentencing hearing, he asked the judge to be lenient, arguing essentially that the person who did all those things in some sense wasn't him. It was some other part of his brain that he couldn't control that the hearing, he called one witness,

Speaker 1:          00:15:57       Orrin Devinsky. I'm a neurologist and epilepsy specialist at NYU Medical Center. He's been treating Kevin for decades, 2020 some odd years. And he says as soon as he found out what Kevin had been doing had a terrible sense of of responsibility. This is because of the brain surgery, the surgery Orin recommended he have any argued in court that this was not Kevin's fault. I remember looking at those agents right in their face and saying to them and to the judge, this could be anybody, this could be those agents, judge, this could be you, this could be me, this could be anybody and we would have no control over what we did it and explained to the court what the biology was.

Speaker 6:          00:16:38       [inaudible] the way the brain is organized that there are parts of our brain that are way deep down that controls like based desires, hunger, sex keeps us alive, but it's teaming with the nastiest thoughts. We all have these crazy thoughts in our head now and most of us, those thoughts are kept in check because there are other parts of our brain that sit on top and act like a lid. But in Kevin's case, the brain surgeon who did that surgery removed part of that filter and suddenly the courtroom

Speaker 1:          00:17:07       resolved. I mean it was just no lid on. His sexual desires

Speaker 6:          00:17:15       is that scientist have known about it

Speaker 1:          00:17:17       condition for a long time. They first saw in monkeys in rhesus monkeys when the monkeys would lose roughly the same part of the brain that Kevin lost. They became very hypersexual males that would only previously be sexually involved with females. Now we're 10 times more sexually active with both males and females. David, it feels to me, it feels to me like there's a, there would be a brighter line before kids, you know, I think there is a line for quote unquote normal individuals, but in a brain disorder case, those lines get blurred and he told the court that's what happened here was black and white. Kevin was sick and his behavior was out of his control. Well, that's not what the facts showed in this case. This is Lee Barton who was the prosecutor. We saw no evidence of impulsivity. He says, if you're claiming that he had no control, that his brain made him do it, then how come he had all this child porn on his home computer?

Speaker 1:          00:18:13       I believe it was 52 videos and 125 images. And yet on his work computer, there were zero images, zero videos of child pornography on his work computer. And he worked a lot. He held down a job. He was working every day. If you truly lacked impulse control, I would think you would see child pornography on both computers. And so what he argued back was, what was the lid on at work and off at home? Seems to me to be an easy out. So the answer is that this is common with neurologic disease. They tend not to be 24, seven is this take something like Tourette's? Some people, when they're engaged in playing sports, they tend not to have ticks, whereas when they're sitting around bored or stressed, they do tend to have ticks. So you could say, well, Therese clearly isn't a neurological disorder, but no, Tourette's is a neurologic disorder. We understand some of the brain things that go on in Tourette's. The prosecution didn't buy it, they just thought it was hogwash. What was hogwash was his level of certainty,

Speaker 5:          00:19:14       um,

Speaker 3:          00:19:15       depressed skis and asked the Kevin be sent to prison for five years, isn't paying for child porn. He was supporting an industry that does terrible things to kids.

Speaker 1:          00:19:25       Kevin hoped he'd avoid jail time altogether and instead be placed on house arrest.

Speaker 3:          00:19:31       That was for Janet. Um, right after the arrest, I have to imagine that you were in shock a little like, yeah, she'd gone to see a lawyer and one of the questions he asked was, is this marriage gonna survive this? And I said, I don't know.

Speaker 10:         00:19:46       Ooh.

Speaker 3:          00:19:48       And at that point, understanding, I didn't even know

Speaker 1:          00:19:50       the level of pictures. Yeah. But she says the moment she heard Orin say that this was a brain disorder with the name got Kluver BC syndrome, once I was able to get that for me.

Speaker 10:         00:20:01       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          00:20:02       It clicked. Like you couldn't blame it. We have these experts saying that it was a disease. And I kept thinking they'll understand,

Speaker 1:          00:20:09       not to mention that after Kevin was arrested and got an on bail or, and gave him some medication and Janet says it was like flipping a switch. That's exactly what it was. It was like, yeah, I got him back. Uh, I was able, I was able to sit and watch a movie with her, you know, normal. Janet actually says in a lot of ways, those few months between the arrest and the sentencing hearing, they'd been the best months of the marriage. He now was just so much easier, calmer. Uh, you could just talk. The hearing took about three hours and when it was over, the judge took a recess, went into her chambers. When she came back, she delivered her decision.

Speaker 6:          00:20:47       She actually wouldn't talk to me for the story, but I have the transcript from the hearing and if you remember, the prosecutor of the, our 10 was asking for five years, 63 months or in Kevin, Janet, we're hoping for meaning no jail time.

Speaker 3:          00:21:02       There's no way they're going to put them in jail. This is clear cut

Speaker 6:          00:21:04       and here's what the judge does. She says, I do agree with orange. It is a neurological disorder. No question do. We can't be held fully responsible for his behavior. She was getting it. On the other hand, she said the prosecution did have a point that he was very much in control of his impulses, at least some of the time. And so the question for the judge was, how does the legal system assign blame when a person is sometimes themselves and in control and sometimes not? Well, this was a crime, she said a crime which ultimately leads to children being harmed. And considering that you did have moments where you were in control than in those moments, you had a responsibility, you could have done something, you could have asked for help, you could have told the people around you what you were doing. So even if you couldn't have stopped yourself, they could have stopped you.

Speaker 1:          00:21:54       She made it very clear that we have to do something here. His sentence, 26 months at a federal prison and 25 months of house arrest. Okay. And I, I believe, I believe that she, she was, she was fair and I, I believe she was compassionate. And about a week before Christmas in 2008 Janet drove him to prison. How long was he in jail for? About two years and she was even, no, the judge said, you know, he is responsible. Does that change her attitude toward him at all? No, they totally stuck together. She visited him pretty much every weekend. The whole time

Speaker 3:          00:22:34       I knew the route and I had my own little routine down in between visits. She'd send up notes and I'll never forget, he could send me mail and they had a store where he could get some cards super call murky and he would like alter them. I remember the very first card I got, it was this very, you know, beautiful. Supposedly it's supposed to be beautiful, but it was like, you know, if you need anything, you know anything at all, just let me know. And then he writes, of course if it's pressing you might want to ask someone else because Oh well you can wait 24 months. And I remember getting that and just laughing and then that became our thing. Like listen, this is a horrible situation but we're going to make the best of it.

Speaker 1:          00:23:11       Tell me a little bit about like where things are at now.

Speaker 3:          00:23:14       I think things are, are, are almost normal.

Speaker 1:          00:23:18       Uh, you know, I, I am still [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:23:22       Oh, probation, but he's home. Um, he's working. Life is going on. We have our normal routines.

Speaker 1:          00:23:29       Kevin still takes those medicines that keep that other part of him in check. I mean I have no libido at all, but I know who I am. I know what I am, um, um, disturbed by that portion of my life. But um, yeah, I'm

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       trying, I'm trying to move on.

Speaker 4:          00:23:58       [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         00:23:59       pretty producer Pat Walters. Thanks also to neurologist or Devinsky for connecting us to Kevin and Janet. Stay with us. We'll be exploring these questions of blame and responsibility even more deeply. The next segment, even yell about it a little. Yeah, come on up.

Speaker 2:          00:24:36       Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I am Robert Krulwich today on radio lab blame. In the story we just heard Lee were wrestling with a very difficult question. When somebody has a brain injury and commits a crime, just how much do we blame them and how much do we blame the brain? Yeah, and as it turns out, this question, hi. Hi, this is Chad. Hi Chad. It's Neda. That question is popping up more and more in court cases. We're increasingly, you will find defendants like Kevin Arguing, okay, you've convicted me of a crime, but you should go easier on me because I have these neurological problems. So this is neat. A fairy haughty professor of law and philosophy and professor of genome scientists and policy at Duke University. She's been following this whole sort of emerging field of neuro law for quite awhile and back in 2006 it occurred to her, okay, lots of people are interested in this field, but nobody has any good data.

Speaker 2:          00:25:26       So I started counting cases to try to see, to try to see how many times does brain science come up in court. Now, the only data that she'd get her hands on were written opinions, which turns out it doesn't happen that often. Like yours really only happens in like 1% of court cases, but, but in that 1% of cases she saw a steady increase and you know, relatively dramatic. You have a couple of years, 2005 and six I had about a hundred cases in (200) 078-9200 some cases. And then 1112 year in the three hundreds all told between 2005 and 2012 it's about 1600 cases, but 1600 cases that are kind of like the Kevin Case where someone maybe argues, look, it's not entirely my fault. My brain made me do it.

Speaker 4:          00:26:17       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:26:17       At least a little bit. Yeah. And by the way, that number was just in the 1% she had access to. So the other 99% of cases may actually have a whole lot more. Yeah, we'll wait a second. Is this a new development? What do you mean? Like, you know, in west side story, there's this character that officer crunky and he goes and the these juvenile delinquents, this is back in the 50s and they're saying everything is someone else's fault. Well, they have bad parents and they have poverty and they have passion and they have [inaudible]

Speaker 13:         00:26:47       youth and they plead all these, their kindness sergeant croppy yet gotta understand it's just our bring an uptick that gets us outta hand. Our mothers solid junkies, our fathers all are [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:26:58       have you just added to the list tumor? That's pretty much the same thing. Well maybe, no, there seems to be something more compelling for both judges and juries when, when you are able to have actual brain scans, you know, or EEG or whatever, because now you can say, look to officer crump key. Look, I know this might sound like an excuse, but check out this spot right here. Here's the proof. I don't have a normal brain, you know, and I didn't choose not to have a normal brain. So how can it be completely my fault? Well, doesn't that sound a little bit like a little too easy? Me? Maybe, I mean, I guess it depends on the specific case, but just in the abstract. Let me give you the best version that I've ever heard of this argument. Okay? This is what, when what made me really stop and take it comes from the uh, from a psychologist Kevin Dutton. He was interviewed on the scientific American podcasts and he gave this hypothetical.

Speaker 14:         00:27:47       Imagine if you've got a deaf person, okay, and you've got a child in a burning building and you've got that child screaming out, but the deaf person can't hear the screams to, you wouldn't necessarily blame. You wouldn't hold that deaf person culpable for that child's death if the child died. You agree so far? Yes. By the same token, if you are emotionally deaf, if you can physically hear the screams, but emotionally you just don't have that kind of mural kick up the backside to go in and save that child. Isn't that the same thing? And when you start thinking about that, there's a whole kind of moral conundrum that starts coming out of that because damage to the ear is damaged with physical strikes. Structure

Speaker 2:          00:28:28       Damage to the brain is also damaged to a physical structure. So here's the moral conundrum I think he's referring to. If we go along with this idea that we can use brain abnormalities to defend ourselves in court, well that's going to lead us into some pretty weird places as a society, things may get very, very complicated as we learned. We got into a little tussle. All right. Okay. Where's this guy? Sorry. So you put this on, it is a little chilly in here. This is David Eagleman. I'm a neuroscientist. He's a regular on our show. Is that what I'm supposed to say or that really spirited regular? Yeah. No. Here's one of the most interesting parts. Here's his argument. Think about a technologically at the moment, our best technologies in neuroscience are very crude. We can see when someone has a tumor or damage from traumatic brain injury or neurodegenerative disease, but it is quite crude still the way he puts it. Looking for those brain abnormalities now is sort of like being up in space and looking down at the earth. You can't really see what's going on down there, but you can see the big shapes and the colors and every so often you notice something that's not supposed to be there. Like, Whoa, what does that create over there? If you see something that's big enough to see you take a picture or you're back in court, show it to the judge and maybe she gives the guy a break, but then say you're up there and

Speaker 15:         00:29:47       um, mission control, everything looks normal up here.

Speaker 2:          00:29:50       You don't see anything. Well then back into court, the judge is going to take a look at your apparently normal brain and say, sorry, well that's your fault. It's not a biological problem. So we're just going to say you're blameworthy. So that's where we are now. We draw the line of what we can see and what we can see is only the big stuff. But he says, imagine forward, we'll have new technologies, we'll have x MRI instead FMRI. And suddenly it's going to be like Google maps where instead of being up in space, you can, you can zoom in and now you can see everything. We'll have new names for disorders of the microcircuitry and so on. We'll certainly never get all the way to the end, but one day we may be able to say like see that little bit of mangled wiring right over there.

Speaker 2:          00:30:33       That is because his mom didn't love him enough. Maybe he got bullied like we will be able to see all that stuff almost as well as we can see brain tumors now because there is nothing special about brain tumors except for their visibility. Really what he's saying, when you get down to it, his core belief is that you are your biology, which is on some level kind of like whatever, Duh, but he takes it much farther. He says that almost everything that you go through in your life, all of your experiences, your culture, your history, your neighborhood, all of it is etched into the tissue of your brain, right? There's nothing separate. Nothing. They cart famously suggested you've got the body, you know the physical stuff, and then you've got this extra bit, the soul, the ghost in the machine.

Speaker 9:          00:31:12       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:31:12       but sort of the, you know the inside word on that neuroscience, is that eh? No, no, no. It's all the same thing.

Speaker 16:         00:31:20       And now that we're beginning to see that, he says, actually see it, we are on a slippery slope because if you start letting people off the hook when you see a tumor, well then you're going to have to keep letting them off the hook. When you see something smaller or smaller or smaller, still

Speaker 2:          00:31:34       the point is it cannot be a just legal system that in one decade says, well you're blame worthy because for the moment we can't see anything in your brain. And then the next decades is, oh, you have schmedlin his disease. Hey, we can see it now. And we didn't realize that. So now you were lumping you over here with the people with the brain tumors. So then what does that mean? Like we have to let everybody off the hook. You know, blame worthiness is the wrong question for illegal system to ask. That's the point is that this whole notion about blame worthiness and saying, okay, if we have a biological mitigator then we'll bring that up in court and we'll say, well, it's not exactly his fault and if we don't have a biological mitigator, we'll say it is his fault. The reason none of this makes sense nowadays is because saying was it the person's fault or was it something about his biology doesn't make sense as a question.

Speaker 2:          00:32:24       They are inseparable. Why I haven't, I have a version of that question. How about everybody should know that his brain isn't completely normal in this regard and now the question is proportion, how much do you want to put on the brain and how much do you want to put his, what else is there behavior which comes in was they ability to choose from the brain is choosy part of his brain as opposed to as an choosy pipe. Well that's okay. I mean you're forcing. I'm glad you, I'm glad you're phrasing it this way because that's exactly the problem with our intuitions. We have this intuition that yeah, your brain might look like this. You have these genes, you have these experiences that makes her biology like this. Oh, but in the end, that doesn't matter because you've got this other thing that's independent of the biology.

Speaker 2:          00:33:07       But we don't, you arm your brain, your brain, however, nevertheless helps you decide things, brains help you choose. So the question I'm asking you that they're helping, who's the, that you're helping the bear of the brain, the owner of the brain, the, the, the, and that's separate from the brain. They'll show you, oh, I need to keep doing this to me. I know that I, if I have a tootsie roll in front of me in an m and, m, I can choose the M and m. So I assume my brain is doing something. And the question I want to ask is like, how much am I choosing and how much am I really outside of choosing? Because some something irregular in my brain is choosing for me. And that seems to me to be a way to [inaudible]. So this, but this is fascinating because the way you're phrasing it suggests that there's, um, there's you and then there's your brain and there's things in your brain that might be telling you what you don't want to do. But it's all one system is the thing. So when you're faced with the tootsie roll versus the whatever else, m and m, everything in your life leading up to that moment from your genetic history, written on invisibly small strands of nucleic acids, all the way up to every experience you've ever had leads to that choice. What would it even mean to make a choice? Completely independent of your brain. Okay. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:34:21       what about like the 10 Commandments? Those are like the, those were, those are, okay. I'm just gonna jump in for a second. At this point, things kind of slid off the rails. We ended up talking about the 10 commandments, debating the question of freewill if free will exists at all. It's a really small part of this system. I'm going back and forth about whether you can overcome your upbringing, which obviously you can. Oh Gosh, no, you can't share. You can, no, you can't. I can go to the library and that's only if you're that type of person. Anyhow, after an hour, we finally got back around to David's main point, which is that the legal system would be a hell of a lot better off. He says if a, if we forgot about blame altogether, forget if it's someone's fault. That's a dead end. He would say the better way to do it, he thinks is to focus on this probability of future recidivism.

Speaker 2:          00:35:09       You mean like will they do it again? That's right. That's exactly it. Well, how would you ever know? So here's how you crunch the numbers. So this has already happened in the world of sex offenders where there have been a longterm studies following out. Here's the way it already works. He says, which he thinks is model. When a sex offender comes up for parole, someone at the corrections office will grab their record and ask a bunch of questions. What was the victim choice? Was it somebody they knew or was it somebody outside of their family? Was it a minor, specific to male or female? Was it somebody their age, what was the crime type, all these different questions. Then the evaluator will take some of the answers and give them points. Three zero to one that psychologist Amy Phoenix, she says, researchers develop this point system based on years of studies of criminal behavior, massive amounts of data and once you have all these points down, then you can add up a total score and that score is supposed to tell you is this guy likely to do it again or not?

Speaker 2:          00:36:03       And here's the bottom line. Amy says, if you were to ask a parole officer with decades of experience to just use their gut, no numbers, we call that unguided clinical judgment. If you were to ask them for their unguided, but expert clinical judgment, will Fred here recidivate or not? What's your prediction? According to studies, those experts are correct about 50% of the time, so you may as well flip a coin. On the other hand, she says if you have people just use the point system, no gut involved, the predictive accuracy would be about 70% wow. 70% no humans involved. Yeah. But here's the thing that sort of gives me pause. Like in order to get that accurate, you kind of have to turn people into data, you know? Yeah. To types. I know it seems like, Oh, where's the humanity in that? But, but the question we have to ask is, compared to what? So the way it currently goes, ugly people get much longer sentences than attractive people in courts. This is a well known bias from juries. Is that somehow better than having a scientifically informed legal system? Hmm. I have no response to that. Dammit. Well, Robert will.

Speaker 17:         00:37:22       Yes. It's okay that pretty people get better sentences than ugly people because I'm, I don't know, I'm going out in the limits of what happens when I can finish this in all go. But because what we're describing here is humans judging humans, not tables judging humans, not data judging humans, but humans judging humans. So you went through that with certain amount of humanness and maybe it's not very rational and maybe sometimes it's wrong headed or unfair, but if you take the judgment away from the humans and you give it to a table, then you invite a different set of problems, which is the chance for mercy, which is a very big part of justice is off the table because statistics don't have mercy. They just have statistics.

Speaker 2:          00:38:13       Amen. I'm Oh, nicely done. [inaudible] that. But let me say a couple of the question that, that is a beautiful question. And so the notion of we should be merciful and so of course that's all true, but the question is, are we good at it? Are we good at knowing who is the right person to be merciful with? It ends up usually being the attractive person, right? And the person who's ugly and is missing teeth were usually not as merciful for I wish this morning. Let me just throw in one more objection to this. Uh, I mean obviously as a point, I guess so, but this whole thing that he's advocating for and he's not the only one of throwing out blame, focusing instead on what someone might do. Is that a world you would want to really live in? Need a fair honey, that law professor, put it this way.

Speaker 2:          00:38:56       Imagine you do something small. So if I, you know, forge a check, minor offense and in the process of arresting me and convicting me, maybe the courts do a brain scan or they do that number crunching things quickly and they determine, actually she has a predilection for far more serious crimes than check forging. I mean, she hasn't done any of those things yet, but she could rob a bank, she could commit a violent crime. That's what the data shows. If all you're worried about is what she might do, then you can keep me in prison forever. Because what you've discovered is that I pose a real and future danger to society. I mean, you could basically convict someone of a crime that hasn't happened yet. Exactly. And not only that, if you think about this whole thing from a slightly higher altitude, according to Nita, when you blame somebody for something, there's a power to that act that goes beyond that one individual. There is value to society holding people morally accountable for wrongdoing. You're, you're upholding this code that is important to all of us. It's what we've lived by and clung to for thousands of years. Yeah, so you could argue that the act of assigning blame is sort of like reinforcing the scaffolding of society. It creates norms for people to follow. That makes perfect sense to me. Otherwise we would be,

Speaker 2:          00:40:16       well, it'd be like, I don't know what we'd be

Speaker 4:          00:40:22       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:40:22       so, hey, so you're coming out for the 10 commandments at the end of the day. Wait, wait, hold on. No. Shut that. Let's just say he went there and he can't take it back. Don't draft me onto that team.

Speaker 3:          00:40:36       This is truly a calling from Washington d C Radiolab is supported in part by the National Science Foundation and by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation, enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world.

Speaker 2:          00:41:00       Ah, three two, one. Hey, I'm Jabu run, I'm Robert Krulwich today on radio lab blame. All right. So tell me your name again. Bianca. Bianca. Yeah. And I'm a colony name. Thank you. Yeah. Okay, so this is taped. It was sent to us by a radio producer named Bianca Gavir. It's a time she was in college just starting out a bike and across the country. Yeah. We just got this grant to bicycle around this summer and talk to you. Yeah, it's called Davis projects for peace. Oh Great. And she was riding through this part of Tennessee and ended up on this farm type place where she met this guy. My name is

Speaker 18:         00:41:34       Hector black. I'm 86, almost 86 and a half. When you get as old as I am, you add the halfs again like you did when you were three.

Speaker 19:         00:41:45       And Hector ended up telling Bianca a story that in many ways turns everything we've learned in this hour on its head. Um, so yeah, where's, where would be the best parts place to start? I mean, I think the story starts when he decided to move to Atlanta because that's where Patricia was his daughter. Okay. He had fought in the war as a combat engineer, world war. I was not a good soldier. Went to Harvard, got a degree, met his wife Susie, and then

Speaker 18:         00:42:12       did join the civil rights work in the 60s, I think.

Speaker 19:         00:42:17       I think when Hector heard about the civil rights movement, he actually packed up his bags, moved to the neighborhood where Martin Luther King Live, rented a house and said, what can I do to help? I felt that I wouldn't really understand what was going on unless I lived there. And that's when he meets Patricia girl in the neighborhood who came over all the time, just like a lot of kids. But she stuck around longer than, than anyone else. And at 11 years old, she asked them, will you adopt me? Why you explaining? Did you adopt Patricia? What happened? How'd you [inaudible]

Speaker 18:         00:42:48       was an alcoholic. Sometimes she drank up the rent money and, and the kids were out on the street with their mom and dad. Mom, there was no dad. And, uh, so we took him in and she was very shy. She had impetigo sores on her legs in a nappy headed, no, your mama never braided her hair. She was just really a neglected child. And so she just blossomed.

Speaker 19:         00:43:11       She got into reading, sewing, painting. She'd make it all her own clothes. She's making bridal gowns as a second source of income. And then she went off to college. She came back and started teaching kids to read. She even took in a few kids, just like he had done, adopted a couple of kids. Yeah. To, she's a wonderful child. So unfortunately the whole story changes now in November of 2000 because that's when Patricia was murdered. I, even, Simpson is the name of the man who killed her. He'd broken into her house looking for money and he strangled her. And later the autopsy showed he sexually assaulted her too. At first, you know, a yellow kill, a bastard. No, I saw it kind of a monster. We do a thing like this and he said for almost a year he could not stop imagining what he had done to these visions.

Speaker 6:          00:44:10       They'd come down and me out of the blue just hit me.

Speaker 4:          00:44:14       Oh,

Speaker 6:          00:44:18       you do again?

Speaker 4:          00:44:20       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:44:21       And you said no control. It was like he had control over me pushing my face in the mud

Speaker 19:         00:44:28       after I haven't had confessed and this was right, the murder. Hector said part of him did want Ivan to get the death penalty.

Speaker 17:         00:44:34       Yeah, it was furious,

Speaker 19:         00:44:36       but then this other part of him was like, no, this is a test. This was a test of his principles, of his beliefs and so he decided he would not pursue the death penalty

Speaker 17:         00:44:49       it at the trial where he was sentenced, you refused to look at Ivan. Trisha's cousin got up first. She was just in tears and just said how much she hated him. I thought, oh Lord, I hear on going to go say something. It's probably going to hurt her feelings and when it came his turn, I had a written statement because I wasn't sure how steady my voice was going to be, but I was saying how much we love Patricia, how much he meant to us and how wounded we were by what had happened. And I said, I don't know if I've forgiven you Evan Simpson, but I don't hate you. I hate with all my soul. Look what you did to my daughter. And then you worked up the nerve to turn around to face him to say the last thing I had written to that is that I wish for all of us who have been so wounded by this crime, I wish that we may find God's peace and I wish that also for you Ivan Simpson. And he says when he looked up, tears are streaming down his cheeks. Then you know if the first time I, I looked into his eyes and it was like a soul inhale

Speaker 10:         00:46:06       [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         00:46:06       I was just undescribable looking

Speaker 19:         00:46:13       in the end, I haven't ended up getting life in prison without parole. What happens next was so surprising and troubling to us, frankly, that we sent Bianca and our producer Andy Mills to meet you back down to Tennessee to talk to Hector again. Okay, so it's the night after the trial. Hector is laying in bed

Speaker 17:         00:46:34       in the material. I couldn't sleep that night.

Speaker 19:         00:46:37       And you kept thinking about that moment in the courtroom.

Speaker 17:         00:46:41       I've never, I've never had it looked like that my whole life. Never before or since.

Speaker 19:         00:46:46       Over and over and over and finally he just gets up. He grabs a pen and paper and he starts writing.

Speaker 17:         00:46:55       Dear Ivan, Christopher Simpson, I am writing because I wanted you to know how I feel after the court hearing Monday when I turned around while I was reading my statement and looked at you, it was a very powerful moment for me when you raised your tear stain face to look at me. Ever since this happened, I've been trying to find something good in all the horror and pain I have tried to be a better person

Speaker 19:         00:47:21       and then he writes this line maybe as a way to push himself to be that better person, but he writes, I forgive you for what you did

Speaker 17:         00:47:30       to our beloved daughter. I don't know if this will be of any comfort to you, but I wanted to tell you, we will both have to live our lives with the pain of this dude always there. Patricia tried to make the world a better place. We should also try

Speaker 4:          00:47:53       [inaudible].

Speaker 19:         00:47:53       Did you think he would write you back after that? I didn't know, but about four weeks later a letter shows up.

Speaker 17:         00:48:02       Yeah. This is it. Dear Mr Hector, black and family. I first want to say, God bless you all in all things. Second, I have to go straight to the point. I know God has forgiven me. You have forgiven me, but I can't forgive myself. Not yet. Anyway. I have so much anger at myself right now. It's unbelievable. This hardness I have against my, I will always be remorseful. I used to hear God speak to me all the time, but I guess after what I did, he took away his touch from me. Right. No, I miss his voice. I don't know the level of love Miss Patricia had, but if it's anything like your example of it, it is great. God comfort you all in everything. Few free to us. Me, anything you like, if I can, I will try to answer it.

Speaker 4:          00:49:11       [inaudible]

Speaker 18:         00:49:11       dear Ivan, I was very glad to have your letter. I think it is important that we be as honest as possible with one another, and so I have to tell you that it is hard for me to write to you. I wanted to know who he was. I would really like to hear about your life, about the people who loved you, the people who hurt you, because I wanted to knew what had happened to him that could make it possible for me to do with any length is

Speaker 4:          00:49:40       [inaudible].

Speaker 18:         00:49:40       Ivan writes, Dear Hector, I was adopted when I was two days old as Muslim schizophrenia. This is Simpson. The one I call mom now took me in. He was raised by his grandmother's sister. She's 82 now. I used to have to stay over there with my natural mom while Marie, my mom. No had to work. Very natural. Mom used to beat me. Blurt out. I'm glad I got rid of you. When he was a little boy, maybe about 11 or so, she took him and his younger brother and his little sister to a swimming pool, and you tried to drone all three. One sister died.

Speaker 17:         00:50:20       He stood there. She drowned his little sister in front of him,

Speaker 19:         00:50:24       just the most horrible stuff. And so we asked him, having heard all this from Ivan, did he still blame Ivan or did he blame his mom or society or something else?

Speaker 18:         00:50:35       Well, I do blame him. I mean, he made the choices. He made the choices. There's no doubt about that.

Speaker 19:         00:50:43       But he says, knowing this also made him wanna write back

Speaker 18:         00:50:47       [inaudible] dear Ivan, Ivan, about his life. I grew up in New York City, his family, two brothers. My parents argued and fought a lot. Basically it's whole life story. I've always loved working with plants. And after we left to find the city and move back to the country, and I wrote back, dear Hector, I was raised in the church, but after starting drugs and alcohol, I changed to responded. Dear Ivan, I don't think God has abandoned you dear Hector. You're the only one writing to me. No, we exchanged many, many letters

Speaker 19:         00:51:24       and at some point in this back and forth, this almost incomprehensible thing happens. Dear Hector, their letters,

Speaker 18:         00:51:33       first of all, thank you for the pictures. I never knew. Plum trees blossom. Really just become casual. My favorite bloom is the waterlily blossom. They talk about flowers. It's beautiful things. They'd I even, thanks for your letters. I've been closing a story someone said to be because I thought you would enjoy it. Do you Hector? Just the most mundane details of their day. Just sitting around this Saturday evening been singing him as to myself. Basically they became friends. You knew Hector. You're right. I do sense a bone developing unusual because of the circumstances pitch. Just not at all what I expected to happen, you know, and it's just so absolutely crazy.

Speaker 4:          00:52:25       Yeah,

Speaker 18:         00:52:25       you're actually,

Speaker 4:          00:52:31       gosh [inaudible]

Speaker 18:         00:52:36       it. We, we, we started to send him Christmas packages and we see this box on the floor and I'd say to myself, are you crazy old man? You're Sidney Christmas packages for the man who murdered your daughter. What the Hell is [inaudible] with you? Just so cross. So totally out of that goes out of orbit or something and I guess I was, because people don't do that. Maybe I'm trying to exact meaning from it. I don't know because I struggled so hard with why I actually,

Speaker 19:         00:53:26       after years of writing letters, Hector decided to ask that why question and its most essential form what happened that night.

Speaker 20:         00:53:38       This one, this one. I just want you to know if you don't want to read this. Oh yeah, we don't. We don't want to make you read this if you, if you're not, if you're not ready. I don't think it's, this might be a good time to say that. This next part is disturbing.

Speaker 19:         00:53:51       If you have kids or you're just not in the mood, now's a good time to duck out for a few minutes.

Speaker 18:         00:53:56       Dear Hector, I wasn't going to tell you. Oh what happened until you asked. I'm also glad you're relieving me of details. Also. God bless you. I went into the house around 7:30 PM I'm used to breaking into place in the past, so I figured the house was total dark. Soil broke out a whole window and climbed in. I took the VCR and TV and clock. I figured that was enough. Went and got $80 worth of drugs or the heavy users. So it went in about one hour.

Speaker 19:         00:54:34       So he made his way back to Trisha's house.

Speaker 18:         00:54:37       It was still dark. So I went back in,

Speaker 19:         00:54:39       he found his way into the bedroom,

Speaker 18:         00:54:41       so a computer in Stereo. So I said I take it and that should last for the night. But I got trapped when I saw a car, so I hid until I could get back out the way I came. So I saw a lady walk to the room. I tried to be quiet so I could escape. When she opened the door to a closet, I was hiding. As she stepped back, she fell. I told her I was going to tie her up so it would have time to get away. She said, okay sir. Her glasses fell off and in no time she saw my face. So I told her I was going to take the car so I could load it up. She gave me the keys, so I told her after I found out her name, I said, Patricia, I know you're scared but I will be out of here in about 15 minutes. Then she said, you should get help with your drug problem. I told her I tried in the past, but I restarted or glad. Yeah, that's, that's Trish. She had no compunctions about telling people when they were in the room and then I said, I'm sorry for this. I'm going to leave your car in the shopping center up the street next to the Chinese restaurant because all I need the car for was to transport the items I had

Speaker 19:         00:56:02       and even though Trish was tied up around her hands, she went to the kitchen and warmed up some chicken and rolls for Ivan.

Speaker 18:         00:56:09       Then I said, I'm sorry, and I left again. I got rid of the things, got about $200 well a hundred dollars drugs and $100 cash. Then I said, well, I just the car at the end of the driveway. Then I couldn't wait. I pulled over and smoked some of the crack cocaine

Speaker 19:         00:56:29       and at this point he's really high and he explained that when he gets this high, he's sometimes here's a male voice in his head and as he was walking away, the voice said to him,

Speaker 18:         00:56:39       he said, well, go get you some sex. I told him, leave me alone, but next thing I know I'm walking back to her house. No police had come.

Speaker 19:         00:56:51       He burst through the door, ran to where Patricia was tied up and said,

Speaker 18:         00:56:54       did you have any money? Cash? She said, look in my purse.

Speaker 19:         00:56:58       And then Ivan said that the voice in his head became his own voice and he said to her,

Speaker 18:         00:57:04       I want some sex. She said, sure, you've been so nice. Why don't do that?

Speaker 4:          00:57:12       Yeah.

Speaker 18:         00:57:12       D said, only way you going to do this if I'm dead.

Speaker 4:          00:57:17       [inaudible]

Speaker 18:         00:57:17       okay then and it happened.

Speaker 19:         00:57:24       He strangled her, sexually assaulted her, then he ran away.

Speaker 18:         00:57:29       Sure. Around 2:00 AM I ran out of drugs.

Speaker 19:         00:57:32       You said that after he finished getting high, he started to wonder if he had dreamt it all up. So he made one last trip back to Patricia's house.

Speaker 18:         00:57:40       So I looked up at the house, no police, engaged to Lope and so now peeps through the door, she was still laying there. So I said Patricia, Patricia,

Speaker 19:         00:57:50       and then the voice in his head told him to go back in one more time. He sexually assaulted her.

Speaker 18:         00:57:55       I couldn't believe what happened. So when to my mom has adopted mother and I said, Mama, it's something wrong. Moma, something wrong. She said, child, tell me what you're talking about. I couldn't tell her

Speaker 4:          00:58:17       [inaudible]

Speaker 18:         00:58:18       I was really hoping they would kill me in the electric chair because I could, I shouldn't be able to live with myself and God after what I had done. I just don't know why I had to do it. Was it because of the items in the money? No. Getting caught later on in life. No control or power? No car? No. Because she saw my face. No, she didn't see me at no time. Fingerprints left on something. No, I just don't understand why I did it.

Speaker 4:          00:58:59       [inaudible]

Speaker 18:         00:59:00       well, I feel the pressure has left me for telling you first what happened. My mom doesn't even know. I've been keeping all this inside and it hurts. So I'm truly sorrowful for what happened. May God bless you all sincerely. Ivan

Speaker 4:          00:59:24       did it, did it help in any way to know? Yes,

Speaker 17:         00:59:31       cause I mean I that sounded exactly like Trish, but she was, she was to really the fearless, I mean a machine. Mr Burrito, I can't imagine what a horrible,

Speaker 4:          00:59:49       Oh God, I was just amazed that

Speaker 17:         00:59:57       she could be so strong just to be raised because when you love somebody very much, you want to know about their last hours

Speaker 4:          01:00:09       and uh,

Speaker 17:         01:00:12       he, he just, yeah, he just wrote it in a way that I found very kind. I mean if you go kind is a weird word to put there.

Speaker 21:         01:00:32       [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         01:00:33       but that's the word he chose.

Speaker 21:         01:00:37       Hello

Speaker 11:         01:00:37       kind

Speaker 21:         01:00:47       [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         01:00:48       after that letter, they still right? Yeah, they still write, they've been writing for 10 years now and Hector has folders and stacks of these papers in his basement. So only room in his house that he keeps locked.

Speaker 21:         01:01:11       [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         01:01:11       pretty sure Bianca gave her thanks also to our own Andy Mills. Thanks to you for listening.
