00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.060
Last time I left you with a cliffhanger,
right?

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.850
So we better try to resolve that,
the two envelope problem.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.590
So, I'll remind you what the problem is,
it's very simple to state, but not so

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.190
easy to resolve.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.938
So the problem is just, we have two
envelopes, envelope one, envelope two.

00:00:19.938 --> 00:00:28.072
They look identical, and suppose they are
X dollars in here and Y dollars in here.

00:00:28.072 --> 00:00:30.172
And you don't know anything
at all about X and

00:00:30.172 --> 00:00:33.200
Y, just they're random
variables right now.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.642
And all you know is that one envelope
has twice as much money as the other.

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:44.750
So they each have a check for
some amount of money.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.080
And one is double the other.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.640
But you have no information other than
that, twice as much as the other, okay.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.570
So the argument last time was,
Let's say you get to pick one.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.140
So let's say you pick this one,
and this one's X.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.920
And you don't know what
X is unless you open it.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.430
But you do know,
the other one is either 2X or X over 2.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.073
And if you average 2X and X over 2,
you get a number bigger than X,

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:15.710
which suggests that this one is better.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.150
But you could reply the same
argument to this one.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.369
This one's a Y,
the other one's 2Y or one-half Y.

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.290
If you average 2Y and one-half Y,
you get a number bigger than Y.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.460
So, all right.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.945
So, let's actually write that out
kinda formally as an argument.

00:01:28.945 --> 00:01:31.698
So, based on the other two
competing arguments here.

00:01:31.698 --> 00:01:38.059
Argument one, Is

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:43.603
simply that E(Y) = E(X) by symmetry.

00:01:48.248 --> 00:01:52.348
So, if you were given some
piece of information that

00:01:52.348 --> 00:01:57.301
the person who put the money in
the envelopes is left-handed.

00:01:57.301 --> 00:02:00.786
And left-handed people subconsciously
wanna put more money on the left, or

00:02:00.786 --> 00:02:03.902
something like that, then you'd
have an asymmetry in the problem.

00:02:03.902 --> 00:02:08.720
But there was no asymmetry given, that
the way it was stated is just there's no

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.100
difference that the left envelope
should have more or the right one, so

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.150
it's a symmetrical situation.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.610
It's kind of hard to argue
against symmetry here, right?

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.020
There is no asymmetry in
the statement of the problem, so

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.080
if somehow the envelope on the left were
better, where would that have come from?

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.236
It doesn't make sense, okay?

00:02:28.236 --> 00:02:30.950
So that's a pretty strong argument.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.970
But let's look at argument 2,
which also seems pretty strong.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.420
Argument 2 is the condition.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.080
Say how do we compute expectation?

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.120
Just like when we had a probability,
we didn't know.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.616
We want a condition on
the thing we wish that we knew.

00:02:49.616 --> 00:02:53.412
And so this is just the law of total
probability except the expectation

00:02:53.412 --> 00:02:54.330
version.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.630
We're gonna condition on whether,

00:03:00.604 --> 00:03:04.950
You know either Y = 2x or Y = one-half X.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.900
So we could just write it this way.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:14.114
E(Y|Y=2x) P(Y=2x) + E(Y|Y=
one-half X)P(Y= one-half X).

00:03:14.114 --> 00:03:22.802
So I mean that's just a fact about
expectation that you condition.

00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:27.858
And the proof of this is basically just

00:03:27.858 --> 00:03:35.400
use the law of total probability,
and that's true.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.420
So it's hard to argue with that.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.960
Let's compute this.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:48.750
So the argument goes, E(Y|Y=2x),
well, then we know Y = 2x.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.444
So we're just gonna replace
that with E(2x) by symmetry.

00:03:53.444 --> 00:03:58.040
It's equally likely that Y = 2x and
Y = one-half X, so that's just one-half.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.244
Plus, in this case, Y is X over 2,
so we're gonna get E of X over 2,

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:08.875
Probability, or that's one-half again.

00:04:08.875 --> 00:04:12.812
And if you simply this,
you can take out the 2,

00:04:12.812 --> 00:04:18.376
take out the one-half,
simplify you get five-fourths E(x).

00:04:18.376 --> 00:04:22.230
All right, so
then the question is how to resolve this?

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.490
Well, first of all,

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.170
is there any case in which both of
these statements could be true?

00:04:31.141 --> 00:04:32.451
Someone said 0.

00:04:32.451 --> 00:04:37.950
Well, kinda, yeah, both envelopes have $0,
then that would be okay.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.930
Now, so let's assume there is a positive,
nonzero amount of money in both envelopes.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.779
Are there any other case?

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:52.917
Infinity, well, infinity equals infinity,

00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:56.746
infinity equals five-fourths infinity.

00:04:56.746 --> 00:04:59.830
So one way out out it,
could we just say, well, on average,

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.640
there's an infinite amount of money,
and then you're pretty happy, right?

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.353
But there are not many kinda like
the Saint Petersburg paradox,

00:05:08.353 --> 00:05:10.633
where the expected value is infinity.

00:05:10.633 --> 00:05:15.079
But there are not many real world
scenarios that you could think of,

00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:21.040
probably, where your expected value of
how much you'll make is infinity dollars.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.790
So let's assume that these
numbers are not 0 or infinity.

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.390
In that case,
this is just a direct contradiction,

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.500
meaning that one of these
two things must be wrong.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:39.530
Well, symmetry, I can't find any way
to argue against the symmetry here.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.700
So, this has to be right.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.790
Symmetry takes precedence.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.919
So let's try to see what's
wrong with argument two.

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:53.835
Well, actually,
this is one of the most common and

00:05:53.835 --> 00:05:58.928
troublesome mistakes with conditioning is

00:05:58.928 --> 00:06:06.238
to kind of like use the information,
and then forget about it.

00:06:06.238 --> 00:06:11.944
Look at what we did here,
we plugged in the information Y=2x,

00:06:11.944 --> 00:06:15.020
but then the condition went away.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.830
What's the justification for that?

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:26.180
There is none, it just looked good to
say that, but there's no justification.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:32.164
So, actually this step is wrong.

00:06:32.164 --> 00:06:34.390
So, actually it's not equal.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.930
What we should have written was,
it's perfectly valid to plug in the 2x.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.230
Let's write the corrected version.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.711
It's perfectly valid to plug in 2x, but

00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:48.604
that doesn't mean we can
forget that we know Y=2x.

00:06:48.604 --> 00:06:51.056
So, it's 2x given Y= 2x.

00:06:51.056 --> 00:06:55.272
And similarly over here,
we can plug in the information, but

00:06:55.272 --> 00:06:59.180
it doesn't mean we're not
conditioning on it anymore.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.330
So, we can do that.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:10.170
But we still have to then evaluate
this conditional expectation.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:15.028
We can't just say that we can
forget this information here.

00:07:15.028 --> 00:07:17.030
In fact, there's no more justification for

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.520
forgetting this information here,
then there would be up here.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.950
You just can't say that.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:28.308
So actually what we just showed is that

00:07:28.308 --> 00:07:37.653
essentially, E(X|Y=2x),

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:46.950
Is not equal to E of,
let's do it this way,

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:53.490
E(Y|Y=2x) is not equal to E(2x).

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.340
So what's going on there is I
like to think of this in terms of

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.710
indicator random variables.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:03.225
So let's just let I be
the indicator random variable.

00:08:03.225 --> 00:08:08.601
I is the indicator of which envelope has
more money, so we could say I is one,

00:08:08.601 --> 00:08:14.313
if y equals 2x, and zero otherwise, or
we could define it the other way around.

00:08:15.614 --> 00:08:19.556
That's the event that says that the
envelope on the right has twice as much

00:08:19.556 --> 00:08:21.500
money as the one on the left, okay.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.560
So we have an indicator for that.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:32.760
Then, essentially what we just showed
is that X and I are dependent.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:37.090
We can either talk about X and
I or talk about Y and I.

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:40.510
They're dependent, and
that seems surprising at first.

00:08:43.195 --> 00:08:48.060
So let's think about what that means.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:54.798
It says that if you got to observe X, then
somehow that gives information about I.

00:08:54.798 --> 00:08:57.799
So now we get to think
of more about the case,

00:08:57.799 --> 00:09:02.280
what happens if you actually get
to open the envelope on the left?

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.450
Okay, and you see $100 there.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:09.238
So you know the other one is 50 or
200, but the question is whether that

00:09:09.238 --> 00:09:14.190
changes your probabilities for I,
that is, is the other one 200 or 50?

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.200
Is saying it's not 50,50 anymore.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.200
Which seems a little strange because

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.650
you're not given any information
kind of the scale of the problem.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:29.200
So let's say you open envelope on the left
and there's a trillion dollars there.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:34.010
Well probably you're really happy,
but is a trillion a big number,

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.870
or a small number?

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:41.290
Well it's a lot of money, but in the grand
scheme of things, compared to the entire

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:46.560
real line, from zero to infinity,
a trillion is miniscule, right?

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.440
A trillion is nothing compared to other
numbers I could name if I wanted.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.800
So when you see that trillion dollars,

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:56.920
does that give you information that
makes you think that the other one is

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.690
probably only half a trillion
cuz a trillion is big?

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:02.590
What's a trillion, right?

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:08.700
It's nothing compared 2 to the 2 to
the 2 to the trillion to the trillion or

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.000
something like that.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.610
But if you would observe that
then that's nothing compared to

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:13.800
other numbers I could name.

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:18.450
So it seems surprising that they're
dependent, but essentially we just proved

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:22.910
that they have to be dependent if
the expected values are finite.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:28.410
And there's a strategic practice
that's related to this too,

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:32.790
which says that, you can look up
the problem if you haven't already.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:36.530
But just to tell you what the result of
that problem is, which is also surprising.

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.120
It also is a two envelope problem,
but in that problem

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.570
it just assumes that there's two amounts
of money, two positive amounts of money.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.600
It's not assumed that
one is double the other.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:49.200
And the problem is to come up with
a strategy guaranteed to give you

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.340
better than a 50% chance of getting
the envelope with more money.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.560
You get to observe one and
then you choose whether to switch.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:02.390
You can guarantee that your probability of
success is strictly greater than one half.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.396
Which again, at first sounds impossible.

00:11:04.396 --> 00:11:08.940
Because if it's a trillion dollars,
should you switch or not?

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:13.140
But it says in a certain
sense that actually you can.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:18.160
You can make a measure of is a trillion
a big number or a small number.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:23.810
And the strategy is in that problem,
is to generate your own random threshold.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.500
That is generate some value t,

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.640
let's say from an exponential
distribution, but it doesn't have to be.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.050
You can pick some other distribution.

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:33.390
You generate your own threshold value and

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.900
then you say you're happy if you got more
then t and unhappy if you get less then t,

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.490
and that gives you better
then a 50% chance of success.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.510
All right, so anyway,
that's the two envelope problem.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:49.000
There's many, many different articles and
debates about this.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.036
And some people try to take Bayesian
approaches to resolving this and so on.

00:11:53.036 --> 00:11:55.479
But I think that's fairly unnecessary,

00:11:55.479 --> 00:11:58.075
I think the key blunder
is just in this step.

00:11:58.075 --> 00:12:01.058
And this is kind of a strange problem, but

00:12:01.058 --> 00:12:05.080
this mistake comes up in a lot
of other contexts as well.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.250
So it's worth thinking carefully about.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.040
We plugged in the information, but

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.620
that doesn't mean we can then
get rid of the information.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.640
The only time when we can get rid
of the stuff we're conditioning on

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.460
is when we know we have independence.

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:22.440
And here there was no justification for
independence and in fact, X and I, or

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.140
Y and I can't be independent.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:26.457
Which is not obvious.

00:12:26.457 --> 00:12:28.655
It's not obvious that
they're not independent, but

00:12:28.655 --> 00:12:31.870
on the other hand you can't just say
they're independent without proving it.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:35.400
And if you try to prove it you'll find
they actually are not independent here.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.350
So that's what's going
on with that problem.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:45.680
All right, so let's do another
example of conditional expectation.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.400
The coin flipping problem.

00:12:55.998 --> 00:12:59.270
So I'll call this one,
Patterns in coin flips.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.010
Okay, so assume we have a fair coin,
all right?

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:10.530
You have a related homework problem where,
where the coin may be biased.

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.400
But right now,
we're assuming we have a fair coin and

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.020
we do a repeated fair coin flips.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.190
And we're waiting for
a certain pattern, okay?

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:31.580
So we're gonna wait until or
we want to know how long?

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:36.740
How many flips until we observe
the pattern heads followed by tails?

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.341
So I'lll just call that HT.

00:13:46.776 --> 00:13:49.819
That is keep flipping the coin and
eventually,

00:13:49.819 --> 00:13:54.180
you will observe heads immediately
followed by tails, right?

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.560
That particular pattern
will eventually show up.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:03.580
You wanna know how many flips does that
take, including the H and the T there.

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.360
Okay, that's a natural
question we could ask.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.760
Similarly we could ask
how many flips until HH?

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.770
That is,

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:15.150
how long do you have to flip a coin until
the coin lands heads twice in a row.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:20.630
Okay, so let's find the average.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:29.250
So let's say, let's call that,
I'll just call it WHT and WHH.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.180
But WHT I just mean the random
variable representing

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.480
how many flips does it, you know.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.920
Imagine this long sequence
of coin flips and

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:43.720
how far into the sequence do you have to
get until you see HT for the first time.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:47.870
How far until you see HH for the first
time, those are both random variables.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:49.910
But right now we're talking
about expectation, so

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:52.600
the question is to find the average.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:59.730
So our problem is to find the expected
values of these two waiting time.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.610
I'm using W for waiting time.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:06.040
Expected value, how long you have
to wait for these patterns, okay?

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:12.970
Well, so we'll solve both of these, but
before I actually solve them, let's try

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:19.150
to think more qualitatively about whether
there's an inequality or equality here.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:24.080
Okay, so we know there's only three
possibilities, either this number is

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:31.160
bigger than this number or it's equal,
or this is less than this, okay?

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.660
So why don't you take a few seconds to
think intuitively about whether you think

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.800
they're equal or one is bigger and
if so which one is bigger.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.570
Then we'll vote.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:40.890
Then we'll see, okay.

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:45.789
So there's three possibilities, right?

00:15:45.789 --> 00:15:48.140
Think about which one you think is true.

00:15:53.637 --> 00:15:58.840
Okay, so how many of you think
that this is greater than this?

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:02.980
Raise your hand if you think
this is greater than this.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:06.030
Okay, and
how many of you think this equals this?

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.760
Okay, and how many of you think
this is greater than this?

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:17.620
Okay, so the dominant answer is equality,
and it's roughly equal numbers,

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:22.190
saying this is greater than this or
that this is greater than this.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.690
Okay, well the answer
is this one equals 4.

00:16:29.063 --> 00:16:34.764
And this one equals 6, 50% bigger.

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:43.500
But you might say, well, by symmetry
don't they have to do the same thing?

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.320
That would be a false use of symmetry.

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:51.860
Symmetry would tell us that,
if we would ask the same question.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:56.030
Let's do a little symmetry
argument over here.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:17:02.840
Symmetry would say expect the value
of WTT equals expected value of WHH.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.135
That has to be true by symmetry.

00:17:05.135 --> 00:17:09.385
Because, the coin, it says heads on one
side, tails on the other, but you could

00:17:09.385 --> 00:17:13.906
have, like relabeled it, the same problem
again, just with a different labeling.

00:17:13.906 --> 00:17:16.890
So that's symmetry,
that I'm interchanging heads and tails.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:22.433
Similarly, we know that E
of WHT equals E of WTH,

00:17:26.919 --> 00:17:30.310
But this, neither of these
tells us that these are equal.

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:31.720
It doesn't tell us that they're not equal.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.710
It just you can't just say by symmetry.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:36.130
Because you have to swap heads and
tails everywhere,

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:37.490
and those are different things.

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.000
All right, so let's do the calculation.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.800
Then I'll talk a little more
about the intuition for

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.780
why is this bigger than this?

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.520
But let's just calculate it first.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:53.274
Okay, so first

00:17:53.274 --> 00:17:58.231
let's do E of WHT.

00:18:00.495 --> 00:18:01.968
So a nice way to think about it,

00:18:01.968 --> 00:18:05.130
we don't actually need
a conditional expectation for this.

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:10.960
A nice way to think about this problem
it is just imagine a sequence of tosses.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.380
Maybe it starts out tails,
tails, tails, tails.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:18.930
Eventually the coin will land heads,
right?

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:24.380
Now once this has happened you can see
we've made partial progress, right?

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:28.800
Because now, well if the next
flip is tails, then we're done.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.660
But if not, that's okay.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:34.230
Heads, Heads, Heads,
eventually it'll be Tails.

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:38.650
So then we're done, right, then we got it.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:43.450
So just drawing, a few examples like that,
make up your own little sequences to

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:47.870
make it concrete then you'll see
what's going on here, which is that

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:53.970
all we have to do is wait for
the first time the coin lands heads.

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:55.986
Let's call that W1.

00:18:55.986 --> 00:18:58.076
That could be the first flip, but

00:18:58.076 --> 00:19:02.300
it could be however long it
takes to til the first head.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.343
And then, after that point.

00:19:07.309 --> 00:19:10.120
How long do you have to wait
additionally for the first tails?

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.610
Let's call that W2.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:15.456
So matter what happens, I can always
split it up between a W1 and a W2, right?

00:19:15.456 --> 00:19:22.768
Time to the first heads, time to the first
tails after the first heads, right?

00:19:22.768 --> 00:19:29.460
Well, okay, those are independent of each
other, because the coin is memory less.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.990
But even if they were not independent,
we could still apply linearity and

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:36.960
just say this is E of W1, plus E of W2,

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:42.000
equals 2 plus 2 equals 4.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.570
Since the W is basically a geometric
the only thing we have to be careful

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:50.190
about is that we define the geometric
to not include the success.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:53.806
So actually W j -1 with our
convention is gemoetric 1/2.

00:19:55.266 --> 00:19:59.685
Right, it's just a waiting time for
success and where here we're defining

00:19:59.685 --> 00:20:04.158
success to be this heads and here
we're defining to be this tails, okay?

00:20:04.158 --> 00:20:08.830
So geometric 1/2, this has expected
value of 1, 1 plus 1 is 2.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:11.978
So each of this, an average will
take two flips to get to this stage,

00:20:11.978 --> 00:20:14.926
two more flips to get to this stage,
2 plus 2 is 4 linearity.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:23.343
[COUGH] Okay so,
Let's try to do the same thing with heads,

00:20:23.343 --> 00:20:27.570
heads and see why that doesn't
give us the same thing there.

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:35.830
All right, so
now we're gonna do E of (WHH) and

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:41.840
again it just really helps for
concreteness draw some little examples.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:45.590
So, again, maybe the sequence
starts out Tails three times,

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:50.790
four times, like here,
eventually the coin lands heads.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:55.740
Now at this point, so we could still call
that W1 if we want, but at this point

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.160
either of two things can happen, either
the next flip is heads then we're done,

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:08.740
we got it, but if the next toss is tails,
we have no partial progress anymore.

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:14.510
That means that in this scenario
these tosses were all wasted, right.

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:17.586
They do nothing for
us then the thing just restarts.

00:21:17.586 --> 00:21:22.150
Al right, I mean it took six tosses to get
to this point, but we're starting again

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:25.349
with exact same problem we had,
right, no partial progress.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.810
In this case we have partial progress.

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:32.700
Because once you get this heads for
the first time,

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:37.940
then you're halfway there essentially,
right?

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.380
That, that's the key distinction.

00:21:40.448 --> 00:21:45.150
All right, so here we have to be more
careful because in this case all these

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:47.350
tosses are gone and
we just start over again.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:51.358
Okay, so now we're gonna use conditional
expectation to compute this.

00:21:51.358 --> 00:21:54.580
So it's kinda like gamblers
ruin type of thing where we

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.410
condition on the first toss.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:04.195
So this is E of WHH given, you can
make up some notation if you want it,

00:22:04.195 --> 00:22:06.380
but I'll just write it.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:11.407
First toss is heads times 1/2 + that's

00:22:11.407 --> 00:22:16.854
the probability that
the first toss is heads,

00:22:16.854 --> 00:22:24.550
plus expected value WHH given
first toss his tails times 1/2.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.340
Just conditioning on the two cases that
this first toss is either heads or tails.

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:35.290
And now let's expand it out further.

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:39.400
This one we need some space for probably.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:45.330
This one the second term is
actually easier here, okay?

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:48.313
So I wanna compute this thing

00:22:50.898 --> 00:22:55.810
I want the expected value WHH given
that the first toss is tails, okay?

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.650
Then the first toss is tails,
what is that say?

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:06.070
It says the first toss is tails,
that cost us one toss.

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:08.890
Tossed the coin once,
the coin was tails, okay?

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:12.840
Then it's the same problem again, right?

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:13.750
Exact same problem.

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:17.360
So that's just E of WHH again.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.950
We're gonna try to solve for
it in terms of itself.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.430
Which sounds circular but
then we have an equation.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:25.891
We can just solve that equation for
E of WHH, okay?

00:23:25.891 --> 00:23:31.690
So that was the first toss, was a waste
and then it's the same problem again.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:37.790
Now for this first term,
first toss is heads.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:42.490
We have to further subdivide it into
two cases based on the second toss.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:46.200
So here we're when we're doing this
conditional expectation it means we're

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:50.940
working within the world where we
now know the first toss is heads.

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:52.470
That's the information we have.

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:56.140
Now we look at the second toss.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:59.740
If the second toss is also heads, then
that means the first two tosses were H,

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.720
H and then we're done and
it only took two flips.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:03.945
And that has probability 1/2.

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:10.730
But, with probability
one-half within this case,

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:13.620
the second toss is tails.

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:18.800
In that case, the sequence started out HT,
which does nothing for us, right?

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:23.009
That means it's a waste of two tosses and
then it's the same problem again.

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:31.590
Right, two tosses from heads tails and
its the same problem.

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:34.781
It resets again at the same problem.

00:24:34.781 --> 00:24:40.198
All right, so now, we have an equation for
E(WHH) in terms of itself.

00:24:40.198 --> 00:24:46.523
So just multiply the 2 times 1/2 is 1 and
move things around,

00:24:46.523 --> 00:24:51.009
and you'll get that
the expected value is 6.

00:24:54.190 --> 00:25:00.150
But you can also check just
by plugging in 6 here.

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:06.210
This is five-halves plus
seven-halves is twelve-halves, is 6.

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:07.341
So that works.

00:25:07.341 --> 00:25:10.593
All right, so okay, so
that seems a little strange.

00:25:10.593 --> 00:25:14.927
And to kind of explain a little
bit of the intuition here,

00:25:14.927 --> 00:25:19.624
let's imagine drawing like a long
sequence of coin tosses and

00:25:19.624 --> 00:25:24.254
look at where did the HHs appear and
where did the HTs appear?

00:25:24.254 --> 00:25:29.214
So maybe it looks like TTHHHT, blah,

00:25:29.214 --> 00:25:34.804
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:25:34.804 --> 00:25:40.591
And then somewhere later on there's an
HHHTT, you can make up your own sequence.

00:25:40.591 --> 00:25:45.393
I'm just gonna try to illustrate
kinda what's the big picture of

00:25:45.393 --> 00:25:47.210
why this is true.

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:52.070
In other words, the question I guess is
why doesn't this contradict the fact that,

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:54.350
since it's a fair coin,

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:58.570
if we flip the coin twice, then all
four possibilities are equally likely.

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:03.705
So if I'm only looking at two particular
positions, let's say here and

00:26:03.705 --> 00:26:08.351
here, it's equally likely that this
will be HH as for it to be HT.

00:26:08.351 --> 00:26:09.911
Those are both one-fourth, okay,

00:26:09.911 --> 00:26:13.147
so I think that's where the intuition
comes from that it should be the same.

00:26:13.147 --> 00:26:15.840
When you look at any two positions,
it's equally likely.

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:19.260
But we're not just
looking at two positions.

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.260
We're looking at the entire sequence.

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:25.490
And what happens is that what the HH is,

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:29.960
sometimes you'll get three heads in a row,
sometimes you'll get five heads in a row.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:34.180
If you have three in a row,
then that means there's an HH there and

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.610
an HH there, they're nested.

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:40.030
So if we have five Hs in a row,
which will happen

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:44.160
more often than most people would expect,
cuz coincidences happen a lot.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.980
And look at all these HHs
with those five in a row.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:51.779
Try to do the same thing with HT.

00:26:51.779 --> 00:26:53.500
You can't, right?

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.690
It doesn't nest inside
itself in the same way.

00:26:56.690 --> 00:27:02.120
So that means that when you get the HHs,
they're kind of clumped together.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.290
But on the other hand,

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:07.340
you have the same expected total
number of appearances of that.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:10.440
So since the HHs are more clumped,
they appear in clumps,

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.840
those clumps must be further apart.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:13.970
That's what's going on.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:22.290
Okay, and if you think this is just
kind of a curiosity of coin flipping,

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:26.700
this kind of problem actually has
important applications in genetics.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.750
In genetics, we will not be looking
at sequences of heads and tails.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:33.518
But we'll look at a DNA sequence which
is the sequence that's drawn from

00:27:33.518 --> 00:27:34.584
the alphabet ACTG.

00:27:34.584 --> 00:27:37.286
And a lot of times,
in genetics these days,

00:27:37.286 --> 00:27:42.033
you won't necessarily study certain
patterns, right, they call motifs,

00:27:42.033 --> 00:27:47.220
where the pattern appear in the DNA
sequence and you get similar problems.

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:52.493
And, while I'm mentioning this,
I'll recommend a TED Talk,

00:27:52.493 --> 00:27:57.193
Peter Donnelly is a statistician
who works on genetics.

00:27:57.193 --> 00:28:00.710
And I don't know if you've
seen any of the TED Talks.

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:04.440
But if you go to ted.com and
look for Peter Donnelly's talk,

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:08.748
he mentions some interesting courtroom
examples, and statistics and

00:28:08.748 --> 00:28:10.703
probability in the courtroom.

00:28:10.703 --> 00:28:14.510
And he also talked about
an example similar to this.

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:15.610
It's quite a nice talk.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:23.400
Okay, so, that's the waiting for
certain sequences.

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:26.760
You can extend this in various directions.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:31.325
This was already a fair amount of work,
not too bad.

00:28:31.325 --> 00:28:34.613
You could also ask more
complicated questions,

00:28:34.613 --> 00:28:37.670
like longer sequences and
things like that.

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:41.750
And there are a lot of other
methods that can be used for

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:43.270
more complicated sequences.

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:46.560
But that basic method
is just conditioning.

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.560
So you can see that
conditional expectation,

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.540
just like in the Gambler's Ruin, let us
simplify kind of this complicated problem,

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:57.190
break it up into simpler pieces,
by conditioning on the first two.

00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:59.970
Essentially, what we did was to
condition on the first two tosses.

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:02.840
Another way to do that, but
I sort of did it in two steps.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.510
We could have also done this just by,
at the very beginning,

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:09.190
breaking it up into four cases,
based on the first two tosses.

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:16.533
That might have been even easier, but
anyway, I did the two-two step way, okay?

00:29:16.533 --> 00:29:20.110
So that's the basic idea
of conditional expectation.

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:25.580
And I guess to just state
it a little bit more,

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:29.170
some of the general properties
of conditional expectation,

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:33.270
and would be useful.

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:40.743
And also we're leading into
conditioning on a random variable.

00:29:40.743 --> 00:29:43.810
This whole week is about
conditional expectation.

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:46.852
So far, we've been doing conditional
expectation where we conditioned on

00:29:46.852 --> 00:29:47.573
an event, okay?

00:29:47.573 --> 00:29:51.400
But what we're gonna get to is what does
it mean to condition on a random variable?

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:56.000
They're very, very closely related.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.320
But if you mix them up,
then it can be bad.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:05.650
So we have this thing with E(Y given X=x).

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:10.340
I just wanna make sure everyone is
completely clear on what this means both

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:12.940
intuitively and mathematically.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.172
What does this expression actually mean?

00:30:15.172 --> 00:30:22.660
Well, I've said over and over again that
big X equals little x is an event, right?

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:27.270
I mean assuming capital X and Y are random
variables, little x is a number.

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:30.530
We're conditioning on that event.

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:34.140
And as I've been saying, all that means
to do is use the same definition of

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:36.380
expectation except make it conditional.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.770
That's why it's called
conditional expectation, okay?

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:42.920
So at this point, you should all be
able to just write down the definition,

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.260
that this is for Y discrete.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.120
And we'll write down
the continuous case too.

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:52.630
Okay, so in the discrete case,
to get the expected value,

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:55.240
we just sum up the values times the PMF,
right?

00:30:55.240 --> 00:31:01.520
So the sum of y times the probability that
Y=y, that would just be expectation of Y.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:06.998
The only difference is we make
this conditional, given X=x.

00:31:10.116 --> 00:31:13.671
That's all this means,
that we learned the X was equal to x,

00:31:13.671 --> 00:31:16.753
and so we conditioned on that information,
right?

00:31:16.753 --> 00:31:23.350
So it's our best prediction of
the value of Y given this information.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:31.494
Best in a certain sense of minimizing the
square of how far off you are on average,

00:31:31.494 --> 00:31:35.455
cuz it minimizes
the expected square error.

00:31:35.455 --> 00:31:37.070
That's the discrete case.

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:38.998
Let's also just write
down the continuous case.

00:31:43.746 --> 00:31:48.918
So if Y is continuous,
then the basic definition of

00:31:48.918 --> 00:31:54.222
expectation, we'd integrate
y times the PDF of Y.

00:31:54.222 --> 00:31:58.086
And now we're just gonna use
a conditional PDF instead,

00:31:58.086 --> 00:32:01.400
which you might write as F of Y given X,
Y given X.

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:05.263
Dy, okay?

00:32:05.263 --> 00:32:10.517
And if x is also continuous,
just to remind you of how we get

00:32:10.517 --> 00:32:16.204
this conditional PDF,
what the definition of the conditional

00:32:16.204 --> 00:32:21.945
PDF is completely analogous
to conditional probability.

00:32:21.945 --> 00:32:25.185
That is instead of a probability,
we have the density but

00:32:25.185 --> 00:32:28.915
the density of Y and
x divided by the density of x.

00:32:28.915 --> 00:32:31.568
So that would just be the joint PDF.

00:32:34.412 --> 00:32:37.670
Divided by the marginal PDF of x.

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:48.930
So this just says that this equals this
because if just says that to get the joint

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:54.620
PDF we could take the marginal PDF of x
times the conditional PDF of y given x.

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.330
So we could also write it this way.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:59.570
And notice that this marginal here,

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:02.920
that doesn't depend,
that's supposed to be y not px.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:07.060
This doesn't depend on y, so we could take
this out of the integral, if we want or

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:09.070
we can leave it there, same thing.

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:14.470
So, this is just the analog, it's just
saying we're using conditional PDF,

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:16.275
its defined analogous.

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:22.480
So, I mean that that that's how you
compute things using a sum or an integral

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:28.470
but that that doesn't yet say like
what property does this satisfy, okay?

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:31.670
So let's let this thing be g of x.

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:38.447
That's g of lower case x = E of Y,

00:33:38.447 --> 00:33:41.700
given big X = little x.

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:48.191
I'm writing it as g of x just
to emphasize the fact that this,

00:33:48.191 --> 00:33:52.821
when you compute this thing, because I
can't even count the number of mistakes

00:33:52.821 --> 00:33:57.473
I've seen in these kinds of problems where
I give a problem like this on an exam.

00:33:57.473 --> 00:34:00.885
And then get an answer that
involves capital X or capital Y,

00:34:00.885 --> 00:34:05.388
which you should immediately know would
be would be completely wrong, okay,

00:34:05.388 --> 00:34:07.707
because this is the expected value of y,

00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:11.760
it can't depend on capital Y because
you're taking the average of Y.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:15.070
So how can that depend on,
you can't you can't base that on Y,

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:19.150
right that's your prediction
of Y you can't use Y, okay.

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:25.540
Given this information X = x, for
conditioning on this event and it can

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:29.470
involve capital X, it can involve capital
Y, it's just a function of little x.

00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:30.440
It might be a constant.

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:33.065
If X and Y are independent,

00:34:33.065 --> 00:34:37.620
then conditioning on X gives
us no information about Y.

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:43.000
So if they're independent, this will just
reduce to E of Y, which is a constant

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.460
function, but it has to be a function of
x, possibly a constant function, okay.

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.550
So that's just to emphasize
that's a function of x.

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:55.410
But that also suggests how to define

00:34:55.410 --> 00:35:00.430
conditional expectation
given a random variable.

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:05.281
So we wanted to find E
of Y given capital X,

00:35:08.444 --> 00:35:11.857
As g of X, capital X now.

00:35:11.857 --> 00:35:17.714
[COUGH] So I mean this is like not
a complicated looking equation, but

00:35:17.714 --> 00:35:23.390
conceptually, this takes a lot
of thought and I'll explain it.

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:26.330
And I'll explain it more
in the next lecture.

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:27.020
But really,

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:31.390
you just have to take some time to just
think about what these things mean.

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:34.176
I think carefully about it
because there's just so

00:35:34.176 --> 00:35:39.760
many mistakes you could fall into we don't
fully understand what this notation means.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:44.980
All right, so what this thing means
is we have this function of little x,

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:53.080
and we replace little x by big X,
after evaluating it, not before.

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:56.700
So one trap you could
fall into here is to say,

00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:01.650
well, g of capital,
this is g of little x, g of capital X,

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:05.810
then I should plug in big X for
everywhere I see a little x.

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:08.700
So I plug it in there and there, but

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:13.750
in that case you would be saying
EY given capital X = capital X.

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:17.200
And then you'd say, well,
I already knew capital X = capital X.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:22.570
So that's just irrelevant information that
I'll cross out and you'll get E of Y.

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:24.580
That's not what this means.

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:25.990
What it means is,

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.560
think of this as a function of little
x that you've actually computed.

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.380
Like, maybe it's x squared.

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:34.700
I'll just write this as an example.

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:39.590
So what it means is if g
of x little x = x squared.

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:44.910
Then g of big X = big X squared.

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:49.260
That's all it means,
that this is some function of X.

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:53.980
And you replace little x by big X after
we actually have our hands on that

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:55.269
function, okay?

00:36:55.269 --> 00:36:58.870
It's really just a notational trap
to think of plugging in the x here.

00:36:58.870 --> 00:37:02.970
But think of this as some function
you're replacing little x by big X.

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:05.080
Notice that that's a random variable.

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:12.136
So in particular,
E of Y given X is a random variable.

00:37:15.665 --> 00:37:19.700
It's a random variable
that's a function of x.

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:23.519
It's not a function of y,
it's a function of x.

00:37:24.701 --> 00:37:29.626
All right, so the intuition for
that is that,

00:37:29.626 --> 00:37:33.290
I mean this is the definition.

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:38.220
But the intuitive interpretation
is that E of Y given X,

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:43.540
what that means is X is a random variable.

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:48.630
But let's pretend that we observed X,
and we know what X is, and

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:53.630
we then get to treat X as if it's
a known constant, that's what this says.

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:57.430
So, it says assuming we get
to pretend that X is known,

00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:59.700
then what's our best prediction of Y?

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:04.030
So that's allowed to be
a function of capital X, okay?

00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:06.870
So that's what it means intuitively.

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:09.090
It's not really that
different from this and

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:12.070
in fact when you have a problem like this,
you can always at

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:15.840
least in principle translate it
back into conditioning on an event.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:19.613
It's just that the notation can
gets more unwieldy in this case.

00:38:19.613 --> 00:38:22.681
And we'll see examples where
it's just a lot more compact and

00:38:22.681 --> 00:38:26.584
convenient to write things this way than
always having to revert back to this.

00:38:26.584 --> 00:38:30.199
But if you start getting
confused about what this means,

00:38:30.199 --> 00:38:34.201
then you probably should revert
back to this kind of notation.

00:38:34.201 --> 00:38:38.778
Okay, so all right, so
let's do a couple of examples.

00:38:43.804 --> 00:38:50.790
So, Let's do one with Poissons.

00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:56.544
So let's let X and Y iid,

00:38:56.544 --> 00:39:02.585
I-I-D Poisson lambda.

00:39:02.585 --> 00:39:07.626
So all right, so suppose we

00:39:07.626 --> 00:39:12.895
wanna find E of X + Y given X.

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:21.050
So, as I said, if we want, we could
first find this given big X = little x.

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:24.850
And then change little x to big X and
you'll get the same thing.

00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:28.290
But, just for practice, let's do this
directly using the interpretation I

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:33.030
mentioned, that this says we get
to pretend that we know X now.

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:36.600
All right, so linearity still holds.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:40.694
So this is E of X given
X + E of Y given X.

00:39:42.924 --> 00:39:44.660
We can still use linearity.

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:48.776
The reason is that conditional
probabilities are probabilities, right?

00:39:48.776 --> 00:39:52.090
So conditional probabilities
satisfies all the same rules and

00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:54.280
properties as probability.

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:57.030
But therefore, since conditional
expectation is defined in terms of

00:39:57.030 --> 00:40:01.610
conditional probability,
conditional expectations are expectations.

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:08.220
It satisfies the same properties such as
linearity So linearity is still true.

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:10.705
Okay, so now let's just think about,
what does this thing actually mean?

00:40:10.705 --> 00:40:18.300
E(X|X), that's easy, that's X,
right, what else could it be?

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:23.854
I know X and I want to predict X,
I'm gonna use X as my prediction.

00:40:23.854 --> 00:40:27.745
So okay, it has to be that.

00:40:27.745 --> 00:40:29.066
&gt;&gt; No.

00:40:29.066 --> 00:40:31.531
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Now let's think about E(Y|X).

00:40:33.898 --> 00:40:37.060
X and Y, I said they're iid,
so they're independent.

00:40:38.392 --> 00:40:40.970
Since they're independent,

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:46.527
that means that getting to know X is
of no use at all in predicting Y.

00:40:46.527 --> 00:40:50.651
So that's just the same thing as E(Y).

00:40:50.651 --> 00:40:56.205
So this part is by independence, and
this part is X, X is a function of itself.

00:41:02.917 --> 00:41:07.860
In general, we'll talk more about this
later, but I may as well mention it now.

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:12.077
If we have E(h(x)|x), this is true for
any problem, not just the Poisson, so

00:41:12.077 --> 00:41:13.539
I'm putting it above this.

00:41:13.539 --> 00:41:16.795
We'll come back to this later,
but since it's already coming up.

00:41:16.795 --> 00:41:21.493
If we get to know, h is any function,
we get to know X, well then we know h(x),

00:41:21.493 --> 00:41:23.192
so we could just compute it.

00:41:23.192 --> 00:41:27.531
So E(h(x)|x) = h(X), right?

00:41:27.531 --> 00:41:33.820
Cuz we have X, we have h(x) so
that's it, no uncertainty about it.

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:37.946
Okay so E(X|X) is X,
E(Y|X) is just E(Y), so

00:41:37.946 --> 00:41:43.890
that's just X + lambda,
For the Poisson case.

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:49.411
Actually, up to this point, I'm not using
anything in particular about Poisson,

00:41:49.411 --> 00:41:53.393
I'm only using the fact that
they're independent, okay?

00:41:53.393 --> 00:42:00.258
So that's just an example that shows,
okay, we can still use linearity.

00:42:00.258 --> 00:42:03.350
If we have independence, we can drop
the stuff we're conditioning on.

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:07.287
And if we have something
that's completely known,

00:42:07.287 --> 00:42:10.168
then we can actually just take it out,
because it's known.

00:42:10.168 --> 00:42:15.536
All right,
now let's do the kind of reverse problem,

00:42:15.536 --> 00:42:19.983
suppose we were asked to find E(X|X+Y).

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:28.071
And okay, so there's no form
of linearity that says this

00:42:28.071 --> 00:42:30.937
E(X) given this plus E(X|Y).

00:42:30.937 --> 00:42:35.074
And I've seen that mistake several times,
maybe, in time pressure-type of panic.

00:42:35.074 --> 00:42:40.408
Just, linearity is like this,
no, we can't do that here.

00:42:40.408 --> 00:42:44.933
Okay, so
we have to think about what this means.

00:42:44.933 --> 00:42:48.223
So I'll show you two ways to do this,
actually.

00:42:48.223 --> 00:42:54.806
One way is just straight
from the definition.

00:42:54.806 --> 00:43:01.999
We're gonna let T = X + Y and let's find
the conditional distribution, right?

00:43:01.999 --> 00:43:05.417
Because what this says is we
get to know the value of T, and

00:43:05.417 --> 00:43:09.495
then we use the conditional
distribution rather than the, right?

00:43:09.495 --> 00:43:11.726
Without this it would say just
the unconditional, right,

00:43:11.726 --> 00:43:14.070
what's the expected value,
we know it's lambda.

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:17.417
But given this information, right,

00:43:17.417 --> 00:43:22.132
treating T as known,
then we need a conditional PMF.

00:43:22.132 --> 00:43:29.307
So, find the conditional PMF, Okay,

00:43:29.307 --> 00:43:34.440
so this is similar to
other problems we've seen,

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:38.730
but let's just compute it for practice.

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:41.770
We need the conditional PMF.

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:47.128
We want the probability that X equals k,
let's say,

00:43:47.128 --> 00:43:51.900
given that T equals some number,
let's say n.

00:43:53.995 --> 00:43:57.330
Those are just dummy variables here,
I'm just finding the conditional PMF.

00:43:57.330 --> 00:44:02.174
That is, what's the distribution of X,
given that we know T, okay?

00:44:02.174 --> 00:44:07.453
So by Bayes' rule, that's just

00:44:07.453 --> 00:44:12.354
P(T = n | X = k) P(X = k),

00:44:12.354 --> 00:44:16.136
divided by P(T = n).

00:44:16.136 --> 00:44:21.477
And that's actually an easy calculation,
because T, this is another

00:44:21.477 --> 00:44:26.924
example of like that plugging in
thing with the two-envelope problem.

00:44:26.924 --> 00:44:32.333
T is X + Y, so we're gonna plug X = k,
and so we know that Y = n- k.

00:44:32.333 --> 00:44:36.331
And then in this case, we do get to cross
out this information at that point,

00:44:36.331 --> 00:44:38.440
because X and Y are independent.

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:40.852
This would fail if
they're not independent.

00:44:40.852 --> 00:44:46.540
But in this case, X and Y are independent,

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:51.280
so really this is just P(Y = n- k)

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:55.864
P(X =k) divided by P(T = n).

00:44:55.864 --> 00:45:00.685
And sorry, we're going right to left here,
let's just write what is this here.

00:45:00.685 --> 00:45:05.740
Y = n- k,
just straight from the Poisson, right?

00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:12.620
E to the -lambda,
lambda to the n- k over (n- k) factorial.

00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:22.620
X is also Poisson, e to the -lambda,
lambda to the k over k factorial.

00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:27.350
And in the denominator, we know that the
sum of independent Poissons is Poisson.

00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:30.620
So this is gonna be a Poisson
of 2 lambda in the denominator.

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:35.688
So we know that's e to the -2 lambda,

00:45:35.688 --> 00:45:41.689
(2 lambda) to the n
divided by n factorial.

00:45:41.689 --> 00:45:44.890
Okay, and if we simplify this,

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:49.754
we get a very familiar-looking
distribution,

00:45:49.754 --> 00:45:53.441
right, what distribution is this?

00:45:53.441 --> 00:45:54.525
&gt;&gt; Binomial.

00:45:54.525 --> 00:45:59.770
&gt;&gt; Binomial, notice the e to
the -2 lambdas cancel, right?

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:03.138
And these power of lambdas cancel, right,

00:46:03.138 --> 00:46:05.467
there's lambda to the n
over lambda to the n.

00:46:05.467 --> 00:46:08.440
We just have a one-half to the n here,
right?

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:12.920
And this thing, n factorial,
put that on top, that's just n choose k.

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:14.820
So this thing,
I'll simplify it one more step,

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:18.850
it's just n choose k one-half to the n,
that's just a binomial.

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:26.514
Okay, so what we just showed with that,
Bayes' rule,

00:46:26.514 --> 00:46:33.680
is that X|T = n is binomial
with parameters n and one-half.

00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:39.750
So now, let's use this to get
the conditional expectation.

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:43.182
So what that says is E(X | X + Y), but

00:46:43.182 --> 00:46:47.870
let's first do the case of
conditioning on an event.

00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:51.518
So we're given T = n,
well that just says, given T = n,

00:46:51.518 --> 00:46:55.540
it's no longer Possion now, it's binomial.

00:46:55.540 --> 00:47:00.479
The expected value of this
binomial is just n over 2.

00:47:00.479 --> 00:47:06.932
So in the other notation,
this is conditioning on an event, right?

00:47:06.932 --> 00:47:12.271
But if we want to condition on T instead,
E(X|T), then all we have

00:47:12.271 --> 00:47:18.060
to do is replace this n by T,
just according to that definition there.

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:19.995
So that's gonna be T over 2.

00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:24.061
So it says that if we
get to know the total,

00:47:24.061 --> 00:47:27.370
then our best prediction is 1/2 the total.

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:30.891
That's actually a pretty intuitive result,
right?

00:47:30.891 --> 00:47:34.423
That we get to know the total of X and
Y, and they're iid, and

00:47:34.423 --> 00:47:37.003
we wanna predict
the average of one of them.

00:47:37.003 --> 00:47:40.099
Well, if I told you the total was 100,
and they're iid,

00:47:40.099 --> 00:47:43.280
you'd probably guess that they're each 50,
right?

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.310
That would be a reasonable guess.

00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:48.880
So that's a mathematical proof that
that's kinda the correct guess.

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:53.107
That's one way to prove it,
here's a way that I like even more,

00:47:53.107 --> 00:47:54.923
is to notice the symmetry.

00:47:54.923 --> 00:48:00.193
E(X | X + Y) = E (Y | X +

00:48:00.193 --> 00:48:05.007
Y) is true by symmetry,

00:48:05.007 --> 00:48:09.604
because they're iid.

00:48:16.797 --> 00:48:22.732
This is always true with iid, that doesn't
assume anything about the Possion.

00:48:22.732 --> 00:48:27.135
Lets add these two things,

00:48:27.135 --> 00:48:32.495
E(X | X + Y) + E(Y | X + Y),

00:48:32.495 --> 00:48:39.587
by linearity, that's E(X + Y | X + Y).

00:48:39.587 --> 00:48:45.390
But E(X + Y | X + Y) is X + Y, which is T.

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:52.046
So I added something plus itself and
I got this, so

00:48:52.046 --> 00:48:57.500
that immediately implies the same result,
E(X|T) = T/2.

00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:00.368
And this didn't use anything
about the Poisson, so

00:49:00.368 --> 00:49:02.672
that's actually a more general result.

00:49:02.672 --> 00:49:08.370
All right, lastly let me just mention one
key property that his notation gives us,

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:09.730
we'll prove it next time.

00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:15.099
So this is called iterated expectation, or

00:49:15.099 --> 00:49:21.302
it's also called Adam's law for
reasons I'll tell you next time.

00:49:21.302 --> 00:49:24.131
This is the single most important
property of conditional expectation.

00:49:24.131 --> 00:49:25.864
So it's good to be aware of it now, and

00:49:25.864 --> 00:49:28.370
then I'll talk in detail
of that next time.

00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:33.140
It just says, as I said, E(Y|X) is a
random variable, so we might want to know,

00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:35.690
what's the expected value
of that random variable?

00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:40.410
Well, if you do E(E(Y|X)), you get E(Y).

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:45.670
And this is closely related to
the law of total probability.

00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:48.970
In a sense, it's a very compact way of
writing the law of total probability,

00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:50.740
extremely useful fact.

00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:52.100
All right, so
I'll see you all on Wednesday.
