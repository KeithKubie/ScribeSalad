yeah it's using the data providers so

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830
yeah it's using the data providers so
 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.400
yeah it's using the data providers so
it's got the time zone in Boston where

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410
it's got the time zone in Boston where
 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.500

my family lives it's also got the water

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510
my family lives it's also got the water
 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.940
my family lives it's also got the water
tracker and it's got the day of the

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950
tracker and it's got the day of the
 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.950
tracker and it's got the day of the
month so we really think that watch

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960
month so we really think that watch
 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.660
month so we really think that watch
bases should own the presentation of

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670
bases should own the presentation of
 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.220
bases should own the presentation of
their complications to make those

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230
their complications to make those
 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.560
their complications to make those
complications fit in so nicely with the

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570
complications fit in so nicely with the
 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.529
complications fit in so nicely with the
watch face okay so I've got Ranger here

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539
watch face okay so I've got Ranger here
 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.120
watch face okay so I've got Ranger here
let's see if what else I might be

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130
let's see if what else I might be
 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.950
let's see if what else I might be
interested in for a watch base so at the

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960
interested in for a watch base so at the
 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.290
interested in for a watch base so at the
end of the watch base favorites I've got

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300
end of the watch base favorites I've got
 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.540
end of the watch base favorites I've got
a

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550
a
 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.250
a
first of all the watch faces that are

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260
first of all the watch faces that are
 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.220
first of all the watch faces that are
available on the device and I'll pick

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230
available on the device and I'll pick
 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.770
available on the device and I'll pick
elements Digital here and now I've added

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780
elements Digital here and now I've added
 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.980
elements Digital here and now I've added
that to my favorites so I've got four

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990
that to my favorites so I've got four
 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.570
that to my favorites so I've got four
mmm you know I don't need this one auto

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580
mmm you know I don't need this one auto
 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.700
mmm you know I don't need this one auto
style watch face anymore so I'm gonna

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710
style watch face anymore so I'm gonna
 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:29.360
style watch face anymore so I'm gonna
get rid of it

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370
get rid of it
 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.480
get rid of it
so I'll have to do is just swipe it up

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490
so I'll have to do is just swipe it up
 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.030
so I'll have to do is just swipe it up
and it's gone and now elements analog is

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040
and it's gone and now elements analog is
 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.500
and it's gone and now elements analog is
my watch face so now that we've shown

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510
my watch face so now that we've shown
 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.540
my watch face so now that we've shown
how to select and discard watch faces

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550
how to select and discard watch faces
 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.310
how to select and discard watch faces
let's go check out another core

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320
let's go check out another core
 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.830
let's go check out another core
capability of Android wear which is how

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840
capability of Android wear which is how
 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.110
capability of Android wear which is how
you get back so here I might be deep in

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120
you get back so here I might be deep in
 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.200
you get back so here I might be deep in
my list of possible watch faces and I

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210
my list of possible watch faces and I
 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.640
my list of possible watch faces and I
decide you know none of these quite

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650
decide you know none of these quite
 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.680
decide you know none of these quite
resonate with me so I want to go back so

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690
resonate with me so I want to go back so
 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.030
resonate with me so I want to go back so
all I have to do is hit the hardware

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040
all I have to do is hit the hardware
 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.970
all I have to do is hit the hardware
button here once to go back to the list

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980
button here once to go back to the list
 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.430
button here once to go back to the list
of favorites and then once more to go

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440
of favorites and then once more to go
 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.590
of favorites and then once more to go
back to my default watch face so hitting

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600
back to my default watch face so hitting
 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.820
back to my default watch face so hitting
the hardware button on the side of the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830
the hardware button on the side of the
 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.040
the hardware button on the side of the
device is just how you get back and it's

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050
device is just how you get back and it's
 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.640
device is just how you get back and it's
super fast so up next let's take a look

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650
super fast so up next let's take a look
 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.040
super fast so up next let's take a look
at what we call the quick settings shade

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050
at what we call the quick settings shade
 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.660
at what we call the quick settings shade
so all I have to do is pull down from

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670
so all I have to do is pull down from
 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.060
so all I have to do is pull down from
the top edge of the watch face and I've

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070
the top edge of the watch face and I've
 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.920
the top edge of the watch face and I've
got all the controls that I might need

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930
got all the controls that I might need
 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.010
got all the controls that I might need
to access in a hurry especially I want

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020
to access in a hurry especially I want
 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.910
to access in a hurry especially I want
to focus on brightness so we've heard

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920
to focus on brightness so we've heard
 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.710
to focus on brightness so we've heard
from users that brightness needed to be

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720
from users that brightness needed to be
 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.750
from users that brightness needed to be
easier to access and so here's that's

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760
easier to access and so here's that's

of the watch and boom that launches the
app launcher let's try that again so I'm

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390
app launcher let's try that again so I'm
 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.120
app launcher let's try that again so I'm
on the watch face and I just hit the

can see it as I'm scrolling I can see a
 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.310
can see it as I'm scrolling I can see a
scroll bar in thumbnail that lets me

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:50.320
scroll bar in thumbnail that lets me
 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.960
