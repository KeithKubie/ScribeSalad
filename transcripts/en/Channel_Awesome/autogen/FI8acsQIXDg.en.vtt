other avenues that can work and I think

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:37.380
other avenues that can work and I think
 

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.340
other avenues that can work and I think
this one to people who do try this stuff

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:40.350
this one to people who do try this stuff
 

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:42.410

it would probably or even on the verge
 

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.080
it would probably or even on the verge
of kind of doing this stuff uh this

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:45.090
of kind of doing this stuff uh this
 

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:46.610
of kind of doing this stuff uh this
would probably speak a little closer cuz

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:46.620

pretty fast I mean like there's a
 

00:19:26.179 --> 00:19:28.480
pretty fast I mean like there's a
character at some point like whips out a

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:28.490
