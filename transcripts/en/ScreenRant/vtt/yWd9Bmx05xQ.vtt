00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:08.620
Animated bloopers come from numerous places;
sometimes the animators create their own bloopers

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.730
or the voice over artists make mistakes while
filming.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.309
Some bloopers are even planned out to help
promote the film or make the characters more

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:16.510
realistic.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.070
Bloopers from animated films are released
few and far between, which make them even

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.900
more of a gem when we get one.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.560
Whether these outtakes are planned or spontaneous
they are still funny and bring an extra dimension

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.801
to the characters on screen.

00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:28.801
Here is Screen Rant’s list of ten Disney
Bloopers From Animated Films You Love.

00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:38.880
Stick around to the end to see some of the
funniest bloopers animation has ever produced.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.789
A Bug’s Life

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:46.310
The first film from the team at Disney and
Pixar to feature spoof bloopers was for a

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.059
little film about bugs, A Bug’s Life.

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.249
Known as one of their least popular films,
A Bug’s Life was an outstanding and exciting

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:54.249
film to watch.

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:58.749
A lot of this had to do with the creativity
the filmmakers produced including the outtakes

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:00.289
at the end credits.

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.280
This film was a follow up to the success of
Toy Story, so it makes sense that they asked

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.660
Woody to make a cameo.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:21.280
He’s all grins in his scene; maybe he was
excited because he had a sequel coming up.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.900
The Lion King

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.410
In 1994’s The Lion King the film features
two beloved characters Timon and Pumba played

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.110
by Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.310
They lived by the motto, "hakuna matata,"
which means “no worries” in Swahili.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.000
When Disney released their Diamond Edition
DVD of this film, they added a segment called,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.100
“Bloopers &amp; Outtakes”.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:55.840
Lane and Sabella are hilarious in the reel
making numerous blunders and flatulence jokes

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.240
but the highlight comes when Rafiki drops
Simba in his famous presentation scene.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.700
Hopefully there was a stunt pad below.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.810
Monsters Inc.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.030
We were already provided a great deal of comedy
in 2001’s Monsters Inc. because of stars

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.750
Billy Crystal and John Goodman killing it
on screen, but what about the end credits?

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.000
The filmmakers added spoof bloopers to their
monster theme film as if the film was actually

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.310
filmed in Monstropolis.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.310
Including a monster with tentacles running
the clapper or characters arguing about getting

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.590
more film roles.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.730
They also threw in a scene of Rex from the
Toy Story films auditioning for a role in

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.730
this film.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.700
If you want more outtakes with the Toy Story
cast stick around because they’re coming

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.370
up.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.590
Brave

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.170
The animation process is a long and costly
process; many times the animators are developing

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.140
techniques they have never done before.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.510
In 2012’s Brave the filmmakers had to animate
Merida’s hair and it was no easy task, it

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.950
is made up of 111,700 hairs that were generated
from over 1500 individually sculpted models.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.980
During test footage you can see the complications
they had animating her hair and the complications

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.880
of keeping her clothes on during a horseback
ride.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.880
Inside Out

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.850
When you fill the roles of an animated film
with comedy actors like Bill Hader, Mindy

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.410
Kaling, Lewis Black and Amy Poehler you expect
a good time during production.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.290
When recording the voice over of their animated
characters you can see the cast and filmmakers

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.819
were having a blast.

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.349
One actor that kept cracking herself up was
Poehler, she spontaneously laughed throughout

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.180
her read showing why she was the right choice
for the role of Joy.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:48.870
No one can be as joyful as Poehler while reading
the lines from this film.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.709
Big Hero 6

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:56.040
Baymax introduces his own gag reel for the
2014 Disney film Big Hero 6.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.740
During production of the film, animators would
make spoof scenes to entertain themselves

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.250
and the filmmakers.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.750
These scenes included Baymax flying with a
cat head, a professor dancing in the background

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.860
during a fight scene and Baymax being poked
like the Pillsbury Doughboy.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.530
Check out his hat and next time you see Baymax
at Disneyland poke his belly.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.389
Finding Nemo

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:23.100
In the 2003’s Finding Nemo there are numerous
Easter Eggs in the film but when a star from

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.870
another animated film shows up and blatantly
swims across the screen is it still an Easter

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:28.870
Egg?

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.630
We could say that it is a cameo but when that
person is a monster swimming with a snorkel

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.270
we have to say it’s a blooper.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.410
Did Mike Wazowski, from Monsters Inc. swim
onto the wrong movie set and the filmmakers

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.690
just left it in for laughs?

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:48.770
Or maybe the filmmakers are hinting at a spinoff
film called, Finding Mike Wazowski?

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.330
Toy Story 2

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.620
The first sequel to a Pixar film, Toy Story
2 is one of those rare occurrences where the

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.960
sequel is just as good or even better than
the original.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.870
The characters all seem to enjoy each other
and these bonus bloopers showcase this delight.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.490
Woody pulled practical jokes on Buzz and Jessie
actually pulled Woody’s string out of his

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:08.490
back.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.120
One of the fan favorite bloopers is Mrs. Potato
Head preparing Mr. Potato Head for his outing.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.560
She kept filling him up with props that he
would have no use for until chattering teeth

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.560
take over.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.560
Brother Bear

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.580
Brother Bear was disappointing at the box
office but the outtakes were not.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.340
In a way to help promote the film Disney released
a gag reel that showcased the fun the animated

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.160
cast had on set.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.930
Including a time when Stitch from Lilo &amp; Stitch
made its way onto the set and ruined a take.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.680
The bears even broke a camera increasing Disney’s
budget, while another cast member relaxed

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.820
in a river drinking fruit drinks.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:50.949
This was all in good fun and was a highlight
of this films production.

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:51.949
Frozen

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:57.040
The chemistry between Kristen Bell &amp; Idina
Menzel is splendid and the filmmakers knew

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.040
this.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.699
During recording of their scenes for the 2013
film Frozen, both Bell and Menzel were put

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.759
in the same room for recording.

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:08.600
These two actresses loved working together
and we loved hearing them.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.240
At one point Bell’s delivery of a line made
Menzel laugh, she broke character and they

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:22.870
had to redo the scene.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.169
