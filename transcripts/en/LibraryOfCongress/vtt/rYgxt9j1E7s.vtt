about the ideas in books?

special opportunity and part

of why we have you here is because
we hope that you'll get a lot

of the book, Black

And it's a special book because
it's won a particular kind of award.

So it's a very beautiful story,
has very awesome characters

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.380
that are very rich and interesting.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.990
I'm sure you can relate to them.

And she takes you a
number of different places.

It's one of the things
I like most about books.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.840
There are tons of places in the
world that I don't have time to go

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.280
or I don't have the money to go to,
and I get to read books like this

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.850
and go to those places anyway.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.370

to put my glasses on for.

and talk a little bit about the book

introduce Elizabeth Wein.

a technical question.

Oh, okay. All right.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.270
Well, I'll try to make
it interesting even

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.510
if you can't see the screen.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.770 position:56%
I want to knowbefore I start --
because this book is set in Ethiopia

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.980
in 1935, and I want to know
if anybody here has any kind

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.280
of relationship with Ethiopia?

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.120
If you're from there, if
your parents are from there,

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.240
you have friends from there?

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.090
Your sister's from Ethiopia?

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.390
Yeah?

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.340
[ Inaudible ]

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.610 position:56%
Okay. Washington has got, I believe,

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.140
it's the largest Ethiopian
population outside Ethiopia,

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.140
this area does.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.220
So it's really kind of neat for me
to be talking about this book here.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.280
I live in Scotland where there is
pretty much no Ethiopian population

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.580
at all.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.220
And I've lived there
since the year 2000.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.390
So I'm assuming that's longer
than any of you have been alive.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.080
You can't hear it in my accent.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.710
I was raised in Pennsylvania.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.250
But I've done a lot of traveling
in my life, and this is --

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.810
Black Dove, White Raven is --

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.730
I think it's my eighth
published novel.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.230
Every single one of
my published novels is

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.700
about a character who's
kind of uprooted.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.910 position:56%
And I think that it's something that
I just noticed recently that I tend

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.060
to write about people who aren't
living where they originally come

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.070
from or who aren't
like the other people

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.860
where they live or
something like that.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.730
And I think that's because I
am essentially where I live.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.060
I'm an immigrant.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.770
And I -- it's something I
feel very deep inside me.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:14.040
So this book is based on my
family more than anything else.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.550
These other two books that you see
up here, Code Name Verity and Rose

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.610
Under Fire are kind of World War
II adventures, and I wrote them

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:27.480
because I -- I got inspired
because I learned to fly in 2003.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.000
I got a pilot's --
private pilot's license.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.070
And I really wanted
to write about flying.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.490
And what I ended up doing is
writing about women in aviation.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.600
So the first book, Code Name
Verity is about a young woman

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.940
who becomes a pilot and another
young woman who is a spy.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.780 position:56%
And it's kind of an adventure story.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.900
It's also about their
friendship during World War II.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.630
Rose Under Fire is about another
young woman who's a pilot,

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.110
and these are all based on real
people who did real things,

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.980
and I found that as I
was writing these stories

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.690
and I feel this really talking
to a girl's school in particular,

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:08.980
that suddenly I've become kind of
an advocate for women in aviation.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.120
So I have to give you my women
in aviation speech before I go

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.460
on to talk about Black
Dove, White Raven.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.800 position:56%
Have any of you ever had a flight in
a small plane like a small aircraft?

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.100
Yeah, we have one there.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.510
How did that come about?

[ Inaudible ]

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:39.510
Yeah. Why were you -- why did
you end up in a small plane?

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.190
[ Inaudible ]

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.490
Okay, yeah.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.900
Sometimes they put you in a little
tiny plane that only seats like 10

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.610 position:56%
or 20 people or something like that.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.750
Anybody ever been in one
that seats four people?

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.990
A grown up -- grown ups.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.030
Yeah, whatever, you know.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:03.270
No. So, how did you end
up in a small plane?

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.070
Are you a pilot?

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:17.200
[ Inaudible ]

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.660
Okay. It's something that I
thinnk doesn't occur to a lot

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.760
of young girls that you can
get careers in aviation.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.590
So don't rule it out basically.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.900 position:56%
And if you want to be inspired, Code
Name Verity and Rose Under Fire are

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.480
about young women who are
flying and who are pilots.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.910
Black Dove, White Raven also has
pilots in it, and it was kind of,

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:44.420
for me, a combination of
being interested in flying

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.750
and also being interested
in Ethiopia.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:52.200
I -- my interest in Ethiopia
goes back to my aunt and uncle,

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.600
Susan and Roger Whitaker, who were

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:59.690
in the Peace Corp teaching
English there in the 1960's.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:03.840 position:56%
And when I finally got to go there
myself it was on a trip with my aunt

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.500
and uncle who went back for
their 35th wedding anniversary

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.310
and were nice enough
to take me with them.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:11.840
So I'm going to show you --

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.410
I'm going to kind of take you
on a little bit of a tour,

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:16.790
especially as it seems that most

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:22.200
of you don't really have an
association with the country.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.730
But I'm also going to
ask you a few questions

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:28.240
about what you know about Ethiopia.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.570
This isn't a quiz.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:32.420
You're not going to get graded.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.800
So how many of you know

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.870
that Ethiopia is the only
African country never

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.060
to have been colonized?

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.510
Anybody know that?

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.720
No grownups back there
putting up their hands either.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.430
Okay, the grownups [inaudible].

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:51.730
Okay, so no kids.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:55.330 position:56%
Ethiopia is the only African country
never to have been colonized.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.330
The Italians invaded it in 1935.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.630
Did you know that?

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:00.930
Do you know anything about
the Italian invasion?

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.510
Yes. How did you come
across that fact?

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:06.310
[ Inaudible ]

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:07.610
Did you read about it in history?

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:08.910
That's fantastic.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:12.380
This one of your history students?

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:18.200
It's -- that's really good to
hear because it's a subject

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.210
that people kind of don't really
pay a whole lot of attention to,

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:26.490 position:56%
but the Italian invasion of Ethiopia
is really considered by historians

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:31.840
to be kind of the first
opening sequence of World War II

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.670
because it sent a lot of messages
to the big powers of Europe.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:39.770
So the fact that nobody
would stop the Italians

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:43.680
from attacking this country told
Hitler that they weren't going

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.210
to stop him if he attacked
countries in Europe.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:55.150 position:56%
It showed how powerless what were
called the great powers of Europe --

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:58.800
showed that they were powerless
to have any control over a country

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.930
that wanted to invade and it
also was kind of a testing ground

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:09.260 position:56%
for Italy to use their aircraft,
which at the time were kind of state

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.740
of the art bombers, and they
went against this country

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:17.270 position:56%
that basically had only just kind of
pulled itself out of medieval times.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:21.480
The Ethiopian population
basically went barefoot.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.870
They didn't wear shoes.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.550 position:56%
Most of them still don't wear shoes.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:29.250
And even the emperor's imperial
guard didn't wear shoes.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:30.900
They were using spears.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.360
They were using antiquated rifles,

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.990
some of which were
about 60 years old.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:38.010
Most of them didn't have
ammunition or they had to trade it

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:39.870
or make it themselves or whatever.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:44.920
So these state of the art
bomber aircraft were --

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:49.860
and tanks and machine guns
were going against a population

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.660
that really couldn't fight back.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:58.670
How many of you know about -- that
there is such a thing as poison gas

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.290
that can be used in warfare?

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.590
Yeah, lots of people.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:06.290 position:56%
Okay. Have you heard of mustard gas?

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:10.240
No? Okay. Mustard gas -- I'm
assuming if you haven't heard

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.070
of mustard gas, you also
don't know that it was used

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:17.520
against civilian populations in
Ethiopia during this invasion.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.430
Have you ever heard that.

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:23.040 position:56%
Mustard gas was used in World War I.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.410
It was then kind of
banned for use in warfare

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:28.970
because it was so horrible.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:32.490
So even if you have a gas mask on,

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:37.470
if mustard gas reaches you,
it will burn your skin.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.800
You have to be completely
covered up to avoid it.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.140
It also poisoned everything
around you.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.240
So it will poison the
drinking supply.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.540
It will poison water.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.770
It'll poison any animals
that are around.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.610
If you touch someone who has
been contaminated with it,

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:55.390
you can get burns on your hands
just from touching the person

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.490
who has been affected by it.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:01.240
Here is this mustard gas
being dropped out of aircraft

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:06.110
on barefoot soldiers, and they
really didn't stand a chance.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:09.350
So this was kind of
what I was looking

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:12.360
at as something I really wanted to
write about and tell people about,

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.950
but I also wanted to
tell them about Ethiopia,

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.200
which is an amazing country.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.400 position:56%
So what I'm going to show you here
is just a little bit of a background

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:28.080
of some of the things that I
brought into the book to make it

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.230
into a story rather then
just a history lesson.

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:35.690
So I needed some characters that
people were going to relate to

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:39.450
and I needed to -- kind
of a personal experience

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:41.940
that people were going to relate
to, so I drew very heavily

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.520 position:56%
on my own life in writing this book.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.520
My father used to work for the
New York City Board of Education,

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.970
and he did teach a training
in Jamaica for three years.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:54.660
So between -- when I was 6 years
old, I went through grades 1

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.560 position:56%
through 3 in Jamaica, and when we --

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.450
anybody here have a
relationship with Jamaica?

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.090
Yes.

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:04.160
[ Inaudible ]

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.460
Your cousin's Jamaican?

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:06.760
And how about you?

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.060
[ Inaudible ]

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.360

Jamaican co-worker.

lived in Jamaica, too.

[ Inaudible ]

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:25.010

history in your family.

[ Inaudible ]

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:27.610
And so do you.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:29.320
Cool. One more.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.730
[ Inaudible ]

Was it just a vacation?

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:35.630
He was working in Jamaica?

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:36.930
What was he teaching?

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:38.310
[ Inaudible ]

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:39.610
Fantastic.

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:40.910
Oh, that's very cool.

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:42.210
In Kingston?

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:43.510
That's awesome.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.690
Okay. So this is -- more people
have relationship with Jamaica.

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:49.940
It's not that far away.

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:55.150
And what I did was I took
my own personal experience

00:14:55.150 --> 00:15:02.580 position:56%
of being American girl in a foreign
country and kind of an alien country

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:07.870
and an undeveloped country and
applied that to what happens

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.170
in Black Dove, White Raven.

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:15.710
So it's a story of a brother and
a sister being raised together --

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.340
well, they're being raised
as brother and sister,

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.150
but they're not actually related.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:20.450
One is white.

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:21.750
One is black.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:25.350
They grow up in Pennsylvania
to about the age of 11

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:27.820
and then they move to
Ethiopia with their mother.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.290
And that was the premise
for the story.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:34.660
So I'm going to show
you a little bit

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.530
about myself and my Jamaican past.

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.720
I'm going to sit down
here while I do this.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.020
And then I'm going to take you

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:47.040
on a very brief tour
through Ethiopia itself.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.350
That's me in the beautiful
long blonde braids,

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.410
which I no longer have.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:56.690
And that is my brother, Jared.

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:59.670
And they -- this is kind of --

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:03.170
they're two different
people that I've based --

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:06.690
two different couples as it
were that I based the brother

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:10.470
and sister [inaudible] on in the
story, and one is me and my brother

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.290
because we have a very
close relationship,

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:16.620 position:56%
and we played together all the time,
and we made up stories together.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:21.220
So there we are at
the age of 5 and 2.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:26.100
And this is us in Jamaica.

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.530
I'm on the left in the pink.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:29.830
Can you see Jared?

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:35.620
He's just sticking his head up
in the bottom right hand corner.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.190
He was a very goofy kid.

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:41.910
This is taken in our
front yard in Jamaica just

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:44.090
in the carport with cars parked.

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:45.580
You can see it in the background.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:49.390
The kids with us are
our nextdoor neighbors.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:53.430 position:56%
They are Madge, Patrick and Peaches.

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.040
And -- it is.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.340
that was her nickname.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:00.080
Her real name was Georgia,
Georgia Peaches.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:05.570
And you know, it's
funny I look at her,

00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:09.530
and I try to think how
old she is in the picture.

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.490
How old? Does anybody have a guess?

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.110
We hear like 8, 9, 12?

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:18.620
Okay. To me, when I
was 6 or whatever I am,

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:21.440
she was this like teen goddess.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.900
She was -- even when
I look at her now,

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.470
I think she must be
about 18, but she's not.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:29.860
She's much closer to
what you're guessing.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.970
She's probably about 10.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.550
Madge was not there.

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:36.170
These two are sister and brother.

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:38.440
Madge is their cousin, and she --

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.300
if you could see the
mountains in the background --

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.490
her family lived way
up in the mountains,

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:45.820
and there were no schools there.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:52.220
So they sent her to live with her
cousins so she could go to school.

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:55.960
And we all played together, and we
made up stories together and kind

00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:00.290
of ran riot in our
connecting backyards.

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:04.640
And this is a picture
that I drew at the time.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:11.750
This kind of shows you how I got
into writing and making up stories.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:18.680
My favorite thing to read when I
was 7 years old was a great big

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:24.210
collection of Buck Rogers
comic strips that dated

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:28.120
to the 1930's and 1940's.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:33.780
And this is a picture of an episode
from one of those comic strips,

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:38.230
and what we have going on here
is this guy has an elaborate sort

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:39.790
of death thing rigged up.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:42.170
So there's Buck Rogers lying there.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:46.050
He's tied up by the feet to
this bent over palm tree.

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:51.500
This is my diseased brain
when I was 7 years old.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:56.360
This tree is tied down
around this tree and held

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.260
down on this little stump here.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.340
There's his crashed
rocket ship over there.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.960
And then these are his
goggles, his aviator goggles

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.420
which you probably can't
see it from back there,

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:12.420
but there's actually a sunbeam that
is coming all the way down here

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:16.540
through the goggles and
setting fire to this vine.

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:22.060
And when the fire burns through
the vine, this tree is going

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:23.470
to spring up, and he's
going to be tied

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:25.560
but hanging upside
down, tied by his feet.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.430
And then he's going to
be left there to die.

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:29.730
But of course, he isn't.

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:32.710
Somebody comes and rescues him,
which is always the problem

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:36.070
when you rigged up an
elaborate execution like this.

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:41.100 position:56%
So that was -- we played Buck Rogers
all the time, and I actually had --

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:45.440
because these comics were published
in the 1930's, I was actually able

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.700 position:56%
to kind of use them as I had the
kids in this book making up stories,

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.520
and they had this kind
of elaborate fantasy life

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:56.140
and they write stories together,
and I was actually able to use some

00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:00.460
of the stuff that I had
enjoyed reading myself

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.770
because the time period was right.

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:07.500
This is a little Buck Rogers
story that I wrote when I was 7.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.270 position:56%
The original piece of paper that
this is printed on is about the size

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.520
of my hand, piece of note paper.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.280
So this side of the paper -- this
is two sides of the same page --

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:21.250
this side says this is
a story of Buck Rogers.

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:23.160
Here's the whole story.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.000
One day Buck was walking
with Sally and Wilma.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.090
They were walking to a rocket ship.

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:30.390
That's the story.

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:33.370
So then it says I have
a more exciting story

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:35.070
on the other side of this paper.

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:41.280
Clearly, I knew that that just
wasn't enough to engage the reader,

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.700
and the second page is actually
a little bit more elaborate,

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.440
even though it's not original,

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:50.090
it was taken directly
out of the comic strips.

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:51.390
So there you have some background

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:53.710
about how my brain
worked at that time.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:57.200
This is my mother and
her best friend

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.790
in Jamaica whose name is Rona.

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:03.890
And my mother invited Rona
to come and live with us

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:09.060
because she had been a maid
for an English friend of ours.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:14.170
And she wasn't able to have her
less than a year old baby living

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:16.030
with her, and my mother
said, "Come with us.

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:17.670
You can bring your baby.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:18.970
You can go to school."

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:22.980
Rona was about 19 at the time.

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:25.170
My mother was not a lot older.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.540
And so Rona moved in
with us with her baby.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:29.900
My mother had a baby as well.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.830
They were about the same age.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:33.600
And here they are.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:39.130
So this is Rona's little
boy, Carlton.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:43.780
Rona did a lot of -- she kind
of wished she had a little girl.

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:48.460
She did a lot of doing his
hair, really, really fancy.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:52.500
And she put big bows
in his hair at times,

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.290 position:56%
but this is my little sister, Maria.

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:58.520
They were almost exactly
the same age.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:04.440
And so -- and that's me -- and so
what I was doing when I thought

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.190
of this book is I was kind
of imagining a scenario

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:13.560
in which these two babies
who were kind of raised --

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.840
they would get put in the
same baby buggy together,

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.790
they'd play in the same play pen,
they'd do everything together.

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:21.680
They thought of themselves
as brother and sister.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:26.720
What would happen to them if they
grew up in a country that was

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:32.590
about to kind of disintegrate
into war.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:35.320
And also what would happen to them
if they did actually have a chance

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.280
to grow up together as brother and
sister because these two didn't

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:42.350
because we left Jamaica and
Rona and Carlton stayed behind.

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:46.510
So that was kind of
the basis for my book.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:49.640
I'm now going to whisk
you to Ethiopia.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:53.120
That's me getting on an
Ethiopian Airlines plane.

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:58.590
And this is -- I told you I
went with my aunt and uncle.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:01.550
That's them over here.

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:03.500
There's my Aunt Susan
and my Uncle Roger.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:07.300 position:56%
That's me in the middle and then
these are Susan and Roger's friends,

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:08.910
Elizabeth and Rick Stoner.

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:13.630 position:56%
Rick Stoner was the head of Save the
Children in East Africa at the time.

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:16.660
So we all did quite a big tour,

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:21.160
and there is pretty
typical highland scenery.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:27.570
And what I really think -- what
I'd love to show you not just

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:30.660
in this brief little introduction
but also in this book is

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:38.720 position:56%
that Ethiopia is a -- it's a country
of many contrasts, but the scenes

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:44.710
that you see of it are kind
of fed to you by the media,

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:48.550
and it feels to me like there
are always scenes of poverty

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:52.880
and destruction and people who
are starving, and you don't get

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.210 position:56%
to see the side that shows that they
have this rich cultural heritage

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:58.580
going back 3000 years.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:02.790
They have their own ancient
language, which is the language

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:08.400 position:56%
of the church [inaudible] and it's
-- they use it the way Latin is used

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.070
as the ancient language
of the Christian church.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:12.950
They have many traditions.

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:15.160
As I said, they're the
only African country never

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.460
to have been colonized.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:20.860
And this scene is taken in
a valley, a farming valley

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.920
where they've got an
irrigation project going,

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.080
and it's working really well.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.050
And this is a scene
-- the largest part

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:30.060
of their population is Christian,

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:33.560
but there's also quite a large
Muslim population as well.

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:38.900
This is the city of Harar,
which is the holy city for Islam

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.500
in Ethiopia, and it's walled.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.810
It's got this 1000 years
old wall around it,

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:47.590
which you can just
kind of make out there.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:52.070
And these are kind of
typical village houses

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:55.610
so that's what the people in the
book would be living in except

00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:57.070
that these are near
what's called [inaudible],

00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:02.010
a village called [inaudible] and
for some reason or other there,

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:03.410
they're two stories high.

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:04.850
Usually, they're just
one story high.

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:07.740
But round stone with thatch on top.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.660
Very typical.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:16.630
And there you have the group of
traditional singers and musicians,

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:20.280
and this woman is doing
a coffee ceremony.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.770
Coffee is said to have
originated in Ethiopia.

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:27.420
Have any of you ever went --
gone out for Ethiopian food?

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.720
Yeah? Okay.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.020
Many more of you.

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:33.380
That's good because there are
quite a few excellent restaurants

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:34.680
in this area.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.870
Have you seen the coffee ceremony?

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.530
Yeah? No? Okay.

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:42.440
Well, only a woman is
allowed to make coffee,

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:49.630
and in the ceremony you would boil
the coffee in this little fire pit

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:53.110
and -- or boil the water, and
you would roast your seeds.

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:56.060
There's coffee beans in it as
well and grind them yourself,

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:59.580
and then this is incense
because it's supposed to be --

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:03.550
these [inaudible] are just spread
around to create atmosphere.

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:06.380 position:56%
It's supposed to be a calm ceremony.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:07.680
It's special.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:11.870
It's a time for sitting back,
and the coffee is served

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:15.710
in several rounds so it gets
stronger and stronger each time.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:19.550
And that's a spice market.

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:22.000
Lots of different spices
[inaudible] there.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.520
That's a church.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.300
This round architecture
is kind of typical.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:31.280
This is probably about
100 years old.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:35.590
Some church paintings, and then
I have -- oh, this is a school.

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:40.300
So here you have -- here you
kind of have your counterparts.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:44.220
This is a -- this school goes
up to eighth grade, I believe.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.870
That's Rick, my uncle's
friend, Rick.

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:50.980 position:56%
And these are staff from the school.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.370
I believe one of them is the
head of the school and one

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:57.530
of them is I think maybe
the eighth grade teacher.

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:00.140 position:56%
And then here you have some students

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.390
from the school a bit
younger than you.

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:08.250
This girl was pretty good at
speaking English, and they were --

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:09.550
we just dropped in on the school.

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:11.550
They didn't know we were
turning up, and they were very,

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:15.600
very anxious to show off what
they knew and what they could do.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.120
They had a very high pass
rate for the national exam.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:23.660
So a lot of their students went
to -- went on to high school.

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:27.210
And this is a school where --
I don't know if you can see,

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:30.240
I actually focused on the
students in the picture and not

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:34.710
on the extreme poverty
that they're schooling in.

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:38.500
Their books must be 30 years old.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.630
Their desks are made of stone.

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:47.540 position:56%
And when they were asked -- some of
them were asked to get up and recite

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:53.470
for us, and this girl stood up and
said she had a question for us,

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:58.510
and it was what are you
going to do for my school?

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:02.900
And you know, there's not a whole
lot that I can do for her school.

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:07.100
So the one thing I can do
is kind of show this to you

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.450
and show you how people are
learning in other countries.

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:14.480
Just make you a bit more
aware of other cultures.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.950 position:56%
And this is a typical improved road.

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:21.400 position:56%
Many of the roads there are actually
funded by the Chinese government.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.660
This is called the Chinese Road,

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.090
but you can tell it's
improved because it's graded.

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:31.040
It's flat, even though
it looks pretty bleak.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.500
This was my aunt and
uncle's landlord

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.760
when they lived there in the '60's.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.650
Still there, still
in the same house.

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:42.100
And this is my Aunt Susan.

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:46.270
We went to the town where they
lived, and we visited the school

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:48.750
where they taught 35 years later,

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:52.500
and this woman was one
of my aunt's students.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.630
And so she had taught her
English, and she's now a teacher

00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:59.340
in the middle school
and high school there,

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:00.640
which we thought was pretty neat.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.570
And so I'm going to
finish on this picture,

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:06.210
which is my aunt again talking to
some of the high school students.

00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:10.430
These girls probably are your age,
and they're the ones that have gone

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:12.280
on to high school, and
they're actually taught

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.610
in English at this point.

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:19.730
English is the language of
teaching at the high school level.

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:24.120
So that leaves us with five
minutes before I start asking --

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.750
well I will start asking questions.

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:27.910
I'm going to let you ask
me questions in a minute,

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:30.970
but I'm going to ask
you a few questions.

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:35.130
I've brought with me
some Ethiopian artifacts.

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:41.840
And I'm going to get them
out and show then to you.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:51.710
So first of all, this is --
well obviously it's a map.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:30:01.870
I think it's a U.S. -- I've
got to read what it says on it

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:04.190
so I don't give you
poor information.

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:10.540
Yes. It's put out by the Defense
Mapping Agency Aerospace Center.

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:14.250
So it's -- they put out
a big series of maps.

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:20.220
But this is basically a great
big enormous air defense map

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.520
of Ethiopia.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:27.690
And its also got a quite a
bit of [inaudible] in it.

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:34.530
So if you looked at a map of the
United States or of the east coast,

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:37.460
there would actually be a whole
bunch of population centers in it.

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:41.190
And as you can see, most
of this is mountain.

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:42.990
All that bit is desert.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:44.820
That is the [inaudible] desert.

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:49.960
It is the hottest place in the
world, and it's below sea level.

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:56.840
So that's quite a bit of
[inaudible] going on there.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:03.540
Now these things --
I'll pass them around.

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:06.130
You can take a look.

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.920
I have some coins here.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:16.660
I'm going to pass around a few of
them so you can each get a look.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:19.630
But these are just regular stuff,

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:24.060
and this is a little
silver cross [inaudible].

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:37.970
This is a little silver
cross, and these --

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:40.560
lots and lots of country
kids wear these.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:45.360 position:56%
They're made out of -- they're
hammered out of the previous coinage

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:49.060
which is the standard
money that they used

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:57.350
up until very recently was the
Maria Theresa silver dollar,

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:59.860
some of which were 200 years old.

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.130
A lot of them got turned
into those crosses.

what this thing is?

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:46.960
Also a good guess.

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.430
It's not a musical instrument, so
it's not a flute, not a drum stick.

No, it's not for smoking.

it's something you put

in your mouth is on the right track.

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:07.410

Toothbrush is exactly what it is.

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:13.300
It doesn't have bristles.

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.710
It's a stick made of eucalyptus.

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:20.530
And this bit on the end is just
carving to make it look pretty.

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:23.190
This bit they've peeled the
bark off, and what you do

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:26.900
with it is you just stick
it in your mouth and scrape.

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:30.490
Eucalyptus is like mint flavor.

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:32.600
Eucalyptus trees grow everywhere.

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.670
They were imported, but
they grow really fast

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:38.320

doesn't -- that's quite old.

any kind of flavor anymore.

Actually, in Jamaica
we did a lot of that.

We just picked everything
and ate it.

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:16.620
I don't know why.

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:20.670
But we're still alive, so --
does it really brush your teeth?

I mean, yeah.

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:23.270
I think it does.

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:27.260
Basically, if you think about
it, what a toothbrush does,

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:30.400
is it just scrapes the plaque
off your teeth essentially.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.240
So I mean, you can do
it with your fingernail.

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:38.670
So a piece of wood that's a little
bit flavored would do a pretty good

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:41.450
job of keeping your teeth clean.

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:47.030 position:56%
So yeah, in answer to what this is,
it's used in a ritual and it is used

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:51.350
to stick a coffee pot in
because Ethiopian coffee pots --

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:55.040

me just ruin all the Library

sure you can see in this --

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:04.380
you can't really but
you get an idea.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:05.680
They're round.

It can't stand up on its own so it
needs -- this is called [inaudible],

but the coffee pot wouldn't.

to write your book, what --

what made you come up with
the title of the book?

Okay, that's actually --

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.790
it's not the most original
question in the world,

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:58.270
but it's a great question
for this book

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:01.780
because this has a funny
story behind the title.

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:06.930
I had -- it's not funny ha ha,
it's kind of funny peculiar.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:10.790
For my previous book, Rose Under
Fire, I had struggled and struggled

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:14.760
and struggled with the title and
nobody liked the title that I liked

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.610
for it because they thought

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:18.540
that it sounded too much
like a fantasy novel.

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:25.850
I wanted to call it The Subtle
[inaudible], which was a reference

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:31.040
to a poem that one of the people
who was in the book had written,

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:34.150
and everybody said, "No, it doesn't
really match Code Name Verity.

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:35.620 position:56%
We want these books to be connected.

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:39.190
It sounds too much like fantasy
so we're not going to use it."

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:44.600 position:56%
So I had thought for this book the
characters of the children's mothers

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:47.980
who -- they're actually a
flying team, so they're --

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:54.390
in the 1920's [inaudible]
mother and M's mother perform

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:59.870
in flying circuses, and their
performer titles are Black Dove

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:01.170
and White Raven.

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:02.470
They are the black dove
and the white raven.

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:07.450
And then the kids later on take
these names and kind of turn them

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:08.890
into their own names and make

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:11.800
up these super heroes
based around them.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:17.020
And I thought when I was working
on this book that Black Dove,

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:20.570
White Raven would be a good
title, but I didn't suggest it

00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:22.930
because I thought everybody's
going to say that just sounds

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:25.210
like a fantasy title again.

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:27.440
So they were asking me for
titles, and I was coming

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:31.290 position:56%
up with [inaudible] Children,The
Pilot's Children, all kinds of stuff

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:35.850 position:56%
like this, and one of my editors
came back to me and said, "You know,

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:37.450
I was thinking Black Dove,

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:41.260
White Raven might be a really
good title for this book."

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:47.130
So she and I came up with the
same title completely separately.

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:52.240
And when she said that to me, I
was just like, "Yep, that's it."

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.030
If we both thought
of that on our own,

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:58.260
then that clearly is
the right title for it.

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:03.560
&gt;&gt; So I wasn't clearly
sure on what you said,

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:11.520
but were your little sister and
Carlton, were they like kind

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.780
of your inspiration
for the little girl?

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:15.080
I mean, for the --

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:16.380
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Wein: Yeah.

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:19.210
I mean it was partly based on them.

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:21.610
I didn't actually make
that very clear.

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:25.440
So they lived -- they both lived
in the same house, and they played

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.460
with other and they were fed
together and they bathed together.

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:30.590
They did everything
together until they were two.

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:33.940
At which point, we left
Jamaica,taking my little sister

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:36.980
with us and Carlton and
Rona stayed in Jamaica

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:38.280
because they were Jamaican.

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:40.800
And these kids never
saw each other again.

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:45.450
So my idea was really
what would have happened

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:48.580
if they had grown up together?

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:52.470
How would their relationship
have developed?

00:39:52.470 --> 00:40:00.840
And so that was kind of what I was
playing with when I wrote the book.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:06.330 position:56%
&gt;&gt; How long did it take you to write
the Black Dove, White Raven book?

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:08.910
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Wein: It took about --

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:14.170
I think it was about
a year and a half.

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:17.500
It might have -- it was
about a year and a half.

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:22.490
It was the hardest book I have ever
written, and it was kind of behind.

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:27.770
I had a deadline for it, and I
kept getting them to extend it.

00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:33.600
And I think it was
about a year and a half.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.200
Part of the reason
it was so hard was

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:39.490
because I really didn't know
much about Ethiopia in 1935.

00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:43.880
I knew a lot about Ethiopia
in the sixth century

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:46.880
because I'd written some
other books about it.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:51.470
But I had to do a lot of research
for the background history,

00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:53.420
and doing that and writing the book

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:56.270
at the same time I
found very hard work.

00:40:56.270 --> 00:41:00.760
But it was about a year and a half.

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:04.200
&gt;&gt; Okay, so did you show your
Mom or your Dad the story?

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.500
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Wein: Oh, no.

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.970
The answer to this
question is really sad

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:12.240
because my Mom died when I was 14.

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:13.540
It's all right.

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.050
It was a long time ago now.

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:19.210 position:56%
And my father also died quite young.

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:20.970
So he died when I was about 20.

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:25.980
So neither of my parents ever
got to see my finished books.

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:31.160 position:56%
So partly what was going on in Black
Dove, White Raven was the character

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:34.420
who is the mother, she's
actually a very strong character

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:38.750 position:56%
in this book, is based on my mother.

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:44.540
So no, they haven't seen any
of my books, but I was --

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:47.830
I've really been thinking the
past week my mother would be

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:49.610
so proud of this book.

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:58.780
She was -- you guys
are really sweet.

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:04.450
She would just be so -- she was
a very forward thinking woman.

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:06.490
She loved living in Jamaica.

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:10.770
She was really kind of involved
in the civil rights movement

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:13.320
in the 1960's, and
she would be really,

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:17.530
really proud that this book has won
the Children's Africana Book Award

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:27.600 position:56%
and also that I'm here talking to
you guys in the Library of Congress.

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.090
She'd be thrilled with that.

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:33.700
&gt;&gt; Okay, so out of all
the books that you made,

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:36.180
is there one that you
like would favor?

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:39.280
Is there one that's your favorite?

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:43.370
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Wein: I don't
really like to choose favorites

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:48.460 position:56%
because they all have kind of
different -- such different meaning.

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:50.690
There's so many different things
going on in them, so this is kind

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:52.600
of the tribute to my mother.

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:56.030
Rose Under Fire, the one
that I wrote before this,

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:58.520
was really important
to me because it was

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:00.850
about a woman's concentration camp

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:04.220
that not many people know much
about, and I felt like in writing

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:08.960
that book I was bringing to
a wider audience something

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.740
that needed to be told.

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:12.950
But Code Name Verity, it has

00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:17.540
to be said is the book
that changed my life.

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:21.460
So for maybe not the right reasons,

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:25.260
Code Name Verity is
probably my favorite.

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:29.620
Without the strengths and
the success of that book,

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:32.190
I wouldn't be here today.

00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:34.420
And that's really true.

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:38.610
So that's probably the
one that is fondest to me.

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:42.380
Yes. Oh, you have the mic, sorry.

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:48.040
&gt;&gt; If you saw Peaches and the
others again, what would you do?

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.650
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Wein: We would
probably all start crying

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:51.250
and running to each other's arms.

00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:55.430
I have actually tried to find
these people on the internet

00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:56.960
and have not been able to.

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.910
I do actually still have
some Jamaican friends.

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:05.420
My best friend from school in
Jamaica now lives in England,

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:13.040
nd she had quite a large family
who I'm in contact with a lot.

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:19.140
So I do actually still have some
really good friends from Jamaica,

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:23.150
but this particular family
I have lost touch with.

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:25.730
We would -- there would
be a tearful reunion.

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:29.930
&gt;&gt; How many books have
you made so far?

00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:34.620 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Wein: Black Dove, White
Raven is my eighth published novel.

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:42.220
I have another one
that is in the works.

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:44.450 position:56%
So by next year, there will be nine,

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:49.390
but I've written I don't know how
many more that I didn't actually --

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:51.570
that haven't actually
been published.

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:57.380
Some of them haven't been published
for kind of frustrating reasons

00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:02.070
of marketing but most of them just
aren't good enough to be published.

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:05.820
So eight is the -- oh no,
that's not the easy answer

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:07.120
because I've forgotten.

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:11.670
I actually had written five
more under a pseudonym.

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:13.940
I always forget about
those so I don't know.

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:15.480
There's no easy answer
to that question,

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:19.830
but let's say eight
under my own name.

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:24.400 position:56%
&gt;&gt; When you was little, was there
-- before when you was really little

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:27.230
and you started reading the
comic, was there a specific person

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:30.840
to inspire you to write the book
or did you just like to write?

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:33.450
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Wein: I
really just liked to write.

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:37.090
So when I was reading that
comic,I wasn't thinking I want

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:39.500
to write stuff like this even
though I was going to write it.

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:42.750
I was more thinking I
want to be this person.

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:47.780
I was really kind of -- I was
relating to the characters.

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:53.340
I wanted to have adventures
and to do exciting things.

00:45:53.340 --> 00:46:02.180
It kind of -- it was kind of tied
up in my head together wanting

00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:05.100
to make the story but also
wanting to live that life.

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:07.830
And again, I think I've
put some of that in there

00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:11.790
where particularly the
character M really relates

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:14.160
to her super her character,
White Raven,

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:17.020
and she kind of thinks what would
White Raven do all the time to try

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:20.340
to make herself do the right thing
or do the brave thing whatever.

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:25.770
So that kind of question of
identity of wanting to write

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:32.230
and putting yourself into a story
is something that I think a lot

00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:35.140
of writers they kind
of go hand in hand.

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:36.450
Does that make sense?

00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:38.730
Okay, good.

00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:42.400
&gt;&gt; From living in Jamaica,
how would you be able

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:45.380
to relate it to like living here?

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:47.400
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Wein: Living in --

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:51.020
okay so like the difference between
living in Jamaica and living here

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.400
or how does that influence me?

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:55.410
&gt;&gt; The difference.

00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:56.710
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Wein: The difference.

00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:59.910
When I came -- I was
-- because I started --

00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:02.150
can you pass the mic to the back

00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:08.120
because I think people
there are losing out.

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:11.960
When I first came here,
I was 9 years old.

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:17.420 position:56%
So I left the U.S. when I was 3, and
I didn't come back until I was 9.

00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:23.200
So essentially my earliest
memories are not of living

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.340 position:56%
in the U.S., and it was really hard.

00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:28.080
It was really hard adjusting.

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:30.800
Everybody thought I'd
come from Puerto Rico.

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.140
Nobody had heard of Jamaica.

00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:34.550
[Inaudible] in that place.

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:40.580
I felt like nobody understood me
and it was hard to [inaudible].

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:42.920
I was again an immigrant.

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:46.900
So that's I think one of the
reasons I do a lot of writing

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:48.570
about people who are displaced.

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:54.910
&gt;&gt; How -- what place is this book?

00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:59.080
Which place is this
book influenced off of?

00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:05.240
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Wein: What was
the last part of that question?

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:08.780
&gt;&gt; So this book, which place
was it influenced from?

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:10.080
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Wein: Oh, okay.

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:12.510
Well, obviously it's
set in Ethiopia,

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:17.400 position:56%
but it was really my experience of
living in Jamaica that influenced it

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:20.880
because the kids in this
story, they're living

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:22.970
in a place that's not their own.

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:26.980
They're living in an
unfamiliar, very foreign country.

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:30.750
And they learned to
speak the local language,

00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:35.420
but they are still
obviously foreigners.

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:39.840
So that kind of a relationship
with the country is something

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:43.390
that I drew on living in Jamaica.

00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:47.200
But also just kind of a celebration
of the countryside because one

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:50.800 position:56%
of the things that we did in Jamaica
I would say we ate everything.

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:55.620
We just -- we ran up and
down everybody's backyards

00:48:55.620 --> 00:49:00.110
and climbed all their trees, and
we picked fruit and we just kind

00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:03.970
of climbed on people's
roofs and just all this --

00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:10.180 position:56%
all that kind of running wild and
feeling very comfortable and at home

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:14.380
in the landscape is something
that was true for me in Jamaica,

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:16.580
and I took that and put it

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:20.060
in this book even though I hadn't
actually experienced living

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:22.370
in Ethiopia.

00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:27.390
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: This will
be our last question.

00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:32.760
&gt;&gt; Are all your books
influenced off of war in Ethiopia?

00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.290
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Wein: No.

00:49:34.290 --> 00:49:38.250
My first two -- the question
was are all my books --

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:41.490
have they all been influenced
by the war in Ethiopia?

00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:45.970
This is the only one
that has anything to do

00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:48.950
with the Italian invasion
of Ethiopia.

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:51.240
Code Name Verity and Rose
Under Fire are both set

00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:54.110
in Europe during World War II.

00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:58.780
So the one thing that they all have
in common is they all have women

00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:04.110
as pilots in them, young
women learning to fly,

00:50:04.110 --> 00:50:06.870
which is something you'd
like to keep your minds open

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:11.360
and just remember that you can do
too if you ever get the chance.

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:15.010
And I think that unfortunately
is the last question

00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:17.310
that you guys get to ask me.

00:50:17.310 --> 00:50:18.940
So now I'm going to turn
it back over to Pam.

00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:20.240
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: So please,

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:21.540
let's give Elizabeth
Wein a round of applause.

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:33.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Wein: Can I also say
thank you to you for coming out here

00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:36.940
and for sitting andlistening
and asking great questions

00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:42.790
because it is the best thing about
being a writer is to get to talk

00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:47.670
to people who are interested
in what you have to say.

00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:49.510
So thank you.

00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:54.530
[ Applause ]

00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:58.180
