00:00:00.228 --> 00:00:02.226
Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.226 --> 00:00:04.836
I know when you think about archery you think about Nottingham,

00:00:04.836 --> 00:00:07.278
and one guy in particular, Robin Hood.

00:00:07.278 --> 00:00:10.413
But I'm gonna tell you about a guy today in my home town

00:00:10.413 --> 00:00:13.457
that might even be better than Robin Hood.

00:00:13.457 --> 00:00:14.774
You're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:00:14.774 --> 00:00:15.395
(someone in distance) - Hey!

00:00:15.395 --> 00:00:16.195
Hey, he might!

00:00:16.195 --> 00:00:17.265
- (Brady Haran)  Better than Robin Hood?

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:19.791
(Destin) [UK accent] He might be!! [laughs] Let's check it out, we'll see.

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:22.799
You gonna agree with me Ms. Wanda?

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:23.995
- I will.

00:00:23.995 --> 00:00:26.959
(Destin) For years in high school I heard about this famous archer in town

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:28.837
that can hit anything you threw at him.

00:00:28.837 --> 00:00:31.685
And now I'm at his house drinking his sweet tea.

00:00:32.855 --> 00:00:34.598
- I shot that moose in Newfoundland.

00:00:34.598 --> 00:00:35.983
- This is Byron Ferguson.

00:00:35.983 --> 00:00:39.824
He and his wife travel all over the world doing exhibition shooting at live events.

00:00:39.824 --> 00:00:44.379
I politely asked if what I heard was true and if I could make a slow motion video about what he does.

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.769
So Byron you wanna tell em what we're gonna do today?

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:49.903
- Well what we're gonna do today is some exhibition shooting,

00:00:49.903 --> 00:00:52.854
starting with a wooden disk tossed up in the air

00:00:52.854 --> 00:00:55.589
and then we'll see what the smallest target is we can hit.

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:56.699
- Alright.

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.893
-  But first we gotta hit this wooden disk.

00:00:57.893 --> 00:00:59.886
- Start with the wood disk, work our way down.

00:00:59.886 --> 00:01:02.191
We've got a Phantom Miro, that's kind of why I'm here,

00:01:02.191 --> 00:01:03.257
I'm running the high speed camera.

00:01:03.257 --> 00:01:04.431
So, let me get to that.

00:01:05.141 --> 00:01:08.846
[music]

00:01:08.846 --> 00:01:10.846
 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:25.390
[Crash] (Destin) Impressive,

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.077
but let's quantify exactly how difficult that was.

00:01:28.077 --> 00:01:30.723
In geometry there's an equation for something called circle packing.

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:33.317
It's a way to determine how many little circles of a certain size

00:01:33.317 --> 00:01:34.863
you can fit inside of a bigger circle.

00:01:34.863 --> 00:01:39.066
You can pack 310 arrows into the presented area of the wooden disk.

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:44.206
The next target cuts the circle packing number down from 310 to only 55.

00:01:44.206 --> 00:01:47.531
(Destin) How did daddy convince you to throw stuff for him the first time?

00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:49.573
- I had no choice. He told me to do it, so I had to.

00:01:49.573 --> 00:01:50.512
- [laughs]

00:02:00.772 --> 00:02:02.637
(Destin) Alright, he hit that too.

00:02:02.637 --> 00:02:06.255
Let's cut the circle packing number down from 55 to 21.

00:02:06.255 --> 00:02:08.741
According to geometry, this is over twice as hard.

00:02:19.601 --> 00:02:21.180
[Bump sound] OK how's he doing this?

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.068
I can understand how a modern archer can do this with a compound bow

00:02:24.068 --> 00:02:26.233
because he has a really complicated sighting system.

00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:29.016
The archer looks at the sighting pins at the front of the bow

00:02:29.016 --> 00:02:31.535
using a peep sight that's attached to his string in the back.

00:02:31.535 --> 00:02:34.669
These pins are aligned based on a bunch of different ballistic variables

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:37.218
like the tension of the bow and the weight of the arrow etc.

00:02:37.218 --> 00:02:39.970
Byron Ferguson does not shoot a modern bow.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.521
He shoots a longbow that he designs himself,

00:02:42.521 --> 00:02:44.690
and he doesn't have any form of sights on it.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.691
His brain is like a ballistic fire control computer.

00:02:47.691 --> 00:02:50.530
It's not just about accuracy though, it's also about timing.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.962
Once he figures out where the target is going to be,

00:02:52.962 --> 00:02:56.695
then he has to be accurate enough and well timed enough with a 70lb bow

00:02:56.695 --> 00:02:58.049
to hit that target.

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.385
So he can hit a golf ball.

00:02:59.385 --> 00:03:04.194
Let's go to something over 4 times more difficult, a life saver.

00:03:04.194 --> 00:03:06.194
 

00:03:06.194 --> 00:03:08.194
[Clank]

00:03:08.194 --> 00:03:10.194
 

00:03:10.194 --> 00:03:12.194
[Swoosh]

00:03:12.194 --> 00:03:14.194
 

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.194
[Crunch... Pooof]

00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:20.269
This is amazing, but we are at our last option,

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.624
a single aspirin tablet.

00:03:25.404 --> 00:03:28.344
Finally, a miss. Well, kind of.

00:03:28.344 --> 00:03:30.894
According to the high speed his accuracy was dead on.

00:03:30.894 --> 00:03:32.898
You can see that the aspirin tablet jumped

00:03:32.898 --> 00:03:34.229
straight up from the arrow shaft

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:36.098
which means he was lined up perfectly.

00:03:36.098 --> 00:03:40.490
His timing however was off by a whopping 8 milliseconds.

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:43.241
Obviously, this is still super impressive.

00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:45.376
Byron however is disappointed,

00:03:45.376 --> 00:03:46.829
and asks me if he could do it again.

00:04:20.065 --> 00:04:21.706
The rumors were true.

00:04:21.706 --> 00:04:27.050
There's a guy from my home town in Alabama that can literally hit anything you throw at him with a bow and arrow.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.796
Let's see what he has to say about how he does it.

00:04:29.796 --> 00:04:33.080
- People ask me all the time how can you hit an aspirin tablet?...

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.868
Cause I'm shooting at the center.

00:04:36.078 --> 00:04:40.108
The center of the aspirin tablet is exactly the same size as the center of a beach ball.

00:04:40.538 --> 00:04:42.305
Always shoot at the center.

00:04:42.305 --> 00:04:46.645
- The center of an aspirin tablet is the exact same size as the center of a beach ball.

00:04:46.645 --> 00:04:47.475
- Correct.

00:04:47.475 --> 00:04:48.524
- It's just a point isn't it?

00:04:49.544 --> 00:04:50.880
- A very minute point.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.679
- Pretty awesome.

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.465
Alright, that was one of the more manly episodes of Smarter Every Day.

00:04:55.465 --> 00:04:58.347
And another manly activity.. [gunshot].. is shaving.

00:04:58.347 --> 00:05:00.246
That brings us to our sponsor today.

00:05:00.246 --> 00:05:01.249
Weapon is safe.

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:02.187
On Smarter Every Day.

00:05:02.187 --> 00:05:03.798
The sponsor is Harrys.com.

00:05:03.798 --> 00:05:07.522
I actually used Harrys before they were a sponsor for Smarter Every Day so I'm not just saying this,

00:05:07.522 --> 00:05:09.241
it actually is a product that I use and I like it.

00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:13.633
You go to Harrys.com and use the promo code "SMARTER" and you get a really cool shave kit.

00:05:13.633 --> 00:05:16.052
The way it works is they send you the razor,

00:05:16.052 --> 00:05:17.185
they send you the refills,

00:05:17.185 --> 00:05:20.767
and the way it works is, once it goes bad you just pop the old one off,

00:05:20.767 --> 00:05:23.086
pop the new one on and you're good to go.

00:05:23.086 --> 00:05:24.001
It works really well.

00:05:24.001 --> 00:05:25.237
This one's called the Winston, this one's called the Truman.

00:05:25.237 --> 00:05:27.370
The Truman comes in a bunch of different colors.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.108
But if you want to support Smarter Every Day,

00:05:29.108 --> 00:05:31.989
go to Harrys.com, use the promo code Smarter.

00:05:31.989 --> 00:05:33.729
It actually ends up to be pretty cheap.

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:35.924
It's cheaper than those disposable ones at the grocery store.

00:05:35.924 --> 00:05:37.100
These are better too.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.452
5 blades. I like it.

00:05:38.452 --> 00:05:39.264
So there you go.

00:05:39.264 --> 00:05:40.236
I think you'll enjoy it.

00:05:40.236 --> 00:05:42.133

Have a good one.

00:05:51.443 --> 00:05:52.261
- Byron Ferguson?

00:05:52.261 --> 00:05:52.892
- Yes!

00:05:52.892 --> 00:05:54.550
- He's awesome! Forget Robin Hood!

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.517
[laughs]

00:05:55.517 --> 00:05:57.846
I mean, could you show us a video about Byron Ferguson?

00:05:57.846 --> 00:06:00.597
- I can. Let's do that right now. [laughs]

00:06:00.597 --> 00:06:02.571
And another manly activity is..

00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:03.406
[gunshot]

00:06:03.406 --> 00:06:04.672
missing what you're shooting at.

00:06:04.672 --> 00:06:06.537
- You don't put that arrow on the string,

00:06:06.537 --> 00:06:07.775
you just hold it like that.

00:06:07.775 --> 00:06:08.769
- Yeah.

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:11.453
- And then, right down the lens.

00:06:11.453 --> 00:06:13.973
- [laughs] That is so messed up looking.

00:06:13.973 --> 00:06:15.883
Well there's two different types of razors.

00:06:15.883 --> 00:06:18.891
The one that I use a lot is called.. [gunshot].. the Winston.

00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:21.674
But there's another one that you can use called the Truman.

00:06:21.674 --> 00:06:22.679
[gunshot]

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:28.064
[laughter]

00:06:28.064 --> 00:06:29.259
Did you learn down here on the creek?

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:31.360
- Some of it, yep.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.142
- Flint Creek?

00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:33.618
- Flint Creek shooting at garfish.

00:06:33.618 --> 00:06:35.881
- There's a lot of stuff learned down on Flint Creek isn't it?

00:06:35.881 --> 00:06:37.630
[laughs]

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.630
 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.630
[Sound of an arrow hitting a target]
