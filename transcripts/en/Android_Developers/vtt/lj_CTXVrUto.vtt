00:00:00.852 --> 00:00:02.560
SPEAKER: Configuring
the Android Emulator

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.130
is easy with the AVD
wizard in Android Studio.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.820
It offers default settings for
optimal Emulator performance.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.801
If you want to double-check your
AVDS are configured correctly

00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:14.800
and your machine can run
them with full hardware

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.110
acceleration, follow
these few steps.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.860
First of all, check that your
CPU supports the required

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.110
virtualization extensions.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.500
On Windows and Mac, only
Intel VTX is supported,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.320
and the necessary virtualization
software from Intel

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.310
is available through the SDK
manager inside Android Studio.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.250
On some machines, VTX
is disabled by default.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.860
In that case, please refer
to your motherboard or laptop

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.800
manual on how to enable it.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.470
If you're using Linux,
both the Intel VTX

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.900
and the AMDV
virtualization technologies

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.360
are supported through KVM.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.850
In our documentation
pages, linked below,

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.430
we provide information
on how to check if KVM

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.740
is installed in your system.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.890
Now that we have the most
difficult part out of the way,

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.920
let's go through the
AVD creation process.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.050
On the first screen,
select a device skin

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.430
that you'd like to
use for development.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.030
If you don't have
a high-end GPU,

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.590
you might benefit from
choosing a device with a lower

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.210
resolution.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.140
You can always change the
size later by editing the AVD.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.300
Next, choose the system image.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.070
There are three important
guidelines for this step.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.150
Choose one of the more recent
releases with a higher API

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.060
level number, as those
contain the newest fixes

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.980
and optimizations.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.620
Mak, sure you're
selecting an x86 image,

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.890
and also one marked as
having Google APIs, which

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.650
means you'll be able to test
apps that make use of Google

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.070
Play Services or integrate with
some core apps such as Google

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.660
Maps.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.240
On the last step, you can
select from different graphics

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.030
acceleration modes,
but leaving it on Auto

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.100
should detect your
GPU capabilities

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.410
and select the best mode to run.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.970
If you're having
problems, it's best

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.280
to always make sure that
your graphics drivers are up

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.840
to date.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.580
You can read more
about the various GPU

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.630
settings in our documentation,
also linked in the description.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.780
If you encounter any bugs
when running the Emulator,

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.330
please read the Android
Studio bug finding process

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.058
and report them using
the Issue Tracker.

00:02:12.058 --> 00:02:13.901
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:13.901 --> 00:02:15.400
