DAN MOTZENBECKER: Hey, I'm Dan.

00:00:08.307 --> 00:00:10.640
It's a little experiment I
made called thing translator.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.099
Lets you point your
camera at stuff

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:14.014
to hear how to say it
in a different language.

00:00:21.545 --> 00:00:23.045
DAN MOTZENBECKER:
It's a little hack

00:00:23.045 --> 00:00:25.100
using two of Google's
machine learning APIs,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.049
Cloud Vision, and Translate.

00:00:27.049 --> 00:00:27.840
You take a picture,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.230
[CAMERA CLICK]

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.840
--send it to the
Cloud Vision API,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.310
which returns a list of
labels for what it sees

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.000
and confidence
scores for each one.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.720
I take the top one and send
it to the Translate API

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.620
to translate it.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.069
And that's pretty much it.

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:40.777
It can do a bunch of
different languages.

00:00:40.777 --> 00:00:43.370

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.890
too, since it's all
built for the web--
