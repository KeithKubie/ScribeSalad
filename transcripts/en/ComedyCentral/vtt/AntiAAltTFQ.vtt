&gt;&gt; DUNCAN TRUSSELL: I'LL NEVER
KNOW HOW MUCH ACID HE PUT ON MY

00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:03.636
TONGUE BUT I DO KNOW.

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:07.740
THE LOOK ON MY FRIENDS' FACES
WAS THE LOOK THAT SOMEONE WOULD 

00:00:07.773 --> 00:00:10.610
HAVE AS THEY WERE WATCHING A
PERSON FALL BACKWARDS

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:12.645
INTO THE GRAND CANYON.

00:00:36.068 --> 00:00:37.637
&gt;&gt;ARI SHAFFIR: THANK YOU,
EVERYBODY.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.005
IF YOU DON'T KNOW, HERE'S WHAT
THE SHOW IS.

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:41.541
IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF PEOPLE AND
WE'RE ALL TELLING TRUE STORIES. 

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:43.776
HE'S GOT AN AMAZING PODCAST YOU
GUYS SHOULD ALL CHECK OUT

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.411
CALLED THE DUNCAN TRUSSEL FAMILY
HOUR

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:47.380
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY FRIEND
AND YOURS,

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:51.651
MR. DUNCAN TRUSSELL.

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:53.986
&gt;&gt; DUNCAN TRUSSELL: IN THE
SUMMER BETWEEN MY JUNIOR

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.524
SENIOR YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL, ME
AND A GROUP OF FRIENDS

00:00:58.557 --> 00:01:02.095
DECIDED THAT WE WERE GOING TO
A GRATEFUL DEAD CONCERT

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:04.831
IN CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA.
AND WE WERE GOING TO THE

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:07.300
CONCERT NOT BECAUSE WE LIKED THE
GRATEFUL DEAD, BUT BECAUSE WE

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:14.040
LOVED LSD AND ANY HIGH SCHOOL
STUDENT WORTH THEIR WEIGHT

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:17.143
IN SALT KNEW THAT IF YOU WANTED
TO GET ACID YOU JUST WOULD

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:20.480
GO TO WHEREVER THE GRATEFUL DEAD
WAS BECAUSE THE GRATEFUL DEAD,

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:21.681
THEY DON'T TOUR ANYMORE.

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:24.550
BUT IN THOSE DAYS, IN THE 90S,
THERE WAS AN UNDOCUMENTED

00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:29.122
ACID BOOM, YOU COULD TRACE THE
FLOW OF LSD THROUGH AMERICA

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:32.225
BY FOLLOWING THE TOURING
SCHEDULE  OF THE GRATEFUL DEAD.

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:35.561
NO JOKE, THAT'S ON THE DEA
WEBSITE. YOU COULD LOOK,

00:01:35.594 --> 00:01:39.465
IT WOULD GO. THE GREATEFUL DEAD,
IT WAS LIKE A PSYCHEDELIC

00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:44.504
GODZILLA THAT WOULD JUST RAMPAGE
THROUGH AMERICA LEAVING BEHIND

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:49.575
NOT DESTRUCTION, BUT JUST
FREAKED OUT TRUST FUND KIDS,

00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:54.046
WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE JESUS AND
INFINTE SHEETS OF ACID.

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.550
IT WAS A TRUE ACID BOOM, IT
REALLY WAS

00:01:57.583 --> 00:02:00.119
WE JUST WANTED ACID BECAUSE,
NOT BECAUSE WE WANTED TO

00:02:00.152 --> 00:02:02.822
TRANSFORM THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF
AMERICA, BUT BECAUSE IF YOU

00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:05.124
HAD LSD WHEN YOU WERE IN
HIGH SCHOOL YOU WERE

00:02:05.157 --> 00:02:09.829
BASICALLY GANDALF. YOU HAD
MAGICAL POWERS.

00:02:09.862 --> 00:02:13.599
IF YOU HAD A HIT OF ACID YOU
COULD TRANSFORM THE HEAD 

00:02:13.632 --> 00:02:17.436
CHEERLEADER INTO A GOTH IN ONE
NIGHT JUST LIKE THAT.

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:20.940
IT WAS METAPHYSICAL; IT WAS A
VERY POTENT THING.

00:02:20.973 --> 00:02:24.877
THAT'S WHY WE WANTED THE ACID,
ALSO THE FACT THAT TAKING LSD

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.046
IN THE MORNING WHEN YOU'RE IN
HIGH SCHOOL HELPS YOU

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.116
FORGET THE FACT THAT YOU'RE AT
AN INTERNMENT CAMP FOR

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:33.152
TEENAGERS BEING RUN BY THE STATE
WHICH IS REALLY NICE.

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:36.956
SO THE GRATEFUL DEAD. HAS
ANYONE EVER BEEN TO A GRATEFUL

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.961
DEAD SHOW? SO YOU KNOW, OH YEAH
YOU DEFINITELY HAVE, FRED.

00:02:41.994 --> 00:02:48.834
HOLY SHIT, YOU KNOW. THE
GRATEFUL DEAD PARKING LOT

00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:52.038
WAS THE FIRST BURNING MAN. THAT
WAS THE FIRST BURNING MAN.

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:55.675
THE GRATEFUL DEAD PARKING LOT
WAS BASICALLY AN OPEN AIR MARKET

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:59.512
FOR PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS AND I
REMEMBER AND I REMEMBER WHEN

00:02:59.545 --> 00:03:02.848
WE PULLED IN THERE, AND PARKED,
THE WORRY THAT WE WEREN'T GOING

00:03:02.881 --> 00:03:06.085
TO BE ABLE TO BUY A SHEET OF
ACID VANISHED WHEN SUDDENLY

00:03:06.118 --> 00:03:09.155
WE REALIZED THAT, THAT'S ALL
THIS IS.

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:12.358
NOBODY LIKES LISTENING TO THE
GRATEFUL DEAD, EVERYBODY

00:03:12.391 --> 00:03:16.028
JUST LIKES TAKING ACID AND THEY
FOLLOWED THIS BAND AROUND

00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:21.200
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE IT'S AT.
BUT YOU WOULD SIT IN YOUR CAR

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:25.838
AND FROM A DISTANCE AWAY YOU
WOULD HEAR SOMEBODY CALLING

00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:30.476
OUT INNOCENTLY,<i> BEER, COLD BEER
 FOR SALE, COLD BEER.</i>

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:33.813
YOU'D LOOK BACK, THERE'D BE A
VERY THIN HIPPIE HOLDING A

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:37.016
REALLY SMALL COOLER MAYBE COULD
HOLD A TWELVE PACK,

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.785
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. LIKE YOU
WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK

00:03:39.818 --> 00:03:41.654
AND REFILL IT A LOT IF HE WAS
SELLING BEERS.

00:03:41.687 --> 00:03:44.390
YOU'D SEE HIM WALKING,<i> BEER,
 BEER </i>

00:03:44.423 --> 00:03:48.527
BUT WHEN HE GOT BY YOUR CAR HE'D
BE LIKE<i> DOSES, ACID, MUSHROOM,</i>

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.731
<i>VALIUM, DOSES, ACID, MUSHROOMS.</i>

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:54.900
EVERYTHING WAS ABOUT SELLING
ACID. THERE WERE DEA AGENTS

00:03:54.933 --> 00:03:57.570
THERE, YOU WOULD SEE FROM TIME
TO TIME, IT WAS ONE OF THE

00:03:57.603 --> 00:04:00.006
MOST BEAUTIFUL THINGS EVER, A
HIPPIE WHO HAD BEEN BUSTED

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:02.742
WOULD COME TEARING THROUGH THE
PARKING LOT WITH THE COPS

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:06.512
CHASING HIM AND THE OTHER
HIPPIES WOULD JUST CLOSE IN LIKE

00:04:06.545 --> 00:04:10.316
A WHITE BLOOD CELL BLOCKING THE
COPS SO THAT HE COULDN'T GET

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.786
BUSTED. IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL THINGS YOU'VE EVER

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.257
SEEN. FRUSTRATED COPS, ALL THE
HIPPIES LOOK THE SAME, THEY'RE

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.661
ALL IN TIE-DYE. WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT FUCKING WAS.

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:22.895
IT WAS GREAT.

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:25.431
SO WE'RE SITTING IN THE CAR,
WE'VE MANAGED TO SAVE UP TWO 

00:04:25.464 --> 00:04:27.199
HUNDRED AND TEN DOLLARS, WE
FIGURE THAT'S ENOUGH TO BUY A

00:04:27.232 --> 00:04:30.336
SHEET OF ACID. WE'RE SITTING
THERE AND THIS WEIRD 

00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:33.506
HIPPIE WOMAN COMES UP NEXT TO
OUR CAR, POKES HER HEAD IN THE

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.442
CAR WINDOW AND SHE'S LIKE,<i> YOU
 BOYS WANT TO BUY SOME ACID?</i>

00:04:36.475 --> 00:04:40.146
<i> I'LL SELL YOU A SHEET FOR A
 HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS.</i>

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:42.615
WE'RE LIKE<i> FUCK, A HUNDRED AND
 TWENTY DOLLARS? THAT LEAVES</i>

00:04:42.648 --> 00:04:46.352
<i> EIGHTY DOLLARS FOR GRILLED
 CHEESE SANDWICHES, WE'RE SET.</i>

00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:52.358
SHE GETS IN THE CAR, OPENS UP
THIS TIE-DYE SATCHES AND 

00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:58.130
INSIDE IS A ZIPLOC BAG FILLED
WITH SHEETS OF ACID. MUST 

00:04:58.163 --> 00:05:01.233
HAVE BEEN A HUNDRED SHEETS OF
ACID IN THERE. OUR HANDS ARE

00:05:01.266 --> 00:05:04.537
SHAKING, WE GIVE HER THE MONEY.
SHE GIVES US THIS SHEET OF ACID,

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.006
VANISHES INTO THE CROWD AND
SUDDENLY WE'RE SITTING IN THE

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:13.145
CAR WITH THE HOLY GRAIL, A
FUCKING SHEET OF ACID, A

00:05:13.178 --> 00:05:17.283
SQUARE, WITH A HUNDRED
PERFORATED SQUARES INSIDE

00:05:17.316 --> 00:05:20.386
OF IT AND EACH OF THOSE
PERFORATIONS IS A HIT THAT

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.656
RESPRESENTS EIGHT HOURS OF
TALKING TO ALIENS.

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:29.261
THAT'S EIGHT HUNDRED HOURS OF
COMMUNING WITH THE UNIVERSE

00:05:29.294 --> 00:05:32.598
IN THIS SQUARE. THIS IS ENOUGH
TO LAST FOR THE REST OF THE

00:05:32.631 --> 00:05:36.135
SUMMER, AND INTO THE NEXT YEAR.
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT.

00:05:36.168 --> 00:05:39.071
AND THAT'S WHEN WE MET SATAN.

00:05:39.104 --> 00:05:44.243
AT THAT SECOND, A HIPPIE POKED
HIS HEAD THROUGH THE WINDOW

00:05:44.276 --> 00:05:47.947
BEFORE WE COULD EVEN PUT THIS
SHEET AWAY, IF IT HAD BEEN A COP

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.282
WE WOULD HAVE BEEN BUSTED
IMMEDIATELY, POKES HIS HEAD

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:53.619
THROUGH THE WINDOW, SEES US
STARING AT THIS SHEET OF ACID

00:05:53.652 --> 00:05:58.724
LIKE WE'RE GAZING INTO THE ARC
OF THE COVENANT. LOOKS AT IT,

00:05:58.757 --> 00:06:06.132
LOOKS AT US, IS LIKE,<i> WELCOME TO
IT, DUDES, WELCOME TO THE DEAD.</i>

00:06:06.165 --> 00:06:08.501
NOW MY FRIENDS ARE HYPNOTIZED BY
THIS GUY BECAUSE HE'S LIKE A

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:12.505
TRUE DEADHEAD. HE LOOKS LIKE A
PIRATE THAT FELL OUT OF A 

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:19.445
RAINBOW. HE'S WEARING A BANDANNA
WITH LIKE PSYCHEDELIC SKULLS AND

00:06:19.478 --> 00:06:23.849
TRIANGLES ALL OVER IT AND HE'S
GOT A BIG RED BEARD, A LAZY EYE.

00:06:23.882 --> 00:06:28.421
HE SMELLS LIKE HE FELL INTO A
VAT OF PATCHOULI, JUST REEKING

00:06:28.454 --> 00:06:31.924
OF PINE SOL AND BODY ODOR.

00:06:31.957 --> 00:06:35.594
AND MY FRIENDS LIKE ARE
IMMEDIATELY HYPNOTIZED BY

00:06:35.627 --> 00:06:38.364
THIS GUY, GUESS HE REPRESENTS
WHAT WE ALL WANTED TO BE IN

00:06:38.397 --> 00:06:41.500
SOME PART OF OURSELVES, SOME
WEIRD, FREE SOUL.

00:06:41.533 --> 00:06:44.570
YOU COULD JUST TELL THIS GUY HAD
BEEN FOLLOWING THE GRATEFUL DEAD

00:06:44.603 --> 00:06:50.009
MAYBE FOR A MILLION YEARS, LIKE
BEFORE THEY EVEN EXISTED HE

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:53.279
WAS FOLLOWING THEM IN THE DEPTHS
OF SPACE LIKE AFTER THE BIG

00:06:53.312 --> 00:06:57.082
BANG HE EXPLODED OUT OF IT AND
JUST STARTED FOLLOWING THE

00:06:57.115 --> 00:06:58.550
GRATEFUL DEAD.

00:06:58.583 --> 00:07:04.423
SO HE'S LIKE,<i> LISTEN, YOU GUYS,
 NOW YOU COULD TAKE THAT SHEET</i>

00:07:04.456 --> 00:07:09.829
<i>OF ACID BACK HOME WITH YOU, OR I
 COULD HELP YOU SELL IT AND WE</i>

00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:12.097
<i> COULD TURN IT OVER IN AN
 HOUR, AND WE COULD BUY</i>

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.432
<i> TWO SHEETS OF ACID.</i>

00:07:13.465 --> 00:07:17.603
IM LIKE,<i> I DON'T WANT TO SELL
IT, YOU GUYS. WHY DON'T WE JUST?</i>

00:07:17.636 --> 00:07:20.139
<i>NO, WE DON'T WANT TO SELL IT. I
 WANT TO TAKE IT BACK TO HIGH</i>

00:07:20.172 --> 00:07:24.009
<i>SCHOOL, MAN.</i> THE HIPPIE ZOOMS IN
ON ME, REALIZING I'M RESISTING,

00:07:24.042 --> 00:07:28.347
HE'S LIKE,<i> OPEN YOUR MOUTH,
 DUDE. I WANNA EVEN UP THIS </i>

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.751
<i>SHEET.</i> NOW THIS MAKES NO SENSE.
EVEN UP THE SHEET?

00:07:32.784 --> 00:07:36.021
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN? LIKE,
IT'S NOT SYMMETRICAL ENOUGH?

00:07:36.054 --> 00:07:38.624
YOU WANT TO MAKE IT MORE
AESTHETICALLY PLEASING WHEN YOU

00:07:38.657 --> 00:07:42.428
TRY TO SELL IT AT A GRATEFUL
DEAD CONCERT? BUT I OPENED MY

00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:45.965
MOUTH, AND I WATCH AS HIS HAND
MOVES FORWARD AND PUTS SOME

00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:48.968
AMOUNT OF ACID ONTO MY TONGUE.
I'LL NEVER KNOW HOW MUCH ACID

00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:52.771
HE PUT ON MY TONGUE BUT I DO
KNOW THE LOOK ON MY FRIENDS'

00:07:52.804 --> 00:07:57.176
FACES WAS THE LOOK THAT SOMEONE
WOULD HAVE AS THEY WERE

00:07:57.209 --> 00:08:05.084
WATCHING A PERSON FALL BACKWARDS
INTO THE GRAND CANYON.

00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:09.288
IT WAS A LOOK OF SUCH INTENSE
HORROR AND PITY AND SADNESS

00:08:09.321 --> 00:08:13.492
ALL ROLLED UP INTO THIS ONE
EXPRESSION. I KNEW THAT I WAS

00:08:13.525 --> 00:08:17.263
FUCKED. I KNEW LIKE,<i> OH I'M
 FUCKED.</i> WITHIN AN HOUR I'M

00:08:17.296 --> 00:08:18.998
HAVING THE BEST TRIP OF MY LIFE.

00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:23.969
IT'S INCREDIBLE. EVERYTHING
MAKES SENSE. THE ASPHALT IS

00:08:24.002 --> 00:08:27.473
WAVING AND BUBBLING AND THESE
BEAUTIFUL BUBBLES. SUDDENLY

00:08:27.506 --> 00:08:32.878
I REALIZE, OH NOW I KNOW WHAT
THE GRATEFUL DEAD ARE.

00:08:32.911 --> 00:08:35.748
THEY'RE WHAT'S LEFT OF THE
ELVES, THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE.

00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:36.916
THE DEAD HEADS ARE ELVES AND
THEY'RE FOLLOWING THE

00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:40.352
GRATEFUL DEAD AROUND BECAUSE
THEY'RE INTER-DIMENSIONAL

00:08:40.385 --> 00:08:45.157
FAIRY CREATURES. IM LOOKING INTO
THE SIDEWALK, INTO THE PAVEMENT

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:49.228
AND I CAN ACTUALLY SEE EGYPTIAN
WRITING, PRIMORDIAL SYMBOLS. IT

00:08:49.261 --> 00:08:55.100
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE HAS JUST GONE
AND PAINTED CONAN THE BARBARIAN

00:08:55.133 --> 00:09:00.406
RUNES ON EVERYWHERE. I WENT INTO
THE PORT-A-JOHN, THERE'S NOTHING

00:09:00.439 --> 00:09:04.276
WORSE ON EARTH THAN THE PORT-A-
JOHN OF A GRATEFUL DEAD CONCERT.

00:09:04.309 --> 00:09:09.114
IT'S HORRIBLE, BUT I WAS SO HIGH
AND HAPPY THAT IT WAS

00:09:09.147 --> 00:09:12.184
LIKE BEING IN HEAVEN. I WAS
LOOKING DOWN AND THE TOILET

00:09:12.217 --> 00:09:16.288
PAPER LOOKED LIKE THE WINGS OF
ANGELS FLAPPING. IT'S LIKE

00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:21.193
THIS IS HEAVEN IM SO GLAD WE MET
THAT HIPPIE, HE'S TEACHING ME.

00:09:21.226 --> 00:09:24.396
WE'RE LEAVING THAT NIGHT, MY
FRIEND LOOKS AT ME AND HE'S

00:09:24.429 --> 00:09:30.669
LIKE, DUNCAN,<i> MY FACE IS MELTING
 OFF MY HEAD RIGHT NOW.</i>

00:09:30.702 --> 00:09:33.739
IT SEEMED REALLY HILARIOUS TO ME
AT THE TIME.

00:09:33.772 --> 00:09:37.910
SO I LAUGH REALLY HARD, BUT I
HAD BEEN CHEWING ON A LITTLE

00:09:37.943 --> 00:09:43.082
PIECE OF DENIM THREAD THAT WAS
FALLING OFF OF MY CRAPPY CUT

00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:49.421
OFF SHORTS AND SO I SUCKED THAT
THREAD INTO MY THROAT AND

00:09:49.454 --> 00:09:53.759
STARTED COUGHING AND COUGHING
AND COUGHING.

00:09:53.792 --> 00:09:57.596
AND I STARTED THINKING LIKE,
<i> WAIT A MINUTE, I JUST INHALED</i>

00:09:57.629 --> 00:10:03.102
<i> A DEMIN THREAD INTO MY LUNGS.</i>
AND WITH THE WEIRD, EERIE

00:10:03.135 --> 00:10:07.806
CLARITY THAT PSYCHEDELICS GIVE
YOU, I COULD SEE INSIDE MY LUNGS

00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:12.678
I COULD SEE THE INNOCENT PINK OF
MY LUNGS SUDDENLY BEING

00:10:12.711 --> 00:10:17.116
INVADED BY A MAGGOT-LIKE THREAD
OF WHITE DEMIN WHICH WAS AT

00:10:17.149 --> 00:10:21.820
THAT VERY MOMENT BURROWING DOWN
INTO MY LUNGS WHICH HAD STARTED

00:10:21.853 --> 00:10:27.059
TO FROTH WITH PUSS AND BLOOD.
AND THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED I

00:10:27.092 --> 00:10:34.867
WAS DYING. I HAD INHALED A
STRING WHICH WAS IN MY LUNGS AND

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.703
MY LUNGS WERE HEMORRHAGING AND
THERE WAS NO WAY YOU COULD

00:10:37.736 --> 00:10:39.004 line:92%
SURVIVE THAT.

00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:42.274
THIS WAS BEFORE GOOGLE, YOU
COULDN'T GOOGLE,<i> CAN YOU DIE</i>

00:10:42.307 --> 00:10:45.911
<i> FROM INHALING A STRING?</i> SO I
DIDN'T WANT TO DISRUPT MY

00:10:45.944 --> 00:10:51.383
FRIENDS' WONDERFUL EVENING, BY
DYING IN FRONT OF THEM. SO I

00:10:51.416 --> 00:10:54.186
DIDN'T TELL THEM THAT I THOUGHT
I WAS DYING BECAUSE I

00:10:54.219 --> 00:10:56.989
HAD A STRING IN MY THROAT. BUT I
STARTED MAKING THESE NOISES

00:10:57.022 --> 00:10:57.723
EVERY FEW MINUTES. 

00:10:57.756 --> 00:11:03.996
[heaving]

00:11:04.029 --> 00:11:06.432
AND THEN LIKE I WOULD ASK THEM
KINDA OFFHAND LIKE,

00:11:06.465 --> 00:11:12.237
<i>HEY, YOU GUYS, LIKE IF SOMEBODY
 DID INHALE A STRING INTO THEIR</i>

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.908
<i>LUNGS, DO YOU THINK THEY'D DIE?</i>

00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:17.810
AND MY FRIENDS ARE LIKE,

00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:20.212
<i> YEAH, PROBABLY, YEAH, YOU'D
 PROBABLY DIE.</i>

00:11:20.245 --> 00:11:24.650
I WAS CERTAIN I WAS DYING AND WE
GOT TO THE HOLIDAY INN PARKING

00:11:24.683 --> 00:11:27.886
LOT WHERE WE WERE GONNA SPEND
THE NIGHT IN MY FRIEND'S CAR.

00:11:27.919 --> 00:11:34.927
GOT OUT OF THE CAR, IN THE
DISTANCE WE HEARD THIS [hissing]

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.963
WHICH IS THE SOUND OF NITROUS
OXIDE BEING RELEASED TO FILL 

00:11:37.996 --> 00:11:41.366
UP A BALLOON. NOW THAT SOUND HAS
THE SAME EFFECT ON HIPPIES

00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:46.505
THAT ICE CREAM TRUCK MUSIC HAS
ON KIDS. THEY GO IN THAT

00:11:46.538 --> 00:11:50.809
DIRECTION TO THAT SOUND. SO MY
FRIENDS ALL JUST STARTED, THEY

00:11:50.842 --> 00:11:53.479
JUST LEFT ME, MOVING IN THE
DIRECTION OF THE NITROUS OXIDE.

00:11:53.512 --> 00:11:57.015
AND I WENT INTO THE BACKSEAT OF
MY FRIEND'S CAR TO DIE, CERTAIN

00:11:57.048 --> 00:11:59.752
THAT THIS WAS IT, I WAS GOING TO
DIE.

00:11:59.785 --> 00:12:03.856
THIS THOUGHT OCCURS TO ME WHICH
IS LIKE,<i> WELL, SINCE I'M ALREADY</i>

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:09.328
<i>DYING, WHY DON'T I GO AND INHALE
 NITROUS OXIDE? BECAUSE MAYBE</i>

00:12:09.361 --> 00:12:11.897
<i> THAT'LL HELP THE BAD TRIP.</i>

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:16.001
THIS IS THE SAME IDEA IN DANTE'S
INFERNO WHICH IS THAT IF

00:12:16.034 --> 00:12:17.836
YOU WANT TO GET OUT OF HELL, YOU
DON'T GO TO THE SIDE OF HELL,

00:12:17.869 --> 00:12:21.974
YOU GO TO THE CENTER OF HELL,
AND CLIMB DOWN SATAN'S LEG.

00:12:22.007 --> 00:12:23.709
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT WOULD
HAPPEN IF I WENT AND DID

00:12:23.742 --> 00:12:29.248
NITROUS OXIDE. SO I GO AND FIND
MY FRIENDS, FIND THE

00:12:29.281 --> 00:12:33.652
NITROUS OXIDE TANK. THEY FILL
BALLONS UP WITH THIS GAS,

00:12:33.685 --> 00:12:37.856
I INHALE THE GAS, AND THAT IS
WHEN I HAD THE MOST BEAUTIFUL

00:12:37.889 --> 00:12:40.692
AND INCREDABLE EXPERIENCES OF MY
LIFE.

00:12:40.725 --> 00:12:44.263
SUDDENLY I WAS NO LONGER A
TEENAGER IN HIGH SCHOOL, AT

00:12:44.296 --> 00:12:47.699
THE GRATEFUL DEAD CONCERT, DYING
WITH A STRING IN HIS THROAT.

00:12:47.732 --> 00:12:52.137
SUDDENLY I WAS EVERYTHING. I
BECAME THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:55.073
THERE WAS THIS MOMENT WHERE
THERE WAS NO MORE ME,

00:12:55.106 --> 00:12:57.810
JUST THIS WAVE OF ETERNAL
CONSCIOUSNESS. A KIND OF

00:12:57.843 --> 00:13:01.847
NEVER ENDING LOVE FIELD THAT
EXISTS THROUGH ALL THINGS.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:07.186
I WAS GONE, IN PARADISE FOR A
MOMENT. AND THEN AS I STARTED

00:13:07.219 --> 00:13:09.955
COMING TO IT WAS LIKE I WAS
HOVERING OVER THIS--

00:13:09.988 --> 00:13:13.492
MY BODY, LOOKING DOWN ON MYSELF

00:13:13.525 --> 00:13:17.696
AS THE UNIVERSE. AND I WAS
THINKING,<i> UGH, LOOK AT THAT</i>

00:13:17.729 --> 00:13:23.035
<i> POOR, POOR KID. HE'S GOT A
 STRING IN HIS THROAT AND</i>

00:13:23.068 --> 00:13:30.375
<i>HE'S, HE'S GONNA DIE. OH, I FEEL
 SO HORRIBLE FOR HIM.</i>

00:13:30.408 --> 00:13:35.881
AND THEN, I ZOOMED BACK DOWN
INTO MYSELF AND IMMEDIATELY

00:13:35.914 --> 00:13:39.751
PASSED OUT, FALLING ON THE
GROUND. I CAME TO COUGHING,

00:13:39.784 --> 00:13:46.692
CHOKING, COUGHING AND I SPIT
INTO MY HAND A GLOB OF PERFECTLY

00:13:46.725 --> 00:13:54.132
HEALTHY MUCUS AND INSIDE OF IT
WAS A TINY STRING. AND THAT'S

00:13:54.165 --> 00:13:56.368
WHEN I REALIZED THERE WAS
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. AND TO

00:13:56.401 --> 00:13:59.238
THIS DAY I STILL REMEMBER THAT,
ANYTIME I GET WORRIED ABOUT

00:13:59.271 --> 00:14:02.875
ANYTHING I REMEMBER<i> COME ON,
 MAN, NO MATTER WHAT IT IS,</i>

00:14:02.908 --> 00:14:05.410
<i> IT'S JUST A STRING IN YOUR
 THROAT. THERE'S NOTHING TO</i>

00:14:05.443 --> 00:14:09.181
<i> WORRY ABOUT, BECAUSE HUMAN
 BEINGS ARE ESSENTIALLY A</i>

00:14:09.214 --> 00:14:12.818
<i> STRING.</i> WE'RE JUST A STRING
CAUGHT IN THE THROAT OF

00:14:12.851 --> 00:14:17.122
ETERNITY. AND EVEN IF YOU'RE
DYING OF CANCER-- WELL, NO,

00:14:17.155 --> 00:14:23.228
THAT SUCKS, BUT. THE NEXT TIME
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR

00:14:23.261 --> 00:14:26.632
PHONE BILL OR WHATEVER IT IS,
JUST REMEMBER, IT'S

00:14:26.665 --> 00:14:28.800
ONLY A STRING IN YOUR THROAT,
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

00:14:28.833 --> 00:14:30.969
THANKS YOU GUYS, GOOD NIGHT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
