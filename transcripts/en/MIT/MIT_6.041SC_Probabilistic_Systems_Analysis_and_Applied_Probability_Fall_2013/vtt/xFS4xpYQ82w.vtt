00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.770
 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.900
In this problem, we're going
to look at the probability

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.090
that when you take a stick and
break it into three pieces

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.300
randomly that these three pieces
can actually be used to

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.560
form a triangle.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.300
All right, so we start
out with a stick of

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.010
unit length, so--

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.680
length 1.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.580
And we'll choose a point along
the stick to break.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.540
And we'll choose that point
uniformly at random.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.565
So let's say that we chose it
here, that was the point where

00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:33.380
we'll break it.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.180
And then independently of this
first choice we'll again

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.970
choose a second point
to break it.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.000
Again, uniformly at random
along the entire stick.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.780
So let's say the second point
we chose was here.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.560
So what we have now is, we'll
break it here, here, and so

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.610
we'll have three pieces--

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.310
the first one, the left
one and the right one.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.730
And we want to know, what's the
probability that when you

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.810
take these three pieces you
could form a triangle?

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.110
So the first thing we
should ask ourselves

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.200
is, what do you need--

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.050
what conditions must be
satisfied in order to actually

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.790
be able to form a triangle
with three pieces?

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.070
So you could think about, what
would stop you from being able

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.110
to do that?

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.130
Well, one possibility is
that you have pieces

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.380
that look like this.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.990
 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.910
So in that case you would
try to form something

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.540
that looks like this.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.800
But you can't get a triangle
because these two pieces are

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.990
too short and they can't
touch each other.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.220
So actually the condition that
must be satisfied is that when

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.490
you take any two of the three
pieces, their combined length

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.430
has to be greater than
the length of the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.200
remaining third piece.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.900
And that has to be true
for any two pieces.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.500
 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.590
And really that's just so that
any two pieces, they can touch

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.970
and still form a triangle.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.870
So let's try to add some
probability to this.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.440
So we have a unit
length stick.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.510
So let's actually give
a coordinate system.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.430
The stick goes from 0 to 1.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.120
And let's say that we break
it at these two points.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.790
 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:38.090
So the first point where we
choose, we'll call that x.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.990
So that's the first point that
we choose to break it.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.670
And then the second point we
choose, we'll call that y.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.700
Now note that I've drawn it so
that x is to the left of y.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.760
But it could actually be the
case that the first point I

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.860
chose is here and the
second point that I

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.680
chose is to the left.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:05.840
But for now, let's
first assume that

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.640
this scenario holds.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.850
That the first point is to the
left of the second point.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.930
So under this assumption,
we can see that--

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.370
from the definition of these
random variables-- we can

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.640
actually see that the
lengths are given

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.560
by these three lengths.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.620
 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:36.210
So the lengths are x, the left
most piece has length x.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.840
The second, middle piece
has length y minus x.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.618
And the last piece has
length 1 minus y.

00:03:44.618 --> 00:03:48.420
 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.270
And now let's recall our
three conditions.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.420
So the conditions were that any
two of these, the sum of

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.070
any two lengths, has
to be at least--

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.840
has to be greater than the
length of the third piece.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.690
So let's do these together.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:15.700
So x plus y minus x has to be
greater than 1 minus y.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.329
So with these two pieces you
can cover this third piece.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:28.450
We also need that with the first
and third pieces, we can

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.910
cover the middle piece.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:41.460
And we need with the second and
third pieces, we can cover

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.870
the first piece.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.140
Now this looks kind of messy,
but in fact we can actually

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.260
simplify this.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.500
So this actually simplifies.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.790
x minus x, that disappears.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.550
And so this actually simplifies
to 2y has

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.530
to be at least 1.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.645
Or even more simply, y has
to be greater than 1/2.

00:05:02.645 --> 00:05:05.500
 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.510
What about this one?

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.190
This one, we can rearrange
things again.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.460
x we can move over.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.870
y we can move over here.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.680
And we get that 2x plus 1 has
to be greater than 2y.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:26.465
Or put in other words, y is
less than x plus 1/2.

00:05:26.465 --> 00:05:29.140
 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.420
And for the last one, again
we can simplify.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.020
The y's cancel each other out.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.870
And we're left with
2x is less than 1.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.590
 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.980
Or x is less than 1/2.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.900
 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.430
So these are our three
conditions

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.400
that need to be satisfied.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.640
So now we just have to figure
out what's the probability

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.180
that this is actually
satisfied?

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:06.030
Now let's go back to original
definition and see what are

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.740
the actual distributions
for these random

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:08.660
variables, x and y.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.370
Remember, we defined them to
be x is the location of the

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.390
first break and y is the
location of the second break.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.000
And as we said in the problem,
these are chosen uniformly at

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.010
random and they're
independent.

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:28.740
And so we can actually draw
out their joint PDF.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:34.740
So x and y, you can cover
any point in the square.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:42.200
And moreover, it's actually
uniform within the square.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.200
Because each one is chosen
uniformly at random and

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.830
they're independent.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.240
So it's anywhere in here.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.770
And so what do we need to do?

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.540
We just need to identify, what
is the probability that these

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.790
three conditions hold?

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:03.800
 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.600
Rewrite this, line these up.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.980
So these are our three
conditions that we need.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.250
And now remember, we're still
working under the assumption

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.900
that the first point that we
chose is actually to the left

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.630
of the second point.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.440
So what does that mean?

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.920
That means that we are
actually in this top

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.100
triangle, top half--

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.000
x is less than y.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.540
All right, so what do we need?

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.910
We need y to be at least
1/2, so here's 1/2.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.990
So we need y to be
above this line.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.780
We need x to be less than 1/2.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.270
So we need x to be to
the left of here.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.640
So now so far we're stuck
in this upper square.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.070
And the last thing we need is y
to be less than x plus 1/2.

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.420
What is y?

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:02.310
The line y equals x and a 1/2,
x plus 1/2, is this one.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:06.880
So y has to be less than that,
so it would have to be in this

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.360
triangle here.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.670
So these three conditions tell
us that in order for us to

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:17.330
have a triangle we need to for
x and y to fall jointly in

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.710
this small triangle here.

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:24.190
Now because the joint
distribution is uniform, we

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.450
know that the density
is just 1, right?

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:30.150
Because the area
here is just 1.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.600
So the height is
just 1 as well.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.809
And so the density, or the
probability of falling within

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:41.020
this small triangle, is just
going to be also the area of

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:41.840
this triangle.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.900
And what is the area
of this triangle?

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.090
Well, you can fit 8 of these
triangles in here, or you

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.580
could think of it as 1/2
times 1/2 times 1/2.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.450
So the area is just 1/8.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:09:00.565
So assuming that x is less than
y, then the probability

00:09:00.565 --> 00:09:04.900
of forming a triangle is 1/8.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.910
Now, that's only half
this story, though.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:10.580
Because it's possible that when
you chose these two break

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:16.930
points that we actually had
the opposite result.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:21.900
That x, the point that you
chose first, falls to the

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.630
right of the point that
you chose second.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.120
In which case everything
kind of flips.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:34.040
Now we assume that y is less
than x, which means that now

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.760
we're in this lower triangle
in the square.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.140
Now we can go through this
whole exercise again.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.560
But really, what we can see is
that all we've really done is

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.770
just swap the names.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:53.520
Instead of having x and y we now
call x-- we call x y and

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.330
we call y x.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:59.930
And so if we just swap names,
we can see that--

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:01.870
let's just fast forward through
all these steps and

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.590
see that we could just swap
names here, too, as well, in

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:05.210
the three conditions.

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:09.260
So instead of needing y to be
greater than 1/2, we just need

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.990
x to be greater than 1/2.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:15.620
Instead of having x less than
1/2, we need y less than 1/2.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.220
We also swap this.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:25.300
So we need x to be less than y
plus 1/2 or y is greater than

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.430
x minus 1/2.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:33.130
All right, now let's figure out
what this corresponds to.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:36.660
We need x to be greater than
1/2, so it needs to be to the

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:37.850
right of here.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.530
We need y to be less than
1/2, so we need it to

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.710
be below this line.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:46.800
And we need y to be greater
than x minus 1/2.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.570
What is the line y equals
x minus 1/2?

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.710
That is this line here.

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.330
And we need y to be greater than
that, so it needs to be

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:57.510
above this line.

00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:02.930
And so we get that this is the
triangle, the small triangle

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.230
that we need in this case.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.960
And notice that it's exactly
the same area

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.480
as this one, right?

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.320
And so we get another
contribution of 1/8 here.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:19.490
So the final answer is
1/8 plus 1/8 is 1/4.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:23.430
So the probability of forming
a triangle using this three

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.270
pieces is exactly 1/4.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:31.250
And so notice that we've done
is, you've set things up very

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.660
methodically in the beginning
by assigning

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.550
these random variables.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.540
And you consider different
cases.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:41.020
Because you don't actually know
the order in which x and

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.630
y might fall, let's just assume
that one particular

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.190
order and work from there.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.550
And then do the other
case, as well.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:52.770
And it just so happened that
because of the symmetry of the

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.570
problem the second case was
actually very simple.

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.820
We could just see that it is
actually symmetric and so we

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.160
get the same answer.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.930
So this is kind of an
interesting problem because

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:06.550
it's actually a practical
application of something that

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:07.540
you might actually do.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:11.460
And you can see that just by
applying these probability

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.540
concepts you can actually--
