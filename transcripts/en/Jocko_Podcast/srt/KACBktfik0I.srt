1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,500
Cool question over here. You, um,

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,840
he's leaving it. Uh, I'd like to
come to bed. Uh, good evening Jocko.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:15,370
Good evening. Uh,

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,400
what lesson do you wish you would have
learned earlier in life that you now

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:21,983
know?

6
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,540
It is discipline equals freedom.
I mean, that is the thing that,

7
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:32,800
that when I connected
that together in my head,

8
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,040
that the fact that that applies
to absolutely everything,

9
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,020
that's the biggest lesson that I wish
I would have learned earlier in life.

10
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,260
And if I would've figured that out,

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,000
then I would've been doing a lot better
and I would've done a lot better.

12
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:50,560
I would've been a lot better of a person.

13
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:55,960
The thing that I try to tell kids,
I try and tell them that for sure.

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,080
But the other thing that I
think kids miss is kids. And,

15
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,580
and this is something that I
completely missed as a kid.

16
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,780
The actions that you take
now affect your future.

17
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,980
That sounds so obvious.
But when you're 14,

18
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:17,260
you just think, no, nothing. I, you
know, my life is only another 20 minutes.

19
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,490
So what I'm doing right now doesn't
really matter. So when I talk to kids,

20
00:01:21,491 --> 00:01:23,560
I try and explain to them that
discipline equals freedom.

21
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:28,770
And then I tried to explain to them that
what you're doing right now really will

22
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,660
have an impact to where
you are in the future.

23
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,950
And I don't know if you listened
to that podcast that I do,

24
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:39,990
the warrior kid podcast that I did
in number 19 about my friend Jeff and

25
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,000
I talked about it on the adult
podcast as well. But you know,

26
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:46,080
it's a classic story.

27
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:51,081
I had a best friend when I was
little and we separated friendship,

28
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:54,630
not we were still friends,
but we, we, we drifted apart.

29
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,450
He started getting into partying and
getting into drugs and all that and I

30
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,753
didn't.

31
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,860
And his trajectory in life just
went down and I joined the navy,

32
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:07,560
which was great and it put me on
a good path almost involuntarily.

33
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,050
But he ended up, he ended up
killing himself and you know,

34
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:15,930
it was drugs, it was
alcohol and it was just bad.

35
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,970
But while I was going through
buds, he killed himself.

36
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,230
And what I tried to explain to the kids
on the warrior kid podcast is like the

37
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:26,520
decisions that the little decisions
that you make, they matter.

38
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,660
They add up and you have
to connect those dots.

39
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,990
Otherwise you don't know where you're
going to end up and it might be bad.
