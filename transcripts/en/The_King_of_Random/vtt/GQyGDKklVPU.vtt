00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.500
For this project, I’m going to show you
how to defend yourself on the stick bomb battlefield.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.700
By making a homemade arsenal, of spring loaded
stick bombs and throwing stars, that explode on impact.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.320
Start this project with a handful of popsicle
sticks, or craft sticks like these. I found

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.410
mine in packs of 100 at a local dollar store,
and one pack is usually enough to make over

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.020
20 exploding stick bombs.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.340
Now let’s get down on the carpet, because
the sponginess of the rug will make it much

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.060
easier to mass produce our mini weapons. And
to start, let’s kick off production with

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.440
the Boomerang Bomb. It only uses 4 sticks,
and it’s one of the easiest throwing stars to make.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.170
Start by overlapping two sticks on one end
so they form an arrow pointing to the left,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.070
with the yellow stick on the top side. Now
place the red stick on top of these two, so

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.249
the bottom lines up with the green stick,
and the top intersects with the middle of

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:48.920
the yellow. To bind them together, hold the
sticks firmly together where the yellow and

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.359
red sticks meet the green, then push the tip
of the orange stick under the middle of the

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.289
green one, and lock the the other end under
the yellow stick. That’s how quick and easy

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.819
it is to make the Boomerang Bomb. And now
if you throw it at a hard surface like a wall

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:03.429
or refrigerator, the sticks will explode on
impact.

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:08.060
Now check this out. With a fairly simple transformation,
and one extra stick, we can easily convert

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.580
the Boomerang Bomb into a 5 point throwing
star. Hold the Boomerang with both hands at

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.860
the bottom, and carefully push the points
together, in a way that makes the orange and

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.730
blue sticks jut out on either side. Now you
should be able to take the red stick and push

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.700
one end under the orange piece, then bend
it over and lock it underneath the blue. With

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.660
a bit of careful tweaking you’ll have a
great looking 5 point throwing star, that’ll

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.180
give a satisfying, spring-loaded burst of
energy when it connects with your target.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.600
Next up is the Butterfly Bomb, and for this
one we need 5 sticks. Start by crossing two

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.150
yellow sticks to form an “X”, then drop
a green stick in the center so it crosses

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.640
through the middle horizontally. Use your
thumb to hold them down, so you can slide

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.550
the end of a red stick under one of the yellow
ones, bending it over the green stick, and

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.060
locking it into place under the yellow stick
on the other side. Now use your thumb and

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.860
finger to hold this side together so it doesn’t
spring apart, then take the other red stick

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.700
and lock it in place on the other side, the
same way you did before. The tension will

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.950
hold it together, and that’s how you make
the Butterfly Bomb.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.370
The Hand Grenade, also uses 5 sticks, but
in a completely different way. Place the yellow

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.299
stick in the center and overlap the two purple
sticks so they diverge away from each other,

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:13.930
but meet together at the top. Hold all the
sticks together with your thumb, so you can

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.249
wedge one of the red sticks so it’s under
the yellow, but on top of the two purple sticks.

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:22.030
Then grab the other red stick and weave it
the opposite way, so it goes under the purple

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.219
sticks and over the yellow. This will lock
it together, and the Hand Grenade is done.

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.450
These are one of my favorite stick bombs to
make because they hold together really well,

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.109
and are one of the most volatile when they
go off.

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:36.650
The Four Square is another quick and easy
build, and uses 6 sticks. Set the two blue

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.569
sticks side by side so they’re parallel
to each other, then set two green sticks perpendicular

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.889
to the ends so the whole thing makes a square.
The orange stick goes on top so it overlaps

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:48.269
the center of the green ones, and now the
yellow stick needs to slide under the middle

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.969
portion of the blue one on the side. Hold
the yellow stick firmly in place so you can

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:55.319
pull the other blue stick to the side, and
carefully weave it over the tip of the yellow

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.939
stick, locking it back into place under the
green. The Four Square is done, and despite

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.650
it’s humble look, it’ll still blow to
pieces just like all the others.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.079
Now a quick and cool variation of the Four
Square is the Flying Fish. Simply slide two

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.859
of the edges on the square toward each other,
then turn it 90º and do the same thing with

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.370
the other two edges. To finish up, gently
push two opposite corners together, and it’ll

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.859
compress the square into a flat diamond shape.
Now it has the look of an exotic fish, and

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.430
should make a nice addition to your collection.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.260
The hardest stick bomb to make is a six pointed
throwing star, and you’ll need 6 sticks,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.870
if you’re up for the challenge. Lay the
blue stick down first, then place the red

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.299
and yellow sticks in a “V” pattern overlapping
it in the middle by about an inch, and with

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.659
the yellow stick on top. Now take the orange
stick and push one end under the blue tip,

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.290
then angle it toward the center. Do the same
thing on the other side with the green stick,

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.109
and place the tip so it’s overlapping the
orange one at the top. Now grab the purple

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.329
stick and hold everything in place with one
hand, while pushing the purple stick under

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.450
the tip of the red one. Bend it over the green
and orange tips, then lock it together underneath

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.150
the yellow stick. It probably won’t look
very pretty at first, but if you carefully

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.909
tweak the sticks, so the tips line up, you’ll
end up with a really cool looking, 6 pointed

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:05.340
throwing star like this. These are the hardest
ones to make, so if you’re able to build

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.709
these, you’ll be a master, on the stick
bomb battlefield.

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.549
Well now you know how to use a handful of
popsicle sticks to create an arsenal of exploding

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.000
throwing stars. Whether it’s just for fun,
or for defending your empire in popsicle stick

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.349
warfare.

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:21.579
By the way, I used 6 sticks to build a bonus
bomb, but I won’t show you how to make it.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.590
Instead, let’s see if you can figure out
how to do it on your own.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.139
And if you find that regular popsicle sticks
are too hard to work with, try using jumbo

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.340
craft sticks, or tongue depressors instead.
They’re actually a lot easier to use, and

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.129
might be more intimidating to your enemies,
as well.

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:38.819
Well that’s it for now. If you like this
project perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
