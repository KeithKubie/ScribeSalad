00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
The singularity, well I mean that's just
something that we just don't understand.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.820
It's a singular point and that
means the curvature of the spacetime at

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.849
this point is gone

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:15.571
infinite and all the mass is collapsed to one point. So it''s a point

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.199
literally a point, with this mass in there.
So it's got infinite density, you know a density is mass per

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.720
unit volume, well if this got no volume, it's an infinite density. These black holes

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.910
that are defined, are defined in the sense of using General Relativity and this is this

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.410
wonderful theory of Einstein which
explains how matter and

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.149
curvature of spacetime are intricately
linked together. So you really need some

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.770
quantum theory of gravity to try to
describe that, so I'm sure that our

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.030
quantum theory of gravity will resolve the
question of what the singularity is at

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.920
the centre of a black hole. It's just that we
don't know what that is yet. So that solution

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.329
as it stands, is there classically but when you include the world of quantum mechanics

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:01.010
where things get, can get smeared out, what isn't clear is whether that singularity

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.070
will remain or maybe it will get smeared out. Will this event horizon still be there?

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.840
So will that, what we think of as
the black hole still be there? It probably will.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.080
-What's that area like between the
event horizon and the singularity?

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.509
Is it like a, is that a tumultuous place
or do you not know you're in that like

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.310
almost like the eye of a hurricane?
 -If you're heading into the black hole and

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.560
if this is a big enough black hole you
actually don't even know you cross this

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.490
event horizon. In fact the density
of the black hole around the event

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.790
horizon for really massive black hole is
of order water, that of water and so

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.570
you'd just sort of pass through. But
what begins to happen is you begin

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.950
to experience the gravitational
attraction. It begins, as you get closer

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.060
and closer to the singularity it gets bigger
and bigger and so you will

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.740
begin to stretch and you will begin
to feel the effects of the pull of the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.909
black hole. And on the other hand for 
a solar mass black hole,

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.950
you know one of order the mass of the Sun

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.619
then the pull of gravity on the event horizon is much stronger and you would have

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.640
already been spaghettified by the time you cross the event horizon. You won't see

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.900
the event horizon, there's no sign post saying you know: 'event horizon no return!'

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.000
but you will pass through this, you would

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.800
already be gone in terms of living by then.
But a supermassive black hole you

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.830
actually want even realize. The pull is far less, the density of

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.710
the matter is far less significant there,
then it would be in the

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.010
smaller black hole.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.519
It's a good question. Ok so if the black hole is a big, there's a big black hole like maybe the one in the

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.930
center of the Milky Way, then you know
when it crosses the event horizon,

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.370
well forget firewalls for a second, but when it crosses the event horizon

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.480
generally you'd expect nothing much to happen because actually the

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.709
gravitational field's pretty weak out there.
As you start to go deeper and deeper

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.790
inside this black hole, you might think
that indeed does it retain its status

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.480
as a particle? I would say probably not
because you know you're entering that

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.680
regime where even your theory of gravity is breaking down. Well let's think

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.829
about how election became an electron, ok? So where does the electron get its mass from?

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.760
It gets its mass from the Higgs particle,
from the Higgs field actually more

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.609
appropriately and for it to get
its mass from the Higgs field something has to

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:33.019
happen called spontaneous symmetry
breaking, a symmetry has to be broken. Now if you

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.700
restore that symmetry and that symmetry does get restored at high energies,

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.010
then the electron looses its mass and you know you can't really talk about, eventually the

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.760
electron just becomes part of some greater thing.
And that's what would

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.069
happen I think as you approach
the black hole singularity

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.989
things would just, symmetries would be restored, you would no longer be able to describe

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.220
matter in terms of what we think of the
low-energy matter dynamics you would

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.549
have to replace that by some high-energy
version of it and eventually you'd have to

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.510
replace things ultimately by the full
quantum theory of gravity and everything

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.440
i.e. maybe string theory. So you'd really be talking about strings so you would never even

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.889
talk about an electron, you can't talk about electron very very close to singularity

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:15.909
you don't have a singularity
really, you probably got some sort of

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:18.570
stringy type structure of which that electron

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.690
has now become a part itself, some
stringy excitation.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.420
We do not know how to use 
gravity and quantum mechanics

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.090
in regimes where gravity is incredibly
strong and quantum mechanics is playing

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:41.830
a big role. We can use our quantum
theory is really well understood in

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.550
regimes where gravity is not that strong,
gravity is really well understood in

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.860
regimes where you don't need to worry
about quantum mechanics, but we know both

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.710
have to exist. We know we have to be able
to understand the world of the macroscopic

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:01.960
and the microscopic and there are regimes where these two clash and the black hole

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.660
is a regime where you have the world of
the microscopic quantum theory and the

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.200
world of high strength gravitational
fields coming together and a

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.100
manifestation of this problem is this
information issue because it's defined

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.410
simply in terms of its mass, its angular momentum and its charge. It's got what's

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.210
known as no hair, there's nothing coming
out to tell you what's bit gone in there.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.080
The world of quantum mechanics on the
other hand should also be able to

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.120
describe this process. In the world of
quantum mechanics there is what's known

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.440
as a wave function. It's integral to the
world of quantum theory that we can keep

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.810
track of this wave function we solve
it by the Schrodinger equation. Knowing

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.270
about this wave function tells us about
the probabilities of everything we

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.610
always expect probabilities to add to
one. If they don't then it's a bad,

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:54.040
something's wrong with our system. When you lose information it means that this wave

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.380
function no longer is deterministic in
the sense that you lose that ability to

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.010
have probabilities adding up to one. Something's gone wrong with the old

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.730
world of quantum mechanics but we
believe our world of quantum mechanics

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.880
so we have to be able to reconcile this
classical picture of the black hole where

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.470
the information gets lost, to this
quantum mechanical picture where we know

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.410
the information shouldn't get lost.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.930
We need to be able to retrieve it and in
order to do it you're having to match these two together.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.920
The very existence of black
holes and this singularity that you seemed,

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.970
it looks like you have at the center of
them, tells you that Einstein's theory is

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.120
not a complete theory

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.910
It's the best and effective theory there
needs to be replaced by something else

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:39.100
when you start talking about high-energy
strong gravitational fields and so on

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.300
and so forth. You need something else which is most likely string theory I guess.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.690
It's believed that the centers of
galaxies have got these supermassive black

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.290
holes right, to billions of solar
masses which actually raises an

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:55.550
interesting question: how did they form?
How did these have time to,

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.130
I think there's might be some cosmic strings involved but no one likes that idea. I'm just hoping

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.310
they'll keep finding these supermassive
black holes earlier and earlier and

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.770
earlier utntil eventually there's just
not been enough time for black holes

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:13.620
coalesce and you need another seed,
something like a super, like a massive

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.350
cosmic string but anyway that's just my own pet hope.
-Is it possible that as you start

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.520
reconciling quantum mechanics and
General Relativity and understanding black

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.199
holes better, that singularities could come
under threat? And people might think 'oh, it's ok

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:28.320
there's actually a little bit of volume there.'

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:34.690
-Yes, absolutely and I think the majority
I don't about the majority but a lot of

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:40.070
people that think about what will be the
effect of quantum mechanics, is that,

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:44.520
that singularity which again is a breakdown of your, demonstrates the breakdown of your

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.669
field equations, the breakdown of your mathematics, that singularity will get

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:48.780
smoothed out.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:56.130
Example of a star or an object, whose gravity was so great, that light couldn't escape from it.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:01.560
So basically what's being hinted at here
for the first time is a black hole!

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.590
Of the existence of bodies and either of these circumstances we could have no

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:08.230
information from site.
