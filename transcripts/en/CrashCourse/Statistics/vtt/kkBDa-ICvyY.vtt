00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.259
Hi, I’m Adriene Hill and Welcome back
to Crash Course Statistics.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.010
Famous tech guy and likely future space dweller Elon Musk once told interviewers that there’s

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.160
a high probability that we’re all living
in a simulation.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.980
Now that may sound outlandish, and it’s an interesting statement about probability, but today we’re

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.800
going to focus on the simulation part.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:30.040
INTRO

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.880
Elon Musk as well as some philosophers, futurists,
and technologists argue that it’s entirely

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.540
possible, probable in fact, that in a few
thousand years we will be able to create simulations

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.000
like World of Warcraft, or Minecraft that
are so real, they’ll be indistinguishable

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
from real life.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.520
Living in a world like that, there’s no
way for you to tell if you’re living in

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.600
the “true” world, or a simulation.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.180
Or maybe a simulation inside a simulation.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.460
If we were living in Musk’s vision of a
future world, any time we wanted to test something--like

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.140
whether that bus would have splashed us if
you didn’t stop to answer a text, or whether

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.220
the new drug we invented can cure lung cancer--all
we would need to do is run two identical simulations.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.020
In one simulation, we’d give people with
lung cancer the new drug and watch to see

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.240
what happens, taking notes on things like
lung capacity and remission rates.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.750
While that’s happening, we’d do `exactly
the same in another simulation except we’d

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.220
give the patients a placebo drug--something
that looks and feels like a real drug but

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.590
isn’t--and we’d record the results.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.240
Once both simulations are done, we’d be
able to look at our data and have a good idea

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.840
of whether it works.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.590
Now we can’t yet run a parallel universe just to satisfy our curiosity of whether the amount

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.880
of time we spend sleeping next to our cell
phone increases our chance of brain cancer…

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.880
But we are doing the next best thing!

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.640
Researchers have started using simulations
to study cancer treatments.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.020
To predict the impacts of climate change.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.740
Researchers are using VR to simulate disaster
situations.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.380
And to help train people how to respond in earthquakes or floods.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.640
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.560
Still we need other ways to answer the burning
questions that keep us up at night.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.479
And until scientists can pull through with
the necessary technology, we’re limited

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.340
to two main methods of collecting data to
answer our questions.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.580
One way to get around our inability to create and destroy universes at will, is by using experiments.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.960
Experiments try to mimic parallel universes
by taking the one universe we do have, and

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.060
splitting it randomly into groups.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.709
Imagine a High School where test scores are
low... and we want to see whether buying cappuccino

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.249
machines for students’ families... will
improve test scores.

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:36.510
We don’t have two parallel versions of the
high school to test our idea, but we can randomly

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.040
split it into two groups: one group’s families
will get free cappuccino machines, and the

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.040
other’s won’t.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.840
And then we let life go on, just like in the
simulations, and we record the test scores

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.940
of both groups.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.500
Because we randomly assigned each person’s
group, every single family had an equal chance

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.020
of being in the cappuccino and no-cappuccino
groups.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.000
Randomness allows us to claim that before
the cappuccino makers were given out, there

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.100
were no systematic differences between the
groups.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.860
Usually researchers will use a random number
generator to assign subjects into random groups.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.180
Random assignment reduces the chance that
the bias of the people running the experiment

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.520
will affect the groups.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.640
For example, it prevents them from doing things
like putting subjects who they think will

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.500
respond to caffeine in the cappuccino group, and those who won’t in the no-cappuccino group.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.500
It also makes it impossible for people to
choose their own groups.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.200
That way, the coffee lovers don’t all sign
up for the free cappuccino machine, while

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:33.190
tea enthusiasts don’t.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.660
These two problems are called Allocation Bias,
and Selection Bias, respectively.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.400
Because of randomness, it’s unlikely--though
not impossible--that all of the wealthy people

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.380
ended up in one group, and the not-so-wealthy
in the other.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.100
Or the vegans in one group, and the omnivores
in the other.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.820
Randomness is usually our best method for
ensuring that our groups are similar before

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.620
we give them any treatment.

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:59.400
But the slight possibility that our groups
might be really uneven is why it’s important

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.239
to replicate experiments.

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.279
In some situations, Researchers can also force
the number of wealthy people or vegans to

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:11.049
be the same in each group using something
called a Randomized Block Design, but randomness

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.760
usually does a pretty good job.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.520
In our example, a Treatment was either getting
a cappuccino machine, or not getting a cappuccino

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.360
machine.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.120
In general, treatments are conditions that
we want to test, like new medicines, or educational

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.040
interventions like reading extra books to
your kids.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.500
Treatments can also have levels.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.020
For example when we look at whether exercise
is related to weight loss, we might have 3

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.150
groups: one group does no exercise, one group does 5 hours of exercise a week, and the third

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.560
group does 10 hours of exercise a week.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.480
These levels can help us see whether there’s
a linear relationship between our treatment

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.990
and outcome, or whether 5 hours of exercise
is just as good as 10.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.030
One of the treatments in an experiment is
usually nothing.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.509
These treatments are called controls and they
play a huge role in experiments.

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:58.340
It’s our way of pretending we have a universe
where there’s no treatment.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.580
Let's say you got a little too eager to get your freshly baked chocolate chip cookies out of

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.030
the oven, and you burned your finger.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.400
You put some Neosporin on it, and after a
few days your finger heals.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.800
You’re SO happy that you practically turn
into Neosporin’s next spokesperson.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.380
But it’s possible that the burn would have
healed just fine on it’s own.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.210
A control treatment--aka no treatment--would
let us compare what happens between two similar

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.500
burns: one treated with an antibiotic cream...and
one left to heal by itself.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.449
These types of control groups are great at
helping us to divide up the changes we observe

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:35.439
into changes due to treatments, and changes
that are just due to time or circumstance.

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:40.069
If your finger heals faster with ointment
than without it, we can more confidently claim

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:44.259
that there’s a relationship between Neosporin
use and burn healing ...than if we didn’t

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.380
have a control.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.060
Sometimes, we want to control for more than just time and circumstance with our control treatments.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.240
With medical trials, you, as the person taking
the medicine, would want new medicines to

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.800
work better than nothing, but you also want
to make sure that it’s not just the act

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.080
of doing something that’s making you feel
better.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.110
It’s been shown that just the act of taking
a fake medication or having a fake surgery--

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.500
seriously --can make people feel better.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.700
These are called placebo effects.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.060
Placebos allow us to control these effects
by “pretending” to treat everyone.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.760
Subjects in medical studies are often given
sugar pills or saline drips to make it seem

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.580
like both groups are being treated.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.380
Non-medical studies also use placebos.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.560
Studies that claim First Person Shooter video
games like Call of Duty improve cognition

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.280
should probably have a control group that
plays a non-First Person Shooters, like Mario Kart.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.220
Then the researchers could ensure that it’s
not just the act of participating in research

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:41.419
or learning a new video game console that’s
causing the observed changes.

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:45.729
Essentially, good placebos and controls should
look and feel as close as possible to the

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:51.470
actual treatment so that the only difference
is whatever we’re interested in--like First

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.920
Person Shooter Video Games.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.580
Sometimes there are undetected factors causing
changes in an experiment that you just don’t

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.180
know about.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.280
Well chosen placebos and controls allow us to better account for them.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.960
Sometimes it’s just not possible to shield
subjects from knowing the difference between

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.960
conditions.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.960
Take diets, for example.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.039
When people agree to be put into a clinical
study which compares a group of subjects who

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:17.539
do not change their diet, to a group that
goes low-carb, it’s hard to make both groups

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:19.349
think they’re doing the same treatment.

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:20.639
People can see what they’re eating.

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:24.139
When subjects don’t know which treatment
they’re receiving--usually because they’re

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:27.960
getting a good placebo--they are considered
“blind” to the treatment.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.009
An Experiment where the subjects don’t know
what treatment they’re getting but the researchers

00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:38.029
do is called a Single Blind Study, which leads
to better experiments because all groups experience

00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:40.000
the act of being treated.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.430
But even in a Single Blind study, it’s possible
that researchers might be biased when observing

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.430
the subjects.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.069
The researchers still know which treatment
the subject is getting.

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:53.559
A researcher who spent years creating, funding,
and planning a study, probably thinks their

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.560
treatment works.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:59.200
Why dedicate your life to developing a drug
to cure cancer if you don’t think it works?

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:04.689
The problem is, that belief in the value of
the treatment can cause researchers to subconsciously

00:08:04.689 --> 00:08:07.129
project those beliefs onto their subjects.

00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:11.120
In the 1990’s a group of Researchers looked
at almost two dozen studies about whether

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:16.440
sugar causes hyperactivity in children, and
they concluded that in general, it doesn’t.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:20.560
Parents who thought their children were given
sugar reported them as being hyperactive,

00:08:20.569 --> 00:08:23.420
but it turned out, they were probably just
being kids.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:27.410
When parents are blinded to whether their
child received sugar, both groups of parents

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:30.780
reported roughly equal levels of hyperactivity.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:35.740
Even when we think our subconscious biases don’t get in the way, they still sometimes do.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.080
We try to solve this problem by having Double
Blind studies in which both the subjects and

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:44.200
the researchers have no idea which treatment
the subject is getting.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.420
Just like with blinding patients, sometimes
it’s impossible for the researcher to not

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:52.860
be able to tell the difference, but double
blind studies are the gold standard in many

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:56.120
fields whenever they are physically ….and
financially…. doable.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.240
And while we still can’t bend space and
time to make parallel universes, there are

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.240
a few other ways to pretend we do have them.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:05.300
One is Matched-Pairs experiments.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:09.610
Just like the name implies, these experiments
use pairs of subjects that are very similar,

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.269
and give one of them Treatment A, and the
other Treatment B.

00:09:12.269 --> 00:09:17.240
Identical Twins, for example, are about as
close as we can get to a parallel universe.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:21.560
Since twins are genetically similar and often
grow up in the same situation, we’re able

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:26.839
to get our treatment groups to be almost exactly
the same ...or at least way closer than random

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.370
assignment alone.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:33.060
The more similar the groups are before treatment, the better researchers can spot treatment effects.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.660
We can also have a matched-pairs experiment
with non-twins.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:40.790
In this case, each pair is matched on one
or more features that the researchers decide

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:44.449
are important... like age, race, gender, or
weight.

00:09:44.449 --> 00:09:46.400
Then these pairs are treated like twins.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.360
One is assigned Treatment A, and the other,
Treatment B.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:53.880
For simplicity here we’re assuming there
are two groups, but there could be more!

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.500
The best subject researchers can pair you
with is yourself!

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.560
Many experiments will give the same subject
multiple treatments, one at a time, to see

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.370
how they react to each.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:07.839
This ensures that each treatment “group”
is the same, since it’s all the same people.

00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:12.710
This type of matched-pairs design is often
called a repeated measures design, and while

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:17.800
it comes with its own set of limitations,
it can be better than regular random assignment.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:22.140
And sometimes the stars align and we get to
see the results of the interesting experiments

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.200
that we don’t have the power to implement
ourselves.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.680
Recently, the city of Philadelphia passed a sugar tax that would charge companies

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.900
an extra 1.5 cents per ounce of sugary beverage sold.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.120
Researchers can’t just assign cities to
have extra taxes.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.329
When cities do vote these things into law,
some very interesting things can happen, and

00:10:41.329 --> 00:10:44.460
they did in the Philadelphia International
Airport.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:49.600
Because it straddles the city’s border,
some of these otherwise identical stores had

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.060
to comply with the law while others didn’t.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:57.290
Through this data, researchers were able to
find that contrary to previous assurances,

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:03.240
chain stores in taxed terminals raised their
prices about .83 cents per ounce more than

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.190
their non-taxed terminal counterparts.

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:10.220
Which means the tax did what it was supposed
to: increase the cost of sugary drinks

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.080
and encourage people to buy less.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.700
We all consume products that are the result of experimentation... from Amazon’s web

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:22.290
design to the prescription drugs we take...
which is why it’s useful to know why researchers feel

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.560
they can make the decisions and claims that
they do.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.740
Knowing the theory behind experimentation
also allows us to be more informed consumers.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:32.779
So the next time you find yourself staring
down the homeopathic medicine section...wondering

00:11:32.779 --> 00:11:38.440
if that effervecent tab (developed by an instructor of students) will really stop your cold

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.800
Ask how they tested it. Ask who tested it.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.800
DFTBA-Q. You know I’m not sure why this
isn’t taking off.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.480
Where’s my t-shirt? Anybody?
