00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.640
&gt;&gt; Michelle Loyalka: Thank you everybody for
coming.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.600
It's great to be here and to have the chance
to share with you a bit about what I've learned

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:15.230
in researching and writing this book and also
living in China for the last 15 years.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.800
As the David, and as the subtitle of the book
suggests this is really a work about the massive

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.179
movement of people from the countryside in
China to the urban centers and right now there's

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:33.020
about 200 million people at any given time,
in, from the countryside who are in the cities

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.059
and that number is expected to grow to about
300 million people within the next 20 years.

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.399
And so that makes it really the fastest and
the largest movement of people in human history.

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:50.399
It's really having a dramatic impact on China
in terms of attitudes and values and standard

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.890
of living and lifestyles and social dynamics,
everything is changing because of this movement.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.949
And also, it's creating a bit of, a sort of
unrest and upheaval, so it's really emerging

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.700
in China these days, as the key issue, the
key domestic issue that the Chinese government

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.390
is trying to tackle.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.210
So what I wanted to do today was give you
first a little bit of an overview of sort

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.870
of the scale of what's happening and then
we can talk more about the issues in the book.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.500
So if we look in terms of urbanization, so
western countries generally took about 200

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.470
years to make that switch from being primarily
urban, or rural societies to primarily urban

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.470
societies.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.870
And China is on track to make this transition
within about 50 years.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.680
And in the 30 years since China started its
opening and reform policies, its urban population

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.540
has double and in the next 30 years, it's
expected to double yet again.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.700
So by comparison, Europe currently has 35
cities with more than a million people and

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:59.310
China right now has about 160, but by 2025,
it's expected that China will have 221 cities

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.990
with more than a million people, so that makes
Europe look small by comparison.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.740
[chuckles] Among these 221 cities will be
15 super cities, each with about 25 million

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.930
people, so by comparisons the entire state
of Texas has about 25 million people so that

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.390
will be 15 cities in China each as large as
the state of Texas.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.390
And by 2030, China's urban population will
reach 1 billion people, so urban China will

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.980
be more populous than the North and South
American continents combined, so obviously

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.770
this is a very large movement of people and
it's happening very quickly and there's a

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.700
lot of different factors sort of underlying
this transition.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.090
But the people really at the heart of it are
China's s rural migrants.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.150
So again, I said there's about 200 million
migrants now and there will be about 300 million

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.110
within the next 20 years.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.250
And I think in the west people tend to think
of China's migrants mostly as factory workers,

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.880
but in fact of the 200 million migrants that
are out there right now only about a third

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.680
of them work in factories.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.240
The rest of them are intimately involved in
every aspect of building up urban China and

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.260
driving this urbanization.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:18.810
So, for example, over the next 20 years migrants
will help to build 5 million new buildings

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.530
including 50,000 sky scrapers or the equivalent
of 10 New York cities.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.250
And they'll also help to pave 5 million square
meters of roads.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.510
And they tend to go into the cities in China
and snap up sort of the low paying, dirty,

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.300
dangerous, distasteful jobs that urbanites
are not really so interested in.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.220
And they also carve out for themselves all
sorts of different small time entrepreneurial

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.910
niches.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.800
Some people may haul heavy loads, they may
do repair work; sell produce on the street

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.800
corner.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.270
The man at the top here, he's popping popcorn,
so there's sort of all sorts of things people

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.880
do and generally they tend to be very light
on their feet and able to sort of quickly

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.620
remold themselves to meet the changing needs
of the Chinese economy.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.430
And so, I met, in the course of the research
I did for the book, I met many people who

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.180
within just the scope of a year or two had
sort of continually reinvented themselves

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.180
time and again.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.539
So one woman had gone from selling eggs on
the street corner, to selling produce, to

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:26.930
shining shoes, to running a small shop and
I looked at that and how quickly she could

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.020
change directions, I felt amazed, sort of
by that ability.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.620
She said, "This is the way you do things when
you don't have a lot of other options."

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.599
And so as a result of this, urban China really
couldn't function without migrant labor.

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:46.819
I had this idea to do a blog post about how
much the average urbanite's life depends on

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.210
migrants.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.020
I live in Beijing now, so I had the idea I'd
just take a picture of each person and write

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.599
a couple of lines about what they were doing
in the city.

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:59.669
And by the time I left my house in the morning
and got to the subway stop, which usually

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.539
is about a 20-minute walk, I gave up because
it was taking the whole day.

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:08.990
There was just so many migrants that my life
depends on in the cities that it was became

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.800
a sort of overwhelming project.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.139
But in addition to that, migrants are really
essential to building up China's rural areas

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:16.139
as well.

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.939
Because the money that migrants send back
to the villages, in lots of places, really

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:25.460
is the major portion of local income and so
they're really responsible for raising rural

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.440
China out of poverty as well.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.020
So, I want to tell you a little bit, about
how I came to write about this topic.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:40.430
When I went to China in 1997, I wasn't a journalist
at that time, I first worked in education

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.970
and I had a lot of different opportunities.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.729
And one of them was I worked on this curriculum
for children to learn English.

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.080
And it was used in small towns around Guangdong
Province.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.050
And I would go and visit these schools about
once a month to sort of track their progress

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.430
and give some teacher training.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.070
And in one of the schools, the principal invited
me to go with her to stay an extra day and

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.749
go with her to back to her village where her
relatives still lived.

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:10.180
And so having lived in urban China for almost
two years at that point and really sometimes

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.740
you don't see much grass or trees or any nature
at all [chuckles].

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.940
And so I really jumped at the opportunity
and went back with her.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.710
It was a banana farming village in the mountains
and we had a great day hiking and doing things

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.710
like that.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.169
And at the end of the day, we were with her
relatives and they asked, "How did you like

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:26.169
our village?"

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:28.909
And I kind of gushed and I said, "Oh, it's
fantastic, I love it here!"

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:32.969
And they said, "Well if you like it so much
why don't you move here?"

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:38.410
And I think looking back, I don't think they
were probably sincerely inviting me as much

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.009
as they were making polite, small talk.

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:43.400
But in my enthusiasm, I said "Oh, I would
love to!"

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.590
And so that what's I did.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.949
So about a month later I moved to this village.

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:51.199
And it was really a very interesting experience.

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:56.150
It definitely that there had been a foreign
person in the village much less living in

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:57.150
the village.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.910
So very quickly, I became the local tourist
destination.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:05.729
[laughter] And people from the surrounding
villages would walk to this village; in fact,

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:10.699
someone came from about 20 kilometers away
one time, on foot, to sort of verify is it

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:13.740
really true that there's a foreigner living
here.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:19.839
[laughter] This is in the south of China were
it's very hot and so the windows are always

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:22.300
open, but there's bars, everyone has bars
on the windows.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:28.020
And so people would come and stand outside
the window of my house with their hands on

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:32.779
the bars and sort of stare in and watch me
and have this ongoing commentary with each

00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:35.439
other about what they saw the foreigner doing.

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:39.819
It was really a very interesting experience,
[laughs] but very wonderful.

00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:44.020
And the people especially were very sincere
and very hospitable.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:49.089
And this was really I think pivotal in terms
of helping me to think about China's rapid

00:07:49.089 --> 00:07:54.090
development from the point of view of the
rural people because so of what we see in

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:59.309
the media here is at least is sort of a boomtowns
where everything is going very well in China.

00:07:59.309 --> 00:08:03.729
So this gave me a foundation, I think, for
for the book.

00:08:03.729 --> 00:08:08.360
And this is another picture of the village
it was called the Flower Fruit Village.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:13.020
And from there I moved to Xi'an, which is
the ancient capital of China and it's most

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.900
well known in the US for being the home to
the terracotta soldiers.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:22.370
And it's also in western China which has been
the least developed and the poorest part of

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:23.370
China.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:28.089
And in fact, when China started its opening
and reforms three decades ago they had this

00:08:28.089 --> 00:08:31.949
concept basically that they would allow a
small part of the population first to become

00:08:31.949 --> 00:08:36.460
prosperous and that those people then would
pull everyone else up to prosperity.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:42.469
And so eastern China, the sort of crescent
along the seaboard there was chosen to lead

00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:44.420
everybody else to prosperity.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:49.680
And western China was just sort of ignored,
largely, for several decades and languished

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.980
behind the rest of the country.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:57.270
And so I moved to Xi'an in 1999 and in January
of 2000, the country, the government launched

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.899
what's called the 'Go West' policy.

00:08:59.899 --> 00:09:04.570
And that essentially was designed to help
western China catch up with the rest of the

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:08.259
country, because the gap between the two had
really become unmanageable at that point.

00:09:08.259 --> 00:09:13.410
And so when the Chinese government decides
to do something, sometimes it happens extremely

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:20.411
quickly and so within months of that policy
opening, money came pouring into the the city

00:09:20.411 --> 00:09:24.110
of Xi'an and especially the high techs zones,
there was what's called the high tech zone,

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:27.000
which is where I was living at that time.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.860
And so from my window in my apartment in the
high tech zone, at any given time, I would

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:40.420
look out and there would be 15 to 20 cranes
on the horizon putting up new urban developments.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:45.060
But what there also was, what I could also
see really basically behind my apartment complex,

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.660
was this old village called Gan Jia Zhai.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.280
This is actually the village whose land the
high tech zone was built on.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:58.279
So what happens in China, is that as the urban
areas expand, the local city governments will

00:09:58.279 --> 00:10:04.470
buy up the neighboring farmland but they don't
generally buy up the cluster of village homes.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:08.560
And so the farmers who lose their land in
this process, they take whatever money they're

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:13.980
paid for their land and they tend to use that
to build on to their homes, or sometimes they

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.220
gut their homes, basically, and start again.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:20.560
And then they rent out their homes, room by
room, to the migrants to come into the new

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.379
up and coming urban areas looking for work.

00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:27.250
And so this is extremely common in China,
it's so common that there's a term for it,

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:28.940
which is 'City Village'.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:33.850
And these City Villages, you'll see them in
any every city in China, basically, and they're

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:39.269
really the way that China has sort of avoided
the absolute poverty, urban slums like you

00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:44.089
might see in India or Brazil or other countries.

00:10:44.089 --> 00:10:49.120
Because they provide such a sort of critical,
low cost housing alternative for migrants,

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.990
they tend to be very densely populated.

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:56.770
So this village was originally home to about
1500 farmers and when I was living there,

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:02.310
they estimated there was about 30,000 migrants
sandwiched into six blocks.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:06.730
So it's a very high population density and
then, of course, a lot of social problems

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:11.480
follow follow along as well.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.550
In 2004, --so I lived there from '99 to 2004--,
and then I went back.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:19.769
I came back to the US for grad school and
I did a masters in journalism and when I graduated

00:11:19.769 --> 00:11:22.910
I received a fellowship to work at a Book
Link project.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:27.690
So I knew that I wanted to write about all
the transformation I had experienced in China.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.250
So I went back to that same neighborhood where
I had lived before and what I had found was

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:36.209
that the City Village of Gan Jai Zhai was
about to be demolished.

00:11:36.209 --> 00:11:39.360
Everybody that I worked, that I interacted
with regularly, you know the people who I

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.510
bought vegetables from or who worked in restaurants,
the security guards, everybody was very anxious,

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:49.231
was upset about this because they lived in
this village and there weren't many more of

00:11:49.231 --> 00:11:53.439
these villages left and they weren't sure
once these were gone, how could they support

00:11:53.439 --> 00:11:55.019
their life in the city anymore.

00:11:55.019 --> 00:11:59.670
And so that really became the backdrop for
the book.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:04.280
Essentially, in the book, you'll find 8 different
profiles of migrants who have come from different

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:09.921
places in rural China into Xi'an and they
find work in the high tech zone, they live

00:12:09.921 --> 00:12:15.920
in this old City Village and the book really
kind of chronicles how successfully, --or

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:21.810
in some cases unsuccessfully--, they're able
to integrate into urban life and enjoy the

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:23.750
fruits of their labors.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:29.670
And also, how well they're able to accomplish
the goals that they've set out for themselves.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:34.230
Now, in addition, to that what I try to capture
in the book is also the spirit of the people,

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:40.170
because I think that a lot of times the sort
of story line that you see in the media about

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:47.019
rural people in China is that they're downtrodden
victims of oppression, that sort of concept.

00:12:47.019 --> 00:12:51.889
And that's not my experience with them and
I don't think that that's really the way that

00:12:51.889 --> 00:12:54.449
most migrants view their own reality.

00:12:54.449 --> 00:12:57.899
I think that overall they tend to be pretty
upbeat given the situation they're in, they're

00:12:57.899 --> 00:13:00.959
pretty upbeat and optimistic about their future.

00:13:00.959 --> 00:13:06.660
And they're extremely enterprising; they find
lots of ways to solve problems that I would've

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.870
given up on long ago.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.760
And in Chinese, as David mentioned, there's
this great word, which essentially doesn't

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:19.390
translate directly into English, but it essentially
means to endure hardship, to persevere, and

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.380
to just sort of keep moving ahead without
complaining.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.940
So for lack of a better word in English, if
you translate it directly, it comes out to

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.029
'eating bitterness'.

00:13:28.029 --> 00:13:31.920
And so that's where the title of the book
comes from, and that's really--.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.990
I didn't set off with this as a theme in mind,
in the beginning.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:38.920
But as I talked to different migrants over
and over again, they, themselves, brought

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:44.189
this up as being the key to their ability
to survive in China, in urban China, for so

00:13:44.189 --> 00:13:45.189
long.

00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:49.600
And really it emerges in every chapter, all
the different ways that people have to change

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:55.240
and grow and develop and to persevere in order
to keep a place for themselves in this really

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:59.160
rapidly changing society.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.720
So I want to give you a I want to give you
an overview of the stories in the book but

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.149
first I'm going to answer a few key questions
that give you a little bit of background of

00:14:08.149 --> 00:14:09.149
migrants.

00:14:09.149 --> 00:14:11.680
So the first one is who are China's rural
migrants?

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.999
And so people tend to think that they're the
lowest level of society, but that's generally

00:14:15.999 --> 00:14:16.999
not the case.

00:14:16.999 --> 00:14:21.740
Over time, they are increasingly more well
educated and increasingly younger.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:27.259
So last year a full 70% of migrants were under
the age of 30 and 65% typically finished middle

00:14:27.259 --> 00:14:28.259
school.

00:14:28.259 --> 00:14:33.420
The thing, though, in China is that there
is only 9 years of compulsory education.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:38.699
If you want to get into high school, you have
to pass a very competitive entrance exam and

00:14:38.699 --> 00:14:40.589
you also have to pay for high school.

00:14:40.589 --> 00:14:45.589
So in poor rural areas, less than 50% of people
will go onto high school.

00:14:45.589 --> 00:14:51.320
So, for a lot of people, they end up in the
cities as migrants.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.399
The next question is why do people come to
the cities?

00:14:54.399 --> 00:14:56.930
Why are rural people coming to the cities?

00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:01.790
So the obvious answer to this is that there's
a large and growing income gap in China.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:06.529
So urban income is about three and a half
times higher than rural income.

00:15:06.529 --> 00:15:11.620
And then also eastern income is about one
and a half times higher than western income.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:16.699
To put this in perspective, so I live in Beijing
and for a very a very average two bedroom

00:15:16.699 --> 00:15:21.079
house, with the ceiling is collapsing in our
apartment, but for a very average, [laughs]

00:15:21.079 --> 00:15:26.449
it's not a fancy house, it's very average
two bedroom apartment, what I pay in rent

00:15:26.449 --> 00:15:30.939
each month is more than a farmer in western
China will make in an entire year.

00:15:30.939 --> 00:15:36.790
So that's a really significant driver pushing
people to the cities to look for jobs with

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:38.670
higher salaries.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:43.059
And related to this is an issue of a lack
of land in China.

00:15:43.059 --> 00:15:47.750
When China ended collectivized agriculture
in the late '70s and early, 80's they had

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:51.370
to do something with all of that land that
previous was collectivized.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:56.110
So what they essentially did was every local
village government divvied up all their farmland

00:15:56.110 --> 00:16:00.380
and every resident of that village received
a plot of land.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:04.970
And this is essentially still the system that's
in place today.

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:09.569
If you're born as a rural resident in China,
at birth, you receive a plot of land and it's

00:16:09.569 --> 00:16:12.720
not exactly yours, so you cannot sell it.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:17.829
If you let the land go fallow, you'll lose
it and when you die, it goes back to the village

00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:19.970
to be redistributed to the next generation.

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:23.069
But other than that, it's essentially yours
for life.

00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:29.459
This is really, it's hard to sort of impress
how important this piece of land is to these

00:16:29.459 --> 00:16:30.459
farmers.

00:16:30.459 --> 00:16:32.309
It's really their main sort of social security.

00:16:32.309 --> 00:16:34.589
They really value this land.

00:16:34.589 --> 00:16:39.199
The problem comes, though, that that by the
time you divvy all the arable land in China

00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:44.420
among seven to eight hundred million rural
residents, each person only gets about a sixth

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.269
of an acre of land.

00:16:46.269 --> 00:16:51.970
So even if you assume a Chinese family of
four, that's still 673 times smaller than

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:53.819
the average American farm.

00:16:53.819 --> 00:16:58.649
When you're talking about plots of land that
are so small, farming in China is really not

00:16:58.649 --> 00:17:00.319
a viable lively hood.

00:17:00.319 --> 00:17:01.939
It's more of a sustenance insurance plan.

00:17:01.939 --> 00:17:05.800
It's just a way to make sure that you can
keep your family fed.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.680
So anyone who really wants to do more than
just keep your family fed they typically have

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:16.900
to send at least one family member to the
cities to look for work as migrants.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:20.850
And then I also want to look at what are some
of the difficulties that migrants face when

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:21.900
they arrive in the cities.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:22.900
There's a lot of them.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.920
I'll just go over them quickly.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.900
The first one is working conditions.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.630
They tend to be overworked.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:38.080
70% or 80% will work seven days a week, 9,
10, 12, 15 hour days are very common.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.880
Also, they tend to be underpaid.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:45.320
And there was a lot of news in China a couple
years back that migrant salaries had risen

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:52.040
quickly and they're now within about $20 to
$30 of a college graduate starting salary.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:57.240
And so, when this news came out what happened
is a lot of seventh graders, sixth, seventh,

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:01.550
eighth graders, started dropping out of school
because they thought "Oh I can go to the city

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:04.240
and make [laughs] about what a college graduate
makes."

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.791
But of course, what they're not really thinking
about is, is that a college graduate, one

00:18:07.791 --> 00:18:11.680
their salaries is going to go up pretty steeply
over the course of their life, but also a

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:19.180
college graduate is not working seven days
a week, 16 hour days, 360 days a year.

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:23.800
If you look hour-by-hour, migrants are still
quite underpaid.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:29.040
And then also in terms of living conditions,
so these City Villages are often built very

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.701
haphazardly, a lot of safety hazards there.

00:18:32.701 --> 00:18:36.030
And also migrants they live in very small
spaces.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:41.870
50% of migrants will live in eight square
meters or less, which is essentially a bed

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.081
with a walkway around it.

00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:45.110
It's very small living space.

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:48.780
And then these villages also, because they're
people are so transient, there they have a

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:52.220
lot of social problems and crime.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.190
And then there's difficulties in terms of
social conditions.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:59.560
Many migrants they leave their kids back in
the village, their parents are back in the

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.681
village, sometimes, --in the book there's
one family--, where the wife is one city as

00:19:03.681 --> 00:19:07.390
a migrant, the husband's in another city as
a migrant, and they have two daughters each

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:10.170
with a different relative in a different village.

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:13.930
This is very common that migrants, their families
are very split apart.

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:20.640
There's also a stigma among the urban population
that migrants and migrant children are sort

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.060
of lower quality, than the urban population.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:28.200
And, I think also, I don't hear a lot of people
talk about this, but I think psychologically

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:33.010
it's also very difficult you come from a village
and you're living in this very new modern

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:37.130
city and you're helping to develop it and
yet you yourself feel like you don't have

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:39.860
any place there and you're not really a part
of what's happening.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:44.670
So, I think psychologically, there's a lot
of difficulties.

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:49.340
Now the last one I want to talk about is probably
the biggest and hottest topic in China right

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:53.850
now in terms of migration and that has to
do with China's Hukou system or its household

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.760
registration system.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:02.570
Essentially this is a system in which every
person, at birth, is ascribed to a location

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:08.080
in which they belong and you're labeled as
either an urban person or a rural person.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:12.860
So in China, urban and rural are not just
adjectives, they're actually legal definitions.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:17.220
And once you are, and it's not, I should say
it's not based on where you are born, because

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:21.100
then everybody would just go and have their
kids in Beijing, but it's based on where your

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:24.310
parents are registered.

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:29.170
And once you are registered as a rural person,
it's very difficult to change that registration

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:30.540
to a city registration.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.840
The only really easy way to do that is to
go to college.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:38.810
If you can get into college, you can change
your registration and become a full-fledged

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:41.890
urbanite and sort of seamlessly integrate
into society.

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:47.820
But in rural areas, less than 25% of kids
are going to have the opportunity to go to

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:48.820
college.

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:53.640
For most people, once you are born as a rural
person that's, that's it for life.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.590
You are going to be officially a rural person.

00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:00.140
In the beginning of this system, actually
China's had some version of this system on

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:06.390
and off for 2000 years, but the most recent
reincarnation was implemented by Mao in the

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:11.890
late '50s as a means of preventing people
from fleeing the countryside when collectivized

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:14.320
agriculture began.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:17.340
At that time, you had to have a lot of, if
you wanted to leave where you were registered,

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:22.090
you needed a lot of permissions and it was
considered illegal to move about basically

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:23.150
without permission.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:27.770
Today, they don't use the system in that way,
so people are free to move back and forth,

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:28.770
as they want.

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:32.580
What they do use the system for is to allocate
benefits.

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:38.630
Everybody in China is entitled to free education
for their children, to subsidized health care,

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:43.860
but you're only entitled to those things in
the location in which you are registered.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:47.050
For migrants when they leave where they're
registered they come to the cities where they're

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:53.200
not registered they often their kids are turned
way from urban schools, they can't get healthcare,

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.240
they can't buy property, they can't get legal
protection.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:01.010
So there's a, it's really created a bit of
a two class system and in many ways that,

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:04.800
although these migrants are not considered
illegal, they're treated in many ways similar

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:09.710
to illegal immigrants would be in other countries.

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:13.360
This is really emerging as a big problem in
China and that brings me back to the point

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:20.540
that migrants and the issues related to migration
are really emerging in China as the key domestic

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.060
challenge that the government has to face.

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:27.430
I think it's easy to throw big numbers when
you talk about China but if you think about

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:32.740
300 million people moving within the next
20 years that's basically like taking the

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:38.220
entire population of the US and having every
man woman and child leave wherever they are,

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:44.130
go to a new place, get a new job, find a new
place to live and, I think, if we try to do

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:48.450
that, obviously, I think it would probably
degenerate into chaos pretty quickly.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:53.450
If you think about it from that perspective,
you can really see the enormity of the challenge

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:58.710
that is facing China right now and the potential
for things to go wrong at multiple levels.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:02.060
I think, probably things going wrong might
be the expected norm when you're talking about

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:07.370
such fast and rap-, wide scale migration.

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:11.660
That really makes people like those that I'm
writing about in Eating Bitterness critical

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.730
to China's future.

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:18.330
I want to give you an overview of some of
the stories that you'll find in the book.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:24.900
It's, the book starts actually with this family
of vegetable vendors who never intended to

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.230
immigrated to the city.

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:33.160
But about 12 years ago, well in the '90s I
should say, in the '90s this man he was doing

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:37.580
construction as a part time job in his village,
he was in an accident and was hospitalized

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:41.810
for more than two years and had to have multiple
surgeries.

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:47.420
And wracked up medical bills that would be
about $12,000 US dollars, but for a farmer

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:53.190
in rural China in the '90s that was an astronomical
amount that he could never really hope to

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:55.240
pay back on farming wages.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:24:00.230
And so his wife left him and their one-year-old
daughter in the village with his mother and

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:02.670
went to the city to look for work.

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:06.971
Now they are reunited, that was about 12 years
before I met them and they are reunited now,

00:24:06.971 --> 00:24:17.130
in Xi'an, and they work everyday from 3 A.M.
to 9 P.M., so 18-hour days, 7 days a week,

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:20.040
basically they take a day off for the Spring
Festival.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.110
This is has been the last 12 years they have
been working like that.

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:27.220
What they told me is they do this with the
one goal in mind and that's that their daughter

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:30.760
doesn't have this same sort of tired existence
that they do.

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:36.600
That she'll have more skills to offer society
and something more to do with her life.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:42.660
And there's also a chapter about young girls
who don't pass the high school entrance exams,

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:47.160
so right out of middle school, at 15, they
come to the cities looking for work and these

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:53.090
girls end up working in a chain of beauty
salons, which is really a new industry emerging

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:55.020
in western China.

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:59.820
This chain of beauty salons, it's very good
at holding up a picture of a very bright future

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:05.120
the girls can have if they work hard and find
a way to become managers in this company.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.650
And they're always kind of saying, "You can
have a house and a car and you can become

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:11.560
a permanent urban resident."

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:15.810
The girls, for their part, they're really
eager to accomplish these things and yet they

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:21.840
feel sort of helpless and hopeless because,
as fairly poorly educated girls coming from

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:26.240
the countryside, they don't feel that they
ever really could become managers in a company

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.240
like this.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.401
They live with this underlying fear that if
they don't get their act together and figure,

00:25:31.401 --> 00:25:34.820
figure things out they may not have a permanent
place in the city.

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:38.730
They may end up going back to their villages
and being farmers like their parents.

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:43.390
This chapter, this is a very sort of common
thing that happens to young people who come

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:45.310
to cities.

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:47.100
So this is that chapter.

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:51.330
Then there's a chapter about a family who
is actually the one of the original family

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:55.710
of farmers in the City Village of Gan Jia
Zhai and they lost their land when the high

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:57.640
tech zone was built.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:02.110
Probably you've followed the news you've seen
there's been a lot of protests in China in

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:03.110
the last year.

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:06.710
I think there's about 100 thousand protests
last year about farmers who've had their land

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:12.240
unfairly grabbed from them, or they've been
not well compensated for their land.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.700
That's a serious problem in China.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:18.650
But I've never seen anyone really talking
about the other side of the picture, which

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:22.280
is actually more common, which is farmers
are paid well for their land.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:26.590
I don't think that plays as catchy of a headline,
so you don't see it very often.

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:31.580
In all the villages that I've been to, most
farmers are sort of eagerly awaiting for the

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:35.190
day when the city might expand out to their
village because they know that they'll make

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:39.560
more money, that they'll get paid more money
for their land than they could ever make farming

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:40.560
their land.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:47.150
It's sort of seen like a lottery ticket, if
you can if the city moves out to your village.

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:51.780
This family, when their farmland was bought
from them in the '90s to make way for the

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:56.770
high tech zone, at that time in China, an
extremely wealthy person was not called a

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:59.310
millionaire, they were called a ten thousandaire.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:04.000
If you had, ten thousand Renminbi at that
time you were extremely wealthy.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.790
They made at that time 50,000, they got paid
50,000 Renminbi for their land, so they were

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:12.250
ten thousandaires five times over.

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:16.670
[laughs] On top of that, when I met them,
by renting out rooms in their home they made

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:20.440
about 10,000 Renminbi in income a month.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:24.920
At that time, a software programmer in the
high tech zone would make about 3,000.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.620
So financially, they are very set.

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:30.550
What happens, and this is extremely common
in this village and I've seen this in many

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:35.000
City Villages, is that now they have, they
are financially secure but they don't have

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.260
anything to do and they don't really have
a lot of other skills, skill sets so idleness

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:45.360
and addiction really sort of seep in and so
this man, he's been addicted to mahjong for

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.000
the last 20 years.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.260
He told me it's his full time occupation.

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:53.860
It's really sad in some ways and, in fact
in this village, many people told me that

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:59.840
when they lost their land the farmers now,
some people turn to Buddhism, like everyone

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.500
was looking for something to occupy their
time.

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:05.830
So some people turn to Buddhism, some people
turn to gambling, but then they said, "The

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:09.040
most pitiful of us are those who didn't find
anything and we still don't know what to do

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.470
with our time."

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:13.630
I think this chapter's pretty important because
it shows the other side of the picture in

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:19.120
terms of what happens when China's farmers
who lose their land to urbanization are paid

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.120
well.

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:26.150
There's a whole new set of social issues that
really creep in to these areas.

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:33.570
The book ends with the story of a 32 year
old, second grade dropout, who came to Xi'an

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:38.410
essentially destitute but with in about five
years amassed a small empire of convenience

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:45.060
stores and health clinics and fitness stores,
fitness centers and really he's blown past

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:48.400
all the typical obstacles that would be in
a migrant's path.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:53.320
But he finds himself more lonely and isolated
than he ever was as a poor man.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:58.220
He really, he has this desire to turn his
sight away from his own material prosperity

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:00.700
and he wants to become a philanthropist.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:05.260
But he doesn't tell anybody this because he
feels like, in Chinese society today, nobody

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:09.000
could really understand that desire and they
would sort of laugh at him and say "Stop being

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.220
silly, just focus on getting more rich" basically.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:17.780
I was really drawn to this story not just
because it's sort of a typical rags to riches

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:22.930
story but I think that it's really emblematic
of the direction that modern China is headed.

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:29.860
Because when China started its opening and
reform policies 30 years ago, people had this

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:34.140
underlying concept that first, you have to
focus on material prosperity, you have to

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:37.450
have a strong material foundation and then
you can think about other things.

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:41.000
And in fact, many people still have this idea
today.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.950
Things that weren't sort of directly related
to material prosperity were seen as distractions.

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:50.620
But today China's changed a lot in the last
30 years and there are a lot of people now

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:56.510
who are becoming quite wealthy and who are
reaching those material dreams that they set

00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:58.160
out for themselves, or are surpassing them.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:04.200
You see in Chinese cities now a real restlessness
setting in as people sort of wondering what

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:08.650
else is there to life beyond just having a
strong material foundation.

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:13.810
You see a rise of things that previously everyone
thought were distractions like religion or

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:20.600
social activism, environmentalism, philanthropy,
these things are gradually on the rise now

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.160
in China.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:27.870
I think that while most migrants aren't going
to become as successful as this man, I mean,

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:31.790
most urbanites aren't even going to become
as successful as this man has become.

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:36.730
Right now, the GDP in China is growing so
fast that the it's essentially doubling every

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:38.280
seven years.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.780
Everybody is seeing changes in their lifestyles.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:46.200
Everyone, not evenly obviously, but everyone
is seeing improvements.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:52.770
I think that at some point these migrants
who, for decades, have basically been sort

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:58.720
of blindly pushing ahead and enduring difficulties,
eating bitterness, without really having many

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:04.290
demands or expectations, at some point people
are going to stop and sort of reassess that

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:08.890
mentality and want more out of life and want
more out of their labor.

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:13.590
You do see this happening already in China
especially among the younger generation that

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:18.320
they're willing to endure difficulties and
eat bitterness but only without it being sort

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:22.230
of a temporary means to a more comfortable
end.

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:26.280
This is really a challenge to China because
its whole development model has sort of relied

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:32.040
on that fact that people are willing and able
to endure a lot without having a lot of expectations

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.040
and without complaining.

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:37.620
This is a challenge to China as it moves forward.

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:40.690
So that's where the book ends and that's where
I'd like to end today.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:48.400
So essentially the book obviously is of interest
to anyone who is interested in China or urbanization,

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.470
migration, social transformation, development.

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:57.390
But I think over and above that, it's a work
of literary non-fiction that is really a human

00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:59.190
story in the end.

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:04.760
The term 'eating bitterness' is a Chinese
term, but it's obviously not an exclusively

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:09.770
Chinese quality, it's a human quality that
you see over and over in history as the human

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:15.500
spirit sort of rises up and overcomes what
seems to be insurmountable obstacles.

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:21.010
In this book, every chapter has sort of tragedies
that people face yet also a lot of triumph

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:23.810
as they overcome the difficulties.

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:28.450
That's where I will end and if anybody has
any questions we can open it up for questions.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:35.950
The pollution in Xi'an was so bad when I was
there, when I first moved there, where I lived

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:40.510
in my apartment, there was no tall buildings
they were all being built in the distance.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:45.740
So I could look out in the distance and for
a year and half I lived there, not knowing

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:50.140
that one day there was a clear blue sky day
and suddenly I saw this huge mountain range

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:53.930
right out my window that I had no idea existed
for a year and half.

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:58.340
[laughs] The pollution there was very terrible.

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.800
I think it's still pretty bad.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:06.080
Now I live in Beijing and people who haven't
lived in Xi'an think Beijing pollution is

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:10.770
terrible, but I'm like "it's blue sky, at
least 50% of the time."

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:16.230
Yeah, I haven't been there too often in the
last few years, but I think it's still pretty.

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:22.360
Yeah, that's definitely in Chinese there's
a term called the after '80s generation.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:28.430
Essentially anybody born after 1980 has only
grown up in China's economic good times.

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:32.550
It's actually derog-, it's a slightly derogatory
term that the older generation will use to

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:38.580
sort of say, "Oh, those kids born after 1980,
they don't really know how to endure difficulty,

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:43.110
they never really faced sort of deprivation
and starvation and all these things that the

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:45.610
older generations have gone through."

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:49.710
Yeah, their work ethic is definitely very
different and I think it's a big challenge

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:56.310
for the companies that employ them because
their not sort of willing to just go through

00:33:56.310 --> 00:34:00.820
so many difficulties without, for example
people don't want to migrate as far.

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:05.740
They're having more and more difficulties
getting people to migrate to the east, because

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:10.470
a lot of migration happens from west to east,
obviously, because of the income gap.

00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:17.430
There definitely it's causing a lot of changes
in the way migrants work in China.

00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:21.629
Yeah, the probably the biggest thing the government
is doing is they're trying to expand that

00:34:21.629 --> 00:34:22.830
education system.

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:27.399
And, in fact, they've really spent the last
decade trying to rapidly expand the education

00:34:27.399 --> 00:34:28.399
system.

00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:33.310
If you look back in the 1990s, only about
3% of students could get into college because

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:35.700
there just wasn't enough universities at that
time.

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:38.800
Today it's about 25% can get into college.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:44.490
Still that's low but considering they went
from 4 to 25% in a decade and also the same

00:34:44.490 --> 00:34:49.200
with high schools, that they have not enough
high schools for so many kids and so the first

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:54.100
thing they are trying to do is have more schools
and allow more people to have higher levels

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:58.220
of education so they can do more skilled jobs
in the future.

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:03.010
Also, this whole issue of the household registration
system, there's been a lot of pressure on

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:06.660
China to get rid of that system, do something
about that.

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:10.820
But it's interesting because in the places
where they've had, in cities where they've

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:15.760
had pilot programs to get rid of that system,
two things have happened.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:21.470
One is that a lot of cities who offered urban
benefits to the migrant population, they went

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:26.590
bankrupt pretty quickly because they just
didn't have the capacity to offer benefits

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:28.570
to so many more people.

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:33.670
But the other thing that's happened is, in
western China for example, I forgot if it's

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:39.500
in Chengdu or Chongqing, but in western China,
one city had this policy that they wanted

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:45.000
to allow 10 million migrants to trade in their
rural registration for an urban registration

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.380
so they could become official city residents.

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:54.450
But within, in the first year of that program,
they only had a few thousand takers.

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:58.910
And this actually corresponds with what I
saw when I was interviewing people that many

00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:07.350
migrants said to me, "We don't have many skills,
we do physical manual labor and at some point

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:08.640
our bodies are going to break down.

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.850
We're going to get old, we're going to get
injured, something.

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:15.420
And if we traded in, because your land is
tied with that rural registration, if you

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:18.720
give up your rural registration, you give
up your land."

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:22.490
If they trade in that rural registration for
an urban registration, they said, "Some point

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:26.080
when my body breaks down, how can I support
my life in the cities.

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:30.630
I don't have enough skill to find another
kind of job."

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:36.800
Most migrants right now, at least, are not
willing to trade in that piece of land for

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:40.130
ur-, official urban status, where you get
more benefits.

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:43.170
So it's a quandary for the government, because
they have this pressure to get rid of this

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:50.390
system and yet the people who everyone's advocating
for, aren't really interested in giving up

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:52.080
their rural residency right now.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:56.050
Well, that's a good question; I wouldn't call
it phenomenal success.

00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:58.000
I think China is a country with a lot of contradictions.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:05.320
You see, for example, in the last 30 years,
600 million people were raised out of poverty.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:08.320
You see an emergence of a really wealthy class
now.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:13.700
But yet at the same time there are still people
who are living in a very poor situations.

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.820
So it's kind of a mixed bag, I think, in terms
of China.

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:20.830
But overall, I think, yeah, things have gone
pretty smoothly for China.

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:24.780
I think partly because people have such a
work ethic.

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:30.590
The other day when I said somewhere that "China
has lifted 600 million people out of poverty."

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:31.760
And someone said, "No, no, no.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.370
600 million people in China lifted themselves
out of poverty."

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:38.150
So I think that partly it is, that was a good
distinction, because partly it is just the

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:40.000
hard work ethic that people have.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.150
They really have helped the country to move
forward so quickly.

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:47.470
So it's going to be interesting as this younger
generation has a very different sort of mindset

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:49.770
and work ethic, to see what's going to happen.

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:55.870
There have been in the recent years, there've
been some small-scale protests that have happened.

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:59.920
I think the main, one of the main ones people
protests about is they want their kids to

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:03.690
be able to have education in the cities.

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:08.010
Socially, families being split up is not a
good policy and even family who bring their

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:11.890
kids to the city, they can only bring them
there for primarily school because if you

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:16.220
want to take the test to get into high school,
you have to go back to the place where you're

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:19.980
registered, your household, you're registered
and take the test there.

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:25.680
Yes, the big that people are sort of unhappy
about is the situation with their children.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:30.360
And also in factories, for example, sometimes
people don't get paid on time, or they don't

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.960
get paid for months.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.340
I've heard of protests about things like that.

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:38.000
But I haven't seen anything sort of large
scale happening.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.980
I think that is because people, one: they
have this work ethic to just endure, but also

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:48.090
I think there's there's a bit of the collective
mentality in China that still is there.

00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:52.250
People, you often will hear people who will
say, "I personally don't like, this situation,

00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:56.420
or that situation, but I know that it's good
for China, or I know that it's helping China

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:57.420
to advance."

00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:03.250
People are sort of willing to put their own
personal happiness or satisfaction aside for

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:06.830
what they perceive to be the good of the country.

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:13.070
Yeah, I think it's probably the local governments
who don't feel equipped to offer benefits

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:14.120
on such a wide scale.

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:19.070
In some cities, like in Shanghai, 40% of the
population is migrant population.

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:25.110
If you are suddenly going to offer them benefits
as well, I think the local governments feel

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:28.460
like they don't know how to deal with that,
or they are not willing to deal with that

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:29.520
right now.

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:34.740
Yeah, I think that's true, for example in
that chapter that I write about the landless

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:37.800
landlords, the people who became wealthy when
their land was bought out.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:43.450
They made the comment that in that City Village
now, the people who collect the trash or do

00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:47.890
the recycling or do any of those sort of jobs,
none of them are the local people anymore,

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:53.120
because they said, "Once people have sort
of financial stability, no one's willing to

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.670
do those jobs anymore."

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:59.270
The people who do those jobs in a City Village
like that will all also be migrants and so

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:04.370
there's definitely even among that population
there's the different classes that emerged.

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:10.230
Yeah, it, it, I don't know how that is going
to play out in the future, but there definitely

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:14.520
is this group of people who when their land
is bought up they become extremely wealthy

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:17.900
and a whole bunch of social problems follow
that.

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:24.130
Well, I should say at first that, that's what
happened in the factories in the south.

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:28.840
In my book, I don't write about factory workers
because, really, they are something of a migrant

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:29.840
subculture.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:35.700
If you work in a factory, you work there,
you're given a dormitory on the factory grounds,

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:40.470
you eat in the factory cafeterias, they often
have movie theaters and bowling alleys, and

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:42.210
it's a whole universe into itself.

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:46.890
A lot of times the factories might have 70,000
employees, so we're talking about, it's basically

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:47.890
a city.

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:52.330
So those migrants are really sort of isolated
from the larger society, so I didn't write

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:55.970
about those, so I don't know so much about
the conditions in factories.

00:40:55.970 --> 00:41:01.180
What I will say, this isn't a justification
for any abuses that happened in those factories,

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:06.970
but that a lot of the migrants that I wrote
about, who are self employed, they still choose

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:11.119
to live almost identically to the factory
workers.

00:41:11.119 --> 00:41:16.600
For example, that family of vegetable vendors,
on their own accord they choose to work 18-hour

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:22.760
days and they live in what's essentially a
one car garage with no windows.

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:25.520
There's a room for two beds and when they
want to eat, they turn a crate on its side

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:27.000
and it's sort of a makeshift table.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.470
There's no plumbing, they cook in the hallways,
that kind of thing.

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:36.720
Originally, as I got to know them, coming
from my western perspective, I assumed that

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:41.140
they're just destitute, like they are doing
this because they have other options in life.

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:44.310
But as I got to know them, it turns out, no.

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:50.240
In China, the savings rate is between 30 and
40%, but migrants try to be as close to 100%

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.510
as they can.

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:54.580
And so it's hard coming from America where
the, I think it's a negative savings rate,

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:59.320
if I'm not mistaken, [laughter] to kind of
wrap your mind around the fact that people

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:03.890
will be willing to not just live at their
means, but way below their means.

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:09.480
So this family, actually, they've been saving
money for years and to have enough money to

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:15.630
build something of a mansion back in the countryside
and pay for their parents, as they're getting

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:18.200
older and their kids' education and all of
these things.

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:23.580
I think it's it's important to sort of realize
that migrants aren't seeing their own reality

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:28.350
as maybe we are viewing it and hearing about
it in the media.

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:32.730
I think there are factories were conditions
are bad, but from what I understand, in factories

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:37.510
where they try to make conditions better,
so they cut the overtime for example, people

00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:42.720
will quit because they're there exactly for
the expressly for the purpose of making money

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:47.600
and even if this is a factory with better
conditions, if it doesn't give them enough

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:52.240
hours so they can make as much money as possible,
they'll quit and go to a worse factory with

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:55.490
longer hours so they can make more money.

00:42:55.490 --> 00:43:01.260
Yeah, it's interesting to think about it from
their perspective and their motivations.

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:05.440
Yeah, that's a big concern in China, because
China actually, from the beginning, had a

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:09.100
lack of arable land considering its size.

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:13.140
Then as more and more farmland gets bought
up, obviously, that's a concern.

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:19.040
The central government has tried to put a
curb on the local government's ability to

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:25.060
take farm land, not always with great success
because local governments buying up farmland

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:30.290
and turning them into urban development that's
sort of the local government's major, major

00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:32.820
income source in lots of areas.

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:36.790
In terms of having enough people to do the
farming, so the land is an issue, but in terms

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:42.450
of the actual movement of people China right
now has way too many rural people considering

00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:46.410
now that it's mechanized agriculture, they
don't need 700 million people.

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:51.990
So they, actually as people leave the villages,
it's very good for farming because then fewer

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:57.130
people left in the rural areas can have bigger
plots of land, make a salary that's somewhat

00:43:57.130 --> 00:44:00.360
more comparable to an urban salary.

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:05.290
Definitely, that the literacy rate in China,
I think in the 80s, like if you go back to

00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:12.590
like the 1950s it was less than 50% and the
80s it was about 60% and today it's about

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:17.250
94% literacy, so most people can read, of
course.

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:21.119
And if you look at just the young population,
it's about 99% literacy.

00:44:21.119 --> 00:44:25.250
So these people, in this village, they definitely
all could read, they went to middle school,

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:26.920
that family that man who's addicted to Mahjong.

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:31.960
But I think that there's a stereotype at least
in this province of China that the men are

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:36.940
sort of, well, OK, the women will say that
the men are lazy.

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:38.250
The women tend to be more the go-getters.

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:44.380
There is also a chapter where, in the book,
where the wife is really wanting to sort of

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:48.670
work her way up and become this official urban
resident and get a house and all these things

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:52.060
and the husband is kind of, like "We're fine.

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:53.060
Life is good.

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:57.800
You know, I can play pool all day and you
know, why do we need to work so hard?"

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:02.140
There's a bit of that that you see that people
are just sort of like, "I have money now,

00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:03.560
what do I need to sort of keep working."

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:07.570
So people don't have higher aspirations for
themselves.

00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:12.300
But they definitely could and a few people
do, but overall there tends to be sort of

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:13.940
this lethargy that sort of sinks in.

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:17.640
OK, well thank you so much everybody for coming.

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:18.640
It's been great.

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:18.700
[Applause]
