00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.120
From the studio that just...

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.900
can't...

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.740
seem...

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.760
to launch...

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.220
a franchise.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.540
Comes the reboot no one wanted

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.900
that ended up being really fun?

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.340
And something I wouldn't mind seeing more of?

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.080
Is this...

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.440
Is this what hope feels like?

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.920
You love the 1995 original.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.700
Now, the reboot is tossing out the setting,

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.840
the premise,

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.180
the dead kids,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.620
the Robin Williams,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.780
and pretty much everything except the name.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.960
"JUMANJI!"

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.740
But since I swore a blood oath to see every movie The Rock makes,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.540
here we are.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.700
Meet 4 teenagers

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.260
who are all unique in a Breakfast Clubby kinda way.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.700
Watch them learn self-confidence and compassion,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.180
just like The Breakfast Club,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.380
thanks to an action-packed day in detention,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.820
just like that other movie.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.180
I believe it was called...

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.360
Power Rangers.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.500
"You must be a bully of detention."

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.120
Thrill as each teen is Jumanji'd into an avatar that represents their character arc,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.860
the nerd who needs courage,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.860
the jock who needs humility,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.680
the weirdo who needs confidence,

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.200
and the popular girl who needs to learn...

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.660
how a penis works.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.800
"So, how do we do this?"

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.960
"Oh my God, these things are crazy!"

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.200
It may be on the nose,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.660
but you'll laugh as all the actors get to play against their usual type.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.980
"Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry."

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.060
"HAHAHAHAHA!"

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.720
"I like can't even with this place."

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.980
Except for Kevin Hart.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.760
"I don't have the top 2 feet of my body!"

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.240
Kevin Hart always Kevin Harts.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.840
"Help!

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.280
"AAAHHH!!"

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.300
"Oh my God!"

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.000
"AH!"

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.780
Enter Jumanji,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.160
the board game that literally rebooted itself for a new generation

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.660
that's sort of a riff on the tropes of video games,

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.080
"I think he's an NPC."

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160
except when it drops the pretense to be a normal adventure movie again.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.840
"They got away."

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.100
"We lost them in the jungle."

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.020
Wait, why are the NPCs talking to each o-

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.400
Uh, yeah, you know what? Never mind.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.600
But it still does a good job at poking fun at female heroes designed by dudes,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.740
"Why am I wearing this outfit in a jungle?"

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.860
scripted events,

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.860
"Dr. Bravestone, Jumanji needs you!"

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.140
"Jumanji needs you!"

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:09.640
Jumanji needs you!"

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.180
"Jumanji needs him."
"Jumanji needs you!"

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.920
"We know."

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.020
and multiple violent deaths that never seem to faze the characters.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.560
"Rose!"

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.200
"My God!"

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.800
"Chill out, he'll be back."

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.700
You know, if Mario was real, he'd never stop screaming.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.580
After 35 years,

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.940
Jack Black finally returns to the jungle,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.280
"Just last night, I was lost in the jungle with Pitfall Harry surrounded my man-eating crocodiles!"

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.100
while The Rock just can't get enough

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.140
in the third chapter of his secret jungle quadrilogy

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.540
that's a pure celebration of his Rock appeal

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.140
as Dwayne Johnson spends an entire movie discovering the joys...

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.680
of being Dwayne Johnson,

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.020
whether it's his arms,

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.860
"Jesus, would you look at the size of that thing?"

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.920
realizing he has no weaknesses,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.500
"None?"

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.900
his sex appeal,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.420
or the effect he has on large bearded men,

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.440
"Damn, that is a man right there."

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.900
you'll totally buy into the hype that's going to make him the second least qualified president someday.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.960
So gear up for a flick that surprised everyone at the box office,

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.880
paid proper respect to the original,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.020
"This is Alan Parish's house. I'm just living in it."

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.180
and reminded every studio that when most of your reboots,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.580
feature-length comedies,

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.740
and video game movies are terrible,

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.580
we'll slob all over you just for showing basic competence.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.280
Eugh! Ugh!

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.580
"Cake?"

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.660
"Albino rhinos!"

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.380
"They're huge, white, scary, and stupid and they eat people."

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.580
Good news, Kev. We've got them on the ropes.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.880
Yay, go us.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:00.840
"Oh, no."

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.580
Hey, Screen Junkies, want to avoid more of your life?

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.400
Click the box on the left for our new show, Smash Hit, where we break down the career of Will Smith.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.980
Or click the box on the right to see us play emoji games with John Cena.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.260
Hopefully, you could see him because we could not.
