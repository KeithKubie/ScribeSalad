1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,570
Wait. Do you want to do, do we should
run that just at a classic intro? Sure.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,760
Hey, I'm Jad and I'm Robert. This
is the radio lab podcast. Yes.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,780
The podcast. And, uh, I gotta be honest.
I have no idea what we're about to do.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,733
This is a,

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,730
hello. What's this?

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,710
Are we in a boat? No, but
we're going to be, Eh,

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,060
this actually story actually
starts in a supermarket.

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,200
Why did you give me the boat?
Was a tease. Yes. That's a tease.

9
00:00:29,201 --> 00:00:31,260
That's what a classic. So
give me some supermarket,

10
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:32,820
then I'll give you some supermarket.

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,753
So

12
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:41,410
that's hat Walter. See, I asked pat a
few weeks ago to hi Pat, by the way.

13
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,660
Yes. Pat Walters, regular person here.
That is one of our producers. I said,

14
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,520
I want him to look for stories
about old lobsters. Why? Well,

15
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,840
I'm not going to tell you that
right now, but you'll see later on,

16
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:53,640
why come I give me a hint? No,
I'm not gonna give you a hint,

17
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,450
but he found a lady. You could
just, uh, introduce yourself.

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,550
Do you want me to say whatever you
wanna say? Okay. Hi, I'm Bonnie Hasan,

19
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,970
I'm a registered nurse and, um,

20
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,730
and Bonnie told us a pretty crazy story.

21
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,610
Did just tell you briefly, uh,

22
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,090
what happened was I had just
gone to work grocery store

23
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,160
just to just any old day. It wasn't okay.

24
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,430
Tenille Day, nothing
special about that day.

25
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,140
And where's this and where's this just

26
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,790
all right. Where I live,
little McMurray, Pennsylvania.

27
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,020
We about 15 miles south
of Pittsburgh. And uh,

28
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,930
the year Jed? Yes. Is 19,

29
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,540
1990 19 August of 1990.

30
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,700
So I was looking around, you know,

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,460
admiring the new seafood
department and I noticed this tank,

32
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,140
the lobster tank and a, there were
only two lobsters in the tank. One,

33
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:43,870
she says it was really
small, but the other one,

34
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,900
this huge behemoth

35
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:48,560
that

36
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,900
well, it's just so massive.

37
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,620
How big is big in this case? He like
from the tip of my finger to my elbow.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,610
Oh, that's big.

39
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,330
Yeah. So she sees this big
lobster and she's like,

40
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,960
that tank is way too small. She thought
the lobster looked cramped. Yeah.

41
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,640
So she goes over to the guy behind
the seafood counter and she's like,

42
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:10,880
[inaudible],

43
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,940
what are you going to do with
this? Take a lobster. And uh,

44
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,820
he kind of just let me know that it
was a promotional for the new seafood.

45
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,590
Oh, I think it was just this big lobster
that would get sent around to different

46
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:24,690
supermarkets when they
wanted to attract attention.

47
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:24,831
Oh,

48
00:02:24,831 --> 00:02:29,250
I just made a few more inquiries and
worked my way up to the store manager and

49
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:34,251
he referred me to the vice president
of the chain and straight away.

50
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,040
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Because if they
didn't, they couldn't answer my question.

51
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,140
I probably was a little
bit of a pain. Right.

52
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,250
Like what are you going to do with them?

53
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,720
[inaudible] this is the moment where
the manager at the store decides, okay,

54
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,330
we have a complaining lady. I
think I can solve the problem.

55
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,430
He makes her an offer.

56
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,540
The bottom line was that I could have him,

57
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,330
if I could arrange for him to return,

58
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,330
she could have him, if she could
somehow get him back to Maine for Nate.

59
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,380
I don't know why. I guess
all lobsters are from Maine.

60
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:07,010
He thought so that's the author

61
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,370
like, okay, how do I do that?

62
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,190
That's a good question. Is this
Eh, in usual experience? I mean,

63
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:20,040
at least this is one case, this, this
actually has a long history of, uh,

64
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,750
people rescuing large lobsters. That's
true of course. And he's the author of,

65
00:03:23,751 --> 00:03:26,390
what is it, the secret life of lobsters.
Yeah, the secret life of lobsters.

66
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,740
Some people may remember the
story of Mary Tyler Moore. No.

67
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,670
In 1994,

68
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,700
Mary Tyler Moore developed a crush on
a large lobster 12 pounder who is named

69
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,630
Mr. Grant. He was named spikes in Malibu,

70
00:03:41,631 --> 00:03:43,970
California in a restaurant
called Gladstone's.

71
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:48,650
She put up $1,000 for the right to
rescue him. Wow. Hundred dollars.

72
00:03:48,651 --> 00:03:53,651
And then rush limbo heard about this
and he called the restaurant and offered

73
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,210
$2,000 for the right to eat spike. Well,

74
00:03:59,211 --> 00:04:02,960
so what did the restaurant
do? They refused, refused.

75
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,960
Uh, and there's been
other cases since then.

76
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,950
Trevor told us that he's actually read
about dozens of these lobster rescue

77
00:04:09,951 --> 00:04:14,420
stories, but our lobster story is the
original lobster story. And he very first,

78
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,840
I don't want to make the claim forever
for sure, but I'm just saying to stay.

79
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,990
If you googled it, this is your opening
lobster. All right, so it's still 1990.

80
00:04:20,991 --> 00:04:25,820
Yeah. Bonnie having now left the
supermarket. She's at home thinking now.

81
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,910
I really, I didn't know what to do

82
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,450
and she doesn't have the laughter
yet. She has no lobster yet.

83
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,300
That was when I started calling some
of the local animal organizations,

84
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:35,780
animal rescue league,

85
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:40,970
the ASP ca this locally trying to see if
there was anybody else there they could

86
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:44,650
help. They really wasn't there.
They're more into mammals.

87
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,740
I probably never even
heard of such a thing.

88
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,460
He basically told me forget it.

89
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,530
So what are we talking weeks of
research here are seven hours. Really?

90
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,150
Oh I was on the phone for hours,

91
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,920
but I had the time and it was kind of fun
project for her. Yeah, it's a project.

92
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,340
Yeah.

93
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,520
Cause then I called the Cousteau society
because I wasn't never the Cousteau

94
00:05:02,521 --> 00:05:05,910
society. And um, they suggest
that I call our local newspaper

95
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:14,830
article appeared Saturday morning paper.
Oh really? Did I have it right here.

96
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:15,963
It was in crustacean station.

97
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,400
Cruzen like Cruz.

98
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,290
Yeah. Not Cruising, but
Cruzen. C. R U. I. S. I. N. K.

99
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:27,370
Presentation. Mick Murray, woman talks
supermarket into releasing large lobster.

100
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,960
I really didn't talk with him. I'm just
quoting now. Yes. It's a long story.

101
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,460
It began Friday morning when Mrs Hasan
enter the Dyanavel supermarket here and

102
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,980
this store is newly opened seafood
section. She encountered Nick Nick.

103
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,250
Oh, the lobster has a name. Yeah.

104
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,050
Yeah. It clearly,

105
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:48,040
the king of crustaceans was lounging in
a large circular saltwater tank along

106
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,810
with several lesser lobsters.

107
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:54,490
They must've done something in the
way nick moved, spoke to Mrs Hasan,

108
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,300
so she spoke to several
giant Eagle employees.

109
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,620
This is hasten who described
herself as environmentally active.

110
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:03,330
Told them she thought nick might
be happier back home and name.

111
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:08,000
Then on someone's where? I really
didn't say that. Don't worry.

112
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,260
Mrs Hasan was told it was a
professional lobster. 70 years old.

113
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,530
70 years old. Yeah. Well,
we don't actually know.

114
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,930
There's no way to technically
age a lobster. Perfectly.

115
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,620
Estimates are from 50 to a hundred
years for those big suckers. Wow.

116
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,230
I'm not an invite. I didn't say
that. I'm not an environmental crazy.

117
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,580
I eat lobster, but I think they're
over harvested. Nick must be set free.

118
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,650
I didn't say that either. I see
you pounded him, your sister? Yeah,

119
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,173
Nick,

120
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,260
they tell me I could have nick if I
promise to take him to the ocean is Hazen

121
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,550
has no money for such a
trip, like a destitute.

122
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,370
Anyway, I guess that's what
appeared then in this state.

123
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,220
[inaudible]

124
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,570
and that could have been the end of it.

125
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,100
Saturday morning we got an early phone
call and there was this woman on the

126
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:04,030
other end of the line.

127
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,130
I'm Tony Leone.

128
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,830
Angie was saying she was in town
for my dad's funeral and yeah,

129
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,860
she was returning that afternoon tonight.

130
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,420
No. Yeah, to Maine, Portland, Maine.

131
00:07:15,421 --> 00:07:17,590
So I figured I'll just bring
him back with me and about,

132
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,250
well why would you leave and
think to do something like that?

133
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:25,590
Cause he was a massive lobster in a
teeny weeny tank that literally he could

134
00:07:25,591 --> 00:07:26,490
barely move in.

135
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,420
Now there's one other thing I remember
she was back in Pittsburgh for her dad's

136
00:07:30,421 --> 00:07:34,050
funeral. So is this in any way
an Omaj to your dad? Oh my God.

137
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:38,970
He loved lobster. He absolutely
loved to eat lobster. To eat lobster.

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,640
Yeah. He would eat them like
crazy, but he also loved it.

139
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:44,700
His oldest daughter would do things that
none of his other kids would ever do.

140
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,400
Yup. He would know that I
would do something like that.

141
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,760
He would expect me to do something
like that. So anyway, Tony and Bonnie,

142
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:54,210
they're on the phone at first. Finding
is actually a little suspicious.

143
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:58,290
Hello? Are you sure you're not just saying
that to eat them? Because I mean no.

144
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,860
And I said no, I wouldn't eat anything
that's big. He's, you know, he's too old.

145
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,690
I wish she reassured me
and she sounded very nice.

146
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,280
So we agreed to meet at Jiminy. Yeah. Yes,

147
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,140
that's correct. Now I'm getting my
daughter, my youngest daughter, oh,

148
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,220
they to hurry up and dressed.

149
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,660
They got to go to giant Eagle and
the woman met us at the store.

150
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,730
She had a two o'clock flight or that she
was there with the manager and I didn't

151
00:08:23,731 --> 00:08:27,600
know they was going to be a photographer
there from the local PBS station in

152
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:31,560
Pittsburgh Anyway. How many bought the
biggest styrofoam cooler she could find,

153
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,960
which really is still was
a little too small for him.

154
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,410
We got him in there, taped
it up as best we could

155
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,980
put them in a van and way they would.

156
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,920
When we got to the airport, we
get up to the reservation desk,

157
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,270
handed him to the stewardess and she
put him in a chair in first class.

158
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:54,190
What kind of like, wait a second.
We ran coach this last year.

159
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,660
Is that from that first? No. The
plane then touches down in Portland,

160
00:08:57,661 --> 00:09:00,200
Maine where the wildlife
police are waiting again.

161
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:05,520
Is anyone able to determine what everyone
here seems to have assumed that this

162
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:09,660
lobster comes from Maine? No fact
that it probably wasn't caught here.

163
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:13,440
Why'd you say that in Maine? You
can't catch big lobsters like that.

164
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:17,570
That's illegal because the big lobsters
are the ones that make more babies. Oh.

165
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,400
They have size limits that
they have on their lobsters.

166
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:25,110
So you are bringing a lobster then to a
venue that you reasonably suspect is a

167
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:28,620
foreign place. A foreign country. Wow.

168
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,300
But he could make friends.

169
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,770
So the next morning the
harbor patrol called and said,

170
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:40,080
do you want to go with us? We're
going to put him in the water.

171
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,190
So we jumped on their boat
at a newspaper reporter.

172
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,810
Went out in the boat with
them that morning too.

173
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,900
Okay, tell me, this is from
Maine. Read it to us. Yes.

174
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:53,950
After 1:00 PM as the marine patrol
boat locked in 30 feet of water,

175
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,000
Tony Leon carefully dropped
him dick over this side.

176
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,800
She washed in the sink and the
choppy frog. Shrouded waters,

177
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,750
then grin. I'm glad he made it

178
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,280
at night. It is nice.

179
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,830
But here's the real deep question here.
When we look at our fellow creatures,

180
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,410
we decide, well who can we?
Who Do we want to protect?

181
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:24,930
We include some groups
and we exclude others.

182
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,870
It seems almost entirely
arbitrary. For example,

183
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,720
why would someone save this lobster? Yeah,

184
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,950
I mean a lot of stories not cuddly
by any stretch of the imagination.

185
00:10:34,951 --> 00:10:39,540
Certainly not soft. I mean, was
it, was it its beauty? Well,

186
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,160
I actually think that, uh, that
lobsters are very attractive.

187
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,810
Really. You mean, do you always think
that? I have always thought, you know,

188
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,810
they're a lobster is like, it's, it's um,

189
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,240
how can I say this
appropriately for radio? Uh,

190
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,750
they're muscular and curvaceous at the
same time. You're like Popeye arms,

191
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:04,440
those claws, and then there's
that nice curving tail.

192
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,300
And I just think that lack of a hunky
mass lobster calendar, lobsters,

193
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,480
I'm not thousand eight. I'm not
talking about that on the radio.

194
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,300
That's just weird of you.

195
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:18,900
That can't be the reason why people
keep saving lobster. No, no, I know.

196
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,900
So what is it? I think that, uh,

197
00:11:21,901 --> 00:11:26,901
it has partly to do with our
obsession with longevity when it's,

198
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,340
when it's one that, that big and that
old, suddenly the rules are changed.

199
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,280
Here is, here is a creature, you know,

200
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:40,281
that has made it through all the tests
of life and it deserves our respect.

201
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:42,130
Now.

202
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:46,780
He was, he was unique. He was
special. And I just felt that, um,

203
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,490
didn't deserve to be in
that tank as his age.

204
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:58,660
Everything kind of converged at
that moment. I am asking my way.

205
00:11:58,661 --> 00:11:59,700
I can explain it. It

206
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,000
just kind of went with it.

207
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:20,690
[inaudible]

208
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,480
the story about lobsters. Thank you, pat.

209
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,870
I thought of dropping patty into
the cushion along with nick,

210
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,570
but when I had him upside down,

211
00:12:29,571 --> 00:12:34,070
I realized he was kind of attractive in
his own right and as if you could pick

212
00:12:34,071 --> 00:12:34,400
me up.
