00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:05.550
It’s not an illustrious category to belong
to of course, but there are plenty of us at

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:12.650
least. We worry about work, money, being left,
illness, disappointing, over-promising, madness

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.249
and disgrace, just to start the list. We worry
in the early hours, we worry on holiday, we

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:24.339
worry at parties and we worry all the time
while we’re trying to smile and seem normal

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:31.179
to good people who depend on us. It can izeel
pretty unbearable, at moments. A standard

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:36.370
approach when trying to assuage our blizzard
of worries is to look at each in turn and

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.890
marshal sensible arguments against their probabilities.
But it can, at points, also be helpful not

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.010
to look at the specifics of every worry and
instead to consider the overall position that

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.840
worry has come to occupy in our lives. There
is a hugely fascinating sentence on the topic

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:03.179
in an essay by the great English psychoanalyst
Donald Winnicott: ‘The catastrophe you fear

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:11.230
will happen has in fact already happened.’
When we worry, we are naturally fixated on

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.550
what will occur next: it’s the future, with
its boundless possibilities for horror, that

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.280
is the natural arena for exploration by our
panicked thoughts. But in Winnicott’s unexpected

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.810
thesis, something else is revealed: the disaster
that we fear is going to unfold is actually

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.770
behind us. There is a paradox here: why do
we keep expecting something to happen that

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.080
has already happened? Why don’t we better
distinguish past from present? Winnicott’s

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.000
answer that it’s in the nature of traumatic
events from childhood not to be properly processed

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.430
and as a result, like the dead who have not
been adequately buried and mourned, to start

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.020
to haunt us indiscriminately in adulthood.
But they do not make themselves felt in straightforward

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.020
For example, we may panic

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.390
that we are about to be humiliated and shamed.
There are no particularly strong grounds for

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.170
this in objective reality, but we are utterly
convinced nevertheless, because this is precisely

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.200
what happened to us when we were tiny and
at the hands of a parent. Or we worry intensely

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.780
that we are about to be abandoned in love
not because our partner is in any significant

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.380
way disloyal, but because someone who once
looked after us at a very vulnerable point

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.531
definitely was. A benefit of understanding
how much our worries owe to childhood is a

00:02:29.531 --> 00:02:35.660
new sense that it isn’t so much the future
we should be distressed about as the past.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.340
We can replace dread and apprehension with
something sadder yet ultimately more redemptive:

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.319
mourning. We can feel profoundly sorry for
our younger selves as an alternative to being

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.900
panicked for our future selves. Appreciating
the childhood legacy of worries, we also stand

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.380
to realise that we can adapt and improve on
how we respond to what alarms us. If we have

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.930
been well parented, we will have been bequeathed
a repertoire of good moves to latch on to

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.170
when crises occur: we know how to reach out,
seek help, perhaps move away and only take

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.319
as much responsibility as we are due. We have
access to a corridor through our troubles.

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.730
But when we have lacked this kind of tutelage,
we remain in significant ways, in relation

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.000
to our troubles, like the frightened children
we once were. We may be tall, drive a car

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.510
and sound like a grown-up, but faced with
concerns, resort to our toolkit of childlike

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.630
solutions: we overreact, we go silent, we
scream, we have a little sense of other options,

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:47.500
we feel extremely limited in our powers of
protest and agency, we lose all perspective.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.310
To which it is appropriate, and in no way
patronising, to remind ourselves of what can

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.750
– in our deeper psychological selves – still
be an entirely implausible thought: that we

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.530
are now adults. In other words, in response
to the kinds of terror we knew so well at

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.410
the age of four or eight, we don’t have
to be either as afraid or as powerless as

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:15.830
we were. We can mount a direct protest, we
can make an eloquent case for ourselves, we

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:23.059
can complain and defend our position, we can
rebuild our lives in a new way elsewhere.

00:04:23.059 --> 00:04:29.440
There are two ways to mitigate risk: to try
to remove all risk from the world. Or to work

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.509
on one’s attitude to risk. Knowing that
many of our fears have childhood antecedents

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:40.870
as do our responses to them can free us to
imagine that history won’t have to repeat

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.509
itself exactly. Adult life doesn’t have
to be as terrifying as our childhoods once

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:51.800
were and our responses to our fears can have
some of the greater vigour and confidence

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.060
that is the natural privilege of grown-ups.
We’ll still be worried a substantial portion

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:03.770
of the time, but perhaps with a little less
fragility and fewer burning convictions of

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:14.050
total upcoming catastrophe. Thank you for
