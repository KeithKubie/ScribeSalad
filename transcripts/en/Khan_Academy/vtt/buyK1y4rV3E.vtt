00:00:00.482 --> 00:00:01.959
- [Instructor] What we're
gonna do in this video

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:04.126
is figure out what 389,002

00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.399
minus 76,151 is.

00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:12.665
Like always, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:00:12.665 --> 00:00:14.295
and try to figure it out on your own.

00:00:14.295 --> 00:00:15.726
That's the best way to really,

00:00:15.726 --> 00:00:16.974
even if you're not able to figure out,

00:00:16.974 --> 00:00:18.272
or if you get a different answer,

00:00:18.272 --> 00:00:19.737
then when I work through it with you

00:00:19.737 --> 00:00:23.719
it will really stick in
your brain that much more.

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:25.156
Alright, now let's work
through it together.

00:00:25.156 --> 00:00:27.173
The way I'm gonna do
it is sometimes called

00:00:27.173 --> 00:00:29.971
the standard method or
the standard algorithm,

00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:33.412
algorithm being a fancy word for a method.

00:00:33.412 --> 00:00:37.928
What I'm gonna do is
first write the 389,002.

00:00:37.928 --> 00:00:38.761
389,002.

00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:44.851
And I'm subtracting 76,151.

00:00:48.494 --> 00:00:50.048
You notice the first thing that I did

00:00:50.048 --> 00:00:53.399
is I aligned the digits to
the appropriate place value.

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.820
I put the ones below the ones.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.179
The 10s below the 10s,
the 100s below the 100s,

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:00.949
the 1,000s below the 1,000s,

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.176
the 10,000s below the
10,000s, so on and so forth.

00:01:04.176 --> 00:01:06.137
And now we're ready to subtract.

00:01:06.137 --> 00:01:07.671
So the first thing we might do is well,

00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:09.361
let's look at the ones place.

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:13.581
Here I have two ones, and
I'm gonna take away one one.

00:01:13.581 --> 00:01:15.426
So I'm gonna be left with one one.

00:01:15.426 --> 00:01:17.044
That was pretty straightforward.

00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:18.834
But then things get a
little bit more difficult

00:01:18.834 --> 00:01:20.454
when we get to the 10s place.

00:01:20.454 --> 00:01:23.350
How do I take five 10s from zero 10s?

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.253
So let me just not think
about that for a second,

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:28.314
but I have the same
problem in the 100s place.

00:01:28.314 --> 00:01:31.442
How do I take away one 100 from zero 100s?

00:01:31.442 --> 00:01:33.264
Now when I go to the 1,000s place,

00:01:33.264 --> 00:01:36.771
I can take away six
1,000s from nine 1,000s,

00:01:36.771 --> 00:01:40.056
but before I do that what
I want to do is regroup

00:01:40.056 --> 00:01:41.601
so that I don't have zeros here

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:46.013
so that I can take away from
the 100s and the 10s place.

00:01:46.013 --> 00:01:50.367
And so what I can do is I
can rewrite nine 1,000s,

00:01:50.367 --> 00:01:52.672
so I'm gonna take away
one of those 1,000s,

00:01:52.672 --> 00:01:54.309
so I'm gonna have eight 1,000s.

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:57.853
And I'm gonna regroup it as 10 100s.

00:01:57.853 --> 00:02:01.436
So this can be that
1,000 would be 10 100s.

00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:06.770
Now that solves a problem,
except for the 10s place.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.708
But what I can then do
is I could take away

00:02:08.708 --> 00:02:12.014
one of those 100s so I
only have nine 100s now,

00:02:12.014 --> 00:02:16.304
and I could regroup that
extra 100 as 10 10s.

00:02:16.304 --> 00:02:17.387
So as 10 10s.

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:20.440
And now I can keep subtracting.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.607
So in the 10s place, 10 10s
minus five 10s, is five 10s.

00:02:27.285 --> 00:02:31.452
I go to the 100s place,
nine 100s minus 100 is 800.

00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:35.930
I go to the 1,000s place.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.180
8,000 minus 6,000 is 2,000.

00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:44.011
And then I can go to the 10,000s place.

00:02:44.011 --> 00:02:45.898
This is essentially eight 10,000s,

00:02:45.898 --> 00:02:50.394
or 80,000 minus 70,000
is going to be 10,000.

00:02:50.394 --> 00:02:52.097
One 10,000.

00:02:52.097 --> 00:02:56.334
And then last but not least,
I have my three 100,000s.

00:02:56.334 --> 00:02:57.454
So there you go.

00:02:57.454 --> 00:02:58.287
We're done.

00:02:58.287 --> 00:02:59.620
This is 312,851.

00:03:01.734 --> 00:03:03.601
This is the standard method.

00:03:03.601 --> 00:03:05.051
I started at the ones place.

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:07.072
Sometimes it's good to just do a check

00:03:07.072 --> 00:03:10.735
to make sure every digit on
top in the appropriate place

00:03:10.735 --> 00:03:13.065
is at least equal to the digit

00:03:13.065 --> 00:03:14.746
that you're subtracting from it.

00:03:14.746 --> 00:03:16.831
And so you can do the
regrouping ahead of time.

00:03:16.831 --> 00:03:20.500
But either way, you will end
up with a similar process.
