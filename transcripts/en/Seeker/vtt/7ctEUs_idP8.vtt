00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.510
Life… finds a way.

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:10.549
Unless it's a fossilized egg under a road,
then we just find it and study it.

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.829
Sup eggheads, Trace here rockin' the fossil
puns for DNews.

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:19.070
In the last 20 years, almost 17,000 dinosaur
eggs have been uncovered in the Guandong province

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.590
in China, earning it the name "Home of Dinosaurs."

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.500
Recently they found 43 more eggs, 19 of which
are completely intact, but don't go all Jurassic

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.300
Universe on me here, they're all fossils -- solid
pieces of rock likely ranging from 65 to 89

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.160
million years old; well past cloning age.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.500
So no dino-parks will result, but they do
have a lot to teach us!

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.630
Dinosaur egg fragments had been identified
in France as early as 1859, and the first

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.760
completely in-tact scientifically recognized
dinosaur egg was discovered in 1923 in Mongolia

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.920
-- the significance there is it still contained
an embryo!

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.140
Since then, eggs have been discovered in 200
sites on every continent eggcept Antarctica.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.310
They're often just shell fragments, mainly
because eggs are really tough to fossilize!

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.580
Taphonomy is the study of fossilization…
what happens to an organism from its burial

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.720
until discovery as a fossil.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.790
A fossil is sort of like the shadow, or model
of a living organism in a rock.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.870
The most common for dinosaurs and their eggs
is called permineralization, widely known

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.360
as petrification.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.770
As an organism is buried under ground, water
seeps into spaces in the remains -- pulling

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:30.850
minerals with it.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.240
As the minerals set, they form crystals, eventually
replacing and encasing the original hard tissues

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.610
-- bones or teeth.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.150
Even though there were millions of dinosaurs
on the planet, we only find a few fossils;

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.020
because conditions have to be JUUUUST right.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.240
The best conditions are when dinosaurs are
buried in sediment shortly after death, because

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.460
otherwise bacteria and other animals go to
work on the corpse!

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.180
Over time, the sediment -- sand or clay -- hardens
and becomes shale or sandstone -- allowing

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.409
us to get the fossils out!

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.380
Some dinosaurs did the hard work for us, because
sometimes, after a dinosaur lays eggs -- maybe

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.989
as many as 20 at a time -- they would bury
them for protection.

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.170
If they bury it too deep -- then the embryo
can't breathe or gets crushed, and millions

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.540
of years later, it becomes a fossil.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.459
Eggs are far rarer than dinosaur bones, simply
because they're so fragile!

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.500
If the egg is cracked, crushed or hatches,
the result is usually the same, shell fragments

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.080
-- but once in a long while, an egg fossilized
having never cracked, and we can explore the

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.440
embryo inside of it millions of years after
it was lain!!

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.240
In the end, though, dinosaur eggs are a fascinating
curio; but unless they're found near bones,

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.360
we don't know which dinosaurs laid which eggs.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.921
Scientists can use X-Rays to CAT scan them
and to see inside, or slowly scrape away the

00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:48.750
fossilized exterior to see the embryo.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.580
But even then, it can be impossible to guess
which dinosaur species laid the eggs.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.530
Instead, paleontologists use them to learn
about how baby dinosaurs developed both inside

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.980
the shell, and after.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.980
In Montana, paleontologists discovered nests,
nurseries, eggs, embryos, hatchlings, nestlings,

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.510
and juveniles -- giving us an understanding
into their young lives.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.750
For example: it would appear, some dinosaur
babies could walk right after hatching and

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.519
left the next -- their eggshells were left
in-tact, while other dinos needed parental

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.590
care, and lived in their nest for a bit -- their
eggshells were crushed from the pitter-patter

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:35.780
of little feet.
