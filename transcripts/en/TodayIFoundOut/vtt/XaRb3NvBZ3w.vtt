00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.619
Despite my sincerest efforts, I could find
no documented instance of a misspelled entry

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.050
name (the word being defined) ever found in
a widely circulated, non-user generated English

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.050
dictionary.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.070
(I’m still skeptical it’s never happened,
so please prove me wrong teeming masses.)

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.750
The lack of mistakes in widely circulated
dictionaries is presumably due to the extremely

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.430
rigorous process words go through before being
included, as well as the massive carry-over

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.110
from year to year in the word databases, making
it so only the first few editions of a given

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.049
dictionary might be prone to such typos.

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:57.839
For example, according to Merriam-Webster,
before a word is included in their dictionary,

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:03.629
it is first identified by an editor and entered
into a large database of citations that includes

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.850
the word with the common spelling along with
examples of its use and information on where

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.850
it was found.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.020
The database, called a corpus, today includes
an astounding 70 million potential words.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.869
Only those words that are sufficiently widely
used over a large enough period of time are

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.069
ripe for inclusion.

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:25.920
Even then, the word will not be listed in
the dictionary until its appropriate segment

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.420
is up for review by a team of editors and
definers (who also have a say in which citations

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.149
remain, as well as if anything further should
be added).

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.979
Thus, given all of the people who look at
and scrutinize every new entry, having a misspelling

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.389
in the entry name included in an established
dictionary would be remarkable.

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:47.820
dordHowever, to err is human, and even established
dictionaries have been shown to (exceptionally

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.520
rarely) make other kinds of mistakes.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.299
For example, in the 1934 version of Webster’s
New International Dictionary, a completely

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.929
contrived word, dord, was listed on page 771:

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:02.999
dord (dôrd), n.

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:04.179
Physics &amp; Chem.

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:05.179
Density.

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.740
Surprisingly, this entry remained unnoticed
until 1939 when one of the editors realized

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.740
that dord lacked an etymology (citations noting
the word’s origin, such as “N.L.” for

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.740
“New Latin.”)

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.430
Upon further investigation, the editor found
that dord came from a note sent by a chemistry

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.670
consultant that had apparently gotten mixed
up with the citations that were compiled for

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.090
completion of the dictionary.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.260
It should be noted that since the 1880s when
Webster’s began its citation system, each

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.240
citation was also placed on a 3×5 inch card,
which, coincidentally, was the note sent by

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.690
the chemist that read:

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.000
D or d, cont/ density

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.070
It was ultimately revealed that the note was
intended to augment the entry for D abbreviations

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.710
(which in chemistry includes “density”),
and that the “cont” was supposed to alert

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.640
the typist that there would be other such
entries for D abbreviations.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.450
Blame was laid at the feet of a couple of
editorial stylists, the first of whom should

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.480
have marked the “or” in the chemist’s
note to be italicized (and which, ideally,

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.600
would have identified that the D and d were
abbreviations); instead, she made the cardinal

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.600
sin of placing a wavy line underneath the
entire “D or d”; a wavy line under letters

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.970
or a word meant that everything above it was
to be included in boldface.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.250
Understandably then, the typist, whose job
it was to type as she was instructed, was

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.600
justified in typing dord.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.270
Remarkably, the word made it through a second
round of stylist/typist processing, at which

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.690
point the second stylist crossed out the “cont,”
and substituted in “n.” for noun.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.640
At some unknown point later, somebody else
gave it a pronunciation.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.800
Shortly after discovering the error five years
after it made it into the dictionary, dord

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.180
was removed and “density, Physics” was
added for D abbreviations.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.130
Webster wasn’t the only distinguished dictionary
to ever have egg on its face over an error,

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.130
however.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.960
In 2010, a professor from the University of
Technology in Brisbane, Australia, found that

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.490
the Oxford English Dictionary had an erroneous
definition of the word siphon.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.990
First inserted in the OED all the way back
in 1911, siphon was defined in 2010 as:

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.340
A pipe of tube or glass, metal or other material,
bent so that one leg is longer than the other,

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.540
and used for drawing off liquids by means
of atmospheric pressure, which forces the

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.970
liquid up the shorter leg and over the bend
in the pipe.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.380
The error, of course, is that pressure doesn’t
pull the liquid through, but rather, in the

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.680
words of Dr. Stephen Hughes who discovered
the error:

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.660
It is gravity that moves the fluid in a siphon,
with the water in the longer downward arm

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.470
pulling the water up the shorter arm.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.570
After being alerted to their mistake, OED
editors noted that the error had persisted

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.160
since 1911, but that in at least one version,
the 2005 edition, they had correctly identified

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.590
gravity’s role in the process.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:05:10.400
There was no reason given for why this was
changed in later versions.
