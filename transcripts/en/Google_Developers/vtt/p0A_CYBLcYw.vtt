[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.340
JOHN MAEDA: Hello, everybody.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.040
Wow, this is a nice stage.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.520
OK, well, I am
delighted to be here.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.750
I have a clock.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.020
We're going to get the see
Hannah a Beachler after me,

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.450
so that's going to
be super awesome.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.100
I am the warm-up act.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.090
I'm John Maeda.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.450
Good to see all of you.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.380
This is something I
made three years ago.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.310
Does anyone know this TV show?

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.000
No, we don't know this TV show.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.630
Well, I spoke at the 50th
anniversary of "Star Trek",

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.490
and it was a true honor.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.590
But I really didn't think
about "Star Trek" lot

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.970
until that moment.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.270
And I made this image
and I showed it.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.510
And people were asking
me why am I Scotty?

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.530
And I was like, well,
Scotty is an engineer,

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.810
and I wanted to be an engineer.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.160
And I was asked, well, why
not Sulu, because he's Asian?

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.660
And I said, I don't
want to be Sulu.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.640
I want to be Scotty.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.460
I want to be an engineer.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.190
But it was in that
moment I realized

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.740
the reason why I
didn't want to be Sulu

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.310
is because I thought he was
weird, in the sense that I

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.410
thought it was strange
how Sulu didn't

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.490
speak with some kind of
thick Asian accent on TV.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.660
And I thought that's weird.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.900
Something is wrong with him.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.680
And it always stuck
with me, why did

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.324
I think it was wrong that he
sounded like a Californian?

00:01:24.324 --> 00:01:25.990
I never thought of
it until that moment.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.470
And that's the general
topic of this presentation.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.800
Now, if you have a question
and you got introvert,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.390
just text me your question--

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.597
253-217-4017-- and we'll
be able to interact.

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:40.930
Because the problem with this
kind of conversation thing

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.054
is it isn't a conversation.

00:01:42.054 --> 00:01:43.160
It's like a one-way thing.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.180
So go ahead and text me a
question at 253-217-4017.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.670
And I'm watching the clock.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.885
OK, here we go.

00:01:50.885 --> 00:01:52.760
The Design in Tech Reports--

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.270
there's four of them
now and they're long,

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.020
so you can read them in
the micro-type, et cetera.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.720
The big conclusion
after four years of work

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.140
has been to ask questions
about how can design in tech

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.670
be more inclusive.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.630
If we can figure
this out, we can

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.990
unlock incredible possibility
and profitability.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.370
The problem with
the word design,

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.520
however, is that it
means too many things.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.450
So the report defines design
as three kinds of design.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.690
There's classical design,
like your glasses.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.380
There's design thinking-- this
idea of using Post-it notes

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.930
to create structure of ideas.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.970
And there's
computational design--

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.170
the kind of design that
is powered by Moore's law.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.890
It's a different kind of design.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.220
It uses a material that
didn't exist 100 years ago.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.770
What's a computational designer?

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.860
I've defined this as
roughly four type of things

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.440
you have to have as a
computational designer.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.390
You don't have to
know how to program,

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.790
but you have to be
technically literate.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.670
You also have to think
critically about technology.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.230
For you, technology
is a responsibility.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.860
So you wonder how
things are being used.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.930
You also use all
kinds of design.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.480
You aren't stuck in just
computational design.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.570
And lastly, you're very
curious about new things,

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.290
because designers loved
to learn new people,

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.340
new customs, new anything
because it's how they learn.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.210
So designers aren't
inherently diversity positive.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.410
It's a very important point.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.000
Now, if you think about
the value of design,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.785
it's been demonstrated
by all the M&amp;A activity--

00:03:29.785 --> 00:03:32.070
the Mergers and
Acquisition activity--

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.950
of agencies.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.960
So I reported on this
report, over 20 agencies

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.260
were acquired by
consulting companies,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.190
because consulting companies
are finding value in design

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.290
for their clients,
which is a big deal.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.960
It never happened before.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.680
Now, the problem, however,
is that classical designers

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.870
tend to dis design thinking.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.510
You know what I'm talking about?

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.310
Like oh, design thinkers,
they have the Post-it notes

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.100
and the Sharpie markers
with the white board.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.040
You know, classical
designers don't think of them

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.810
as real designers.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.060
But I always tell
classical designers, well,

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.280
they make more
money than you do.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.200
So important to note, design
thinking is not a bad thing.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.589
It's a different kind of design.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:20.920
Also, I found that, being in
the Silicon Valley for a while,

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.210
we tend to forget there's
the rest of the world.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.440
So I'm a big fan of China
and all of the design

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.060
work being done there--

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.110
design of cars, design of
experiences, especially mobile,

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.850
and, more recently, using AI
to design banners, designs.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.600
They're just so further
ahead that many people

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.810
seem to have the impression
in the United States.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.130
And that's kind of an
embarrassing problem.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.930
Also, the other problem
I've seen in tech

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.590
is that it indexes to
younger people, which

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.120
is a great opportunity.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.060
But there's also an incredible
opportunity in the older

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.730
generation because, I don't
know if you all know this,

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.528
but you all will get older.

00:05:04.528 --> 00:05:05.840
Yeah, it's not a problem.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.230
It's a real thing.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.030
And as you get
older, things change.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.190
The first thing that
changes is your eyesight.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.130
So for all designers
who love 6.5 point,

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.350
you better give it up.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.010
Looks awesome,
especially in light,

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.440
but you won't be able to see
it once you hit 40-something.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.720
And at Automattic we call
this the bolder generation.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.220
Get it?

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.347
Boulder?

00:05:28.347 --> 00:05:28.930
We liked that.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.360
Good news is that design
is being used sooner

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.490
in the process.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.450
It used to be in tech that
you'd make the technology,

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.780
and oh, my gosh,
it finally works.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.910
And you'd spray design
on called make it pretty.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.060
That was great 10 years ago,
but because the competition

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.480
is so fierce now, you have to
bake design into the product.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.880
And you can see globally-- we
did a survey of 2,000 people--

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.710
the trend is design
is being used

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.930
earlier in the process,
which is a big deal.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.940
Now, when we talk about
computational design,

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.370
however, it's important to note
that computational design uses

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.040
the computer.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.550
And if you were-- who
was there in the '80s?

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.040
'80s, '80s, come on.
'80s people, right?

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.980
People didn't like people who
used the computer for design,

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.090
right?

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.120
You were made fun of like
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.180
You were a bad designer because
you were using the computer.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.060
There was a time.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.000
But the computer kept on
getting more interesting.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.590
It came out of prints.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:35.970
It became interactive.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.830
Who remembers
Macromedia Director?

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:39.420
Macro mind.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.990
Come on.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.402
Yes, yes.

00:06:41.402 --> 00:06:43.860
This stuff has been happening
for a long time-- interaction

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.630
design.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.720
More recently have these
tools gotten more interesting,

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.910
specifically by
integrating things

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.560
like machine intelligence.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.210
We can all feel it
coming and that's

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.620
kind of exciting, but also
scary at the same time.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:59.490
Let's see here.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.950
OK, so when we think about
machine intelligence,

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.150
my favorite demo--

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.880
and this is all sourcing
real data off the internet--

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.420
this is Siri saying
something in iOS 9.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.946
SIRI: 1 liter is
33.81 fluid ounces.

00:07:12.946 --> 00:07:14.070
JOHN MAEDA: This is iOS 10.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.740
SIRI: 1 liter is
33.81 fluid ounces.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.080
JOHN MAEDA: This is iOS 11.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.990
SIRI: 1 liter is
33.81 fluid ounces.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.450
JOHN MAEDA: Got really
good fast, didn't it?

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:25.570
That's what's happened.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.720
These quantum leaps
are occurring.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.570
Linearity is being thrown out,
and that's really important.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.630
And so when people
ask in design,

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.370
should I learn all these things?

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.350
If you don't learn them,
you'll be left behind.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.400
And so it's so key to
stay at the forefront.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.220
Now, I also had this question--

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.850
when do you expect AI to
replace most visual designers?

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:49.950
And it's interesting
because the average

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:55.170
says at least five years till
visual designers get replaced--

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:58.210
not everyone, of course,
but some design jobs.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.210
I think it's going to
be much sooner, quite

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:04.140
frankly, because all the
information from companies

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.960
like Google, and companies
in China as well,

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.720
are that a lot of
rote things can be

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.260
done by machine intelligence.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.190
Here's some of my favorites.

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.560
I love that you can
remove the watermark.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.950
I wonder why you'd
want to do that.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.300
You can perfect contrast.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.610
This is MIT work.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.830
Making a dark image
an awesome image.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:30.230
It can also take two photos and
make a new photo out of them

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.730
too.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:33.330
This is work from Nvidia.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:37.100
You can also generate infinite
variations of ideas, just

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.961
with pattern libraries
in machine intelligence.

00:08:40.961 --> 00:08:43.360
You can also-- as you all
know in this audience,

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.020
at least-- you can
change people's faces.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.316
And you can fix drawings.

00:08:48.316 --> 00:08:49.690
What's important
to note, though,

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:52.110
is that we see these warnings.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:55.740
Consider the photos, that's
how you tell if it's fake.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.510
But it's so hard to tell if
things are a fake these days.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:02.040
And soon it's going to
get harder and harder.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.049
So we are human beings we
like to mess with the machine.

00:09:05.049 --> 00:09:06.590
So this is one of
my favorite things.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.620
If you click on
this button, this

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:13.110
will like randomly hit things,
so your browser gets confused.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.670
So we humans love to confuse
machine intelligence.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.150
You know, put a pixel there.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.610
I don't know what it is anymore,
says machine intelligence.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:21.710
So we'll keep looking
for this to try

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:25.100
to stop the inevitable,
which is that computers

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.670
are learning so quickly.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.320
And when they learn so
quickly, they learn bad things.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.140
I'm not sure if you remember
it, but in July 2015,

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:37.070
the Wall Street
Journal reported how

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.590
images mistakenly tagged
black people as gorillas

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.380
was happening in 2015.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.730
The algorithm was fixed.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:44.450
Why did it exist?

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:49.310
Because the database had more
light faces than darker faces,

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.920
so the database was dumb.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.390
And so these data dumbness is
occurring all over the place

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.180
as machine intelligence
ingests more data which

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.720
contains incredible
biases that we have,

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.320
unfortunately, let sit
out there for too long.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.060
So how do we change that?

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.310
I think we change that by
rethinking a few things.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:15.080
And that is where does
technology evolve the quickest?

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.870
And in the report, we pointed
out that there's two regions.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.150
Do you see the red
regions-- the hot regions?

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:22.460
That's where all this
stuff is happening--

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:23.930
this region of the country--

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:25.730
New York.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:29.210
But if you flip the map,
this is a map of inequality--

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:30.530
income inequality.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.760
If you flip it, you
see the exact opposite.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.090
That where tech is
not impacting is

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.850
where poverty is growing the
quickest, because the skills

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.970
gap is so large.

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.940
This audience here is
probably in the 0.01%

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.290
of the most advanced
people in the world.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.760
That said, the entire world
is behind in computation,

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.690
understanding the
impact of Moore's law.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:56.270
And this is a very subtle
intellectual privilege problem

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:57.870
today.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:01.040
So when we look at what
technology has done,

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.370
it's been able to be
extremely smart at optimizing

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.740
our experience, and
therefore making nothing

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.850
we understand real or not real.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:12.260
And that we all know it's
happening, and it's amazing,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.060
but it's also quite disturbing.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.150
My mother-- by the way--
her favorite newspaper

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:18.170
is the "National
Enquirer," so I'm always

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.570
checking out the headlines.

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:22.520
I just picked this up.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.510
Look out, Google.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.800
They know too.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.690
So is the digital
divide related somehow

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:29.130
to poverty and inequality?

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:32.790
I think it's hard to say
they're related or it's causal

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.280
or correlated, but there's
something connected that we

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.900
cannot miss.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.320
And that is that if you don't
have access to computation,

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.160
you are excluded.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.730
And if you don't understand
what it can do, you're excluded.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:50.540
And so technology keeps
shooting off without them, us.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.190
So what's a solution?

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:54.140
I'm passionate
about remote work.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.450
I'm at a company that is
all remote, Automattic.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:59.780
Who remotes-- who
works remotely?

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:00.710
That's quite a few.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:05.150
So remote work is neat
because it takes you out

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.880
of these bubbles of tech.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.760
I guess I'm hopeful
that's at Automattic

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.100
we're trying figure out
a world where WordPress

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.600
is good design for all.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.750
How do we do that?

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:18.140
We have to use the fact
that we can go anywhere

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.910
because we're remote.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:22.690
So for instance, let's see--

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.240
someone, I was
visiting Appalachia.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.170
And in Appalachia
I heard the story

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:31.520
about how it was a coal
miner who's teaching code

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.310
to ex-coal miners.

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:35.420
And he said, you
know, you people

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.600
are from the
three-dimensional world.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.510
You're 3D.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:41.570
You live in cities
with skyscrapers.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:44.600
And if you're from a smaller
city, you're in a town,

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.160
you live in 2D.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.670
In 2D, you have no
skyscrapers, just streets.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:52.980
And he said, here in
Appalachia, we live in 1D.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.090
There's one street, and
we all live off of it.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:58.520
That's when I realized the
neat thing about remote work

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.790
is you're zero-dimensional.

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:04.640
And by being zero-dimensional,
you can travel anywhere.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.550
And so we're trying
to use this advantage

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:10.760
to go into all kinds of
places, anywhere in the world,

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.260
and to connect with people.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.290
And I can tell you that this
experience of being remote

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:18.410
is a very powerful way
to reduce exclusion,

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:21.650
because you can be including
by just going anywhere

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:24.050
you think is necessary.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:27.490
Now, this is my favorite quote
by the lawyer Verna Myers.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.110
"Diversity is being
invited to the party.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:33.380
Inclusion is being
asked to dance."

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:34.680
Say this over to yourself.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.960
It's such a powerful idea,
because if you don't have both,

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.740
nothing occurs.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.040
And so when you ask how
to be more inclusive,

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.240
it's quite easy.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.590
Just ask where do
you spend your time?

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:48.050
Who do you hang out with?

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:50.090
Look at the people in
the room around you?

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:51.641
Are they diverse in some way?

00:13:51.641 --> 00:13:53.390
If they're not, you're
going to have to do

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.490
something terrible to yourself.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:58.840
You're going to have to
make yourself uncomfortable.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.000
And it's exciting
to be uncomfortable.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.330
Oh, my gosh, you say
the dumbest things.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.780
And you stumble, and
you become stupid,

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.360
and you become smarter and
a better person through it,

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.110
I believe.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:15.670
So all of you who are not found
yourself in this way, enjoy it.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.460
It's so exciting.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.920
I'm a big entertainment
fan, and I've

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.840
been tracking all
the movies that

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.990
have put diversity inclusion
at the center of them.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.210
And they're doing
very well financially.

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:31.150
Movies like "Wonder Woman,"
directed by Patty Jenkins,

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:34.870
"Star Wars" had a much more
diverse cast, "The Foreigner"

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.730
by Jackie Chan.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:39.640
Who's seen "The Foreigner,"
where the terrorists aren't

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.750
dark-skinned people?

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:42.410
That was brand new.

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:44.530
And "The Big Sick," of course.

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:46.900
And these are doing
really well financially.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:50.320
This is teaching machine
intelligence and the business

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.720
world that this is a
pattern to take note of.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.000
I like Kumail Nanjiani's
quote, "there's so

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.880
many movies from
different points of view

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.520
that are making a ton of money.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.410
Don't do it because it's better
for society and representation,

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:03.670
even though it is.

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:05.830
Do it because you'll get rich.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:08.110
You'll get that
promotion, right?"

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.540
This thinking
seems crass, yet it

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:14.840
sits at the center of how
change will start to occur.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:18.190
And I believe that as we see
more of these kinds of things,

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:19.630
wonderful things will happen.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:23.110
I want to close on my mother
went to see "Black Panther."

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:24.220
This was her review.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.750
It went kind of viral.

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:26.590
"Hi, John.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:28.540
Just came back from
seeing 'Black Panther.'

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.150
It was very good."

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.742
And we actually went to see
"Avengers" last, me and mom.

00:15:33.742 --> 00:15:34.450
I was in Seattle.

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:36.310
And my mom is like 83 years old.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:39.040
She's like a little
woman with her cane.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.550
We're walking out of "Avengers"
and I said, mom, how was it?

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:48.760
"Oh, it wasn't as good as
'Black Panther.'" So anyways,

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:49.630
thank you.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:53.355
And we'll have Hannah next,
so please stay seated.

00:15:53.355 --> 00:15:55.295
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.860
HANNAH BEACHLER: This is nuts.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:00.840
Look at all the faces.

00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:05.590
JOHN MAEDA: Wow, I'm so happy.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.120
I get to interview
Hannah Beachler.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:07.940
Yes.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.148
HANNAH BEACHLER: Yeah, right.

00:16:09.148 --> 00:16:11.200
Hey, y'all.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.816
Good to be here.

00:16:12.816 --> 00:16:14.190
And this thing is
a little weird,

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:17.800
so you might see me kind
of being a little weird.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.305
JOHN MAEDA: So how's it been
walking around this area?

00:16:23.305 --> 00:16:24.430
HANNAH BEACHLER: I'm sorry?

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:26.410
JOHN MAEDA: How's it been
walking around, wandering,

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:26.890
looking around?

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:27.220
HANNAH BEACHLER: Cool.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:29.400
We went and hung out
at the auditorium,

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.600
and walked around
some of the tents,

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.790
and ate, and sat on the
grass, and it was fabulous.

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:36.980
JOHN MAEDA: Anything
catch your attention?

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.396
HANNAH BEACHLER: I mean, I was
just looking at everything.

00:16:39.396 --> 00:16:41.680
The area is
beautiful, and I think

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.830
everything has been great.

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:47.830
I've been talking to some great
people, and it's been awesome.

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:51.250
JOHN MAEDA: So my mother
loved "Black Panther."

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:56.876
I'm sure you weren't
surprised, though.

00:16:56.876 --> 00:16:58.250
HANNAH BEACHLER:
What, I'm sorry?

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.070
JOHN MAEDA: I'm sure
you weren't surprised.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:01.861
HANNAH BEACHLER: That
your mother loved it?

00:17:01.861 --> 00:17:04.180
Not really.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.030
You know honestly, that was
part of what we tried to do,

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:11.349
was make it so
everybody could love it.

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:14.770
It wasn't really geared
towards one specific anything.

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:18.599
It was more about creating
a feeling and a moment.

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:19.990
And you know what I mean?

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:22.540
I am pretty into my emotions.

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:26.060
I would call myself an
emotionalist, if you will.

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.119
And that's really
what drives me,

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:33.610
is creating things from a place
that people can relate to,

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:36.390
and then that expands.

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:38.510
JOHN MAEDA: Had you
heard of "Black Panther"

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:40.150
when you got the job?

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:41.320
HANNAH BEACHLER: Yes, I did.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.807
I had heard of the
character and the comics,

00:17:43.807 --> 00:17:45.640
and I kind of knew it
because I knew Marvel.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:49.210
I've certainly asked
my son right away when

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:54.100
I knew I was going to
interview for the job, that oh,

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.410
tell me all about the
MCU and all of that.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.725
And he was like, here's
a Marvel dictionary.

00:17:59.725 --> 00:18:01.520
And I sort of
started from there.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:06.760
So I knew of him, but
over that 14 months,

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.420
I really got to know him.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.140
JOHN MAEDA: So a superhero.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.806
HANNAH BEACHLER: Superhero.

00:18:12.806 --> 00:18:14.430
JOHN MAEDA: Was your
reaction positive?

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:15.310
Yay, superhero!

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:16.230
Or superhero?

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:22.870
HANNAH BEACHLER: My reaction
to it being a superhero?

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:23.560
JOHN MAEDA: Yes.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.685
HANNAH BEACHLER: I mean,
I was really super excited

00:18:25.685 --> 00:18:27.160
because it was challenging.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.810
I've done so many
things that are

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:32.050
so different from each
other that anything that

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:34.900
is going to challenge me,
I instantly want in on.

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:38.110
And working with Ryan
Coogler, the amazing director,

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:42.280
again, for the third
time was without question

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.470
I was going to be
involved with that.

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:48.010
So I never thought I
would ever do something

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:49.090
like a superhero movie.

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:51.250
That's not where I
saw my career going.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:53.230
That's not what I
thought I wanted to do.

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:54.470
But then that's life.

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:57.250
It's not really what you
think in the beginning.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:01.622
But as I started to get into it,
I was like, you know, why not?

00:19:01.622 --> 00:19:03.330
I didn't think I would
do a boxing movie.

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.038
I didn't think I would
work with Beyoncé.

00:19:05.038 --> 00:19:07.790
I didn't think I would
work on a little $1 million

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:10.160
movie that would win an Oscar.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.740
So I don't generally
go into anything

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:15.690
thinking anything other than
how do I make this work?

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.990
How do I make this
the best it can be?

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:21.510
And for each film, it's
something different.

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:24.770
So for "Panther" there
was a reason behind it

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:28.940
for Ryan and I, and same
with all the other projects.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.890
JOHN MAEDA: So you had to look
1,000 years in the future,

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.850
and you didn't come to Silicon
Valley to look at that future.

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:36.760
HANNAH BEACHLER: No.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:37.780
JOHN MAEDA: Talk about that.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.196
HANNAH BEACHLER:
Well, first I had

00:19:39.196 --> 00:19:41.720
to look 1,000 years in the past.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.330
That was a big
part of Wakanda was

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:46.970
the honoring of the
culture, and the tradition,

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:49.010
and the diaspora--

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:51.800
the African
diaspora-- that really

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:55.640
is what Wakanda is
representational of.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.310
So I had to look
backwards because I

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:00.920
think the past is a
very important bridge

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:04.190
to what the future is.

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:08.420
And that needs
inclusion in design

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:14.120
in this world of what I was
doing for "Black Panther."

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.720
Looking into the
future, I didn't know--

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:18.470
and you know what?

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:20.570
Honestly, I didn't know
that Silicon Valley could

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.700
have helped me for my needs.

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.970
I didn't think that I was
going to find in there.

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.510
And honestly, I didn't
really know much about it.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:30.860
I live in New Orleans.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:32.930
It's a very small town.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:34.320
I don't live in Los Angeles.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.872
I don't live in New York.

00:20:35.872 --> 00:20:37.580
I live in a place
where the population is

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:42.300
like 250,000 to 300,000 people.

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.170
I didn't know much
about Silicon Valley.

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:46.880
I kind knew what I saw on TV--

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.400
sounds familiar.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.310
But I didn't really
know how that

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:56.480
could help me create
this technology which you

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.540
would think was kind of crazy.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.670
Because what I
knew I needed to do

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:07.400
was evolve something that
Silicon Valley, to me, I felt

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:11.510
had no interest in,
which is this culture.

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:13.550
So there was-- you
know what I mean?

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:21.140
I felt like I kind of
had to give an autonomy

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:27.440
to this story and a narrative
that, at times, is restricted,

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.180
just in general, by society--

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:32.120
like the ability to tell--

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.660
a community's ability to
tell their own story, how

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:40.220
they want it told, and based
on what they want it based on.

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:46.310
So that was sort of me being
the person who made sure

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:49.040
that the representation of the
culture that we were digging

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.290
into, and creating a
fictional one on top of it,

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:54.200
stayed to what I
needed it to be.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.200
And I didn't know that
Silicon Valley could help me.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.230
Now, I did reach out
to a lot of experts

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:03.200
about all kinds of stuff--

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:07.010
geology, geography, archeology.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:09.590
We talked to experts
in architecture

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:11.930
who were doing
future cities, people

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:16.130
who were sort of
architectural archaeologists

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:20.450
that could talk to us about
some of the architecture

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:24.500
of Pre-colonial
Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.350
And then of course,
going to South Africa,

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:29.990
traveling all over South
Africa for three weeks,

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:31.520
and sort of understanding that.

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.440
Because at the heart
of "Black Panther"

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.380
was the question of what
is it to be African?

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:40.160
And so that's sort
of why I felt like I

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:44.650
didn't want to go or need
to go to Silicon Valley.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.590
I don't know-- that
is what it was like.

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:50.990
And I mean, that's honest.

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:52.490
That's the honest truth.

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:56.409
And because I was so
busy, I was like I'm just

00:22:56.409 --> 00:22:57.450
going to have to do this.

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:00.360
I'm just going to have
to figure this one out.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.270
And I didn't really know
1,000 years into the future.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:06.020
Here's the thing--
it's hard enough

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:09.860
to go any amount into
the future and understand

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:14.240
what you'd think might happen
or how people would respond.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.940
So I found myself getting
to this place where

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.850
I started thinking about
technology in the future, how

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:21.950
Wakanda would use technology.

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:26.030
Technically, "Black
Panther" is placed in 2018.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:27.350
It's not sci-fi.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:30.135
It felt sci-fi because Wakanda--

00:23:30.135 --> 00:23:31.010
you know what I mean?

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:32.940
We have to remember,
it's not science fiction.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:36.170
It's supposed to live in
this universe, which is 2018.

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:38.840
So I had to make sure it felt
grounded enough that people

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.490
weren't like, it's space.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:43.820
But it also had to be advanced
enough where people thought,

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.320
maybe this is
something that's going

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:49.610
to come around in 50 years,
60 years, or something.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:51.590
It's not impossible.

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:54.170
And then you had to add
sort of with the vibranium,

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:56.540
the fantasy of it all.

00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:01.107
So you know, and I'm
rambling, so I don't even

00:24:01.107 --> 00:24:02.440
know if I answered the question.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:06.450
But that's sort of--

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:07.644
I might have lost myself.

00:24:07.644 --> 00:24:09.810
JOHN MAEDA: Actually, when
you were describing that,

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:11.686
I remember walking my
mom out of the theater,

00:24:11.686 --> 00:24:14.060
because she can't walk very
well because she has diabetes

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:15.910
and her feet are really--
it makes it hard.

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:18.816
So she's walking really slowly
and talking really slowly.

00:24:18.816 --> 00:24:21.190
And I remember when we'd just
left the theater, she said,

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:25.460
you know, "Black Panther"
was so beautiful.

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:29.240
All the scenery, everything
was so beautiful.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.520
And it's the thing
that stuck with her--

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.800
how beautiful the movie is.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.960
And it's optimistic.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.110
And so where did that
come from, and how were

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:40.569
you able to translate that?

00:24:40.569 --> 00:24:42.110
HANNAH BEACHLER: I
mean, I like to do

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:44.270
things that are beautiful.

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:46.880
And I think that's another
part of "Black Panther,"

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.590
is changing this
idea of narrative,

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:50.700
of how we see things.

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:53.570
It was a challenge to
me of how I saw Africa,

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:54.770
what I thought about Africa.

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.270
Just because I'm
black, doesn't mean

00:24:56.270 --> 00:25:00.530
I'm an expert on
African culture, right?

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:02.977
So I really had to dig in
and challenge myself about

00:25:02.977 --> 00:25:04.310
like, OK, well, what do I think?

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:05.690
What are my biases?

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:07.400
What was I raised with?

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.220
From my American
experience, this

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.110
is a land that's
1,000 miles away.

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:15.020
And as far as I
know, my ancestry

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:17.630
begins and ends at slavery.

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:19.400
And then the culture
that came afterwards

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.550
was this bastardized
idea-- or we were told

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:25.460
it was a bastardized culture.

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.830
We're not African,
we're not American,

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:31.790
so it became this bastardized
culture in a sense.

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:35.390
And you go through all of
these different points in time

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:37.040
throughout American history.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:42.620
So I needed to rediscover what
that was thousands of miles

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:46.460
away from where I live, and
how I'm connected to that.

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:49.160
Because, oftentimes, you
feel like the hyphenate

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.350
between the African
and American.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:54.320
You're really not either one.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.110
So it was what is
it to be African,

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:58.530
because this is a movie--

00:25:58.530 --> 00:25:59.450
Wakanda is African.

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:00.830
It's not African-American.

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:03.560
And one of the little
things that Ryan

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:07.040
was so brilliant at doing in
the film with Killmonger's

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.980
character-- who's the villain,
if you haven't seen it.

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:11.620
Has everybody seen
"Black Panther?"

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:12.930
Is that a thing?

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:13.770
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:15.290
Awesome.

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:18.990
So Killmonger-- played by the
fabulous Michael B Jordan--

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:22.130
if you notice something
about him, it's his names.

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:24.620
And part of the reason behind
him having so many names

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:28.670
is because our American
ancestry is that we

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:30.440
have been given so many names.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.580
We were Negroes.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:33.050
We were black folk.

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:34.340
We were colored.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.070
We were Afro-American.

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:40.040
We were African-American.

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.650
And that's sort of how
this has gone over time.

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:46.250
So what Ryan did was
he gave Michael Jordan

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:48.740
the N'Jadaka name.

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.090
But they also called him Erik.

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:51.650
They also called him Killmonger.

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:53.940
They also called
him Erik Stevens.

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:57.830
So he's that representation
of African-American never

00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:00.650
having a true identity,
from different places

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:02.870
and different people call
him different things.

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:03.950
And that's the tie back.

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:05.060
And those are the
types of things

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:06.290
that we were trying to do.

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:09.352
That is a piece of
representation, in a sense.

00:27:09.352 --> 00:27:11.060
And we'll get to
representation because I

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:13.310
think that's mostly what
we want to be talking about

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:18.710
is how that is so important
in "Black Panther"--

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:22.640
technologically, scientifically,
through your STEM, and then

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.290
also socially, and economically.

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:28.610
And so there are so many little
things that we did in there.

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:32.610
I mean, it goes so
deep into how we

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:33.860
brought in the representation.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:34.901
And that was one of them.

00:27:34.901 --> 00:27:37.400
And it was in such
a small story way

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.131
that you don't
even really realize

00:27:39.131 --> 00:27:40.130
that's what's happening.

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:43.180
Because Shuri calls
him Erik Stevens.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.410
T'Challa calls him N'Jadaka.

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:48.140
His father calls him--

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.800
Ross calls him Killmonger.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.040
His father calls him Erik.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.720
So it's everybody-- he
doesn't have an identity.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.640
And he's going to Wakanda
to try to figure that out.

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.220
And that's sort of
the representation

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:05.120
of where we are as sort of the
"lost tribe" as we called it.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.470
JOHN MAEDA: I'm such
a Ryan Coogler fan.

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:11.151
So I can see that detail.

00:28:11.151 --> 00:28:12.775
I didn't see it until
you described it.

00:28:12.775 --> 00:28:14.710
HANNAH BEACHLER:
The small detail.

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:16.460
JOHN MAEDA: When we
were talking last week

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:17.700
about representation--

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:18.050
HANNAH BEACHLER: Yes?

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:20.240
JOHN MAEDA: --you mentioned
the production designer,

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:20.974
Wynn Thomas.

00:28:20.974 --> 00:28:22.140
And I looked up Wynn Thomas.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.102
I hadn't heard of
his name before.

00:28:25.102 --> 00:28:28.615
And he has credits for "Hidden
Figures," "A Beautiful Mind,"

00:28:28.615 --> 00:28:31.610
"Analyze This," all
of Spike Lee's movies.

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:34.670
So you mentioned seeing him
on television or something?

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:37.820
HANNAH BEACHLER: I saw he was
nominated for an Academy Award

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.030
for "Mars Attack,"
the Tim Burton film.

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:43.850
And I happened to be watching
the Academy Awards that year,

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:46.610
and I was like, oh, who's
this black man doing

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:48.290
this thing that I want to do?

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:51.534
And that was really the first
time that I really saw that.

00:28:51.534 --> 00:28:52.700
I was like, oh, my goodness.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.050
What is this?

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:56.900
Because I had always been a big
fan of Bernardo Bertolucci--

00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:02.480
who is an Italian director back
in the '50s, '60s, '70s, and

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.410
'80s--

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:07.460
and his designer,
Ferdinando Scarfiotti,

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.780
was someone who was really
a big influence to me,

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.060
was this Italian
man way back when.

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:16.520
But my design aesthetic is
highly influenced by his.

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.730
But seeing him never made me
feel like, eh, I can do that,

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:22.440
because he's this Italian guy.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.235
Of course he can.

00:29:23.235 --> 00:29:24.180
He's an Italian guy.

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:28.170
Like I'm this farm
girl from Ohio

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:30.510
who literally runs
around with bare feet

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:33.330
and riding my horse to the
store to get Jolly Ranchers when

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:35.160
I was like six.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.830
How do I get to that?

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:41.610
How do I get to-- there
was no path for me there.

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:43.610
So I kind of started
thinking like what are some

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:45.943
of the other things that I
could do where there might be

00:29:45.943 --> 00:29:47.410
a path that's still creative?

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:49.890
And that's how I had to think,
knowing that that wasn't

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:51.750
something that was for me.

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:57.279
But then when I saw Wynn, which
was much later in my life,

00:29:57.279 --> 00:29:59.070
that's when I realized
like, you know what?

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:00.725
I can actually go for this.

00:30:00.725 --> 00:30:03.100
I mean, that didn't actually
mean that I could go for it,

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:06.420
but seeing it certainly
made me feel that way.

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:07.590
And I took that chance.

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:10.980
And that gave me an opportunity
to get into this industry

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:12.750
and really go far.

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:14.500
I mean, as I got into
it, I realized like,

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.440
oh, this is really hard.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.120
I'm the only one.

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.770
And I am the only one.

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:23.670
And that's a really
strange thing

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:29.340
to think that you are
the only black female who

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:35.076
does this, who does what
I do and at this level.

00:30:35.076 --> 00:30:36.450
You know, there's
one other one--

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:37.470
Toni Barton.

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:39.210
And she's an art
director working

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:41.130
on television for Marvel.

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:43.050
And I kind of saw
her on Twitter,

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:46.560
and I was like, uh, I want
to be-- let's be friends.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:49.140
And she's like, I
don't even know you.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.790
And I'm like stalking
her on Twitter,

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:53.130
like, I want to be girlfriends.

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:54.900
And she's like, OK.

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:59.100
Maybe don't-- maybe
call my agent.

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:01.740
But we finally kind of--
like I broke her down.

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:04.350
And she finally decided
to be my friend.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:07.350
And we're kind of besties.

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:08.640
Don't quote me.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.400
And don't go up to
her and be like,

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.608
Hannah said you were besties,
because she'll be like,

00:31:12.608 --> 00:31:15.480
I don't know who she is.

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:19.140
But that's-- you want
to find likeness.

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:21.330
You want to find relatability.

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:23.880
And when you look
at communities--

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.520
I think one of the
other things too

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:30.960
is when you look at communities
who are associated with not

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:36.160
having a lot of tech, and not
having access to a lot of tech,

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.200
and you start relating
your economic status

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:44.850
to your racial profile,
that all of a sudden--

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:47.220
especially in poverty--
the black community

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.200
becomes associated
with this idea

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:53.370
of not being tech
savvy or wanting tech

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:56.500
or having that type of thing
within their community.

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:59.340
And it's basically all
based on accessibility.

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:01.950
It's not there
because how many--

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:03.810
representation is
not just in front

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:07.710
of whatever it is or throwing
the pretty on it that

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:11.010
seems to be representing
a group or a culture,

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:15.520
but actually having
the voices creating it.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:19.350
Is it-- you look at it like,
was it important for me

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:22.980
to be the production designer on
something like "Black Panther?"

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.620
Or the "Infinity War's"
designer, Charles Woods, would

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:28.210
he be able to have
then done that?

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:33.690
And so I do believe
that the representation

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:34.740
behind the camera--

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.340
I'll say, because
that's what I do--

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:37.660
I mean, behind the desk?

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:40.110
I don't-- do you guys stand?

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:41.240
I don't know.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.082
JOHN MAEDA: Walk.

00:32:42.082 --> 00:32:43.832
HANNAH BEACHLER: You
know what I'm saying?

00:32:43.832 --> 00:32:51.000
Or however it goes, is as
important as creating an app

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.820
or creating something--

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.330
is specifically
having the voices

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:57.690
there that then
has the experience

00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:58.817
in those communities.

00:32:58.817 --> 00:33:00.900
Because you really don't
know what you don't know,

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:02.420
and that's what I learned
by going to Africa.

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:04.130
Like I don't know
what I don't know,

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:07.800
but I knew that I was going
to look at it with beauty.

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:11.250
I knew I was going to
look at it with the lens

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:17.370
of absolute modernism, and
beauty, and capability--

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:19.530
all the things that I wanted
to put into "Panther."

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:21.420
I wasn't looking
for the commercial

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:24.030
with the poverty-stricken
children.

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:26.190
I wasn't looking for
the things that we're

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:29.310
told the continent is.

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:31.290
I was looking for the
joy, and the pride,

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:35.340
and the dignity of the
people that lived there.

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:39.190
And that's the choice we
make for wherever we are.

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:43.140
Because I met people who lived
in the rural parts of Africa

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:46.140
just as much as people who
lived in the modern cities,

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:50.700
like Johannesburg,
and we were in Durban,

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:52.350
we were in Cape Town.

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:55.830
So it's-- you can see someone
dressed in their traditional

00:33:55.830 --> 00:34:02.400
Zulu or traditional
Xhosa in the city,

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.260
just as much as you might
see that in the rural areas.

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:09.719
So I decided not only to
find myself and realize

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:14.250
that I think I've been
African this entire time,

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:20.340
but that I was determined to
find all the beautiful things

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:24.639
that I was told weren't there.

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:30.480
Because that then really came
back to who I am as a person.

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.500
It really related
back to who I am

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:35.380
and how I felt about myself,
and the confidence that I had.

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:37.810
So it all kind of-- like,
our fictional world building

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:40.929
bleeds back into our realities.

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:43.179
JOHN MAEDA: Could you just--
we have two minutes left.

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:44.650
Could you share a
non-fiction story

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:46.441
you shared with me that
moved me very much,

00:34:46.441 --> 00:34:48.429
which was about the
director Ryan Coogler, who

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:50.024
I'm a huge fan of.

00:34:50.024 --> 00:34:51.940
And I've always wanted
to-- in Silicon Valley,

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:53.860
we talk about leadership--

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.770
CEO, or the product
manager is the CEO

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:58.900
of the product, and
these CEOish things.

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:01.000
I think of Ryan Coogler
as one of the great CEOs

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.020
of our time in creatives.

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.490
You shared a story about him.

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:04.810
Could you talk about that?

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:06.130
HANNAH BEACHLER: When I
was talking to myself?

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:06.610
JOHN MAEDA: Yes.

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:07.530
HANNAH BEACHLER: So
you obviously know

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:08.390
I'm kind of weird.

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:10.420
So I'm going to tell this story.

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.010
Don't hold it against me.

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:14.640
But so we're working
on "Creed," and we're

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.375
tech scouting, which
is coming and going

00:35:16.375 --> 00:35:19.090
to look at all these locations,
and you can spend all day.

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:21.520
And we had stopped
at this coffee shop.

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.540
And I got my coffee.

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:23.620
And everybody was
getting their coffee.

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.286
But I was kind of
working out a problem.

00:35:25.286 --> 00:35:29.050
And when I'm trying to work out
a problem or solve a problem,

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:32.110
I talk out loud to myself,
because that's the best way

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:35.050
to do it for me, apparently.

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:38.950
And my friends and stuff
will like poke fun at me

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:40.030
like, oh, you're crazy.

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:41.510
You're talking to yourself.

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:44.680
And so sometimes I do it and I
don't even know I'm doing it.

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.450
So Ryan comes walking over
to me, and he was like,

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:49.090
are you talking to yourself?

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:51.226
And I was like a
little like, uh.

00:35:51.226 --> 00:35:52.100
You know what I mean?

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:54.580
I know you and
love you, but yeah.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:57.370
And the first thing he said--
he looked at me and he said,

00:35:57.370 --> 00:36:01.060
that's the sign of a really
healthy mind and a really

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:02.876
intelligent person.

00:36:02.876 --> 00:36:04.750
And he kind of turned
around and walked away.

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:07.490
And I was kind of like ready
to get the hit of like,

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:08.440
oh, you're crazy--

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:12.610
kind of funny joke, joke, but
a little bit like of a slight.

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:14.750
And that's not at all
where his mind came from.

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:18.760
It looked for the immediate
positive thing about the thing

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.730
that I was doing,
that sometimes people

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:25.210
think is weird or
could make you feel

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:29.440
a certain way about yourself
that eventually starts

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:32.680
beating you down and making--

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.930
defining who you are
because you're hearing

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:36.390
negative things about it.

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:38.120
That is who Ryan is.

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:42.300
He's the person that will
constantly lift people up,

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.615
will constantly-- and he
is not perfect, I promise.

00:36:45.615 --> 00:36:47.740
There's days when I'm like,
please make a decision.

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:48.955
You have like two hours.

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:54.070
And he does all the
things that directors

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:56.470
do that can
completely bother you,

00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:58.390
or things that are like amazing.

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:01.000
But he's the type of person--
like we would be on set

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.340
for Warrior Falls, which
was the big waterfall where

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:04.840
they had the big fight.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:09.400
And he gathered us all
around in a big circle.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.260
Some people were in the water.

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:13.480
And he really told us why
that scene was important.

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.220
This is before we
even started shooting.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:18.580
He really started to
say why that scene was

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:20.800
important to him,
and really talked

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.280
about having all the fictional
tribes of Wakanda in one place

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.020
and represented by
all the references

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:27.580
that we used of the tribes--

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:30.130
the different tribes
in Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:35.590
And how that was a big part of
him, really feeling complete.

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:39.364
And you're holding hands and
he's telling us all of this,

00:37:39.364 --> 00:37:40.780
and we're standing
in this circle,

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:44.620
and you just feel like you
can take on the entire world

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:45.350
at that point.

00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:48.350
So that's who he is as a
director and my friend.

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:50.320
And he is a really
important voice

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:54.610
because his perspective
on anything and everything

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:57.130
is the most unique
perspective you will--

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:59.350
I promise you-- ever
hear from anybody.

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:01.690
If you ever get a
chance to talk to him,

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:06.310
talk to him because he
will turn a situation

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:10.660
and make you see it from a side
you were never maybe even meant

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:11.470
to see it from.

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:13.830
And all of a sudden,
your world opens up.

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:14.924
And so I can always--

00:38:14.924 --> 00:38:17.340
and he would be standing here
going like, oh, please stop.

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.372
But he is really that great.

00:38:19.372 --> 00:38:21.330
JOHN MAEDA: Wow, thanks
for sharing that story.

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:22.750
What a leader and
what a designer.

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:24.050
Thank you, everyone.

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:25.110
Thank you.

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:28.715
