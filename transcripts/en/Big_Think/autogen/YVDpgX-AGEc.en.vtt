00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.200
okay let's try and pull together all of

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210
okay let's try and pull together all of
 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.910
okay let's try and pull together all of
this research I've been doing both on

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920
this research I've been doing both on
 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.609
this research I've been doing both on
physical places in which people live and

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619
physical places in which people live and
 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.370
physical places in which people live and
work but their oral places ie the music

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380
work but their oral places ie the music
 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.020
work but their oral places ie the music
they listen to and the virtual spaces

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030
they listen to and the virtual spaces
 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.150
they listen to and the virtual spaces
such as their Facebook profiles and it

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160
such as their Facebook profiles and it
 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.200
such as their Facebook profiles and it
seemed like this would be a good

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210
seemed like this would be a good
 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.360
seemed like this would be a good
opportunity to pull it together

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370
opportunity to pull it together
 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.930
opportunity to pull it together
the idea behind snoop is that is that

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940
the idea behind snoop is that is that
 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.779
the idea behind snoop is that is that
the places which we select and craft are

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789
the places which we select and craft are
 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.500
the places which we select and craft are
rich with clues about what we're like

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510
rich with clues about what we're like
 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.500
rich with clues about what we're like
and so the question is what can you

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510
and so the question is what can you
 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.040
and so the question is what can you
learn about someone by going into their

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050
learn about someone by going into their
 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.850
learn about someone by going into their
environment what can you learn about

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860
environment what can you learn about
 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.319
environment what can you learn about
them and we certainly form lots of

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329
them and we certainly form lots of
 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.420
them and we certainly form lots of
impressions which one's the which of

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430
impressions which one's the which of
 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.819
impressions which one's the which of
those impressions are accurate which

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829
those impressions are accurate which
 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.770
those impressions are accurate which
ones are inaccurate what are people

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780
ones are inaccurate what are people
 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.780
ones are inaccurate what are people
learning about us and even more broadly

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790
learning about us and even more broadly
 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.480
learning about us and even more broadly
and this is I think sort of the the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490
and this is I think sort of the the
 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.990
and this is I think sort of the the
intellectual kernel really interests me

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
intellectual kernel really interests me
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.870
intellectual kernel really interests me
is how are we connected to our spaces

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880
is how are we connected to our spaces
 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.070
is how are we connected to our spaces
and I think we often don't realize it

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080
and I think we often don't realize it
 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.660
and I think we often don't realize it
cuz so automatic we just say oh I like

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670
cuz so automatic we just say oh I like
 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.749
cuz so automatic we just say oh I like
that photo and put the photo up but but

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759
that photo and put the photo up but but
 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.090
that photo and put the photo up but but
we didn't just put that photo up it will

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100
we didn't just put that photo up it will
 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.679
we didn't just put that photo up it will
we there were 10,000 photos we could

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689
we there were 10,000 photos we could
 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.359
we there were 10,000 photos we could
have put up we put that one up why do we

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369
have put up we put that one up why do we
 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.670
have put up we put that one up why do we
put it up and and what can that teachers

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680
put it up and and what can that teachers
 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:41.570
put it up and and what can that teachers
about how we are connected to the spaces

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580
 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.950
basically having to be you know and I

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960
basically having to be you know and I
 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.480
basically having to be you know and I
think that's to be one of the palings I

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490
think that's to be one of the palings I
 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.330
think that's to be one of the palings I
think that they you know architects see

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340
think that they you know architects see
 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.060
think that they you know architects see
themselves generally as artists and they

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070
themselves generally as artists and they
 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.500
themselves generally as artists and they
are doing their project and you may be

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510
are doing their project and you may be
 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.730
are doing their project and you may be
lucky enough to live in one of their

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740
lucky enough to live in one of their
 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.510
lucky enough to live in one of their
magnificent creations but and and those

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520
magnificent creations but and and those
 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.200
magnificent creations but and and those
those people in the building trade who

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210
those people in the building trade who
 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.760
those people in the building trade who
have really gone and asked people what

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770
have really gone and asked people what
 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.710
have really gone and asked people what
they want and looked at what people want

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720
they want and looked at what people want
 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.730
they want and looked at what people want
they are with with division referred to

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740
they are with with division referred to
 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.950
they are with with division referred to
as builders by architects their builders

that's not the proper thing but but

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570
that's not the proper thing but but
 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.120
that's not the proper thing but but
there are some people who are doing it

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130
there are some people who are doing it
 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.390
there are some people who are doing it
and one of these people is is Chris

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400
and one of these people is is Chris
 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.260
and one of these people is is Chris
Travis who who really goes very deeply

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270
Travis who who really goes very deeply
 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.790
Travis who who really goes very deeply
into people's psychology and where their

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800
into people's psychology and where their
 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.430
into people's psychology and where their
their associations with buildings and

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440
their associations with buildings and
 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.140
their associations with buildings and
environments come from so right at the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150
environments come from so right at the
 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.810
environments come from so right at the
very beginning before he's even started

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820
very beginning before he's even started
 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.990
very beginning before he's even started
work he does that and it turns out that

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000
work he does that and it turns out that
 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.820
work he does that and it turns out that
that's a tremendously effective both

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830
that's a tremendously effective both
 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.600
that's a tremendously effective both
from his perspective and also the the

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610
from his perspective and also the the
 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.699
from his perspective and also the the
clients is it's effective from his

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709
clients is it's effective from his
 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.710
clients is it's effective from his
perspective because because he gets the

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720
perspective because because he gets the
 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.680
perspective because because he gets the
design right so in in nearly in 90% of

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690
design right so in in nearly in 90% of
 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.600
design right so in in nearly in 90% of
the cases after he's gone through this

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610
the cases after he's gone through this
 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.009
the cases after he's gone through this
interview which takes a long long time

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019
interview which takes a long long time
 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.020
interview which takes a long long time
and all these psychological exercises he

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030
and all these psychological exercises he
 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.150
and all these psychological exercises he
comes up with the design and he nails it

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160
comes up with the design and he nails it
 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.640
comes up with the design and he nails it
the first time and so much of

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650
the first time and so much of
 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.970
the first time and so much of
architectural work comes about from from

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980
architectural work comes about from from
 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.860
architectural work comes about from from
doing redesigns okay here's one design

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870
doing redesigns okay here's one design
 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.750
doing redesigns okay here's one design
okay we have to redo it and redo it and

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760
okay we have to redo it and redo it and
 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.780
okay we have to redo it and redo it and
he finds in now he won't even take on

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790
he finds in now he won't even take on
 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:16.920
he finds in now he won't even take on
clients who won't go through this

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930
clients who won't go through this
 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.060
clients who won't go through this
process because he said it's too

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070
process because he said it's too
 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.130
process because he said it's too
expensive for him not to he can't afford

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140
expensive for him not to he can't afford
 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.680
expensive for him not to he can't afford
to go through all that redesign so so

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690
to go through all that redesign so so
 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.420
to go through all that redesign so so
that he seems to nail the design every

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430
that he seems to nail the design every
 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.040
that he seems to nail the design every
time and I've went to a few of his

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050
time and I've went to a few of his
 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.210
time and I've went to a few of his
houses and they're really quite

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220
houses and they're really quite
 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.740
houses and they're really quite
different there's not like he just has

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750
different there's not like he just has
 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.080
different there's not like he just has
hit the key they and they're really

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090
hit the key they and they're really
 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.900
hit the key they and they're really
molded to people and and I spoke to a

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910
molded to people and and I spoke to a
 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.270
molded to people and and I spoke to a
lot of his clients and it is really

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280
lot of his clients and it is really
 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.430
lot of his clients and it is really
interesting they they talk about the

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440
interesting they they talk about the
 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.960
interesting they they talk about the
place and they say it just fits us we

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970
place and they say it just fits us we
 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.910
place and they say it just fits us we
love it but at the same time was

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920
love it but at the same time was
 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.130
love it but at the same time was
interesting if they seem to be largely

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140
interesting if they seem to be largely
 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.990
interesting if they seem to be largely
unaware that the psychological interview

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000
unaware that the psychological interview
 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.430
unaware that the psychological interview
had any role in it I mean they went

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440
had any role in it I mean they went
 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.319
had any role in it I mean they went

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349
Chris Travers told me but he said look
 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.440
Chris Travers told me but he said look
people are very resistant to believing

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450
people are very resistant to believing
 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.830
people are very resistant to believing
that they're under underlying sort of

couldn't believe it until I saw them and

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920
couldn't believe it until I saw them and
 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.470
couldn't believe it until I saw them and
spoke with them and they and they were

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480
spoke with them and they and they were
