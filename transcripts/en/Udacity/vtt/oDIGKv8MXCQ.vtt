00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.120
So we can get to the workflow in the setup. So if we

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.820
go into the setup and then type in workflow into the quick find,

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.140
we should be able to create a new

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.600
workflow right here. Just click on Workflow Rules.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.720
&gt;&gt; What is workflow?

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.379
&gt;&gt; And so, yeah. Here breaks down the different actions

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.990
that we can do, and like certain tasks that you

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.250
might be able to automate. But, we don't, we don't

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.770
need to go through this. We can just do it ourselves.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.538
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what you're here for. To explain

00:00:25.538 --> 00:00:28.410
these things. don't show me this page again. Actually.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.275
&gt;&gt; Maybe.

00:00:29.275 --> 00:00:31.270
[LAUGH]

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:31.810
When I'm not here.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.250
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.530
&gt;&gt; Great. So, the first thing we want to do is create a new rule.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.050
But, before we create that rule, let's

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.350
think about what we're trying to automate.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.570
&gt;&gt; So, I want to automate the whole repair process.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.733
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.060
&gt;&gt; You know, you file a maintenance ticket.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.516
And then I want to automatically alert a technician.

00:00:45.516 --> 00:00:47.950
&gt;&gt; Right. And so, a technician is just a user in our

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.730
organization. So we have two options. We can assign them a task.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:52.893
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:52.893 --> 00:00:54.090
&gt;&gt; And so when they first log in to

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.280
Salesforce, on their home tab they'll see all the open

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.550
tasks that they need to complete.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:57.970
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.770
&gt;&gt; And then we can also send them an email.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.710
So automatically generate an email

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.380
with information about that maintenance ticket.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.450
&gt;&gt; Nice, let's do it.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.019
&gt;&gt; So, great.
