00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.779
 Some of us like to spend the weekend with a book in his hands 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.800
 While some prefer to go out and be the center of attention 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:13.220
 But from a scientific point of view, is there any advantage of being an introvert or an abstract? Which is better? 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.440
 The first to describe the idea of ​​the two main trends of personality was the Swiss psychologist Carl Jung 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.580
 Who invented the terms both introverted and diagonal. 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.920
 The theory was separated by German psychiatrist Hans Eisenk 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.520
 Who defined the Antoine and the Apostles with their fundamental excitement. 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:38.400
 Diabetics need a low rate of stimulation to do exciting things that physically and mentally weary the introverses to satisfy their desires. 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.080
 So while the introvert may just ride the bike in a tranquil park 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.660
 Diastolic may need to go through the sand roads to feel mental satisfaction. 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.460
 Brain radiation shows that the frontal cortex is denser at the introversion than the extrasensory 

00:00:52.631 --> 00:00:55.171
 Which are linked to deep thinking and planning 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.360
 Which suggests that extrasimists may be more aggressive than introversists who prefer to think things over 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.920
 Rather than rushing to do it directly, but because of the tendency of the introversaries to think about something 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.280
 They are more susceptible to anxiety and depression. 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.280
 Diabetics respond more strongly to rewards 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.980
 With brain radiation showing that they have a greater amount of activated dopamine in the equivalent device than the introversion 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.920
 When you're done and win a gamble game. 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.580
 Because we are social beings, dopamine is released when we communicate with other humans. 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.920
 This was especially important for fishers who relied on others to bring food and protection from predators. 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.160
 However, the human relationship has a greater influence on the simplistic of the introversion. 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.380
 In fact, the brains of the Epistemes appear to respond more strongly 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.380
 When showing images of humans' faces compared to images of nature. 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.980
 But the mind of the introversaries responds similarly to both images. 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.130
 This does not mean that the introversians feel no excitement when winning 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.210
 Or they vehemently hate staying around people 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.050
 But they simply do not feel the same excitement and do not need that amount of communication to feel satisfied. 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.460
 From a genetic point of view, there may be an evolutionary advantage for each feature. 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.280
 For example, introductions may hide with margins to avoid predators 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.500
 While wandering around and discovering extras, giving them preference when food is scarce. 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:20.480
 A study of 130 participants found that a person who tends to be an adventurer has two copies of a particular allele gene 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.660
 Which reinforces the idea that personality traits are partially associated with genes. 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.460
 Our society is biased in many ways 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.620
 Where qualities like putting yourself abroad will be appreciated. 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.780
 Our institutions are usually designed with the simplistic mindset where "teamwork" is common practice in schools and workplaces, 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.260
 Creating the idea that creativity stems from a social place. 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.560
 However, because we are social beings instinctively negate the opinions of others is not aware of it 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.380
 This suggests that brainstorming sessions with others may not always be fruitful. 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.280
 Neuroscientists have shown that when we do not agree with the group there will be a high activity in the amygdala 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.460
 It is part of the brain linked to the rejection state. 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.000
 When we think of aeronautics, we are ashamed and prefer unity 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.840
 But in fact, introversists may simply prefer proximity talks with one person or a few people rather than many of them. 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.560
 Moreover, introvers may be better preachers 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.760
 Since they are known to reflect on ideas rather than abstractions 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.380
 Who may choose to make hasty decisions. 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.870
 But you may be "balanced mood" 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.220
 In the middle between the circles of introversion and extrapolation combining the best of both worlds! 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:35.080
 In a recent study involving 340 representatives of the call center with their track record of 3 months. 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.800
 Non-Antoine or Nefasatin produced the most revenue at $ 208 per hour, 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.120
 Compared to the average study of $ 138 per hour. 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.379
 So where do you see yourself? Do you think there is a better feature than the other?
