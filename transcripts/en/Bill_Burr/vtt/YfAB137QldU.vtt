1
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.130
Hey, what's going on it's Bill Burr and It's time for the a Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05.131 --> 00:00:09.090
just before Friday.

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.440
Fucking Monday morning podcast that I'm just checking in on you. How's that?

4
00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:15.930
Is that the worst?

5
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:20.790
Is that the worst you've ever heard? Um, Dave, no reference.

6
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.710
Uh, sorry. My voice is a little fucking blown out. Uh,

7
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.720
I did a record for episode six of the 10 that we're doing for a season two and I

8
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:34.290
don't know what the fuck I did to it. Um, who's getting new when you know,

9
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:35.610
when you lack talent,

10
00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:40.611
what you try to do is you try to be loud so you can shout down all the silence.

11
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.260
That's what you do. You throw in a couple of f words,

12
00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:46.560
a couple of fucking shit jokes. And next thing you know,

13
00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:48.120
you kind of have an act, you know,

14
00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:51.750
and you scraped the bottom of the fucking barrel.

15
00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:55.920
That's what you dope. And when you're scraped the bottom of the barrel.

16
00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:56.641
Next thing you know,

17
00:00:56.641 --> 00:01:00.990
you have your party's nomination for presidency of the United States.

18
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.060
You know what's great about this job is I get to meet a bunch of different

19
00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:10.170
people and overwhelmingly people on both sides are just going,

20
00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:14.150
I don't know who the fuck I'm going to vote for. These are my, these are the,

21
00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:18.060
these are the two which are supposed to decide,

22
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.580
added a fucking blue between these two fucking lunatics.

23
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.540
I don't get it. Well, I get it. What are you gonna do?

24
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.780
So you either vote more of the same or you step off into the abyss.

25
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.420
A, I swear to God,

26
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.370
if Trump didn't hate nonwhites as much as he seems to, uh,

27
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.680
or at least it wasn't so fucking out of touch,

28
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.920
I'd almost be excited just to see what the, what,

29
00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:49.950
just just being a lazy comedian.

30
00:01:49.951 --> 00:01:53.880
Just how this guy would just be fucking feeding it to you. You know what I mean?

31
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.490
I found Obama was kind of boring. You know, Bush was fine.

32
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.360
Clint was Jesus Christ. Clinton was fucking great. You know,

33
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.360
why don't you come over here and suck my Dick? I mean,

34
00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:10.210
it was so easy to get laughs on that guy and then bullshit to just get old

35
00:02:10.211 --> 00:02:13.050
after. Well, we get it. He's fucking stupid. But like Clinton,

36
00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:16.830
every fucking week he was sticking cigars and people's fucking twats,

37
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.760
you know, he's bombing people, he's putting on weight.

38
00:02:20.761 --> 00:02:24.250
He goes to McDonald's and he's got his fucking thighs out. I mean, that guy,

39
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.183
he was, he was, uh,

40
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.240
he was a comedy juggernaut because he kept changing every time you thought,

41
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.140
you know, all right, it's this, this, and this, and you got this guy down.

42
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:36.990
He would add another layer. Bush was just kinda hazy.

43
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.840
And then another fucking seven years and it's like, we get it. We get it.

44
00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:46.770
He's fucking stupid. He's not stupid, but he's, I don't know.

45
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.160
I'll quote one of my relatives. He's not the best speaker. Um,

46
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.960
I don't, I barely even watched Obama Bowers over there. Oh, Ho Ho.

47
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.290
We just felt like he was giving me a fucking lecture. It's like, all right.

48
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.610
I never really found any whom I found his wife Hilarious fucking going on Ellen

49
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:13.990
and shit and tweeting, you know what I mean?

50
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.360
Acting like some seventh grader on Instagram. She was funny, but uh,

51
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.230
I don't know about him. Um, anyways,

52
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:26.320
so hopefully whatever one of the other,

53
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.630
I can tell you right now that both of the, either one of them,

54
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:32.320
Hillary or Trump is going to be plenty of fucking material but then instantly be

55
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:35.080
hacky. So maybe that's what it is. I don't know.

56
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.850
All I know is I got 'em I got, I'm doing this Wednesday night.

57
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.220
Um, the hockey is over.

58
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.940
You get so excited to see somebody win the fucking cup and then,

59
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.020
then there's like the next day like, oh fuck, it's over now what do I do?

60
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.100
Um, I'll tell you what you do. You get into Formula One.

61
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.040
There's another race this Sunday. The fucking,

62
00:03:57.041 --> 00:04:00.370
I don't know where the hell it's gonna be. Is this the European one?

63
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.870
I don't know. I got them all on my phone. There's a couple in July,

64
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.830
then there's a as like one in August, two in September,

65
00:04:09.831 --> 00:04:13.520
then like fucking every Sunday in October there's one,

66
00:04:13.521 --> 00:04:17.660
then there's two more in November and then that's it. It's pretty fucking easy.

67
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.990
There are only a couple hours you get to watch somebody go like torn and miles

68
00:04:20.991 --> 00:04:22.730
an hour. You get through to look in the crowd,

69
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.090
see all the people that go to the Bilderberg meetings, right?

70
00:04:26.091 --> 00:04:28.790
And sacrifice people. And then you see a couple of Basque.

71
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.280
This is how much money's in, in,

72
00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:35.240
in fucking Formula One is when you look at like the alias movie stars and like

73
00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:39.080
fucking Zillionaire, you know athletes, they have a look on their face.

74
00:04:39.081 --> 00:04:41.870
Like they can't even believe that they're there. They're like, wow, these,

75
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.250
these people have money. We thought we had money. And then,

76
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.570
then we came here and then we realized that we, we did, we, we, we,

77
00:04:49.571 --> 00:04:52.460
we have money, but we don't have that kind of money. You know,

78
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.360
we don't back a fucking yacht into France.

79
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.760
He's fucking people back a yet into France and fucking watch a race and then

80
00:05:04.191 --> 00:05:07.400
continue on. Where do they go? You know,

81
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.240
you ever seen those people on the yachts? Every once in a while you're like,

82
00:05:11.241 --> 00:05:15.110
where the fuck? Where are they going? Do you say like you,

83
00:05:15.111 --> 00:05:17.990
you cruise underneath of fucking, you got your own mountain.

84
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.850
<v 1>Okay.</v>

85
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.360
<v 0>That's incredible. Um, you ever been on a boat just by yourself?</v>

86
00:05:23.361 --> 00:05:25.910
Whenever I'm on a boat by myself, I always have the same thought.

87
00:05:25.911 --> 00:05:29.840
There's no fucking way I wouldn't do something illegal if I owned a boat.

88
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.580
There's no fucking way.

89
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.440
The level of freedom that you fucking have this shits you,

90
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.950
you're on a boat going out in the fucking ocean.

91
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.210
All bets are off. You get out into international waters. I mean it's fucking,

92
00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:48.310
whatever you say, it becomes your law.

93
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.240
Literally do whatever the fuck you want to do. You're telling me right now,

94
00:05:52.241 --> 00:05:57.010
if you had a fucking boat, right? Your boss was a Dick, right?

95
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.700
Fuck. Ah, you know, just uh, whatever.

96
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:05.120
They promoted a woman, right? Cause they had a fucking check off a box.

97
00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:07.400
They guy, you are more qualified.

98
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.560
You came in every day with your qualified swinging Dick and junk and they had

99
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:13.394
enough of it.

100
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.140
They told you to stand down and then they promoted this lady, right?

101
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.880
You're telling me if you got a boat, right? I don't know how you got the boat.

102
00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:25.400
You didn't get promoted, but whatever. This is my fucking fantasy.

103
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.510
Trash trashing fucking it's hypothetical lady. Right?

104
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.930
I know this could be considered misogynistic.

105
00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:35.840
This is the woman I ran into the first 90 times.

106
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.400
I tried to get something on the air.

107
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:42.280
I just feel it's like this and that would be the end of my dream. Um,

108
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:47.660
but they don't have any power. Um, it's a glass ceiling. Well,

109
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.640
I'm running into their shoes over here is they're banging their head on the

110
00:06:52.641 --> 00:06:55.670
ceiling. That was been my experience. Anyways, let's get back to the fantasy.

111
00:06:55.671 --> 00:06:59.510
You're telling me if you got a fucking boat, you know,

112
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:04.880
you don't I to just, I don't know, just a kilo of cocaine.

113
00:07:04.881 --> 00:07:07.880
Just for the fuck of it. Just to have the cash laying around your house.

114
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.450
You know what I mean? Get a Kegger, have some people over,

115
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.230
cook up some steaks. That's the way you do it. When you, when you're,

116
00:07:17.231 --> 00:07:19.820
if you're fucking drug is just every once in awhile.

117
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.880
Is there a way to do that in the, in the drug game was the kid say,

118
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.010
can you just every once in awhile deliver a kilo so no one picks up on it,

119
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.460
right. You still drive your dented Prius like mate, Jesus,

120
00:07:31.461 --> 00:07:34.190
my car needs a fucking bath. Like you read about.

121
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.070
I literally walked out of a fucking liquor store today.

122
00:07:37.071 --> 00:07:38.780
It wasn't for me because I'm on the wagon.

123
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.980
Buddy of mine got fucking married to like bottom. Um,

124
00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.140
it couldn't make it cause I was on the road,

125
00:07:45.141 --> 00:07:47.630
so I just got them some fucking champagne shit, whatever.

126
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.170
And I forgot to get a card. But if on the stand I'm giving it to him,

127
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.450
I'll just say, hey, you know, I've got a card. He goes, dad, don't worry.

128
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:56.650
You got the booze. That's what counts. Sorry, what did he drink up? I hear Ya.

129
00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:01.190
Yeah, me. I, you look at my eyes, right? I want the same boat. Oh yeah.

130
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.680
So anyways, um,

131
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.830
I came walking out of the liquor store and, uh,

132
00:08:06.831 --> 00:08:09.380
I looked at my car and this thing's a fucking piece of shit,

133
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:15.620
but it isn't just on the outside, you know,

134
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.680
on the inside, everything's been taken care of. Right. I've,

135
00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:22.040
I've maintained that thing meticulously on the outside.

136
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.740
It's a mess on the inside. It's beautiful, you know,

137
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:28.460
it's like an ugly person just waiting for somebody good looking to come along

138
00:08:28.461 --> 00:08:31.340
and discovered that, you know, maybe they have something. I do the conversation,

139
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:36.140
you know, um, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about,

140
00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:39.800
so I'm just saying this is the way this is. If you're in,

141
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.920
if you're selling drugs, this is what you do it.

142
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:48.150
If he can just do it like the way Bush went to the fucking Army National Guard,

143
00:08:48.591 --> 00:08:51.350
whatever the fuck he did, we just showed up every once in awhile,

144
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.160
you know what I mean?

145
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.920
Played Ping Pong dressed like a sergeant and then you just went home for like

146
00:08:55.921 --> 00:09:00.690
fucking six months. That's the way you deal drugs. Alright. Yeah.

147
00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.530
Befriended drug deal and you go, listen, this is all I want to do. I got a boat.

148
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.590
Okay? Every fucking Watson awhile, you know,

149
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:12.120
every whatever be fucking 18 months, you call me up, right?

150
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.690
You've got a key is something. Why you throw it on the fucking boat?

151
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.220
I'll have it on ice.

152
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.280
You have the coldest fucking cocaine in the universe and I'll fucking deliver it

153
00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:25.170
over here, right? You break me off like fucking 15 grand. All right?

154
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.240
Then you just take the cash. You just got it.

155
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:33.030
You got 15 grand in cash and you don't fucking buy yourself anything.

156
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.020
You know, go out and buy a fucking flashy fucking car or any of that shit.

157
00:09:37.021 --> 00:09:41.400
All you do, you just have it in a jar or some shit. Every once in a while.

158
00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:45.090
Big Games coming up. You know, UFC event, you fucking ordering.

159
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.770
That's what you spend it on. You fucking blow it on your friends.

160
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.600
You know it's some fucking barbershop chairs in your house.

161
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.960
Just some stupid shit, you know? Nothing that causes that.

162
00:09:57.961 --> 00:10:01.320
That's how you blow your fucking cash, man. You can keep shit on the inside,

163
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.970
right. You don't drive around some flashy car with the fucking elevator shoes,

164
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.250
whatever, whatever, whatever the kids do today. I don't,

165
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.550
I don't pretend to know. That's what I would do, you know?

166
00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:15.560
Then every once in a while, and I don't know how to get into your bank account,

167
00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.290
why would he do then? If you've got to pay for the UFC event,

168
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.010
well who gives a fuck? You pay for it out of your body. Clean money, you know?

169
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.310
And then all the Booz money and all the other bullshit you just take out of the

170
00:10:25.311 --> 00:10:26.780
jar. There you go.

171
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.640
Be hilarious when you finally get caught, you know,

172
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.850
and you just go to trial and just be like, look, I just,

173
00:10:34.851 --> 00:10:37.760
every once in a while I was like, every 18 months,

174
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.980
it's not even a felony a year, your honor. And you know, I just, I,

175
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:47.400
I didn't buy anything. I don't even watch this shit. I just, you know, I,

176
00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.600
I got the NFL package and I had my friends. Oh,

177
00:10:50.601 --> 00:10:52.580
everybody had their own leather chair. Yeah, we have watch shows,

178
00:10:52.581 --> 00:10:55.280
the Elvis documentaries. Well, you know,

179
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.770
everyone's going to go horseback riding and it wasn't enough.

180
00:10:57.771 --> 00:10:59.720
He bought everybody a horse and he got him a saddle,

181
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:04.520
then a little pickup truck to put the saddle in. I did that. The judge be like,

182
00:11:04.521 --> 00:11:05.810
Oh, is that what your dad does? Great.

183
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.850
Well maybe you can take that given nature and go to jail and start giving some

184
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:13.760
hand jobs because a, see United States of America Buddy,

185
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.393
<v 1>do you know</v>

186
00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:21.940
<v 0>if you get a kilo of cocaine, right? And then you fucking</v>

187
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:28.570
take your boat all the way out into international waters, right?

188
00:11:28.571 --> 00:11:33.280
And then I meet you on another boat and then I hand you the key, uh, cocaine.

189
00:11:33.281 --> 00:11:37.120
And then you give me the money in international waters and what both captains

190
00:11:37.121 --> 00:11:41.560
and what we say goes and we say, uh, um, I say,

191
00:11:41.561 --> 00:11:45.500
this is legal. All in favor. And we go, Aye. Aye. Aye.

192
00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:47.920
Good. They don't really think, I mean,

193
00:11:47.921 --> 00:11:52.320
once it's the dude who comes back in with the fucking kilo,

194
00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.750
he's in trouble. You, once you get back within the borders,

195
00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.540
you know what I mean? Can you sit there?

196
00:12:00.541 --> 00:12:02.860
I'm really fascinated with boats now. Can you fucking just,

197
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:04.860
I don't even do drugs. This is just fascinating to me.

198
00:12:04.861 --> 00:12:09.390
Can you sit in just just on the other side of international waters with a kilo

199
00:12:09.391 --> 00:12:10.920
of cocaine out in the open,

200
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:16.530
just blow in stripes is the coast guards looking at you just waiting for you to

201
00:12:16.531 --> 00:12:21.230
float another 40 feet over and just be sitting there. Gone on out.

202
00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:25.560
I am the captain of the ship and international waters and I say this is legal.

203
00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:29.420
Yeah, you probably can't do that. Right.

204
00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.320
Cause you know what they could do is they could just come over and just say that

205
00:12:33.321 --> 00:12:33.740
you were,

206
00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:37.790
you were in within the borders of the U S who's gonna fucking know it's there

207
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:39.380
where it gets yours. You right there on the ocean.

208
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.250
There's a lot of questions I have about the ocean.

209
00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:46.670
This is one of the reasons why I don't have a boat aside from the fact it's just

210
00:12:46.671 --> 00:12:49.970
a fucking money pit. You know what I mean?

211
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.990
Can't have a boat. You can have a friend who has a boat.

212
00:12:53.991 --> 00:12:56.120
That's the way to do it. Right. That's my brother always said,

213
00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.480
you don't want a boat pill. You want, you want a friend to have a boat.

214
00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:02.990
That's still, that's what it is. And then you show up, you know,

215
00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:05.450
bring a little tango, rain tonic, you're a fucking hero.

216
00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:08.150
And then you guide dogs to fucking boat and that's it.

217
00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:10.820
He's cleaning off the barnacles. You know what I mean?

218
00:13:10.821 --> 00:13:15.080
He has to explain what happened to the stores. She was here a minute ago.

219
00:13:15.081 --> 00:13:17.150
I don't know. We were drinking. She must've fallen overboard.

220
00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:20.060
Right then that falls you around for the rest of your fucking life.

221
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:25.490
Um, anyways, so what do you guys think?

222
00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.040
I guess when you're listening to this, it's Thursday.

223
00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:33.130
So game six in Cleveland to night to night to night.

224
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.650
Um, oh my God. Can you imagine if they force a fucking game seven

225
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:46.010
that would be something else. You know what I mean? Who knows?

226
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.140
Then you go out to fucking elites.

227
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:52.580
I'm going to give some Cleveland Cavalier fans some advice here. Okay.

228
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.310
God willing. They forced the game. Seven. Okay.

229
00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:00.120
Cause we're all trying to avoid the dog days of fucking baseball.

230
00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.860
You know what I mean? Nobody wants to watch that shit.

231
00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.980
The baseball players don't want to play the games. They don't.

232
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.840
You only reason why they play is because if they didn't,

233
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:07.950
they wouldn't make as much money.

234
00:14:07.951 --> 00:14:12.951
But nobody wants to fucking play baseball from mid June to fucking like the

235
00:14:13.681 --> 00:14:15.840
second week of September. Any ball player,

236
00:14:15.841 --> 00:14:18.870
if they could fast forward to all of those fucking games and just get to the

237
00:14:18.871 --> 00:14:22.860
exciting part. You know who's gonna win the division? There's nothing better.

238
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:28.620
Then when it finally fucking matters after fuck a 263 regular season,

239
00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:32.790
whatever they play 182 games, whatever the hell it is, 180 games.

240
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:35.730
Jesus fucking Christ.

241
00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.990
You know everybody in Chicago getting all excited about the cubs.

242
00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.190
You know what I mean? Already rubbing one out.

243
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.440
They're going to bust a nut and fucking the beginning of July.

244
00:14:46.441 --> 00:14:50.940
You got to pace yourself. You're not watched any pornos relax.

245
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.680
Cub, feds, put your shirts back on. All right?

246
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:59.150
How many fucking times if you fell for this, not saying I'm rooting against you,

247
00:14:59.151 --> 00:15:03.290
but you know, slow your roll here. Cubs fans,

248
00:15:03.291 --> 00:15:06.620
the level of excitement they get when you watch them every fucking year.

249
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.740
It's literally like watching somebody's fallen in love with his stripper,

250
00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:13.610
you know, and you just sit and there like, what are you doing? You know,

251
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:20.280
you fuck them. You don't fall in love with them right now.

252
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.520
I'm kidding. Part of being a sports fan is the fucking misery.

253
00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:24.080
And you've got to believe that's what you gotta do.

254
00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:28.340
Take the kick to the seeds every fucking year and then maybe one time they

255
00:15:28.341 --> 00:15:30.980
actually win it. Then you talk about that for the rest of your life. Oh,

256
00:15:30.981 --> 00:15:35.960
what a year. They still live the newspaper a framed it.

257
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:41.360
Um, and then your wife throws it out. Nah, maybe she doesn't.

258
00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:45.140
Maybe she's cool night. Maybe she wants us to sports too,

259
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:47.960
but then she'd probably fed, you know,

260
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:53.840
looks like you guys started putting on each other's jeans in the morning.

261
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:58.600
Just these might aff. Nothing felt weird. Yeah. Don't use that.

262
00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:02.630
Usually the camel toe fit here. I guess these are yours. Um,

263
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:07.060
this has gotta be the most fucking bizarre podcast I've ever done. Um,

264
00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:11.660
it's cause I'm fucking exhausted mentally from doing this shit.

265
00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:16.400
Uh, I got halfway through this podcast. I'm not drinking and I was watching the,

266
00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.390
a Jacopo story of Pistorious is that he says, name the fucking Bass player.

267
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.680
They're watching this documentary on him. I read the book on this guy too.

268
00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.230
And like the beginning is all greatness.

269
00:16:27.231 --> 00:16:29.780
Just once he starts going off the rails, you know,

270
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.460
so I kind of paused it right the right part.

271
00:16:31.461 --> 00:16:35.810
If you're watching the documentary for the first hour and eight minutes,

272
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:39.140
we're actually probably about the hour and three minutes.

273
00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.630
And then it starts to be like, oh,

274
00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:44.900
and then he did this and did that and then this fucking gappiness then it's a

275
00:16:44.901 --> 00:16:49.600
shit show. Um, so anyways, uh,

276
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:51.520
the fuck was I talking about, I'm talking about boats now.

277
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:53.120
I was talking about the Cavaliers now it's,

278
00:16:53.121 --> 00:16:55.640
he had some advice to Cleveland Cavalier fans. Okay. God willing.

279
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:59.120
You guys force a game six. Okay. Enough for you, not for your city.

280
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.870
That's the offense for me. Okay. Cause I want another,

281
00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:07.220
I want two more fucking games tomorrow night and I want another one. Okay.

282
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:10.070
Before I slip into, um,

283
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.660
the sporting abyss, you know,

284
00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.590
and I don't give a fuck that you only have to wait another six weeks before,

285
00:17:18.591 --> 00:17:22.460
you know, preseason football starts. I don't give a fuck.

286
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:27.110
I don't give a fuck about the draft. I don't give a fuck about preseason.

287
00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:29.840
I don't give a fuck about analysis.

288
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.540
I don't give a shit the projections.

289
00:17:32.541 --> 00:17:35.840
I don't give a fuck about any of it.

290
00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:38.840
Just let me know when it counts.

291
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:46.510
I am so fucking sick of watching people standing up on a fuck in front of a God

292
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:52.870
damn screen trying to explain to me what the fuck I just saw what happened and

293
00:17:53.011 --> 00:17:56.460
why it happened. I don't give a shit. I get it.

294
00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:00.390
You played the game and you understand it on a level beyond,

295
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:06.660
you know, just, I don't know, just fucking show who won.

296
00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.660
Talk over the highlights and the fucking thing.

297
00:18:09.661 --> 00:18:13.690
You're going to sit around and have goddamn debates. You know,

298
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:15.790
what do you think was happening in transit? Lots.

299
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:20.640
The problem with everybody knows, I don't know shit about basketball,

300
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:21.720
but I can tell you right now,

301
00:18:21.721 --> 00:18:25.890
if you fucking the Cavaliers as a fucking comedian,

302
00:18:25.891 --> 00:18:29.340
I know what they're doing wrong. At least they think I do.

303
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:33.060
I would think if you're up by eight points against a team that can shoot the

304
00:18:33.061 --> 00:18:33.960
fucking lights out,

305
00:18:33.961 --> 00:18:36.750
you'd want to throw the ball around a little bit when it was in your possession,

306
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.360
rather than whoever gets the ball and crosses.

307
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.500
Fucking mid-court just says, I'm shooting it right.

308
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:46.590
It doesn't even pass the ball. And you take like two seconds off the clock.

309
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:51.540
It's probably not what you want to do. Right? See that? I'm a comedian.

310
00:18:51.541 --> 00:18:54.180
I can figure that out. Do I need four people in fucking so well,

311
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.640
three people in suits. Then you've got to get a lady in there, right?

312
00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.190
She's got a fucking, she's got to run her. Yap.

313
00:18:59.191 --> 00:19:01.200
She's gotta put her fucking 2 cents in. Right?

314
00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.220
You only one of the worst fucking things ever is to be a beautiful woman,

315
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:09.120
you know, and you're with a really successful guy, you know,

316
00:19:09.121 --> 00:19:11.520
and you just go around to parties and then you're just,

317
00:19:11.521 --> 00:19:13.650
you just stand next to the guy going,

318
00:19:13.651 --> 00:19:17.580
is he going to introduce me as they're going to introduce me. You get one time,

319
00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:20.160
say hi. And then he just stand there.

320
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.210
The other night I did a Gig and there was this,

321
00:19:24.211 --> 00:19:28.290
there was a scene afterwards and there was all these fucking, you know,

322
00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.160
rich people with their beautiful wives and I just, I don't know,

323
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.600
I just started watching the wives after awhile. I don't under,

324
00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.890
why don't they peel off and talk to each other?

325
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.960
It's sort of a weird thing where they just got to stand there smiling.

326
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:47.550
You can see their face hurting, you know their feet hurt from the fucking pumps.

327
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:52.680
It's fucking brutal. If you're a beautiful woman, what you should do,

328
00:19:52.681 --> 00:19:57.681
you got to marry like a fucking six who just can't believe that he's with you.

329
00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:02.670
Cause he'll let you go out and wear some fucking flatties some moccasins.

330
00:20:02.671 --> 00:20:03.001
He doesn't,

331
00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:06.270
you don't have to jack it up in the air and stand there smiling next to him.

332
00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.540
Like one of those fucking psychos on the prices, right?

333
00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:12.840
Waiting to fucking act like they're amazed about a washer and a dryer.

334
00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:17.490
Get a stand next to your fucking guys wearing a sport coat trying to cover up

335
00:20:17.491 --> 00:20:20.700
his fucking man tits and you've got to sit there smiling like you're happy.

336
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:22.380
You know,

337
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.740
putting your fucking makeup on like some clown that's probably really shot out

338
00:20:25.741 --> 00:20:28.980
of a fucking candy. You don't need that shit. What are you doing?

339
00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:34.800
They got to start while I tell you these fucking good looking women that marry

340
00:20:34.801 --> 00:20:39.330
these really successful guys and then just stand next to him smiling, you know,

341
00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:44.660
for the whole fucking evening like a stewardess at the end of a flight except

342
00:20:44.701 --> 00:20:47.800
the fuck it takes four hours for the, for everybody to get off the plane.

343
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.850
Cause by thank you for flying. Hi.

344
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.000
You know whose fault that is? It's their fault.

345
00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.440
It's their God damn fault for getting yourself into that fucking position.

346
00:21:02.441 --> 00:21:06.580
Some point in the relationship. You've got to say, listen, hey mark, sit down.

347
00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:11.350
We gotta talk. Guess what? Fucking Susie ain't putting on the shoes tonight.

348
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:14.800
All right, deal with it not standing next to you. Smile.

349
00:21:14.801 --> 00:21:18.140
You want to go to a fucking brunch and stand next to me smiling with some after

350
00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.540
shave on for fucking four hours. I didn't think you did. Shut up.

351
00:21:22.541 --> 00:21:25.120
I'm not finished. At some point you got to have that conversation.

352
00:21:25.121 --> 00:21:29.140
You know I'm not trying to be mean here. This is supposed to be empowering.

353
00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:32.520
I'm saying you have the power to not just fucking stand there smiling like a God

354
00:21:32.521 --> 00:21:35.020
damn. I don't know why. I don't know what it is.

355
00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:37.923
<v 3>You know?</v>

356
00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:40.400
<v 0>I don't know. I'm talking about,</v>

357
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:43.160
I don't even know if I saw that or I watched an episode of House of cards,

358
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:45.320
you know how's of cards? I last like three.

359
00:21:45.321 --> 00:21:49.070
I lasted like three episodes and I just got sick of him fucking turn me talking

360
00:21:49.071 --> 00:21:51.830
to me. It's like, dude, will you just live your life? Stop talking to me.

361
00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:55.190
They're out there as the secretary of state. He doesn't know that.

362
00:21:55.191 --> 00:21:58.820
I'm fucking is. Wow. Shut up. I get it. I get it.

363
00:21:58.821 --> 00:22:01.100
Just stop talking. What is this,

364
00:22:01.101 --> 00:22:05.180
the wonder years for adults? Um, Oh God,

365
00:22:05.181 --> 00:22:08.150
I'm going to grumpy fucking mood and I love Kevin Spacey.

366
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:11.240
Why would I say these things? Why would I say these things?

367
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:14.220
Cause I'm mentally fucking exhausted and I got another eight minutes so I gotta

368
00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.380
run my fucking Yap

369
00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:22.060
running my yap on the Thursday afternoon pod cares talking about issues.

370
00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:27.140
Um, what else?

371
00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:29.600
I don't know that I have anything else.

372
00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:33.200
I still haven't watched peaky blinders cause I'm trying not to drink and there's

373
00:22:33.201 --> 00:22:36.260
no way to to watch that show and not want to fucking start.

374
00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:42.680
She's pounding. Maybe I'll wait until like the 4th of July, you know,

375
00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:44.360
I'll just watch. That's what I'll do.

376
00:22:44.361 --> 00:22:46.190
That's a good way to spend the 4th of July.

377
00:22:46.191 --> 00:22:49.490
I'll ignore my wife and just get blind drunk watching a show that she can't

378
00:22:49.491 --> 00:22:53.360
understand. You know, I put on the subtitles but she,

379
00:22:53.361 --> 00:22:57.080
she is just not into it. She just doesn't give a fuck. We actually had this,

380
00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:59.360
we had this argument the other night. Right.

381
00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:01.060
<v 3>Okay.</v>

382
00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.710
<v 0>She goes to when we go to bed, right.</v>

383
00:23:02.711 --> 00:23:06.310
She puts on the TV and she always has her shows on and what's fucking hilarious

384
00:23:06.311 --> 00:23:06.910
to me.

385
00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:10.960
And she's always coming at me about my temper and my yelling and flipping out,

386
00:23:10.961 --> 00:23:15.020
screaming at lamps and shit or yelling at the TV or my computer. Oh,

387
00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.210
me and my computer, if you ever heard the way I yell at my fucking computer,

388
00:23:19.211 --> 00:23:22.720
you know, like that couple that just needs to fucking break up. You know,

389
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:24.250
we got in my neighborhood, dude,

390
00:23:24.251 --> 00:23:28.030
I'm telling you like fucking two houses up that they've been very good lately,

391
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.540
you know. But I'm telling you this like times,

392
00:23:31.541 --> 00:23:34.000
like you're literally like waiting to hear the gunshot.

393
00:23:34.001 --> 00:23:37.270
It's like this is fucking insane. The way they scream at each other.

394
00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:43.870
It's the most unhealthy fucking relationship, you know, I've ever heard.

395
00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:48.470
And I gotta be honest with man, you know, sometimes I hear it and I just,

396
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:51.200
I go out on my porch and I g I just listened.

397
00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:56.420
You don't let up a cigar and just enjoy it like it's a show now fucking with

398
00:23:56.421 --> 00:23:59.420
yet, don't. Um, but anyways,

399
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.520
so she's always getting on me about my temper and shit.

400
00:24:01.521 --> 00:24:05.510
You know what's fucking hilarious? Almost every fucking show she watches.

401
00:24:05.511 --> 00:24:07.940
It's just a bunch of people screaming and yelling at each other.

402
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:13.880
Those reality shows that are just wall to wall clams. That's all. I mean,

403
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:18.650
you would think all these feminists out there who was sitting at trash and men

404
00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:22.790
up and down, all the bad stuff we do to them. Admittedly. You know what I mean?

405
00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:26.750
We make you stand next to us and smile for an entire fucking party,

406
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:31.070
you know? Oh, I'm sorry. This is my wife. Oh, I'm sorry.

407
00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:34.520
This is the person that committed my life to, I'm sorry.

408
00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.600
Did I agnostic? Did I not even acknowledge that you will fucking here?

409
00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.480
They deal with that all fucking night. Right? All that bullshit.

410
00:24:41.481 --> 00:24:44.840
I know we do that shit. But you would think that these fucking feminists, right?

411
00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:50.630
You'd think that they would have issues with these fucking reality shows because

412
00:24:50.631 --> 00:24:55.400
the way they depict women is, I don't give a fuck how many pairs of shoes,

413
00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:59.600
how big the fucking houses, how much jewels they got hanging off of them.

414
00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:02.840
They're still gonna Bitch that just fucking bitch in each other up.

415
00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.690
She was watching one of these shows, right? And there was just like,

416
00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:09.380
I don't know, 15 it seemed like there was 15 or 20 of them. So you know,

417
00:25:09.381 --> 00:25:10.940
there was probably just three.

418
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:14.750
But that's the amount of noise a fucking woman can make. Right.

419
00:25:14.751 --> 00:25:18.320
Three of them will sound like 15 it's like their defense mechanism because

420
00:25:18.321 --> 00:25:20.510
generally speaking, they can't beat the shit out of men,

421
00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.430
but if they just start complaining,

422
00:25:22.431 --> 00:25:25.520
it just sounds like a platoon in your back down. Right.

423
00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:28.840
Instead of given all three of them, I'm one of those most slaps, you know,

424
00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:33.920
and all three stooges would get slapped at once. Um, anyways,

425
00:25:33.921 --> 00:25:36.560
one of the episodes I saw like f, you know, like I said,

426
00:25:36.561 --> 00:25:39.290
it sounded like 15 so realistically it was probably like six of them, right?

427
00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:43.670
They, they went to like Rome or some shit and I'm thinking, I finally,

428
00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:48.850
they got these fucking women out of this cul-de-sac now they can now they can be

429
00:25:49.071 --> 00:25:52.430
excited to be in romp. They go to fucking Rome. They do the same goddamn think.

430
00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.660
You know this bitch come up to me, started talking about,

431
00:25:56.661 --> 00:26:01.010
it's like you're in Rome. You dumb fuck. Go look at something. Go eat some food.

432
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:03.650
I know it's just a show, but whatever.

433
00:26:03.651 --> 00:26:06.770
She watches that shit and I'm just laying there. I hate the fucking show.

434
00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.460
I'm trying to go to sleep and I just know she just watches these fucking shows

435
00:26:10.461 --> 00:26:11.570
where they scream and yell at each other.

436
00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.960
Now she's watching a fucking show that's about a show.

437
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:16.580
That's a show that's like that.

438
00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:22.250
It's a show about a one of those reality shows like the bachelor.

439
00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:28.260
You know what I mean? And I don't know. I, I don't, I W W, w, w,

440
00:26:28.261 --> 00:26:32.060
w what the fuck do I know? Right? 26 minutes.

441
00:26:32.061 --> 00:26:34.400
Let's read a little bit of advertising here. Why don't we do that? All right.

442
00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:37.520
Type in the password.

443
00:26:37.521 --> 00:26:40.040
You wouldn't want anybody to break into your computer bill with all your

444
00:26:40.041 --> 00:26:40.874
secrets.

445
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.690
All my fucking slap fight videos that I watch.

446
00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.790
Why don't we have a fucking password, you know?

447
00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:51.190
<v 4>Okay.</v>

448
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:52.940
<v 0>Yeah, I know this isn't going to work either. Anytime.</v>

449
00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.780
I tried to do the past with one fucking hand. You know what kills me too.

450
00:26:55.781 --> 00:26:57.460
Is that one? Yeah, of course. It didn't work.

451
00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:01.420
I wanted a nice simple fucking password and stupid tucked in there.

452
00:27:01.421 --> 00:27:02.740
Keeps telling me that it wasn't safe

453
00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:06.810
<v 4>here enough. You know what? No thank you.</v>

454
00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:11.940
<v 0>25 minutes. All right. Here we go. Loot crate. What the hell is this shit?</v>

455
00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:16.770
All right. Here we go. Loot crate. Everybody ever been to comic con? No.

456
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:21.760
Wish you could take it home with you. I've what? An aqua man soup.

457
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.590
No. [inaudible] bill. Just read the copy. Copyright it.

458
00:27:24.591 --> 00:27:28.890
Have a little bit of it sent to your home every month with loot crate

459
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:34.890
packs. E three and comic con happened just once a year. All this is some fun.

460
00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:38.970
This is like some mega nerd shit. All right. Yeah,

461
00:27:38.971 --> 00:27:43.640
we go nerds perk up your ears. This is like when they, after the Superbowl,

462
00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.750
when they sell like the programs and the hats and all that, I'm like,

463
00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:50.190
go be to buy that done. I'm going to save it. It's going to be worth something.

464
00:27:50.191 --> 00:27:54.180
Right. Um, this is for the nerds. Here we go.

465
00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.350
Okay. So the, evidently there's something called Pax.

466
00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:01.860
Evidently there's some called [inaudible] and I know about comic con and they

467
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:06.590
happen just once a year each. That's like the Grand Slam. Like you know,

468
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.480
in golf you got the masters, she got the British open,

469

some wonder woman thing. I don't know.

00:29:44.771 --> 00:29:48.040
I did a Gig the other night where there was like professional gamers there and

495
00:29:48.041 --> 00:29:51.910
stuff. They make all this fucking money. It's like the greatest thing ever.

496
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:56.740
You play video games for a living, you know,

497
00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:00.040
that's what this country has become. It's become like your turn your hobby.

498
00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:04.600
Like me, I turned fucking around telling jokes in a warehouse into a career.

499
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:09.220
Skype plays video games, you know what I mean? You like Robyn one out,

500
00:30:09.221 --> 00:30:12.120
you get into porn. God knows we don't manufacture anything.

501
00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:16.320
And there's like two things left in this country, a growing weed and,

502
00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:18.160
and fucking, uh,

503
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:23.410
starting like a nonprofit. You know what I mean?

504
00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:28.750
Most of those are bullshit anyways, right? We got to help people. Uh,

505
00:30:28.751 --> 00:30:31.420
we got to pinkies. There's a bunch of paint, you know,

506
00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.830
Pavin two pinkies affects most people. A lot of people don't even talk about it,

507
00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:37.560
you know,

508
00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:40.460
all they do is just make it sound like it's a bad thing and then you all of a

509
00:30:40.461 --> 00:30:42.930
sudden you're just giving them money. That was probably a bad example,

510
00:30:42.931 --> 00:30:45.240
but you know what I mean? All right. Boll and branch, everybody.

513
00:30:53.841 --> 00:30:57.970
situation. That's getting a good night's sleep. A fucking ma'am.

514

I can tell you four days sober. I forgot what it's like to wake up and be like,

515
00:31:01.761 --> 00:31:04.670
you know what? I want some eggs. Whoa.

516
00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:09.050
A bullet branch was the rest you need wrapped up in there.

517

Um, what is it? One 48, one 49. There we go.

577
00:35:48.211 --> 00:35:52.950
Just change west coast time. And, uh, I'm in a great fucking mood.

578
00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.970
I'm not in the God damn airport. You know

580
00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:07.860
I'm, no, I haven't great mood. I'm actually in my apartment laying in my bed,

chilling the fuck out and uh,

582
00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:17.520

583
00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:21.060
Really? Bill, you had a fucked up week. Why is that? Well,

584
00:36:21.061 --> 00:36:23.340
I'm going to tell you, um,

585
00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:26.700
I've been making jokes over the last four months about me.

586
00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:32.640
I'm driving a dented hybrid and talking about how emasculating that is.

587
00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:33.503
You know,

588
00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:38.010
it's like already I'm driving a hybrid so I had to deal with everybody.

589
00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:41.820
Go and do what do you effect? You know what I mean?

590
00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:48.410
Suggesting that because I'm making the air a little bit cleaner that for some

591
00:36:48.601 --> 00:36:52.940
reason that on some level that means I want to suck a dick, which is a,

592
00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:57.030
it's very childish yet affective, yet effective.

593
00:36:57.450 --> 00:37:01.470
It's very hard in a group situation. One on one maybe can defend it,

594
00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:05.520
but in a group situation when somebody yells out, what are you effect?

595
00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:10.850
What ends up happening is that even guys who won in the social circle will start

596
00:37:10.891 --> 00:37:12.120
laughing and then it's like,

597
00:37:12.121 --> 00:37:17.121
you know you're fucked because people are laughing at the question of what are

598
00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:21.540
you saying? Like, if you suck Dick or whatever, you know,

599
00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:24.930
if you to start talking about, you know, how

600
00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:27.360
you know,

601
00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.660
how you're thinking about the environment that actually digs the hole deeper,

602
00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.020
you know, and the people like, well maybe, yeah, look at him.

603
00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:35.880
He's talking about the environment.

604
00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:41.760
Only people who are into the same sex, uh, are into the environment.

605
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:46.350
They know. It's funny actually about the hybrid is when I bought it a year ago,

606
00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:47.880
I got a ton of shit for it.

607
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:52.440
People made fun of the little tires and everything else, you know,

608
00:37:52.441 --> 00:37:56.040
but as gas prices have crept up,

609
00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:01.940
I feel like four 60 to four 70 out here in lost Congolese.

610
00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:08.610
Um, all of a sudden people are now coming up to me being like, so what's, uh,

611
00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:13.190
what's the deal with those cars? But they, uh, you know,

612
00:38:13.191 --> 00:38:16.850
and then they asked the usual dumb questions like, can they go up a hill?

613
00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.350
No, no, they can't. Fortunately,

614
00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:25.450
everywhere I want to go involves driving on a perfectly level surface,

615
00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:27.250
if not a little bit downhill.

616
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:32.430
And then I take the long way around and somehow I get back without having to go

617
00:38:32.441 --> 00:38:34.270
back up the hill. That just fucking drove down.

618
00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:38.800
It would've it sell it Goddamn car that doesn't go up the hill. You know,

619
00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:42.490
ask me that question. It was my mother. My mom asked me that.

620
00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:44.520
You went on a hybrid

621
00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.470
[inaudible] Hell No. Mom. I moved to Nebraska,

622
00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:55.180
moved to Nebraska. That's what I did. And it's funny,

623
00:38:55.270 --> 00:39:00.010
there's no hills in Nebraska, but there are tornadoes.

624
00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.930
Okay. Um, okay. This is what happened.

625
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:05.830
20 20th I drive around this fucking Dennett car. Oh, if you new to my page,

626
00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:09.670
this is the Monday morning podcast and I do one of these every single week.

627
00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.480
You know, people ask me questions, uh,

628
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:16.420
people send me information and uh, whatever.

629
00:39:16.421 --> 00:39:21.020
And I babble about my life while I hype upcoming gigs, like a,

630
00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:26.050
the fact that I'm going to be doing stand up on the guys' choice awards this

631
00:39:26.051 --> 00:39:26.890
Sunday night,

632
00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:31.840
June 22nd on spike TV guys, choice awards.

633
00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:36.870
I believe it comes on somewhere between eight at night and four in the morning.

634
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:41.080
No, I think it's 10 o'clock. I don't know when the fuck it is.

635
00:39:41.081 --> 00:39:44.350
If I was organized, I know that, but I did six minutes to stand up that they,

636
00:39:44.351 --> 00:39:48.960
I believe are going to whittle down to three minutes. And uh,

637
00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:52.690
I had a great time and they were a bunch of famous people there and I was

638
00:39:52.691 --> 00:39:56.770
jumping up and down like a girl scout inside, outside. I was playing it cool.

639
00:39:57.250 --> 00:40:00.550
Like, hey there a person who I've always admired. How are you? Yes.

640
00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:03.910
Nice to meet you too. And instead of like, Oh God,

641
00:40:03.911 --> 00:40:08.530
I can't believe I just shook their head. And they said, nice job. You're funny.

642
00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:13.840
It was a thrill. I had a great fucking time. Um,

643
00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:15.460
so I got that coming up. Oh,

644
00:40:15.461 --> 00:40:18.520
also this week I'm going to be at the punchline in Atlanta.

645
00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:21.700
One of my favorite clubs. See little, a great mood on it.

646
00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:24.370
What's the last week's podcast? That was not a good mood.

647
00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:27.490
That was me in an airport wanting to get the fuck out of there. Oh.

648
00:40:27.491 --> 00:40:31.150
And by the way, for those weekly listeners of my podcast, you know,

649
00:40:31.151 --> 00:40:35.050
I was going from Raleigh trying to get back to la because it's fucking Raleigh.

650
00:40:35.051 --> 00:40:36.220
There's no direct flight.

651
00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:41.230
I had to fly from Raleigh up to Cleveland and then from Cleveland to fucking La.

652
00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:44.530
Well, uh, my connecting my Raleigh to Cleveland,

653
00:40:44.531 --> 00:40:48.820
the flight was late because wind, if you remember. And when I,

654
00:40:48.821 --> 00:40:51.640
by the time I got to Cleveland, my flight to La had already left.

655
00:40:51.641 --> 00:40:56.641
So I'd have spent five fucking hours and the God damn Cleveland fucking airport

656
00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:00.010
we with, with, with, what was the, they gave me,

657
00:41:00.011 --> 00:41:05.011
they give me a $15 voucher to spend five hours in that fucking airport.

658
00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:10.240
And I was, uh, I did my usual, I flipped out a little bit. I was like 50 dude.

659
00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:14.920
And The lady's like, well, you know, I actually hooked you up. They usually, uh,

660
00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:19.720
I gave you the dinner voucher. The lunchtime voucher is only eight.

661
00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:22.323
You know,

662
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.960
that's one of those times you just want to reach out and cross and just grab

663
00:41:25.961 --> 00:41:28.030
someone by the throat, even though they didn't make the rule.

664
00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:30.040
Just to make you feel better and be like, bitch,

665
00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:33.380
you're not giving me fucking eat those fitness fucking airport for eight hours.

666
00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:36.570
All right, I want,

667
00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:41.600
I want one fucking 30 bucks and I want free Internet. That's what I want. Okay.

668
00:41:41.601 --> 00:41:45.830
I don't want some $50 voucher, so I go get a chicken sandwich with mushrooms.

669
00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:49.670
Oh Shit. Was that good? God Damn. And I had a good chicken sandwich in there.

670
00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:53.640
It all worked out. So anyways, this, this is uh,

671
00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:56.570
this is what happened this week. So anyways, so I've been driving around this,

672
00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:01.010
uh, my, uh, my hybrid, there was dented,

673
00:42:01.011 --> 00:42:05.750
it got dented initially cause some douchebag backed into me and I got that fixed

674
00:42:05.751 --> 00:42:10.280
immediately and then the next time it got dented it was cause my girlfriend,

675
00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:14.240
uh, yeah, I dunno, she misspoke in a parking way,

676
00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:17.780
put it that way and she fucking, I dunno what she did,

677
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:23.720
but it came home and it looked like fucking big foot had a pair of timberlands

678
00:42:23.721 --> 00:42:27.980
on and stomp the Goddamn quarter panel. So I've been driving around with that.

679
00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:33.470
Right. Was scrape marks on the side. It just, it just, you know,

680
00:42:33.471 --> 00:42:35.800
as a man, you don't want to have a car with a dentist.

681
00:42:35.801 --> 00:42:37.580
It just makes you feel like a fucking loser.

682
00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:42.170
Forget about the fact that it's a hybrid and it has those little fucking search

683
00:42:42.171 --> 00:42:44.840
roll up size tires. Okay.

684
00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:48.950
So I finally get the thing fixed after four months,

685
00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:53.120
you know, cause I want to make sure she learned how to parallel park, you know,

686
00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:57.680
for, she fucked the thing up again. So that's taken care of.

687
00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:02.600
So I get the Goddamn thing fixed. This is how excited I am.

688
00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:08.210
Fight. My girl comes to pick me up at the airport as I'm hugging her, right?

689
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:10.640
Like World War II ended.

690
00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:15.620
I'm looking over her shoulder looking to see that there's no dent in the car.

691
00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:16.910
And you know what I mean?

692
00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:20.990
It's almost like I was cheating on her in like an automotive kind of way.

693
00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:25.880
So I was excited. The fucking thing looked great. Everything was fantastic.

694
00:43:25.881 --> 00:43:29.600
And I drove this car. Tell us on Monday,

695
00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.820
Thursday I go over my management's office.

696
00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:36.110
I valet the fucking thing, one of those deals where, you know,

697
00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:40.970
I valet it but I park it cause there's a spot right there. I go to my lunch,

698
00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:44.660
I come back from lunch and there's a fucking dent in my car again.

699
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:48.220
The exact same spot, the exact same side.

700
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:51.890
So now it's the bumper and I swear to God,

701
00:43:51.891 --> 00:43:56.060
I never understood the expression I was beside myself.

702
00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:01.340
I never knew what the fuck that meant. But when in that moment I get it,

703
00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:04.640
it's some sort of out of body experience where I was just,

704
00:44:04.641 --> 00:44:06.320
I had to look at my driver's license.

705
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:11.150
So my license plate like seven times. I was like, there's no fucking way.

706
00:44:11.151 --> 00:44:14.740
That's my car is his campy, my car. And I didn't,

707
00:44:14.741 --> 00:44:18.500
it just kept looking down and it was with my fucking card.

708
00:44:18.501 --> 00:44:20.810
So then I look over at the valets,

709
00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:25.280
okay mind you within the exact same spot and they're not looking at me.

710
00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:30.170
This is all shit I put together afterwards. But I was so flustered.

711
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:35.000
I came up there and I was like, well the what happened to my car?

712
00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:38.330
I felt good voice went up like nine August. Oh, he's even mad.

713
00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.150
I was literally like, uh, I felt like I was going to fake.

714
00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:48.740
Let me see those old movies where they got some broad and you know,

715
00:44:48.741 --> 00:44:49.341
they get their,

716
00:44:49.341 --> 00:44:53.240
those dresses down to the floor that has like 52 layers of underwear underneath

717
00:44:53.241 --> 00:44:55.070
them. That's why I should've had all of those,

718
00:44:55.071 --> 00:44:58.850
a fucking hoop skirt and I should have just fainted with one of those little

719
00:44:58.851 --> 00:45:02.060
umbrellas that you spin around and it doesn't really keep the rain or the sun

720
00:45:02.061 --> 00:45:04.790
off you. It's just supposed to make you look more attractive.

721
00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:07.310
I should've been holding one of those and that's what I shouldn't,

722
00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:08.550
that's how flustered I was.

723
00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:13.270
So the fucking parking attendants are like, I'm like, well,

724
00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:17.070
you know what happened? Like car and they would just like, oh yeah. And all day,

725
00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:22.380
uh, somebody, uh, somebody hit hit it, somebody hit, I might,

726
00:45:22.381 --> 00:45:24.810
who hit it. I don't know that they,

727
00:45:24.811 --> 00:45:29.490
we backed it over there and somebody hit it and fucking did that that day.

728
00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:31.740
You know, everybody, every fucking word sounded like it started with a date.

729
00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:36.300
You know, so, um, I'm like,

730
00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:37.410
I can't fucking believe it.

731
00:45:37.411 --> 00:45:42.360
And then they gave me the sheet of paper to fill out, you know, right there.

732
00:45:42.361 --> 00:45:44.880
They should have told me that they fucking did it because if someone else hit

733
00:45:44.881 --> 00:45:47.790
me, first of all, if you saw the fucking dent in this car,

734
00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:51.150
there's no way these guys didn't hear it, you know?

735
00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:53.850
And they just automatically give me this form saying that they,

736
00:45:53.851 --> 00:45:58.290
I guess they're going to pay for it. So I'm filling the shit out.

737
00:45:58.291 --> 00:46:03.060
And it wasn't until I drove away that I started thinking about it.

738
00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:07.710
I had pulled over and I'm looking at the dent and it's the exact same shape as

739
00:46:07.711 --> 00:46:09.990
the polls in the garage.

740
00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:13.410
So obviously one of those fuckers

741
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:19.050
drove it into a pole and then after they drove and into a pole,

742
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:22.800
they stuck it back in the space where I, where I have left it

743
00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:25.740
and then tried to fucking,

744
00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:28.110
then they would look and down and I'm making eye contact.

745
00:46:28.111 --> 00:46:32.240
I think they were trying to hope that I didn't see it. Do you want to help?

746
00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:36.360
One of those fucking guys is one of my listeners every week. All right, dude,

747
00:46:36.361 --> 00:46:40.680
why don't you just fucking come clean and let me know you did it. Okay. I know.

748
00:46:40.681 --> 00:46:42.900
Like, cause you don't want to get fired, right? Is that what it is?

749
00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:47.690
I just can't fucking believe it, man. I just,

750
00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:51.550
it's so God damn depressing my fucking car. It's got another God. Damn.

751
00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:54.300
I just got to fix four days. I drove around for four days.

752
00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:57.540
I don't understand it. You know what I mean?

753
00:46:57.541 --> 00:47:00.270
It's not like when my car didn't have a dent in it,

754
00:47:00.271 --> 00:47:03.230
I started driving around and making fun of people who had dents in their cars.

755
00:47:03.231 --> 00:47:05.280
So there was some sort of fucking calmer going on.

756
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:09.580
Why didn't deserve to not have a dented fucking car? So,

757
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:15.450
so that's it. Now it's unreal, man.

758
00:47:15.451 --> 00:47:18.020
I can't have a car, doesn't have a fucking [inaudible]. And uh,

759
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:21.550
I really wish I didn't tell this story because I started off in a great mood.

760
00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:24.270
And as you can tell by my tone, I'm not in such a great mood anymore.

761
00:47:24.271 --> 00:47:26.880
It's just really fucking, man. I'll tell you what's extra frustrating.

762
00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:31.460
They give me this piece of paper or some lady's on it and they're like, yeah,

763
00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:36.430
yeah, she doesn't call you in the next five days. Give me a call.

764
00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:40.660
And like I said, I was so beside myself. I said, okay.

765
00:47:40.661 --> 00:47:42.940
And it wasn't until day three I was like, wait a minute,

766
00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:46.150
somebody doesn't call me in the next five days.

767
00:47:46.151 --> 00:47:51.010
How about the next five fucking minutes? Fucking idiot. You ruined my car.

768
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:53.410
Or this phantom lady ruined it.

769
00:47:53.411 --> 00:47:56.590
And then you got in it in it for some fucking reason to put it back in the same

770
00:47:56.591 --> 00:48:00.790
spot. You five put two inch fucking jackass.

771
00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:04.440
I just, Ah, maybe that's why he put it.

772
00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:07.150
Then it gave his c over the fucking steering wheel.

773
00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:12.520
I listened back to last week's podcast and I just really felt like,

774
00:48:12.521 --> 00:48:15.730
I sounded like I was too, God damn upset on it and it was too depressing.

775
00:48:15.731 --> 00:48:20.380
So I tried to start this one off and try to stay focused in a good mood and then

776
00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:23.350
look what happened for them.

777
00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:26.260
Had 13 minutes in and I'm already flipping out again. I just, you know,

778
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:28.301
anybody else?

779
00:48:28.301 --> 00:48:31.360
Anybody else got any fucking stories out there like that they can make me feel

780
00:48:31.361 --> 00:48:33.570
better. Maybe I could read to some of the listeners. I'm like,

781
00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:34.570
I want to hear some of your,

782
00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:40.380
I fixed my car or I just bought a brand new car and then some fucking contacts.

783
00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:46.150
Jesus. No, no, no. I'm dropping the seabird. All right, let, let's,

784
00:48:46.151 --> 00:48:48.880
let's get back to my dates here. Okay. Um, so that's the deal.

785
00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:55.180
I have a dental hybrid. Again, you know, let's think of some positive shit.

786
00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:59.470
The Celtics won one game, like they had two out in la,

787
00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:03.240
one of the greatest comebacks ever. And uh,

788
00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:06.490
they get to one Boston that's hopefully gonna win it.

789
00:49:06.491 --> 00:49:10.690
I actually went to game three, Celtics lost that one,

790
00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:14.230
but I was still on some to go to the, uh, go to the finals,

791
00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:19.210
but I gotta admit man or the referees were, uh, they were little,

792
00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:20.230
they were crazy.

793
00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:24.490
The amount of foul that was the game right after Phil Jackson was complaining.

794
00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:29.230
Remember that game too when they called 56 files on the Lakers and like three on

795
00:49:29.231 --> 00:49:33.460
the Celtics don't eat, bitched about it. And I think the referees get pissed.

796
00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:36.760
But kind of knew we was right. So they,

797
00:49:36.761 --> 00:49:39.640
they were like calling a ton on the Celtics,

798
00:49:39.850 --> 00:49:44.400
but they also kind of go and fuck you Phil Jackson, we're still running shit.

799
00:49:44.401 --> 00:49:48.070
So they still called a bunch on the Lakers and I don't think the ball went up

800
00:49:48.071 --> 00:49:51.220
and down the court three times without them blowing the whistle.

801
00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:55.830
Like there was never any sort of like slow to the game and it kind of sucked as

802
00:49:55.831 --> 00:49:59.320
a fan because they kept cock blocking the excitement.

803
00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:03.690
Even when the Lakers were going on and run, you know, even as a self extends,

804
00:50:03.691 --> 00:50:04.690
sitting there was pretty, you know,

805
00:50:04.691 --> 00:50:07.870
it was cool to see them going bananas and feeling like I was at a finals.

806
00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:11.470
But every time they'd start to go nuts, they'd call some ticky tech file.

807
00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:15.160
And then the other way when they would start getting quiet and I'd start

808
00:50:15.161 --> 00:50:19.380
standing up talking shit, they, they call another bullshit once.

809
00:50:19.381 --> 00:50:22.750
So I don't, I don't know what the fuck they're doing,

810
00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:25.960
but in the last night's game, I thought the officiating was really weird.

811
00:50:25.961 --> 00:50:28.070
It was like the beginning of the game. Like, all right,

812
00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:29.173
they going to let him play.

813
00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:32.750
They will let them mug each other and then all of a sudden they start calling.

814
00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:37.590
They just picky tech. It's not consistent that I'm inconsistent. Plus we lost.

815
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:42.320
So I'm probably a little cunty too. Um, but anyways, uh, here we go.

816
00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:45.620
Punchline in Atlanta this week, uh,

817
00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:47.570
from June 19th to the 21st.

818
00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:50.690
This is one of my favorite gigs and I absolutely loved going to that club.

819
00:50:50.691 --> 00:50:54.110
It's just an old school club. If you live anywhere near there, please come down.

820
00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:56.960
I've got a brand new hour and I also have a solution to the, uh,

821
00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:00.750
the gas problem. I really do something that would be effective, uh,

822
00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:05.000
very effective. If, uh, did I say effective, very effective, effective

823
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:10.090
within eat. Now we're going a ASTEC did like it. Uh, you know what,

824
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:14.150
that's one of those things, I never know the difference, the effect or effect.

825
00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:16.940
I might have to look that up. Um, all right.

826
00:51:16.941 --> 00:51:21.790
And then July I'm going to be at the Improv and put spark from, uh,

827
00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:25.000
July 10th through 13th. Then, uh,

828
00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:30.080
the next Gig I have and after that is July 31st through August the fuck is it?

829
00:51:31.221 --> 00:51:34.010
Hang on. Hang on. The pages, there's going to be at the comedy works.

830
00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:38.060
That's what it is. The comedy works in Denver, Colorado from August. I mean,

831
00:51:38.061 --> 00:51:41.810
July 31st or 30th.

832
00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:46.100
I already turned the page for less fucking day in July through, uh,

833
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:52.070
Saturday, August 2nd. Nice. No Sunday. Gotta love that. Yeah.

834
00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:56.150
There's 31 days in July. 31 days have November,

835
00:51:56.151 --> 00:52:00.750
except for September and Friday. Honestly,

836
00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:03.980
I want to go. All right. Um, do I have anything else? The Heights.

837
00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:08.990
I think that's pretty much it. Uh, podcast questions.

838
00:52:08.991 --> 00:52:11.180
All of a sudden, nobody's asked me podcast questions.

839
00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:12.740
Is that what happened last two weeks?

840
00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:16.280
I didn't answer any questions to now you guys, you can't ask me any.

841
00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:21.290
I got a question for you. Where the fuck are all the questions? Are you over it?

842
00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:26.630
Um, I don't know what. Okay. I think it's time to wrap this fucking thing up.

843
00:52:26.631 --> 00:52:29.420
What the hell was I just looking up? Oh, effect

844
00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:32.143
aspect.

845
00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:36.620
I'm trying to teach you guys something effect and effect you like how I don't

846
00:52:36.621 --> 00:52:40.340
know the difference and I'm going to act like I'm teaching you.

847
00:52:40.341 --> 00:52:42.200
Which of these sentences are correct.

848
00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:46.070
Rising oil prices will have an effect on nearly everyone.

849
00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:49.140
That's correct. With any right.

850
00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:53.300
Why don't you just give me the fucking definition. I hate when they do this.

851
00:52:55.090 --> 00:52:58.730
Their emotional outbreak first was purely for effect.

852
00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:02.510
You know, wait a minute. All of these sentences correctly.

853
00:53:02.511 --> 00:53:06.920
Employee effect and effect. And in most situations we use effect as a noun,

854
00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:11.030
an effect as a verb. Well, what the fuck do they mean?

855
00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:13.820
How about giving me a definition first? You know what? This is like,

856
00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:18.290
this is like how they, I was taught Algebra, you know what I mean?

857
00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:24.280
Like everything would math up until eighth grade for me anyways,

858
00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:26.360
was numbers. If you fucking Asian,

859
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:28.500
I'm sure you were doing calculus in the third grade,

860
00:53:28.570 --> 00:53:32.450
but let's just stick with your random fucking stupid American here. All right.

861
00:53:33.130 --> 00:53:35.940
[inaudible] right up to eighth grade. It was all fucking numbers.

862
00:53:35.941 --> 00:53:38.760
Then all of a sudden ninth grade comes around and they throw the fucking

863
00:53:38.761 --> 00:53:42.900
alphabet in there and there was no sort of, before they go in, you know,

864
00:53:42.901 --> 00:53:46.020
little little speech like, Hey, this is going to be a little different.

865
00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:50.970
The dude just started doing it. He just started throwing, you know,

866
00:53:50.971 --> 00:53:55.410
foil first outside, inside last, uh, you know, the, all that,

867
00:53:55.411 --> 00:53:59.120
all that high school math opposite angles are congruent and none of his shit may

868
00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:02.010
, and you just, you just repeated it like you were in a cult.

869
00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.980
They just stand up. They opposite angles are congruent.

870
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:06.570
Opposite angles are congruent.

871
00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:10.140
Nobody had any idea what the fuck they was and they just had a triangle on the

872
00:54:10.141 --> 00:54:12.750
board. That's what this website is like.

873
00:54:13.530 --> 00:54:16.720
Get it right online.com. Uh,

874
00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:19.650
there's no fucking definition.

875
00:54:22.290 --> 00:54:26.760
All of these flyers correctly. Webster's code, this fucking thing.

876
00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:30.630
All right. Hey, is this exciting? Is this an exciting podcast?

877
00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:34.500
As I attempt to fucking look up God damn word and fail miserably.

878
00:54:35.970 --> 00:54:37.320
Affect effect.

879
00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:43.320
Cause you guys do this shit at work and death admission. You know,

880
00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:46.710
you try to look up like Robbie Knievel and try to guess what year he's here.

881
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:48.960
He was born. All right, here we go.

882
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:52.860
Affect definition of effect

883
00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:58.440
to have an influence or effect or a change in,

884
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:03.570
you know what? Fuck this word. Okay, forget it. You know what I mean?

885
00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:09.030
That's like the difference between a truck and a car and the definition of car.

886
00:55:09.031 --> 00:55:12.290
They describe it as a fucking truck. You know what?

887
00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:14.970
Sometimes you got to cut your losses and you got to realize that you're not

888
00:55:14.971 --> 00:55:17.970
going to know some things in life. So that's just one of them, you know?

889
00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:21.360
All right, what does this podcast,

890
00:55:21.361 --> 00:55:25.970
this is just been spam for the last three minutes. I apologize. Um, you know,

891
00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:29.340
I just had to eat. You know what?

892
00:55:29.341 --> 00:55:32.250
I should actually turn this into a contest and say I'm going to give out,

893
00:55:32.310 --> 00:55:36.810
give you a free 100 DVDs. If you could guess what the fuck I just ate,

894
00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:41.100
cause you'll never guess what it was. Think of the most, okay.

895
00:55:41.101 --> 00:55:45.000
I'm going to give you a hint and you can all play along at home.

896
00:55:45.610 --> 00:55:49.680
All right? This is something, it's a dessert.

897
00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:56.480
It's a something that they used to have creepy commercials about with a high

898
00:55:57.180 --> 00:56:00.480
pitch voice and you put it in the freezer.

899
00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:06.630
Three answer in two. One,

900
00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:09.810
I actually just had a slice of cookie posts.

901
00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:16.760
There's no way to say that without fucking laughing.

902
00:56:16.770 --> 00:56:20.160
I just had a piece of cookie Puss, ice cream cake,

903
00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:23.070
whatever the fuck you call it. It's ice cream and cake. Just like effect and,

904
00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:27.160
and effect. They're the same thing. Fucking incestuous.

905
00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:30.580
And you, I gotta tell you something. If you've never had it,

906
00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:35.110
it's just as disgusting as it sounds. You know what I mean?

907
00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:39.700
Some things are just named perfectly and cookie posts. It just what it is.

908
00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:40.031
It says,

909
00:56:40.031 --> 00:56:45.031
stank rank slutty ass fucking disgusting cake.

910
00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:50.500
Like if, if, uh, who's the right whore to pick up?

911
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:55.330
It's gonna say a Paris Hilton was a cake. She wouldn't be,

912
00:56:56.440 --> 00:57:01.150
she'd be like a fucking blow pop. Sorry. Uh, I don't fucking know.

913
00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:03.820
All right, whatever. My sugar levels up to the fucking roof.

914
00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:06.360
Why do I have up God damn fucking ice cream cake?

915
00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:11.580
Cause I turned 40 last Tuesday on gym on Sunday.

916
00:57:12.010 --> 00:57:14.620
That's the way I was dying. I rejoined, I'm like fuck this.

917
00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:18.490
I turned 40 on Tuesday. Let me let me bang out 500 setups.

918
00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:21.760
The last 500 steps to being 39 years old.

919
00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:27.160
Um Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty fucking brutal.

920
00:57:27.161 --> 00:57:29.560
But I'll tell you something and somebody shows up. You know you have a party,

921
00:57:29.570 --> 00:57:31.390
a place and somebody shows up with a cookie posts,

922
00:57:31.391 --> 00:57:35.260
ice cream and you know it's not that bad. Not because you eat it,

923
00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:37.610
it tastes good. You're more thinking like, well you know, maybe I,

924
00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:40.630
if I was addicted to sweets I'd eat, eaten his fucking horse shit every day.

925
00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:45.250
All right. Did we learn anything this week? Yes we did.

926
00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:49.390
We're going to learn that bill burns is going to be on the fucking, the a,

927
00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:54.580
that's like guy's choice awards this Sunday at a,

928
00:57:55.090 --> 00:57:58.760
somewhere between eight and 4:00 AM on Spike TV and a,

929
00:57:58.770 --> 00:58:03.190
I am going to be at the punch line in Atlanta and a, I don't know,

930
00:58:03.191 --> 00:58:08.191
the definition of effect and effect and a cookie puss.

931
00:58:08.441 --> 00:58:13.330
Ice Cream tastes like a tastes like Eskimo.

932
00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:16.720
Uh, yeah, you went down on a fucking Eskimo hooker.

933
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:24.490
It's really fucking, it's, it's just, it's fucking awful.

934
00:58:25.690 --> 00:58:27.880
Let me see if I can just, first of all, some Carville,

935
00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:32.450
it's got a big green fucking ice cream nose with a Conan.

936
00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:35.740
And I just can't imagine like you ever see those people that are so fat that

937
00:58:35.741 --> 00:58:39.610
like fucking bedridden. This is the kind of shit that they eat.

938
00:58:40.930 --> 00:58:43.540
Cause you know, everybody's out of shape. I'm fucking out of shape right now.

939
00:58:43.541 --> 00:58:45.490
You know what I mean? Everybody wants, you get tests dirty.

940
00:58:45.590 --> 00:58:47.830
You got a fucking gun. Nobody looks good without this shirt on.

941
00:58:48.490 --> 00:58:51.430
It's everybody stopped whining on that fucking biggest loser. Okay.

942
00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:56.770
No one looks good to put your client. Okay. But, uh,

943
00:58:56.830 --> 00:58:59.350
those people who get so big that they're just fucking dead written,

944
00:58:59.351 --> 00:59:01.150
you really have to go out of your way.

945
00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:06.840
You have to go above and fucking beyond to get that big,

946
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:11.020
you know what I mean? They were [inaudible] slow metabolism.

947
00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:14.950
Fuck you and your fucking metabolism. No, you don't.

948
00:59:14.951 --> 00:59:19.780
You are eating cookie posts nightly, nightly basis.

949
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:21.380
I had just had a snack. What you have,

950
00:59:21.381 --> 00:59:26.381
I had cookie plus all fucking 3000 fucking calories a slice.

951
00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:30.740
Damn. We kill them. That's how I like to fucking end it.

952
00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:34.010
I like to attack the bedridden and that's it.

953
00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:37.970
That's the Monday morning podcast app. Please, uh, re up with the questions.

954
00:59:37.971 --> 00:59:39.530
I swear to God, I'll read them.

955
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:43.160
I will answer them next week and somebody please give me a fucking definition

956
00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:48.320
the difference between effect and effect, because, you know, I, I, you know,

957
00:59:48.321 --> 00:59:51.200
I looked it up and they use the definition of the other word and the fucking

958
00:59:51.201 --> 00:59:54.860
definition, which is annoying. All right. Um, that is it. Uh,

959
00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:59.550
thanks. Everybody came up to me to see my show in Raleigh, North Carolina.

960
00:59:59.650 --> 01:00:02.680
It's the most disjointed fucking podcast ever. Um,

961
01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:05.180
did I use that word correctly? Um,

962
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:09.640
in Raleigh and I'm Caroline's, um,

963
01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:11.640
I'm adding a bunch of new dates coming up.

964
01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:15.660
I got a date coming up with the stress factor in New Jersey. Uh,

965
01:00:15.661 --> 01:00:17.880
I got to college, Umass Amherst.

966
01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:23.010
I'm going to be adding that date shortly. Uh, what else? What else?

967
01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:26.560
I Dunno. Sometime in August, the beginning of September.

968
01:00:26.561 --> 01:00:29.560
So look for those dates and anything else.

969
01:00:29.561 --> 01:00:34.000
Just go to [inaudible] dot com and, um, and that's it. All right.

970
01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:37.190
I'm tapping out. I'm talking to that next week after week. Correct.

971
01:00:37.590 --> 01:00:39.440
<v 2>Too much walking shoes.</v>
