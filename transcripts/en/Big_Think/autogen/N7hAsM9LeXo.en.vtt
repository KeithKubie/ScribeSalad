the earth will destroy all of that so we

take that information and duplicate it

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009
take that information and duplicate it
 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.679
take that information and duplicate it
off the planet such that if anything

able to implement this so those are some
 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.010
able to implement this so those are some
of the reasons to uplift society and to

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020
of the reasons to uplift society and to
 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.440
of the reasons to uplift society and to
back up the biosphere and the third and

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450
back up the biosphere and the third and
 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.920
back up the biosphere and the third and
final reason is its

in our genome we are as humans exploring
species you know we began the plains of

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750
species you know we began the plains of
 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.100
species you know we began the plains of
Africa and our need to explore that took

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110
Africa and our need to explore that took
 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.830
Africa and our need to explore that took
us into Europe into Asia across the

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840
us into Europe into Asia across the
 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.800
us into Europe into Asia across the
Straits into the Americas and so forth

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810
Straits into the Americas and so forth
 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.770
Straits into the Americas and so forth
that drive to explore is resident in our

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780
that drive to explore is resident in our
 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.229
that drive to explore is resident in our
DNA in fact it's genetically if you

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239
DNA in fact it's genetically if you
 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.240
DNA in fact it's genetically if you
would select it for because those who

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250
would select it for because those who
 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.819
would select it for because those who
explore and move out the widest and

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829
explore and move out the widest and
 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.670
explore and move out the widest and
farthest have the least chance of having

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680

you know destroyed by a local accident

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640
you know destroyed by a local accident
 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.099
you know destroyed by a local accident
and so that is a evolutionary imperative

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109
and so that is a evolutionary imperative
 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.170
and so that is a evolutionary imperative
we're not going to stop here on planet

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180
we're not going to stop here on planet
 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.509
we're not going to stop here on planet
Earth we're going to move out to other

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519
Earth we're going to move out to other
 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.930
Earth we're going to move out to other
planetary bodies and not I believe not

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940
planetary bodies and not I believe not
 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.970

going into the planetary you know

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980
going into the planetary you know
 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.339
going into the planetary you know
gravitational wells will build societies

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349
gravitational wells will build societies
 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.520
gravitational wells will build societies
and in you know one'll like spheres and

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530
and in you know one'll like spheres and
 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.229
and in you know one'll like spheres and
and humanity will move out into the

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239
and humanity will move out into the
 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.140
and humanity will move out into the
cosmos and probably meet other societies

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150
cosmos and probably meet other societies
 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.300

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.540
 
something very interesting has happened

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550
something very interesting has happened
 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.650
something very interesting has happened
over the last hundred years that people

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660
over the last hundred years that people
 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.930
over the last hundred years that people
don't think about which is that the

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940
don't think about which is that the
 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.690
don't think about which is that the
frontiers that we have have started to

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700
frontiers that we have have started to
 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.910
frontiers that we have have started to
shrink and disappear it used to be that

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920
shrink and disappear it used to be that
 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.020
shrink and disappear it used to be that
a hundred or 150 years ago if you

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030
a hundred or 150 years ago if you
 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.449
a hundred or 150 years ago if you
screwed up you know you up

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459
screwed up you know you up
 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.170
screwed up you know you up
literally in one area you're you could

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180
literally in one area you're you could
 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.840
literally in one area you're you could
go and start again someplace new you

go and start again someplace new you
 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.040
go and start again someplace new you
could go and and start your life again

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050
could go and and start your life again
 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.760
could go and and start your life again
without the stigma of what happened

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770
without the stigma of what happened
 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.080
without the stigma of what happened
there's no place you can do that again

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090
there's no place you can do that again
 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.350
there's no place you can do that again
there's no real frontiers so that

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360
there's no real frontiers so that
 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.420
there's no real frontiers so that
ability the second thing about frontiers

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430
ability the second thing about frontiers
 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.210
ability the second thing about frontiers
are it allows the individuals who are
