TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hey, y'all.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.830
How are you doing?

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.700
God, I'll tell you, it's not
every day I get to deliver a

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.119
speech like this to
a packed house.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.720
But everybody out there on the
internet, you're really

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.500
missing out.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.870
This is "Get More From the
Google+ Platform." Hi, I'm

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.570
Timothy Jordan.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.770
I will be your developer
advocate

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.040
for the next 60 minutes.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.420
Let's just jump right in.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.730
There are three things that
I want to talk about.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.009
The first is implementation;
second, optimization; and

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.680
third is measurement.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.350
And it's these three steps sort
of provide a foundation

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.400
for doing more with
most things.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.090
But I'm going to go specifically
through how to

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.770
get more from the Google+
Platform.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.890
And the idea is to get more
engagement from your users,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.190
and to get more in value out of
that engagement at any one

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.440
of those steps.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.270
Let's start with implement.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.170
So I'm going to give you a
survey of some of the things

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.860
that you probably already
know about, and maybe

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.740
a couple new things.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.860
First off, the easiest way to
implement the Google+ Platform

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.730
is to start with one
of our plugins.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.450
We have a +1 button, which is
about letting visitors quickly

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.340
recommend your brand
and your content.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.340
A Share button, which is an easy
way for people to share

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.370
content with their circles.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.280
And it's particularly useful
when the +1 button doesn't

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.810
make sense.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.380
For example, if you don't want
users to make a public action,

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.980
you want to give them
the option to just

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.260
make a private action.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.850
Also sometimes, you
want that verb.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.100
You want the verb "share"
within your UI.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.860
And then, of course,
the badge there.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.005
And the badge has a +1 button.

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:48.800
It also has a link to your
Google+ page and the ability

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.730
for users to add the page to
their circles right from your

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.960
site, without having to leave
and go to Google+.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.590
And of course, the +1 and the
Share, whether they're on the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.050
badge, or standalone,
all drive social

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.300
annotations in search.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.930
And we just announced, a few
days ago, recommendations on

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.580
the +1 button.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.740
How many of you all
have seen this?

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.280
Cool.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.780
It's neat.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.420
I mean, now you hover over
the button, and you get

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.780
recommendations for other
content on that same site.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.330
It's giving the user
more value while

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.210
they're on your site.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.740
And it's great for
interlinking.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.850
We all know recommended content
is great for user

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.490
engagement and continued
capture.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.620
So those are the plugins.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.190
And remember, the plugins
are the place to start.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.760
And the next step about
implementation I want to talk

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.580
about is putting the pieces
together, connecting the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.200
things that you've already
implemented.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.530
The table stakes here are
the identity on Google+.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.490
That's your Google+ page,
and linking that

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.960
identity from your site.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.610
That's something like the badge
or another link code

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.430
that's invisible on your page.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.140
And then finally, making all of
that drive more clicks on

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.650
the ads that you're already
serving with AdWords.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.190
And all of this centers around
your site and your brand.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.140
And the goal is to make it a
single entity wherever Google

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.730
refers to it and uses it.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.086
So starting with the
Google+ page.

00:03:24.086 --> 00:03:27.500
The Google+ page is all about
just getting your identity on

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.860
Google and giving you the
ability to interact with your

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:37.100
audience in that personal,
Google+ way, with Circles,

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.740
with rich posts, with
conversations, with Hangouts.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.280
Now on the page, you'll notice,
right there at the

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.140
bottom, is this little
website.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.345
And this is great, because users
can go to your profile

00:03:51.345 --> 00:03:53.100
and then click on that and
then go to your site.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.370
But it's also a signal
to Google.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.420
It's important to fill this out
because then Google knows

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.400
that the owner of this Plus page
has claimed that site as

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.960
the same entity.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.730
That's step one.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.010
And that's the website address
that, again, connects that

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.650
page to the site.

00:04:15.458 --> 00:04:20.640
The next step is to claim the
Google+ page from your site.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.960
And this creates a bidirectional
link.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.360
So we have from the page to your
site, and then back from

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.270
your site to the page.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.570
And then we can know, with
confidence, that both sides of

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.310
this equation agree, these
are the same entity.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.530
Now, claiming that on your site
is as easy as adding the

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.020
Google+ badge.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.950
And you get the benefits of that
+1, and the Follow button

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.830
right there on the page.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.060
However, if you don't have room
for that on your home

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.600
page, or you want to link
it another way,

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.220
you can always add.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.450
Right down the bottom
here, you'll

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.600
see a link rel publisher.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.530
And that links to your
Google+ page as well.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.120
All right, the last step here is
if you're using AdWords to

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.700
enable what we call
social extensions.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.590
And what it does, is it makes
it so the +1's on your ads

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.730
share the same bucket of +1's
for that entity that I've been

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.270
talking about, which
is your brand.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.710
And the cool thing about this,
it's really easy, too.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.790
You'll notice the dialog
box there.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.300
That's in your AdWords
management console.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.870
You just go in there, add
in the Google+ page ID.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.850
And now we know that that's
all the same entity.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.570
And as I was going to say, the
cool plus about this, if you

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.940
have more +1's, that's more
opportunity for social

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.740
annotations.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.200
Which means, I see on an ad that
my friend Will Norris has

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.020
+1'd this product, and I'm more
likely to click on it.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.190
In fact, on average, you're 5%
to 10% more likely to click on

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.810
it, which as far as a CTR
lift, is pretty big.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.180
All right, so we've
talked about

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.220
plugins, getting started.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.310
And we've talked about
connections, making that all

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.720
have a little bit more value.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.370
Let's go into some higher-order
features here,

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.420
starting with Hangouts.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.090
Now, once we launched Google+,
and people started using

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.630
Hangouts out there in the world,
we knew something that

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.080
we thought was going to be
cool was really cool.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.520
What people are starting
to do with

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.870
Hangouts is really amazing.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.470
Here you see President Obama in
a Hangout, connecting with

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:38.760
American citizens.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.680
Like that kind of discourse
is new, and absolutely

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.380
incredible.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.800
But in addition to this sort
of front porch of the

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.460
internet, if you will, are the
ability to write your own

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:55.540
applications that users can play
with, can do work with,

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.350
with each other at
the same time.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:03.070
Now,, there is a talk that
you should check out at

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.040
Google I/O this year.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.840
It's "The Next Generation of
Social is in a Hangout."

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.050
Follow that link, you'll be
able to see the video and

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.230
check out the slides.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.680
But some quick notes.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.800
There's three main things.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.570
One, it's easy integration
of video chat.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.080
Once you make the app, video
chat just comes along for the

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.910
ride, it's baked in.

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.340
Simple APIs make your app real
time, so that people can

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:33.100
actually collaborate in this
application together, and the

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.700
ability to make it fun with
effects, face tracking and

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.550
video effects to make it more
of a joyful experience,

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.620
whether it's for work
or just for play.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:49.130
And there's some examples on
this screen of really cool

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:49.960
Hangout apps.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.810
And if you go to our demo
stations, you'll see some

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:55.510
really great Hangout apps
that people have built.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.200
And there's a lot of
interactivity, and there's

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.350
some really fun nuance
in there.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:03.170
But getting started is so
much easier than that.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.240
You don't have to build
a full application.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.970
All you have to do is put your
content in a Hangout.

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.690
And I want to show you
what this looks like.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.880
OK, so I have an example site.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.010
And you'll notice that it
is not the prettiest

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.160
thing in the world.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.130
That was on purpose.

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:22.200
It's so that you can take
a look at the code.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.160
And I'll give you
this URL later.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.770
It's so that you can see these
things implemented in a

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.080
relatively clean environment.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.250
I mean, I did add four shades
of gray, though.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.630
So I hope it's a little
interesting.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.070
I'm going to show you
this site, which is

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.179
Random World Photos.

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:41.610
And all it's doing is taking
some images from a Picasa

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.900
album on my account, and putting
them on the homepage.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.170
And then when I click
into them, I see a

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.500
one-up of that image.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.490
But I've also integrated the
Google+ platform throughout.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.860
So you can see all the little
bits and pieces and how the

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.300
connections work together,
one of which is

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.180
this Hangout button.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.465
And I wrote a Hangout app.

00:08:59.465 --> 00:09:01.730
And it took me about
10 minutes.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:05.960
All this Hangout app does is
start a Hangout with my

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.380
content in it.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.010
And in this case, it's
just a simple image.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.340
But you can imagine the content
on your site there.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.020
It could be a simple image.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.160
And that's interesting
and engaging.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.130
Or it could be a video, or it
could be a live stream with

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:26.380
stats on the side.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.610
So you see, here's this image.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.340
And it was just on that
page of the site.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.640
And now I'm in a Hangout,
spending time with my friends,

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.320
talking about this.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.420
In this case, it's just a photo
I took out of a plane

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:42.980
while I was waiting
to take off.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.490
But again, what if it
were your content?

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.580
What if it were breaking news?

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:51.040
And you just made this all
possible with, as you'll see

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.010
in just a moment, a
few lines of code.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:01.622
So first off, here is the
link to the Hangout.

00:10:01.622 --> 00:10:04.820
It's just an href that
includes a URL

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.340
with the data encoded.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.380
You'll notice, right up here,
it says, gd equals.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.530
And then I'm using some template
syntax to put in the

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:14.050
Hangout data.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:19.586
In this case, I'm adding in
the URL to the image.

00:10:19.586 --> 00:10:22.010
Now, you do want to be careful
of this data because it's

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:23.810
being sort of passed around
the internet.

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.810
And if somebody were to
intercept it and modify it,

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:28.530
then that could make it not the
Hangout experience that

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:29.360
you had intended.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.490
So you just want to make sure
that when that data comes in,

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:32.160
that you verify it.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.345
And there's a number of
different ways that

00:10:33.345 --> 00:10:34.380
you could do that.

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.080
You could pull out the domain
and then insert your own

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.870
domain, just make sure it's
coming from the right place,

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.120
for example.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:45.010
So this will grab the image from
our server, display that

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.510
button that when you click on
it, starts a Hangout, sending

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:48.450
in that data.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:52.560
Now, the Hangout itself is first
defined by an XML file.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.760
You'll notice in this XML
file a few things.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.030
Right up at the top, we have
different features.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.990
We have a title.

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:03.100
And then we're including the
Hangouts JavaScript.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.830
Again, this is just really
a little bit of code.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:08.610
And I copied and pasted this
from our documentation.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:11.680
Now, this part here, this URL
application code, I added in a

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.070
couple things.

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:14.710
This is all you really
need to do.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:19.370
I've got app data, where
I'm grabbing the app

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.500
data using the API.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.420
And then I'm setting an image.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.020
Now, down here below the script
tags, I would just put

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.920
in a tag for the image.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.281
And that's just inserting
that.

00:11:31.281 --> 00:11:34.420
So it's really three custom
lines of code to get my

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.650
content into a Hangout for a
full video chat experience

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:40.300
with people, my audience,
connecting over my content in

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.740
this new space.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.270
Pretty cool, right?

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:45.750
But then where you
go from that--

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.950
that's where you start-- where
you go from that gets even

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:51.280
more exciting, adding in that
interactivity, using those

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.380
effects APIs, doing something
real time and collaborative is

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.120
where you get even more power
out of the Hangout.

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:03.630
Next thing is the Google+
History API.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:08.470
Now, we just announced this this
week at Google I/O. And

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:11.720
it's an early developer
preview.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.290
So it's not available
for users yet.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:16.050
But it is available for
developers to start testing

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:18.220
and playing with and giving
us some feedback before we

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.010
release it to all users.

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:21.830
And this is the thing.

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:24.990
It's pretty much like
Instant Upload,

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:26.240
but for almost anything.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:33.476
And who here is familiar
with Instant Upload?

00:12:33.476 --> 00:12:35.380
Oh, there's still a few
people that aren't.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.940
OK, this is how it works.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.000
I have my phone.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.480
I turn on Instant Upload.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:43.510
Now every time I take a photo,
it gets uploaded in the

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:47.020
background to my Google+
account, to a private album.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:48.850
So it's just for me.

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:52.270
I log in to Google+, and I see
all the photos I've taken that

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:53.940
day, that week, that
year, ever since I

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:54.920
turned on Instant Upload.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.880
So it's cool.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.710
Like, it's a safety thing
if I lose my phone.

00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:59.910
But then it's also a
nostalgia thing.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:02.090
I can go there, and just sort
of review all my photos,

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:03.690
whenever I want to.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:07.980
And then finally, I can share
really easily, if I want.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.370
I'm not going to share
all my photos.

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:10.860
But there's going to be a few
I want to share with my

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.090
friends circle, or
with public.

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:16.570
Google+ History is about making
that happen for a

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:18.030
user's activities online.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:26.510
And the key thing here is for
that user to have the ability

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:30.510
to privately save their moments
into Google+ History,

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:34.260
and then optionally share
when they want.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.010
Now, I'm giving a few talks
about this at Google I/O. If

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:40.700
it's of interest to you,
please check those out.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.225
But let me give you a quick
overview of how it works.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:50.650
First off, this is
the general path.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:55.900
Get something, an activity that
the user performs online,

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.725
into Google+ History
as a moment.

00:13:59.725 --> 00:14:02.190
And the user's history will be
filled with these moments.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.650
And they're all just
for them, private.

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:08.170
And then when they want to, they
can share that activity

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.400
with their friends, their
family, their public,

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.410
however they want.

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.180
There's a few steps just
getting started.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.930
First, you set up your
application.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:20.000
Second, you authorize
the user.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.210
And third, you write moments.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:24.190
And these are using technologies
you're already

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:25.430
familiar with.

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:27.330
First off is the APIs Console.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.320
Who's familiar with
the APIs Console?

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.085
Heard about it at Google I/O?

00:14:31.085 --> 00:14:31.540
Oh.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:34.250
For a few of you that aren't,
this is just a website at

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:37.620
developers.google.com/console,
where you define your

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.730
application, add the services,
like Google+ and Google+

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.010
History, that you want.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:45.670
And then you can get something
like a client ID.

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:52.000
You then use that client ID to
start the OAuth process.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.050
Your user will be presented
with a permission screen.

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:01.730
They add the permissions, get
directed back to your site,

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.270
and then you write moments.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.740
And you use a RESTful
API to do that.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.450
Essentially, you send a JSON
payload to this RESTful

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.520
endpoint that includes
a type--

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.790
the activity that was
performed, like a

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:15.550
comment or a listen--

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:18.040
and the target URL, which
is the activity that was

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:22.850
performed on like a blog
post, or the song.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:25.540
And then finally, a result,
If there is a result.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.110
So in the case of a comment, it
would be the comment that

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:29.360
you actually wrote.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.500
Now, for writing moments,
again, just to take you

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:42.520
through that flow here we did
the write step, sending that

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.000
JSON payload.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.790
But then there's this next
step of fetching.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:52.490
Now, once Google gets the target
URL, it'll grab that

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:55.170
target URL and try
to determine what

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:56.420
that page is about.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.990
Who here is familiar with
microdata markup?

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:04.550
Just a couple, OK.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:07.190
This is really interesting and,
I think, increasingly

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:10.420
important for all publishers
to know about.

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:15.760
Microdata markup, it's in the
HTML5 spec, so it'll validate.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.740
And then Schema.org uses
microdata markup with its own

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:24.400
types and item properties to
give your web page some

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.290
intelligence.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:30.110
Without markup, a machine
reading your web page will

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:31.380
read a bunch of content.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:35.140
But with the markup, you get
to tell that robot exactly

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.560
what your page is about, what
item it represents, of what

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.430
type, and what are the primary
properties it should use to

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:43.430
represent that item.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:46.890
And in the case of Google+
History, we'll use those to

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:51.970
render a moment and, if the
user shares, a post that

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:56.043
include a rich image and the
title that you specify and a

00:16:56.043 --> 00:17:00.140
link that you specify
back to the item.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:03.320
And it turns out, Schema.org
markup is good for other

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:03.930
things as well.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:06.430
In fact, it is the markup of
choice of all three major

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:09.990
search engines, both Yahoo
and Bing and Google.

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:16.069
So that's Google+ History.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:19.210
It's all about giving your
users the ability to save

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:21.609
their moments privately, and
optionally share them with

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:23.465
whom they want.

00:17:23.465 --> 00:17:25.270
Now, let's talk about mobile.

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.970
Now, we just had a mobile
session in here.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:31.960
And if you want more information
about that, please

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.910
check out that session.

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:36.910
Francis and Julia go into a
lot of detail about what's

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:38.210
available for Google+.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.500
I'll give you a quick
overview.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.990
The Sign In button.

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:44.480
And this is something that's
also in developer preview,

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.020
that we released with the
Google+ History API, that

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.190
initiates the OAuth flow.

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:51.450
It's a button on your
page that we render.

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:52.520
You just set up some
attributes.

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.590
The user clicks on it, and
it starts that flow

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:56.695
automatically.

00:17:56.695 --> 00:17:59.600
It makes it really easy to
get going with the API.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.120
And it also does cool things
like login, and

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.770
cross platform identity.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:08.140
And it's available
soon on mobile.

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:08.760
Widgets.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.940
We've got the +1 and the
Share available.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.935
And then, of course, the History
API is available, too,

00:18:15.935 --> 00:18:18.680
so that users can save their
moments, not just from their

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.060
web activity, but also
from their mobile

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.310
app activity as well.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.160
And again, that session,
"Integrating Google Into

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.640
Mobile Apps," with Julia and
Francis, is available online.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.630
All right, let's look at a
couple more things on this

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:40.125
example site before
we move on.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:47.420
I just wanted to point out some
of the things here that

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.350
I'm going to talk more about.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:51.010
First off, we've got the badge
right up at the top.

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:52.820
And the badge comes in
two different sizes.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.360
There's the bigger size that
includes a +1 button at the

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.980
bottom, or the one without.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:58.370
I've chosen the one without.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:59.150
You can make it dark.

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:00.320
You can make it light.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.180
There's a little bit of
flexibility here for fitting

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.900
this into your page.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.750
The +1 buttons, you'll
notice that I have

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:07.970
multiple ones on the page.

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.490
With the +1 button, you
can just sprinkle

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:11.680
these as you would.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.710
It makes sense to have them on
leaf nodes, so they're the

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:17.150
representative of
a single item.

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:20.290
But you can also add them on
categories, to +1 that

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:24.610
category, or in a listing, so
that all those items, you can

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:27.140
+1 those before going into them,
if you just want to.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.945
I can +1 these previews
of the image.

00:19:29.945 --> 00:19:34.020
I don't have to go into
the image to +1 it.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.780
I've also included on here
inline annotations.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:40.310
So if people knew about this
website before today, they

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:43.050
would have +1'd here, and I
would see faces and names of

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:44.300
the photos that people like.

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:52.060
And when I click in, you'll see,
again, the +1 button and

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.050
the Hangout.

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:55.870
Now, if I were to +1 this,
which I'll do in another

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:58.720
example in a moment, you'll
notice it's highlighted here.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.830
I go back to the home page,
highlighted there as well.

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:04.970
It's the same entity because
it's specified by the URL,

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:06.190
which is this.

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:08.540
This is the URL for this item.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:12.260
We'll come back to this
in a few minutes.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.350
So that's implementation.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:15.830
It's a survey of a lot of our
platform elements and how they

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:18.980
work together, really
emphasizing the connections

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.480
between those things.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.890
And a couple of the higher-order
stuff, like

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:27.710
Hangouts, and Google+ History,
and Mobile, which actually

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:30.460
have really accessible entry
points, but you can go pretty

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.540
far with them.

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.070
So for optimizing, there's
a few things I

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.080
want to talk about.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.330
First off is that Schema.org
markup.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:39.370
I talked about it
a little bit.

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:41.280
I want to give some
more detail.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.800
And again, rendering the moment
or a post for Google+

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.920
History API is good.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.713
But this Schema.org markup works
for everything that you

00:20:48.713 --> 00:20:49.660
share on Google+.

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:55.040
So if a user grabs your URL and
pastes it in, we're going

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.360
to retrieve that page and look
for the same Schema.org markup

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:02.600
as if we do for History, or if
they share from the +1 button,

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.200
or when we're looking
to render rich

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.480
snippets on Google Search.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.910
Now we'll look for other
markup styles as well.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:13.990
Schema.org works the best
in this case, we think.

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:15.610
So we're going to look
for that first.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:18.680
If we can't find it, we're then
going to look for Open

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.765
Graph markup.

00:21:19.765 --> 00:21:22.690
If we can't find Open Graph
markup, we're going to look

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:24.480
for meta tags.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.400
And if we can't find that, we'll
make our best guess.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.140
Now, working up from the bottom,
our best guess, we're

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.910
pretty good guessers.

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:34.860
But given the choice, I would
imagine that you'd want to

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:38.326
specify how you look, rather
than have us guess.

00:21:38.326 --> 00:21:41.465
Because for meta tags, you
can't do an image.

00:21:41.465 --> 00:21:43.940
You can only do the title
and the description.

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:46.220
And they work pretty well, and
you can put them in the head.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.590
But having that visual
component, we find, is really

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:52.988
powerful for having engaging
posts on Google+.

00:21:52.988 --> 00:21:54.940
All right, so let's
look at what this

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.740
appears like in code.

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.940
Here is some Schema.org
markup.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.200
Now, this is just a
body section with

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.880
not very much content.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.530
I just want you to focus
on the markup here.

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:07.420
And it's these items.

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.030
So for those of you that
weren't familiar with

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:11.950
microdata markup, it's
essentially data that we put

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:15.010
inside the tag.

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:17.680
So there's these attributes,
item scope and item type.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.070
You put that on the parent
tag to specify,

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:22.870
that's the whole item.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:27.120
The item type's value is the
actual type from Schema.org

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.390
that you're specifying.

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:29.870
Now, there's some generic
types, and

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:31.440
some specific types.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.210
You could make everything
a thing.

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:37.000
But then, the whole world knows
less about your site.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.430
It can't put more intelligence
into it.

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:44.080
So by specifying, in this
case, a product, we get

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.290
additional attributes
that are very

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:48.780
product-specific that we can add.

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.970
Now, I've just included the
sort of generic attributes

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:53.140
that you'll always
want to include.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.720
And those are name, image,
and description.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.620
The name you'll see as the
title on that post.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.680
The image is the thumbnail
that you'll see.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.480
And the description is, of
course, that description below

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.730
both of those.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:10.640
Now there's Open Graph.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.230
And you'll see we have a
title, an image, and a

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:14.200
description.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.200
And there's also the meta tag.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.990
And you see the title
and the description.

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:25.580
Looking at this in a page, which
I think is always really

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:29.850
interesting, you'll see that
there's all sorts of content,

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:32.500
and then there's just these
highlights throughout that

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.710
represent the structured
markup.

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:38.570
Key takeaway here is
that first, the

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:41.080
user doesn't see it.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.060
Whether you have the structured
markup or not, it

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:44.430
doesn't change the appearance
of your

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:46.970
web page in the browser.

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:51.470
Also, you don't have
to add any content.

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:54.670
Most likely, the content that
you would want to mark up is

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:56.090
already on your page.

00:23:56.090 --> 00:24:01.400
You just have to indicate
what's already there.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.450
And then finally, to reiterate,
adding the

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:05.980
structured markup to your
page makes it more

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:07.565
than just a web page.

00:24:07.565 --> 00:24:11.160
It's adding this intelligence
that Google and other search

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:15.590
engines and Google+ can all
use to represent your page

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.620
with more clarity.

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.650
All right, so that's
structured markup.

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:23.190
Next up is speed.

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.990
I like that.

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:25.450
You want to see that again?

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:27.422
Really fast buttons.

00:24:27.422 --> 00:24:29.730
[CHUCKLES]

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:35.210
So my friend John and Malte did
a session about this, "How

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:37.740
we Make JavaScript Widgets
Scream." And it's really

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:40.310
interesting, all the little
things they've done to make

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:43.090
these buttons appear as fast
as possible on the site.

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:46.620
And it's something that we're
always working on.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.500
So in general, any
implementation you do should

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:50.440
have a fast button.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.520
And it should get faster over
time, the better we get at it.

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:57.610
But if you want the specific,
fastest implementation, I

00:24:57.610 --> 00:25:01.170
asked John, and he told
me this is it.

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:02.940
You'll notice a couple
quick things.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:06.300
First off, we have the
script tag, right up

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:07.330
there at the top.

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:11.190
And it's including parsetags
explicit.

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:14.960
That means, this script is not
going to walk the DOM and look

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.670
for script tags.

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:19.120
It's going to wait until we
tell it exactly where to

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:25.530
render a button, which we do
right after the script tag.

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:28.060
Now, you would probably put
these at the bottom of your

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:31.536
body, but you could include them
right after the last tag

00:25:31.536 --> 00:25:33.615
where you want to see
a button as well.

00:25:36.712 --> 00:25:41.140
Now this gapi.plusone.render
method will allow you to

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:42.570
specify an ID.

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:45.980
That's the ID of the element
that you want to

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.450
replace with a button.

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:51.230
And then a JSON parameter bag.

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:53.380
And in this case, I'm
specifying an inline

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:54.360
annotation.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.190
But any of the attributes on
the button you can include

00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:58.440
here as parameters.

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:02.250
And then you'll see
these are the ID.

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:04.900
It just sort of links up with
that DIV tag at the top.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:06.740
And of course, the annotation
is what gives

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:09.900
us this nice thing.

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.510
And let's just see that
in a template.

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:13.880
It looks a little
bit like this.

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:21.100
I'm showing a couple different
template examples.

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.320
And the idea is that with just
a couple changes, if you have

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.110
templating in place, you can
affect thousands of pages

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:28.000
across your site.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.260
In this case, even if I have
tons of buttons on a page--

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.260
and this is simply the code for
the example site that I

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.130
showed you--

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:36.840
I can still specify each one
of those buttons with the

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.610
render function.

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:39.490
That's why they show up so
quickly on that site.

00:26:42.605 --> 00:26:44.590
All right, so that's speed.

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:46.080
The next is user experience.

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.720
And there's just a couple
notes here.

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:53.560
I talk to publishers a lot.

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:57.870
And one of the questions I get
frequently is, how do I put

00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:00.950
the buttons on my page so that
users will use them?

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:03.980
And I usually ask them, well,
it's like, I don't know.

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:06.480
You guys should experiment
with this.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:10.240
But over time, we found that
there are at least two things

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.990
that are sort of obvious, but
let's just codify them, that

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:14.080
will get more clicks.

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.220
One of them is prominence.

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:20.010
If you hide the buttons away,
they're not going to get

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:20.820
clicked on as much.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:22.380
It's sort of obvious.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.650
But it's specific
to your site.

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:28.530
For some sites, it makes sense
to have it at the bottom

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:31.950
because everybody always reads
the whole article.

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:36.030
You have a really long bounce
time, which means people are

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:39.560
spending time on that page, and
they're scrolling down.

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.360
For other sites, a lot of users
might just be reading

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:48.360
the title or the paragraph, or
whatever the user behavior is.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.760
Maybe they're more likely
to click at the

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.980
top or at the bottom.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:55.020
But having that correct
prominence for your site is

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.230
what's essential.

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:58.530
The next thing is grouping.

00:27:58.530 --> 00:27:59.650
This is sort of obvious.

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:02.660
It's that social actions are
very familiar with each other.

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:06.006
You put them together so users
know where to go to click.

00:28:06.006 --> 00:28:08.690
And here's an example on the
New York Times website.

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:11.150
And you'll see, right up at the
top of the article there,

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:15.240
we have those social actions so
that users on the Times can

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.240
share this right away.

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.070
I also wanted to show an
example from Time.

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:23.330
Again, this is right
below the headline

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:25.300
and before the article.

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.300
And what you'll notice that
these two sites is you go to

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:30.130
article to article to article,
and it's very predictable

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:31.395
where those buttons are.

00:28:31.395 --> 00:28:33.360
And they're always
easy to find.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.760
They're always near
each other.

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.660
So I would switch back to the
site, but we already saw this.

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:49.780
Remember, the +1 button is
next to each image, very

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:50.730
predictable where that is.

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:54.245
And when you go to the actual
image page, the +1 button and

00:28:54.245 --> 00:28:56.050
the Hangout are right
there together, the

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:57.300
same on all the pages.

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:11.390
Oh, you know what?

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:15.130
There's one more other thing
I'd like to show you too,

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:16.390
before we move on.

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:19.390
So I told you I was going to
+1 something in a moment.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:21.056
Let's do that right now.

00:29:21.056 --> 00:29:23.090
And you'll notice, a couple
things happen.

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:25.110
On this site, something happens
that happens on every

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.520
other site.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.010
The Share box comes up.

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:29.000
You +1 something, you
get a Share box.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.180
Another thing happened, which
is, I think, pretty obvious,

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:33.700
is that we got a big red border
around the image.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:35.720
Sort of a silly thing to do.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.530
But I'm demonstrating
a signal here.

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:39.660
And that signal is, when
the user clicks on

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:42.440
it, something happens.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:46.670
And something happens on your
site, not just on Google.

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:50.170
These social annotations are
important, because when I +1

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:52.530
something, Will may see that
later and be like, oh,

00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:53.150
Timothy +1'd that.

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:54.470
That's important.

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:56.540
But making them important
on your site,

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.810
too, is really helpful.

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:01.270
In this case, on this particular
site, you'll see

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:04.660
that red border around the
image on the image page.

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:08.280
And now, when I go back to the
landing page, all the images

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.640
I've +1'd have this
red border.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.760
So this signal has indicated
to me my favorite

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.010
images on this site.

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:16.780
And what else could
you do with this?

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:20.610
Aside from just indicating to
the user or thanking them, you

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:22.200
could keep track of what
they're +1ing.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.370
And you could recommend, at
the moment of the click,

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:26.240
alternate content.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.800
Hey, you +1'd this hat.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.110
Here are three other hat
similar that you might

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:32.980
want to check out.

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:37.250
You can do that based on that
action with just, again, a few

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:38.500
lines of code.

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:43.510
And it looks like this.

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:49.820
I put this code together, again,
in the render function

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:54.250
so you could see the callback
in context of, again, using

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:55.660
that render function to
get them to render

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:58.041
really, really fast.

00:30:58.041 --> 00:31:00.420
And it's just this
item right here.

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:04.520
I'm specifying the +1 callback
identifier as a function in

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.840
the global JavaScript namespace
that should be

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:10.060
called when the user clicks
the +1 button.

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.490
I just threw it in the
parameter bag.

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:14.890
Remember where I specified
inline annotations earlier?

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:17.366
Same thing.

00:31:17.366 --> 00:31:20.340
And I need to make sure to
define that function, again,

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:23.540
in the global JavaScript
namespace of the page.

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:25.100
Here it is, +1 callback.

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:30.090
And it receives a parameter
that I'm calling data.

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:35.480
And the first thing I do on this
particular site is I get

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.900
the ID of the photo, which
I'm actually just

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:40.870
pulling from the URL.

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:43.340
I then set a cookie.

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:52.480
And then finally, if
the state is on--

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.150
oh, it's yellow here, I
changed it to red--

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:58.730
but either way, I'm setting
a border on the image.

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:00.890
And if it's off, I'm removing
that border.

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:15.130
And then finally, when I
render these buttons--

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:18.120
just coming back to the code
you saw a few frames ago,

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:21.890
you'll notice this code
down here as well--

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:24.970
is if the cookie was
set to on, I

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:28.280
render that border again.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.940
Now, the border is,
again, just sort

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:31.440
of an example signal.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.560
So you can see the functionality
of this, and so

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:35.280
it can get your ideas flowing.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:38.650
But also, so it makes it
easy to implement.

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:42.170
But what else could you do on
your particular site that

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:44.970
makes it really valuable for
the user on your site that

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:46.220
they +1 something?

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:51.090
OK.

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:52.650
So we've done implement.

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:55.350
We've done optimize.

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:56.875
Let's now talk about
measurement.

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:03.640
So you can measure the value
of the +1 button and how

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:07.650
people are using it using
Google Analytics.

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:10.520
And you can also do it using
Webmaster Tools.

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:18.430
Now, Google Analytics will show
you engagement on these

00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:19.950
buttons and who's
clicking what.

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:22.190
And Webmaster Tools will give
you some really cool things,

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:24.960
like the +1's on your site,
understanding them a bit more,

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.296
and the CTR uplift.

00:33:27.296 --> 00:33:29.220
But of course, this is
a developer talk.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:31.860
So I want to talk a little bit
about our own code, and to

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:35.320
mention that you can write
custom analytics.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:38.030
In this particular case, I'm
using the +1 button.

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:41.760
Now remember, the +1 button has
a callback, which I can

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.280
use to drive my own analytics
on my own site.

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:52.730
And that's what this
is right here.

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:56.080
This +1'd function is getting
called when the user clicks on

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.400
the +1 button.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:01.670
And then, if it's on, I'm
sending a signal to my custom

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:03.240
analytics that it was a +1.

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:06.670
And if it's off, I'm sending a
signal to my analytics that it

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:10.160
was un+1'd, if you will.

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:12.994
It's pretty neat, right?

00:34:12.994 --> 00:34:17.219
All right, so when I was putting
this together, I

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:19.159
thought, well, what else could I
do that was kind of fun that

00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:20.199
used the API?

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:24.650
Now this is not a robust
analytics solution.

00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:26.800
I wouldn't say, deploy this
at your organization.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:30.280
But it does demonstrate how easy
it is to use the API to

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:33.100
get a little bit of data out of
Google so that you can make

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:36.530
the experience better on
your Google+ page.

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:39.659
You'll notice, on every
post that you make,

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:42.610
there's these numbers.

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:47.090
There's the +1's, there's
the reshares.

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:48.929
There's also the number
of comments, if

00:34:48.929 --> 00:34:51.360
you count them up.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:54.540
And that gives you an idea of
how users are engaging with

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:57.420
the content that you publish
from that Google+ page.

00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:59.810
+1's are that me too action.

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:02.140
It's very easy for users to add
that when they feel some

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:03.850
sort of affinity.

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:06.140
Reshares are that viral reach.

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:08.340
The more of those you have, the
more places your content

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:12.110
is getting, the more groups
are seeing it.

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:17.570
And then comments, those are
your direct interaction with

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:19.950
your content.

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:23.390
And all of this is available
in the API.

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:26.400
So if what you wanted to do
was sort of improve your

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.780
posting over time, you
could just pay

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:29.820
attention to these numbers.

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:32.390
And for fun, I threw it
into an app script.

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:34.180
So it looks like this.

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:38.030
There's a spreadsheet that pulls
the API and fills out a

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:41.700
bunch of information based
on the posts I've made.

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:42.950
And it gives me some graphs.

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:48.210
And it looks like this.

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:50.850
Here's the app script itself.

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:53.810
And this is all sort of
spreadsheet information,

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:55.760
except for this one thing.

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:03.810
We get the feed of
all of my posts

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:07.050
using this fetch request.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:10.375
And then the rest is really
just parsing.

00:36:10.375 --> 00:36:12.290
I'm going to show you what
that looks like for fun.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:18.060
All right, so this is
the spreadsheet.

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.570
And you'll see that it has a
URL to all of my things.

00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:22.880
And I've gone here, and
I've categorized them.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.500
And then it sets automatically
the +1's,

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.140
comments, and reshares.

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:30.310
And you can see, I can get a
summary of all that data.

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:32.070
And I make my own graphs.

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:36.040
And this is all because of
some simple app script.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:39.490
Now again, this is
not a robust or

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:42.930
dependable analytic system.

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:44.690
You wouldn't want to build
a business on this.

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:48.140
But it's really a great
place to start.

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:51.830
If you're already doing things
with the Google+ API, if

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:54.870
you're already working with this
stuff, you could use this

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:57.440
data in that product.

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.890
But the spreadsheet was fun.

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:01.270
And I'll give you that code as
well if you ask me on Google+.

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:08.220
So just to recap.

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:11.010
There are these three
big things.

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:15.750
This is implementation,
adding items your page

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:17.510
and connecting them.

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:23.920
There's this optimization,
getting them to be faster,

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:27.220
putting things in
the right place.

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:30.240
There's this measurement,
knowing what is working and

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.270
what's not.

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:33.040
If you put the button
at the top, are you

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.870
getting more +1's?

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:36.265
Or if you put it at the
bottom, are you

00:37:36.265 --> 00:37:38.980
getting more +1's?

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:40.850
And then, of course, there's
always this last

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:42.710
step, which is repeat.

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:44.890
We're always adding
functionality that you can

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:51.580
insert on an implement phase and
using your measurement to

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:55.010
really hit that optimization
phase again and again, until

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:56.670
you're getting the most value
out of each of these

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:59.242
components.

00:37:59.242 --> 00:38:00.450
And that's it.

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:02.100
Thank you so much.

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:09.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:11.230
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Do we
have any questions?

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:14.560
Oh, and I should mention
this as well.

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.130
I always forget to.

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:17.100
If you liked this talk, please
put one of these in those

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:19.325
boxes back there, +1's.

00:38:19.325 --> 00:38:20.620
It's like a real life +1.

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:23.740
Isn't that neat?

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:25.400
So please, questions.

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.760
AUDIENCE: You showed putting the
border around images when

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:30.460
someone +1's on that device.

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:33.450
Is there a way to keep that
border when they visit your

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:35.840
site on another device,
where just a

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.740
cookie wouldn't do that?

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:38.460
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So that's
a great question.

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:41.010
In this case, I've implemented
that persistent

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:42.020
data using a cookie.

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:44.162
So the user has to be on the
same browser, has to be the

00:38:44.162 --> 00:38:46.700
same user, can only get
it from that domain.

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:48.570
But obviously, if I was going
to persist this data over a

00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:51.490
long time, I'd want something
more robust in my own database

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:52.990
that I'm submitting that to.

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:55.250
And of course, you could use
that on multiple devices.

00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:58.240
And to take that one step
further, if you're using the

00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:01.860
Sign In button, you've got the
user's identity from Google+,

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:05.170
and you can use that correlate
that across multiple devices,

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:08.840
because that's available
soon on Mobile as well.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:11.760
AUDIENCE: So once the user is
authorized, then the data will

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.960
include the user identity
as well?

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:16.990
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So the
authorization process, once

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:19.860
the user grants access, and you
get that callback, you get

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.180
their Google+ ID.

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:22.730
Then it's up to you to
store that data.

00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:23.430
AUDIENCE: You store
it to the session.

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:24.160
OK, got it.

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:25.196
Yeah.

00:39:25.196 --> 00:39:29.660
Question I have, the Open Graph
tags or microtagging,

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:31.180
how often is it updated?

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:36.140
Let's say I +1 the URL,
and one week later,

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:37.800
I change the title.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.300
What will be the
effect of that?

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:40.950
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So that's
a great question.

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:44.330
When we fetch that page, we
respect the cache headers that

00:39:44.330 --> 00:39:45.330
you're setting.

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:48.200
So as soon as that cache
expires, if a user creates a

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.640
new post, we will
refetch that.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:53.830
AUDIENCE: And essentially, the
user post will change?

00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:56.450
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So if a user's
already made a post, that post

00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:58.460
does not change, but
new posts do.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.310
All right, because you wouldn't
want to pull the rug

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:01.710
under the user

00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:02.240
AUDIENCE: Why not?

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:02.985
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Or change
the content.

00:40:02.985 --> 00:40:04.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:07.110
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well, the reason
is because, and we

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:08.830
believe really strongly in this
at Google, is you don't

00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:09.830
want to surprise the user.

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:10.220
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I know.

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:10.825
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah, you know.

00:40:10.825 --> 00:40:13.570
OK.

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:16.360
Any other questions?

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:16.910
Well, OK.

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:18.520
Thank you so much for coming.

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:25.288
[APPLAUSE]
