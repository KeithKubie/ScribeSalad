00:00:00.419 --> 00:00:02.823
- [Voiceover] Metal-air
cells need to be lightweight

00:00:02.823 --> 00:00:04.622
for many applications.

00:00:04.622 --> 00:00:08.698
In order to transfer more
electrons with a smaller mass,

00:00:08.698 --> 00:00:11.127
sodium and calcium

00:00:11.127 --> 00:00:14.181
are investigated as potential anodes.

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:16.967
A 1.0 gram anode

00:00:16.967 --> 00:00:19.277
of anode of which of, (laughs)

00:00:19.277 --> 00:00:22.167
A 1.0 grm anode of which of these metals

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:24.497
would transfer more electrons,

00:00:24.497 --> 00:00:27.474
assuming that the anode
is totally consumed

00:00:27.474 --> 00:00:30.246
during the lifetime of a cell?

00:00:30.246 --> 00:00:32.963
Justify your answer with calculations.

00:00:32.963 --> 00:00:35.563
So let's go to the top

00:00:35.563 --> 00:00:39.262
where they showed the reactions

00:00:39.262 --> 00:00:41.316
involving sodium and calcium.

00:00:41.316 --> 00:00:42.746
And actually, let me
just copy and paste this

00:00:42.746 --> 00:00:45.986
so it's easier for me to
reference near the bottom,

00:00:45.986 --> 00:00:48.494
where we're actually doing the question.

00:00:48.494 --> 00:00:51.013
So let me just copy this.

00:00:51.013 --> 00:00:54.647
And then let's paste it down here,

00:00:54.647 --> 00:00:57.777
that I can reference it.

00:00:57.777 --> 00:01:00.944
Okay, I'll even make
it a little bit smaller

00:01:00.944 --> 00:01:03.948
just so I don't take up
too much much real estate.

00:01:03.948 --> 00:01:06.498
And so the reactions that we care about

00:01:06.498 --> 00:01:08.534
are actually going to go
in the reverse direction

00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:10.437
of these half-reactions.

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:13.931
Remember, when we looked
at our power source

00:01:13.931 --> 00:01:15.777
right over here,

00:01:15.777 --> 00:01:17.147
this first half-reaction

00:01:17.147 --> 00:01:19.831
is what produces the hydroxide ions.

00:01:19.831 --> 00:01:23.791
The hydroxide ions migrate
their way to the left-hand side.

00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:25.575
And then they perform,

00:01:25.575 --> 00:01:29.581
then they are involved in oxidizing,

00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:33.123
in oxidizing whatever metal you have here.

00:01:33.123 --> 00:01:34.180
If this was zinc,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.804
the hydroxide combines with the zinc.

00:01:36.804 --> 00:01:38.429
They're going to oxidize the zinc.

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:40.124
And those extra electrons

00:01:40.124 --> 00:01:41.669
that are released in that reaction,

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:44.119
those are the ones that are
going to travel across the wire

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:45.778
and provide the current.

00:01:45.778 --> 00:01:46.986
But the hydroxide,

00:01:46.986 --> 00:01:48.449
it could react with sodium,

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:49.749
if this metal is sodium.

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:51.247
It could react with calcium,

00:01:51.247 --> 00:01:52.268
if this metal is calcium.

00:01:52.268 --> 00:01:53.580
So the reactions we care about

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.738
are going from this side, the right side,

00:01:56.738 --> 00:01:58.944
to the left side.

00:01:58.944 --> 00:02:01.603
And so, let me just rewrite that again.

00:02:01.603 --> 00:02:03.671
And actually, just the act
of rewriting it will help,

00:02:03.671 --> 00:02:04.367
will,

00:02:04.367 --> 00:02:06.352
my pen has been having trouble,

00:02:06.352 --> 00:02:07.714
is having trouble,

00:02:07.714 --> 00:02:09.153
actually scrolling down.

00:02:09.153 --> 00:02:10.314
But just the act of rewriting it

00:02:10.314 --> 00:02:13.878
will help with digesting what's going on.

00:02:13.878 --> 00:02:15.772
So the sodium reaction.

00:02:15.772 --> 00:02:19.395
For every two molecules of sodium,

00:02:19.395 --> 00:02:20.114
it's solid,

00:02:20.114 --> 00:02:21.937
it's actually forming our anode,

00:02:21.937 --> 00:02:25.657
plus two molecules of hydroxide,

00:02:26.537 --> 00:02:29.067
dissolved in the water, aqueous solution,

00:02:29.067 --> 00:02:31.883
we are going to yield

00:02:31.883 --> 00:02:36.845
sodium oxide,

00:02:36.845 --> 00:02:39.218
a solid version of that,

00:02:39.218 --> 00:02:43.559
plus water in the liquid state,

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:45.404
and plus two electrons.

00:02:45.404 --> 00:02:46.326
And this is really important

00:02:46.326 --> 00:02:47.477
'cause we wanna think

00:02:47.477 --> 00:02:50.663
about one gram of each of these metals.

00:02:50.663 --> 00:02:53.367
How many electrons would they yield?

00:02:53.367 --> 00:02:54.144
How many electrons

00:02:54.144 --> 00:02:58.393
are they going to be
able to transfer through,

00:02:58.393 --> 00:02:59.426
potentially through,

00:02:59.426 --> 00:03:00.285
that wire?

00:03:00.285 --> 00:03:02.302
So that's the first relationship up there.

00:03:02.302 --> 00:03:04.346
And then, actually, let me
just leave the sodium there.

00:03:04.346 --> 00:03:06.308
And then let me do the calcium over here.

00:03:06.308 --> 00:03:07.945
And remember, we wanna go
from the right to the left,

00:03:07.945 --> 00:03:09.685
so let me rewrite it that way.

00:03:09.685 --> 00:03:12.599
Calcium, a solid state,

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.179
plus two hydroxides,

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:18.617
dissolved in water,

00:03:18.617 --> 00:03:23.617
is going to yield calcium oxide, solid,

00:03:23.631 --> 00:03:27.046
plus liquid water, liquid,

00:03:27.046 --> 00:03:30.308
plus two electrons.

00:03:30.308 --> 00:03:30.833
So, once again,

00:03:30.833 --> 00:03:33.345
I just rewrote each of these
in the opposite direction.

00:03:33.345 --> 00:03:35.143
And, if I wanna write the voltage,

00:03:35.143 --> 00:03:36.443
I would flip the sign now,

00:03:36.443 --> 00:03:39.183
'cause I have written them
in the other direction.

00:03:39.183 --> 00:03:40.681
But they're not asking
us about the voltage.

00:03:40.681 --> 00:03:43.361
They want us to know a one gram anode

00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:44.317
of which of these metals

00:03:44.317 --> 00:03:46.358
would transfer more electrons?

00:03:46.358 --> 00:03:48.484
So if we think about sodium,

00:03:48.484 --> 00:03:50.503
the case with sodium,

00:03:50.503 --> 00:03:53.569
we have 1.0 grams,

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.234
1.0 grams of sodium.

00:03:58.234 --> 00:04:02.640
Well, let's think about how
many moles of sodium that is.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.426
Well, that's going to be,

00:04:04.426 --> 00:04:05.228
well let's see.

00:04:05.228 --> 00:04:06.701
We're going to have,

00:04:06.701 --> 00:04:09.581
we could look up sodium

00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:11.452
on our Periodic Table of Elements.

00:04:11.452 --> 00:04:12.232
And this is actually the one

00:04:12.232 --> 00:04:15.240
that they give you when
you take the AP Test.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.620
And you see sodium right over here.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.477
We could read its atomic weight,

00:04:19.477 --> 00:04:21.915
sometimes now called relative atomic mass.

00:04:21.915 --> 00:04:22.966
And that's the weighted average

00:04:22.966 --> 00:04:25.190
of the atomic masses of the isotopes

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.129
that you would typically
find of sodium on Earth,

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:28.750
if you just took a
random sample of sodium,

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.691
and you were, average their atomic masses,

00:04:30.691 --> 00:04:33.362
it would be 22.99.

00:04:33.362 --> 00:04:35.382
So that tells us that a mole of sodium

00:04:35.382 --> 00:04:36.293
is going to weigh,

00:04:36.293 --> 00:04:40.521
is going to have a mass of 22.99 grams.

00:04:41.611 --> 00:04:44.391
Or you could say,

00:04:44.391 --> 00:04:47.840
so a mole is going to,

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.974
a mole is going to have
a mass of 22.99 grams.

00:04:51.974 --> 00:04:54.871
So I could write one mole,

00:04:54.871 --> 00:04:57.650
one mole of sodium

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.094
is going to have a mass

00:05:00.094 --> 00:05:04.436
of 22.99 grams.

00:05:04.436 --> 00:05:06.758
And of course, this is
still talking about sodium.

00:05:06.758 --> 00:05:07.951
And so I made sure

00:05:07.951 --> 00:05:10.483
that I have it in terms of moles per gram,

00:05:10.483 --> 00:05:12.201
because when you do our
dimensional analysis,

00:05:12.201 --> 00:05:13.934
grams divided by grams,

00:05:13.934 --> 00:05:15.783
or grams of sodium divided
by grams of sodium,

00:05:15.783 --> 00:05:16.758
they're gonna cancel out,

00:05:16.758 --> 00:05:18.779
and I'm gonna be left
with moles of sodium.

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:20.088
So this part of the expression,

00:05:20.088 --> 00:05:21.169
this is gonna give me

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.735
how many moles of sodium
we are dealing with

00:05:23.735 --> 00:05:25.988
if I have one gram of sodium.

00:05:25.988 --> 00:05:29.169
But we need to think
about how many electrons,

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:30.490
how many electrons

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.410
are we going to be able to transfer?

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.978
And that's where we actually
have to look at this reaction.

00:05:36.978 --> 00:05:38.992
So for every two,

00:05:38.992 --> 00:05:42.811
for every two moles of sodium,

00:05:42.811 --> 00:05:47.202
we are going to transfer
two moles of electrons.

00:05:47.202 --> 00:05:48.721
Or another way you can think about it is

00:05:48.721 --> 00:05:50.114
for every mole that,

00:05:50.114 --> 00:05:51.832
here you have a two to two relationship,

00:05:51.832 --> 00:05:53.988
or you could say for every mole of sodium,

00:05:53.988 --> 00:05:56.949
we are going to transfer
one mole of electrons.

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:58.109
And so let's do that.

00:05:58.109 --> 00:06:01.986
We're gonna transfer one mole,

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:03.796
one mole of,

00:06:03.796 --> 00:06:06.002
let me write it this way.

00:06:06.002 --> 00:06:10.382
One mole of electrons

00:06:10.382 --> 00:06:15.382
per mole of sodium.

00:06:15.492 --> 00:06:16.993
If you have two moles of sodium,

00:06:16.993 --> 00:06:18.804
you're going to get
two moles of electrons.

00:06:18.804 --> 00:06:19.710
If you have one mole of sodium,

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.045
you're gonna have two. (laughs)

00:06:21.045 --> 00:06:21.834
If you have one mole of sodium,

00:06:21.834 --> 00:06:24.227
you're gonna have one mole of electrons.

00:06:24.227 --> 00:06:26.108
And so, what is this going to give us?

00:06:26.108 --> 00:06:28.266
Well, if you just multiply out.

00:06:28.266 --> 00:06:29.736
Actually, let's look at the units first.

00:06:29.736 --> 00:06:32.616
Grams of sodium cancel
out with grams of sodium.

00:06:32.616 --> 00:06:35.344
Moles of sodium cancel
out with moles of sodium.

00:06:35.344 --> 00:06:38.878
And so you're left with
just moles of electrons,

00:06:38.878 --> 00:06:41.382
moles of, (scoffs)

00:06:41.382 --> 00:06:43.123
why am I making an apostrophe?

00:06:43.123 --> 00:06:44.342
Moles of electrons.

00:06:44.342 --> 00:06:46.983
And it's going to be 1.0 times one,

00:06:46.983 --> 00:06:49.944
divided by 22.9, times one.

00:06:49.944 --> 00:06:52.393
So it's 1.0 divided by 22.9.

00:06:52.393 --> 00:06:53.172
And let's see.

00:06:53.172 --> 00:06:56.169
I'm gonna have two significant
digits right over here,

00:06:56.169 --> 00:06:57.665
two significant figures.

00:06:57.665 --> 00:07:00.591
So let me get the calculator out.

00:07:00.591 --> 00:07:02.772
And it is, let's see,

00:07:02.772 --> 00:07:04.072
so it's just one,

00:07:04.072 --> 00:07:08.829
I could just say one divided by 22.9

00:07:08.829 --> 00:07:10.539
is equal to,

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:12.837
so if we have two significant figures,

00:07:12.837 --> 00:07:17.820
it's approximately .044,

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.590
.044

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.425
So, I'll say approximately

00:07:23.425 --> 00:07:28.012
0.044 moles of electron.

00:07:28.012 --> 00:07:28.763
Remember, moles.

00:07:28.763 --> 00:07:29.443
All we've got is numbers.

00:07:29.443 --> 00:07:31.147
This is still a lot of electrons.

00:07:31.147 --> 00:07:33.097
A mole is 6.022 times 10 to the,

00:07:33.097 --> 00:07:34.323
you know, or roughly that,

00:07:34.323 --> 00:07:35.301
times 10 to the 23rd.

00:07:35.301 --> 00:07:37.844
So it's a very, very
large number of electrons

00:07:37.844 --> 00:07:40.468
that we are going to
potentially transfer over here,

00:07:40.468 --> 00:07:42.325
if we have one gram of sodium.

00:07:42.325 --> 00:07:44.891
Now let's do the same
thing with the calcium.

00:07:44.891 --> 00:07:46.644
So if we have calcium,

00:07:46.644 --> 00:07:48.804
it's going to be the same exercise here.

00:07:48.804 --> 00:07:53.193
We have one gram of calcium

00:07:53.193 --> 00:07:57.413
times one mole of calcium,

00:07:57.413 --> 00:07:59.233
has what mass?

00:07:59.233 --> 00:08:01.335
One mole of calcium has a mass

00:08:01.335 --> 00:08:05.459
of how many grams?

00:08:05.459 --> 00:08:07.894
So let's go back to the Periodic Table.

00:08:07.894 --> 00:08:10.905
And there you have
calcium right over here.

00:08:10.905 --> 00:08:13.784
The atomic weight is 40.08,

00:08:13.784 --> 00:08:15.912
or oftentimes, or now the more modern name

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:17.042
is relative atomic mass,

00:08:17.042 --> 00:08:18.755
the weighted average of the typical,

00:08:18.755 --> 00:08:19.877
of the isotopes.

00:08:19.877 --> 00:08:21.491
40.08.

00:08:21.491 --> 00:08:25.439
So I could write 40.08

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:26.719
right over here.

00:08:26.719 --> 00:08:28.438
And then, in our reaction,

00:08:28.438 --> 00:08:30.737
for every mole of calcium,

00:08:30.737 --> 00:08:34.961
how many moles of electrons
are we going to generate?

00:08:34.961 --> 00:08:36.361
Well, we have in this reaction,

00:08:36.361 --> 00:08:37.962
one, for every one calcium,

00:08:37.962 --> 00:08:39.321
we have two electrons.

00:08:39.321 --> 00:08:40.343
So for every mole of calcium,

00:08:40.343 --> 00:08:43.210
we're gonna have two moles of electrons.

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:43.900
So we could say

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:48.020
times two moles of electrons

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.467
for every mole of calcium

00:08:51.467 --> 00:08:54.640
that we have as a reactant over here.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.204
And so this is going to give us,

00:08:57.204 --> 00:08:59.341
this is going to be approximately,

00:08:59.341 --> 00:09:00.966
see, our units,

00:09:00.966 --> 00:09:03.718
grams of calcium cancels
with grams of calcium.

00:09:03.718 --> 00:09:07.112
Moles of calcium cancel
with moles of calcium.

00:09:07.112 --> 00:09:09.343
And so we're gonna have one times one,

00:09:09.343 --> 00:09:11.445
divided by 40.08, times two.

00:09:11.445 --> 00:09:14.509
So it's going to be two divided by 40.08,

00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:18.687
which is, so, two

00:09:18.687 --> 00:09:23.687
divided by 40.08.

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:25.896
Now we're gonna have
two significant figures

00:09:25.896 --> 00:09:27.060
right over here.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.083
'Cause this two and those ones

00:09:28.083 --> 00:09:29.720
are kind of pure numbers,

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.438
while these are from measurements.

00:09:31.438 --> 00:09:34.031
So, and this is the fewest
number of significant figures,

00:09:34.031 --> 00:09:35.504
so we have two.

00:09:35.504 --> 00:09:37.679
So two divided by that.

00:09:37.679 --> 00:09:41.771
Let's see, so it's gonna be 0.050.

00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:47.726
So 0.050

00:09:47.726 --> 00:09:50.838
moles of electrons.

00:09:50.838 --> 00:09:51.721
So you can see,

00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:54.322
right from this calculation,

00:09:54.322 --> 00:09:56.978
that one gram of calcium

00:09:57.978 --> 00:10:02.468
can transfer more electrons

00:10:02.468 --> 00:10:03.966
than one gram of sodium,

00:10:03.966 --> 00:10:05.695
if sodium was the anode.

00:10:05.695 --> 00:10:09.306
So we see very clearly that calcium,

00:10:09.306 --> 00:10:11.942
so one gram of calcium

00:10:11.942 --> 00:10:15.998
can transfer more electrons,

00:10:15.998 --> 00:10:20.998
can transfer more electrons,

00:10:21.173 --> 00:10:24.550
more electrons than,

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:29.600
1.0 gram

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.253
of sodium.

00:10:31.253 --> 00:10:32.925
And you can see it right over here.

00:10:32.925 --> 00:10:37.336
We have done the calculation.
