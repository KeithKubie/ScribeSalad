00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.790
[engine running]

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.710
[music playing]

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.500
Well, season 2
on "Truck Night,"

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.330
we tried to ramp it up a little
bit with some new challenges.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.420
And one of our favorite
is Creek Climb.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.210
It's a cool little creek that
tests your truck's suspension.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.750
Man, you can see that
thing articulate.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.750
[engine roaring]

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.420
And then we hit
some gnarly climbs.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.540
That first climb's
at 60 degrees.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.830
And then the second
climb is at 70 degrees.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.380
And we made it even
a little nastier.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.750
We threw some
water on top of it.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.750
It's super cool.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.710
Let's take a look at it.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.250
Go!

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.920
Nice and slow.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.080
Nice and slow.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.000
A little slower.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.750
No, no, no, turn my way.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.040
My way, driver.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.210
See, if you can
see, it's hard to get

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.710
those tires to
stick on the rocks

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.290
because it's so damn slippery.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.120
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.790
[crash]

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.540
Oh!

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.380
You've got to really drive it
high up onto Glen's left there

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.920
to get the front end around it.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.880
And then the rear end
kind of settles in.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.620
If you don't, you
end up on your side,

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.040
right in the middle
of this creek bed.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.620
[music playing]

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.460
And then you go
into the bends.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.790
So you've got to carry a high
line here so that you can make

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.210
it around that next
bend there and maintain

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.710
the high side on this one.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.920
Because the last turn out
of here gets real tight.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.420
Run up and over
it and to the right.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.750
There you go.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.620
A little more right,
a little more right.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.460
Get down in the pond.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.210
Nice work.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.000
Nice work.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.670
Once the driver comes
out the creek part,

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.960
now it's time to
do the climb part.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.290
[engine roaring]

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.620
This is where it's really
crucial to pick a good line.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.750
Perfect, perfect, perfect.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.500
[engine roaring]

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.460
ROB PARK: To try
and pull momentum

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.420
and not have the tires
leave the ground--

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.790
Woo!

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.330
--that's really key
in this challenge.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.500
Woo!

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.670
That's what I'm
talking about, Zach!

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.420
Nailed it!

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.790
Yeah!

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.080
ABE WINE: Killer job.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.080
So that's a look
at the creek climb.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.580
We love it.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.670
I know a lot of the other
drivers have loved it.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.210
[engine roaring]

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.620
You guys wanted it.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.880
You wanted some rocks.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.380
Kicking it up for season 2.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.710
[music playing]

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.670
PETE SOHREN: This
is the Slag Heap.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.380
And it tests your truck's speed.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.790
So you're looking at a climb
of about 100 vertical feet

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.290
at a 45-degree angle.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.290
But you have to climb
over a bunch of logs

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.210
to get to the finish line.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.290
The key to this challenge
is when to be on the gas

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.170
and when to be on the brakes.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.380
Slag Heap is one of
our toughest challenges

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.120
here on "Truck Night."

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.000
Every one of those trucks had
the power to get up this hill.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.710
But driver error kept three
of them from making it.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.420
Ready, set, go!

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.080
[engines roaring]

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.880
Oh, look at the little
red one on the far side.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.540
All you got to do to
get up the Slag Hill

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.830
is maintain traction.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.080
We had one driver
on the outside lane

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.210
barely spin a tire
going up the hill.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.080
We had every other driver
throwing big rooster tails.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.420
They looked like boats
going across the water.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.880
PETE SOHREN: The
little red Ford's gonna

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.830
make it up the hill first.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.250
GLEN PLAKE: Go, little red!

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.040
Do it, buddy!

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.750
Do it!

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.710
Yeah!

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.580
Little red takes it.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.670
Let's come over the lane 2 here.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.040
Look at the two big
holes dug in right there

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.210
in front of that log.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.960
Instead of backing
up, resetting,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.790
he just spin the tires, spin
the tires, spin the tires.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.040
And then he broke something.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.960
[engine roaring]

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.380
[crash]

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.790
Oh, my gosh.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.120
[bleep]

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.460
You come over the
lane 3, you got four,

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.290
six big holes on those logs.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.420
Back up, reset.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.120
You know?

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.080
This challenge-- you don't have
to win, you've got to finish.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.210
Everything on "Truck Night,"
you don't have to win.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.420
You've got to finish, especially
in these early challenges.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.960
[engine roaring]

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.920
Do it!
Do it!

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.620
Do it!

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.290
Do it!

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:17.960
Go, go, yeah!

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.920
MAN: There you go, buddy!

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.750
Look over here.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.460
We kind of got a mess.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.380
Looks like a rototiller has been
going up there because they've

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.170
just been turning and burning.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.830
Big, giant motors, it causes
a lack of traction problem

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.330
if not done correctly.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.170
[engines roaring]

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.170
[creaking]

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.580
Oh, no!

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.500
Stop, stop!

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.500
It's over!

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.460
Wow!

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.790
These five lanes tell
the story of Slag Heap.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.250
I've got two clean
lanes, and I've got three

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.250
lanes where people got stuck.
