00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.110
ALEX: So I'm Alex from Bite
Sci-Zed, and I have

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:03.770
synesthesia.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.240
And so I have grapheme two-color
synesthesia, which

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.990
means that my digits in
my numbers have color.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.720
And a lot of times this is due
to the actual digits of the

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.560
number themselves.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.059
Because each digit from zero
to nine has its own color.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.940
The colors of numbers above nine
actually have to do with

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.400
their factors as well.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.300
And so things in the three, six,
nine series, so multiples

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.040
of three, are actually
my warm colors.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.390
So three is red, six is orange,
and nine is sort of a

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.565
very dark red maroon.

00:00:30.565 --> 00:00:31.705
BRADY HARAN: Go from
zero for me?

00:00:31.705 --> 00:00:32.280
ALEX: OK, yeah.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.870
Absolutely.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.980
Zero is sort of a
clear number.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.550
One is simultaneously
white and black.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.970
Two is green.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.600
Three is red.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.000
Four is blue.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.580
Five is very black.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.920
Six is orange.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.390
Seven is yellow.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.340
Eight is sort of
a darker blue.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.180
Nine is a very dark maroon.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.100
And then once you get into
things like 10, they're

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.800
simultaneously white
and black.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.670
A lot of the two and three digit
numbers have to do with

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.510
their actual digits.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.420
So things like 20 will be very
predominately green, because

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.510
they start with a two.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.910
However, that 20 is actually a
little bit more clear or white

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.170
and black as well, because it
has the 2 times the 10, which

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.720
is simultaneously
white and black.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.870
It also has a little bit of the
four thrown in, so it's a

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.840
slight blue tinge as well as
sort of a little bit of that

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.710
black from the five.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.045
BRADY HARAN: So when you're
telling me this and you're

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:22.440
envisaging it, what's happening
in your brain?

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.160
Are you seeing the number five
that color or are you just

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.190
seeing a color?

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.500
ALEX: I'm actually seeing the
number in that color.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.450
But I try and describe it to
people as the space in my

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.460
brain that it occupies is the
same space that it would

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.930
occupy if you tried to visualize
a pumpkin right now

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.050
because I said it to you.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.520
You don't see it in the world
in front of you, but you see

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.920
it in a space in your head.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.660
And so the numbers in my
head are that color.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.750
BRADY HARAN: So when you were
counting through the numbers

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.360
for me a minute ago, in your
mind's eye, was there like a

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.355
white background and then there
was a number five of

00:01:54.355 --> 00:01:56.060
that color like the
shape of the five?

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.250
Or was your mind's eye just
going, oh, that color, like a

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.300
flash to color?

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.520
ALEX: It is sort of that
number in its color.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.770
I think I've developed such a
strong visualization to them

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.020
that now the numbers and the
colors are the same almost.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.100
So if I see something like four
red blocks on a table,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.620
it's intrinsically
wrong to me.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.100
Because it should be either
four blue blocks

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.900
or three red blocks.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.160
It doesn't cause me problems,
but it absolutely interacts

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.210
with the way that I interact
with my world.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.380
So it helps with how I visualize
math problems.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.980
And it also sort of helps with
how I look at the world around

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.430
me and classify things
and remember things.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.000
BRADY HARAN: Does it
make you better?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.320
ALEX: I don't think it makes
me better at all.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.560
I think it's something actually
that a lot of people

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.470
have, but they don't realize
that they have.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.920
I didn't realize that I was
doing this until my freshman

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.050
year of college when a professor
called out, does

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.090
anyone in this classroom see
numbers with colors?

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.170
And my first response
is, that's stupid.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.560
Numbers don't have colors,
they have personalities.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.810
And then I realized that the
personalities I was equating

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.650
with my numbers were
their colors.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.880
Nine was a very angry
number, because it

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.060
was so dark and red.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.330
Whereas twos and fours were much
happier numbers because

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.440
they were cool blues
and greens.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.350
BRADY HARAN: When you've done
a bit of research and found

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.360
out about other people with this
condition, or skill, or

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.620
whatever we're going to call it,
do they associate the same

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.260
colors with numbers or is
everyone different?

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.330
ALEX: No, absolutely not.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.700
That's the best thing that I've
found, is that sharing my

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.740
numbers with colors is I have
this strong reaction from

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.270
other synesthetes who go,
no, absolutely not.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.700
Five is the brightest yellow
you've ever seen, and six is a

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.240
dark blue, and how dare you
have different numbers?

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.260
And I think that's the best part
of it, is that everyone

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.800
interacts with these numbers
and colors in a

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.936
very different way.

00:03:33.936 --> 00:03:36.920
-13, the most important thing
is tremendous good luck.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.785
It's bad luck for everybody
else, but for a magician,

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:39.190
somebody who likes--

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.550
-It's prime.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:41.870
What was the other thing?

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.020
This is called not
respecting your

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.360
favorite number well enough.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.480
ALEX: But when I was 13, I
decided that was silly and so

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.450
the last one stuck.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.270
And so my favorite number
has always stuck at 27.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.630
-Well, it's even.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.400
And it's the lowest
even number.
