00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:02.877
[music playing]

00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:11.052
NARRATOR: Edfu, Egypt,
located on the Western bank

00:00:11.052 --> 00:00:12.554
of the Nile.

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:15.515
The temple of Edfu is one
of the largest and most

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.685
well-preserved temples
of the ancient kingdom

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:24.274
dating back to 237 B.C.

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:27.694
The Edfu temple is of
tremendous importance.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.904
As you enter the
temple, it's like you're

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:31.114
going inside a book.

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:32.741
It's literally full of texts.

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:36.536
Every wall, every column,
every room, every chamber

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:38.163
is filled with texts.

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:41.291
They're known collectively
as Edfu texts.

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:44.252
What is very interesting is
that the majority of these texts

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:46.880
speak about the
creation of the world.

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:52.719
NARRATOR: According
to the texts,

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.222
the Earth was created by
powerful gods who came down

00:00:56.222 --> 00:01:00.894
from the sky, and these gods
first established a place

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:03.646
known as the island of the egg.

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:11.613
Two gods they created
an island in the middle

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:13.990
of the eternal lake.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.037
Creation started
with that island.

00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:22.332
The occupants of this
so-called primordial mythical

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:25.001
world, very strange creatures.

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:28.379
There seems to be three
groups of people--

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:33.134
one called the sages,
one called the builders,

00:01:33.134 --> 00:01:34.677
and the other
called the shebtiu.

00:01:34.677 --> 00:01:36.387
Nobody knows who they are.

00:01:36.387 --> 00:01:39.057
These are the ones that are
very mysterious because they are

00:01:39.057 --> 00:01:43.228
said to emerge from the water.

00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:46.064
Then the Egyptians
believed a series of gods

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:49.734
came and built
the first temples.

00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:53.154
It says that here the
first temples were built,

00:01:53.154 --> 00:01:56.449
the first ones ever in
the world and that these

00:01:56.449 --> 00:02:02.038
became the blueprint for
every temple in Egypt.

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:06.668
Once all the creator gods have
done their job with creating

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:10.630
the world, they would
meet with their big bird

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.049
and ascend to the sky.

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.970
Ancient Egyptians believed
with all their heart

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.350
that everything listed and
inscribed on these walls

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.271
are true, true, true.

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:30.441
If the walls say there's an
island in the middle of nowhere

00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:33.945
where gods would go
and ascend to the sky,

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:37.282
then ancient Egyptians,
the devoted ones,

00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:38.825
would believe that
island exists.

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:46.124
NARRATOR: According to the Edfu
texts, not all of the occupants

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:48.042
left.

00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:50.503
And after many
generations, the island

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:52.171
suffered a terrible fate.

00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:57.802
The texts are very
different as to what

00:02:57.802 --> 00:02:59.470
happens to the occupants.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.265
These strange
gods, they seem to,

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:04.809
once they have set the scene,
once they they've built

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:08.187
the temples, they
hand over their work

00:03:08.187 --> 00:03:11.274
to the historical lineage.

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:12.525
And then they depart.

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:14.736
We don't know where they go.

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:16.446
There seems to be something
very interesting here.

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:18.573
There seems to be
a war going on.

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:22.911
The armies of these divinities
is led by this falcon God,

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:27.582
and he battles a kind of
enemy represented by a snake.

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:32.337
In the skies appeared what
was known as the enemy snake.

00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:33.588
It had a name.

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:35.298
It was called the
Great Leaping One,

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:38.259
and it was said that
immediately it appeared

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:40.094
there was a time of darkness.

00:03:40.094 --> 00:03:42.680
And there was some
big floods that

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.643
destroyed this sacred island.

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:51.564
And when the waters receded,
these original beings,

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:55.526
who were known as the ancient
ones or the elder ones,

00:03:55.526 --> 00:03:58.988
were now no longer there.

00:03:58.988 --> 00:04:02.867
Perhaps the Great Leaping
One, this enemy snake,

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:06.913
was the memory of the
comet that entered

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:13.002
into our inner solar
system, broke up, causing

00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:14.712
devastation and destruction.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.637
NARRATOR: Might the account
of this ancient catastrophe

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:25.473
inscribed on the walls
of the Edfu temple

00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:32.355
be describing a natural event
or was it a deliberate attack,

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:35.024
an attack targeting
an other worldly

00:04:35.024 --> 00:04:38.444
civilization existing
on what we now know

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:39.445
as the Antarctic continent?
