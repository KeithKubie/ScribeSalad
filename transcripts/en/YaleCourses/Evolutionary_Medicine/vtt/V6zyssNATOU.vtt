00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.800
Our fifth look at what does a patient recognizes that every patient is a life

2
00:00:06.831 --> 00:00:11.831
history that unfolds from egg through fertilization,

3
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.970
birth growth,
maturation,
reproduction,

4
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.730
and on into old age and death.

5
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.140
These patient life histories have evolved and they continue to evolve and that

6
00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:30.470
evolution has both medical causes and medical consequences.

7
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.970
<v 1>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.680
<v 0>Patients are phenotypes,
they are traits,
not jeans and treat.</v>

9
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:40.800
Evolution is what's analyzed by life history theory.

10
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.500
Life history theory has successfully explained why organisms are smaller,

11
00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:50.190
large,
why they mature early or late,

12
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.090
why they have few or many offspring,

13
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.990
why they have a short or a long life and why they must grow old and die.

14
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.573
<v 1>Okay,</v>

15
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.340
<v 0>so what is it that causes life histories to evolve?
Well,
at a very,</v>

16
00:01:07.341 --> 00:01:08.390
very basic level,

17
00:01:08.391 --> 00:01:11.930
they result from the interaction of extrinsic and intrinsic factors from things

18
00:01:11.931 --> 00:01:13.910
in the environment and things in the organism.

19
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.240
The extrinsic factors are those that influence age or stage specific rates of

20
00:01:20.241 --> 00:01:21.710
mortality and reproduction,

21
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.460
so risk and nutrition and things like that.

22
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.440
This is where the environment comes in.
Nutrition,
disease,
violence,
medicine,

23
00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:31.101
public health.

24
00:01:31.101 --> 00:01:34.760
Those are all factors that are affecting age and stage specific rates of

25
00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:36.680
mortality and reproduction.

26
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.040
The intrinsic factors primarily include tradeoffs among traits and here

27
00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:44.330
phylogeny genetics,

28
00:01:44.331 --> 00:01:48.500
development in physiology are all involved in establishing these critical

29
00:01:48.501 --> 00:01:50.120
connections among traits.

30
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.520
The analysis done is one of costs and benefits.
For example,

31
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.150
what are the costs and benefits of maturing earlier or later of investing more

32
00:02:01.191 --> 00:02:04.400
in each of a few children or less in each of more children.

33
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.110
Those are standard life history questions and so you can see the framework is

34
00:02:09.111 --> 00:02:14.111
one the conceptualizes organisms as having tradeoffs that set up a structure of

35
00:02:16.131 --> 00:02:17.330
costs and benefits.

36
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.210
The method of analyzing treat evolution that's developed for life history traits

37
00:02:23.211 --> 00:02:25.490
suggest how all traits evolve,

38
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.520
including traits in the immune system,

39
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.640
treats having to do with physiology and so forth.

40
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.640
Those can all be cast into this sort of framework.

41
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.630
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

42
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.420
<v 0>An example of treat evolution is agent size at maturity.</v>

43
00:02:39.421 --> 00:02:41.130
We'll focus just on this one.

44
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.060
Natural selection shaped the evolution of agent size of maturity to maximize

45
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.530
reproductive success.
That results from maturation at different ages and sizes.

46
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.930
It's a very straightforward approach.

47
00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.070
How many children and grandchildren are you going to get if you mature at this

48
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:03.970
age and size rather than at some other?
That's the question.

49
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.270
So let's make a few assumptions about costs and benefits.
First,

50
00:03:10.271 --> 00:03:12.820
delaying maturity improves offspring's survival.

51
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.600
So older organisms have higher quality offspring.

52
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.680
Delaying maturity improves offspring.
Number.

53
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.730
Older organisms have more time to grow so they're bigger so they can have more

54
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:28.930
babies.
Earlier.
Maturity shortens generation time.

55
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.550
That's a benefit and early maturity shortens the period of risk before

56
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:34.780
reproduction begins,

57
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.430
so you're more likely to reproduce because you've survived to reproduce if you

58
00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:42.760
can do it faster.
So these things are trading off with each other.

59
00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:43.720
They're in opposition.

60
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.690
There is an equation down here which probably looks a little formidable.

61
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.250
It's the oiler latke equation.
It explicitly relates fitness to these traits.

62
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:57.850
Now in this equation,
fitness is this thing here a little our,

63
00:03:57.851 --> 00:04:02.851
that's the rate at which a variant will grow in the population and in a stable

64
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:05.074
population.

65
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.830
This relationship between age fecundity survival and fitness can be shown to be

66
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:14.554
true.

67
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.970
Basically what you do is you are integrating between h at first reproduction.

68
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:22.510
In agent last reproduction of reproductive success.

69
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:27.511
That's probability of survival times fertility weighted by the discount or the

70
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:33.160
population growth rate and in a stable population that will equal one.

71
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.460
This gives a way of relating little r which is fitness in this formulation to

72
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:42.970
age of maturity Alpha.

73
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.900
Let's do that for these curves here.

74
00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:51.510
So these curves come out of that equation is age of maturity Alpha and here's

75
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.810
fitness little are and what you can see is that under two different sets of

76
00:04:55.811 --> 00:04:56.644
assumptions,

77
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.330
this is one which is based primarily on an effect on juvenile mortality and this

78
00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:03.700
is one which is based primarily on fecundity.

79
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.070
You can see that there is a peak fitness associated with a certain age at

80
00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:12.580
maturity.
The actual agent maturity is this dash line.

81
00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:17.581
Here you can see that the model is bracketing that observed agent maturity.

82
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.190
This particular analysis for the western fence lizards.

83
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.790
Now you can ask yourself what will happen when a range of environments is

84
00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:32.290
encountered.
So here we have long the x axis,

85
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.900
age along the y axis we have weight,

86
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.100
these curved lines here,
our growth curves.

87
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.520
So they indicate how much,
how wait is varying with age.

88
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.380
It's increasing rapidly here with age,

89
00:05:44.381 --> 00:05:47.140
with rapid growth and a little more slowly here with slow growth.

90
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.220
Let us suppose that organisms decided that they were always going to mature at

91
00:05:53.351 --> 00:05:56.080
the same weight.
Well,
if they're growing rapidly,

92
00:05:56.081 --> 00:05:59.340
they would mature young and if they were growing slowly,
they would mature,

93
00:05:59.341 --> 00:06:02.990
are quite old.
And the problem they would encounter as mortality,

94
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.490
let's suppose that they decided on the other hand to mature,

95
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:09.800
always at the same age.
Well,

96
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.060
if they mature when they're at this point,
when they're growing rapidly,

97
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.560
they're big,
but at the same age,
when they're growing slowly,
they're small.

98
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.650
So here the problem is that they lose fecundity there.

99
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.600
They aren't able to make as many offspring.
So just on that very simple ground,

100
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:30.230
one would expect a flexible compromise.
Something in between.

101
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.190
Now what the human females actually do,
they are phenotypically plastic.

102
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.910
This is rose Frisch's data on women in England and Scotland from the 19th

103
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:47.510
century and from Hutterites in Iowa from the 20th century.

104
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.220
And the women in England and Scotland in the 19th century were stressed by poor

105
00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:53.630
nutrition and hard work.

106
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.880
And the women in Iowa and the 20th century were growing better and they weren't

107
00:06:58.881 --> 00:06:59.714
as stressed.

108
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:05.170
And basically what you can see here are different measures of the,

109
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.400
this is procreative power on this axis over here,

110
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:15.670
this is age down here and marked on here are best fitness for procreation.

111
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.700
Okay?
So this is a shift here of about four or five years.

112
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.190
In other words,
in the 20th century,

113
00:07:25.191 --> 00:07:29.720
women were able to mature and have children four or five years earlier than they

114
00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:32.750
were in the 19th century.
And that is a plastic response.

115
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:39.910
So if you use that framework that you saw with the equation and the example from

116
00:07:40.311 --> 00:07:42.080
the Lizard,
and you ask,

117
00:07:42.081 --> 00:07:46.010
what is the optimal reaction or infer maturation in humans,

118
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.260
it is this blue line here.

119
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.830
And if you put in the amounts,
the,
the correct,

120
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.430
uh,
estimated parameters for the 19th and the 20th century,

121
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.960
this model predicts about,
uh,
four or five,

122
00:08:02.961 --> 00:08:07.961
six years shift in agent maturation age at first birth.

123
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:14.900
Now,
what that means is that when human females grow faster,

124
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.420
they mature younger and larger,

125
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.860
and this is quite consistent with an optimal evolved reaction.

126
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:24.110
Them interestingly,

127
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.490
there is also on this figure another line,
it's this red line.

128
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:35.330
This is the difference made by nurture.
This red line indicates what one expects.

129
00:08:35.331 --> 00:08:37.730
If juvenile mortality rates remain low,

130
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.290
there should be a shift of the entire reaction norm down to the left,

131
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:47.800
meaning that women should be maturing slightly earlier and slightly shorter,

132
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:53.440
slightly smaller than they were before juvenile mortality rates dropped.

133
00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:00.740
So you can think of this as being selection that is a result of improvements in

134
00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:02.340
medicine and public health.

135
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:10.320
We got a surprising confirmation of this when we analyze women in the Framingham

136
00:09:10.321 --> 00:09:11.154
heart study.

137
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.840
We looked at selection operating on those born between 1890 in 1950 and then

138
00:09:20.311 --> 00:09:25.311
projected the change that they would experience over the next Gen 10 generations

139
00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:30.120
in height and an age at first birth height predicted to decreased by about two

140
00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:33.570
centimeters age at first birth by a bit over five months.

141
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.630
We then contrasted that

142
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.680
with rates of evolution in 19 natural populations of plants and animals.

143
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.580
This is for height.
This is for age at first birth in humans.

144
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.930
Here you have intervals over which change was measured.

145
00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:53.610
Here you have the rate of change.

146
00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.750
The scatter of black points gives you all the measurements for plant and animal

147
00:09:57.751 --> 00:10:01.170
populations in nature.
The humans are sitting right in the middle of them.

148
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:06.540
Humans have normal rates of evolution projected,

149
00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.450
uh,
when compared with other organisms.

150
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.460
Contemporary humans are still evolving and they are evolving in the direction

151
00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:17.730
that had been predicted by that model of life history,
evolution.

152
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:24.150
This is what an optimal reaction norm for and size of maturity looks like for

153
00:10:24.151 --> 00:10:27.720
many organisms,
the dotted lines or a growth lines,

154
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.170
the dark line here is the optimal reaction norm.

155
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.720
So basically what it is saying is that if you're growing fast,
mature,

156
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:41.730
young and large,
and if you're growing slow,
mature,
old and small,

157
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.460
there are other possible reaction norms.

158
00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:48.540
But this is certainly one that seems to be common.
Now,

159
00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:53.541
why is there earlier age at first birth in contemporary humans?

160
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:56.370
Well,

161
00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:01.370
agent size at maturity are determined by tradeoffs between infant mortality and

162
00:11:02.701 --> 00:11:03.534
age of mother.

163
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.940
The offspring of younger first time mothers suffer higher mortality rates.

164
00:11:08.941 --> 00:11:11.280
That's the trade off with juvenile mortality.

165
00:11:11.281 --> 00:11:16.281
So here is a curve of infant mortality versus age of mother at birth for the

166
00:11:19.351 --> 00:11:24.351
population of the US in 1960 61 with a sample size of a bit over 100,000.

167
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:30.360
And you can see that girls who are having offspring before they're 10 years old,

168
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.110
uh,
have a very high probability that their baby will die.

169
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:39.290
That drops down to a minimum at about 22 years of age and then begins to rise

170
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.390
particularly strongly after 35.

171
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:48.770
So what's going on when medicine improves?

172
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:55.670
Early Childhood survival is something that has a direct impact on the evolution

173
00:11:56.621 --> 00:12:00.850
of agents size at maturity when modern hygiene and medicine,

174
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.710
lower infant mortality rates,

175
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.210
they reduced the evolutionary costs of earlier met earlier maturation.

176
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:10.750
But the benefits of earlier maturation stay the same.

177
00:12:10.751 --> 00:12:13.540
So the cost benefit analysis,
uh,
ratio changes,

178
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:18.160
it's become possible and it pays off to mature earlier

179
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.510
with the cost of earlier maturation reduced.

180
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:25.990
And the benefits unchanged maturation shifts at earlier ages.

181
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.280
The entire reaction norm then moves down and to the left.

182
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:36.370
Similar effects have also been found in other human populations,

183
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.900
particularly those that like the u s population have already moved through the

184
00:12:40.901 --> 00:12:44.080
demographic transition,
Finland and Australia,

185
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:51.120
so the important points from this lecture or that what evolves is not a fixed

186
00:12:52.091 --> 00:12:56.650
value of a trait but the entire plastic response,
the reaction norm,

187
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.290
reaction norms depict the interaction of nature with nurture of genes with

188
00:13:02.291 --> 00:13:07.291
environment and they are very useful for making the point that all aspects of

189
00:13:07.631 --> 00:13:11.590
the phenotype result from gene environment interactions.

190
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.900
The nature nurture debate is a false debate.
Both things are important.

191
00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.200
Public health measures and medical care have population level consequences.

192
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.800
They changed selection pressures and they alter the course of evolution.

193
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.250
That's something that most doctors probably don't realize.

194
00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.840
The Framingham study describes the biology but at the same time culture is

195
00:13:37.511 --> 00:13:40.630
pushing women in the other direction to have their first child later,

196
00:13:40.631 --> 00:13:42.220
particularly in

197
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.990
families where both couples are professionals and women want to delay

198
00:13:46.991 --> 00:13:49.000
childbearing for professional reasons.

199
00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:54.520
The result is increased conflict between biology and culture.

200
00:13:55.750 --> 00:14:00.750
So this is not a paradox that women are under selection to have earlier agent

201
00:14:02.171 --> 00:14:06.790
maturation in Framingham,
Massachusetts in instead,

202
00:14:06.791 --> 00:14:11.791
it is a pointer to the increased intensity of conflict between biology and

203
00:14:11.801 --> 00:14:16.150
culture.
So to summarize,
selection shapes,

204
00:14:16.151 --> 00:14:17.740
life histories from birth to death,

205
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.620
changes in life history events have costs and benefits and selection benefits,

206
00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.520
uh,
shapes them to maximize the difference between the benefits and the costs.

207
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.900
That process is constrained by trade offs,

208
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:33.790
which connect traits that are genetically,

209
00:14:33.791 --> 00:14:36.640
developmentally and physiologically bound together.

210
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:41.920
When traits are connected by tradeoffs,
then changes in one trade.

211
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:47.050
That improved fitness cause changes in other traits that decrease fitness.

212
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.500
We'll see that in greater detail in the next lecture.

213
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.240
What evolves is often not a fixed trait,
but it's plastic response.

214
00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.650
It's norm of reaction,

215
00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.860
how it is expressed as a function of the environment encountered.

216
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
So the take home from this lecture is a patient is not a fixed object.

217
00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:13.241
Developmentally the patient is a point on a reaction norm that describes all the

218
00:15:13.881 --> 00:15:18.110
different possibilities that that genotype had in interacting with various

219
00:15:18.111 --> 00:15:18.800
environments.
