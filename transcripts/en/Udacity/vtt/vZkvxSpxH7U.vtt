00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.969
At this point in the process you might
be thinking, all right I'm ready to go.

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:06.660
Let's do this.
But there might be a small voice

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.610
in the back of your head or perhaps
a very loud one that's saying, wait.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.190
I'm not a graphic designer.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.490
I'm not an artist.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.950
How am I going to make this app actually
look good so people want to use it?

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.420
To which I say, don't worry.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.940
There's a lot of great services out
there that provide high quality

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.070
images and graphics that you
can use in your own app.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.040
First, you have your basic
Google image search.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.910
Now anything that you search here
will bring up a lot of results.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.550
So you'll need to be wary of
any copyright restrictions.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.020
But, given the right search terms,
you can find some real and free gems.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.140
iStock photo and 99 Designs are also
great options if you're looking for

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.690
more professional high quality graphics.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.480
However, these services
do cost a bit of money,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.149
but they're usually pretty reasonable.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.530
Maybe there are other services out there
that you've found that you are going to

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.080
use in your app.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.000
If you find those,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.100
I encourage you to share them with
your fellow classmates on the forum.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.890
I'll actually be interested to see them,
too.
