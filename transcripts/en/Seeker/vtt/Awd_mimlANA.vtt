00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.330
Ok, show of hands, who would fly upside-down
in a jet?

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:14.230
But how does it…

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.650
Some planes can do crazy things, but one of
the most extreme is the ability to fly at

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.679
high-speeds upside-down.

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:22.230
And not all planes can do this.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.230
Planes fly when air moving around the wing
lifts the plane into the sky.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.480
With upside-down-flying it get’s a little
more complicated.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.370
There are two main factors to consider when
thinking about wings: the wing’s design

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.340
and “the angle of attack.”

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.150
Normally, a wing has to be shaped very specifically
to nudge the air over the top, allowing the

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.430
air below to create lift.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.810
When a plane has to be able to fly both ways
the wing has to be shaped differently.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.430
On commercial planes, the wings are rounded
in the front, bulged on top and flat on the

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.430
bottom.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.200
The helps the air move faster over the top,
which in turn, makes the air less dense, helping

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.520
the plane fly.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.751
Now that’s all fine if you’re trying to
fly long distances at a steady speed, but

00:01:01.751 --> 00:01:06.050
flying upside-down requires a whole different
thought process.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.440
Planes built to fly upside-down have uniquely
shaped wings.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.270
Fighter jets, for example, have crazy thin
wings, which allow them to go faster while

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.000
producing more lift.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.940
Stunt planes have symmetrical wings.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.150
Meaning they’re curved on both the top and
bottom to allow air to easily glide over the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.340
wings even when flying upside-down!

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.520
These planes are also a heck of a lot smaller
and lighter than the massive planes we fly

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.030
across the country.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.979
The ‘angle of attack’ also affects these
upside-down movements.

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.710
The angle of attack represents the measurement
of how high the front of the wing is tilted.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.850
More tilt means more lift.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.390
When the pilot flies upside down they have
to understand their angle of attack.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.510
Or the angle of the airplane’s wing through
the air.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.280
To little angle of attack, and there’s not
enough air below the wing to lift it up.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.370
So, if they push the nose into the sky -- even
while upside down, they can generate lift

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.979
on a thin, symmetrical wing.

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:01.979
Voila!

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.960
Upside-down flight (for a bit).

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.040
Think about “flying” your hand out a car
window…

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.840
If you keep it level it glides through the
air.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.569
Tilt the leading edge up and the air pushes
on the bottom of your hand generating lift!

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.819
Fighter jets and stunt planes are a lot lighter
and smaller than regular commercial planes,

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.739
which is what gives them the ability to tilt
their noses skyward and get much higher angles

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:26.739
of attack.

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.920
This allows the planes to fly up, over and,
breathtakingly upside-down!

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.489
It’s safe to say that you’ll probably
never have to worry about a pilot taking you

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.219
on a topsy-turvy joyride… that is unless
you’re riding shotgun in a fighter jet.

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:43.879

I actually rode in a fighter jet once.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.730
The whole experience was incredible.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.349
I definitely threw up everywhere.
