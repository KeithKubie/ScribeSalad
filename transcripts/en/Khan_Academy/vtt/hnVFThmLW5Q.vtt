00:00:00.581 --> 00:00:01.360
- [Voiceover] So we're asked to choose

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.741
the equation that can represent

00:00:02.741 --> 00:00:04.483
the hyperbola graphed below.

00:00:04.483 --> 00:00:06.176
And so this is the hyperbola graphed

00:00:06.176 --> 00:00:08.116
in blue and I encourage
you to pause the video

00:00:08.116 --> 00:00:09.904
and figure out which of these equations

00:00:09.904 --> 00:00:13.340
are represented by the graph here.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.536
Alright, so let's think about it.

00:00:14.536 --> 00:00:16.461
This graph opens to
the left and the right.

00:00:16.461 --> 00:00:17.702
Well, I guess, the first
thing we could realize,

00:00:17.702 --> 00:00:19.920
it's centered at zero.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.638
So definitely, it's just going to have

00:00:21.638 --> 00:00:25.980
the form, x squared and y squared over

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.393
two different things equaling one.

00:00:29.393 --> 00:00:32.896
And we know that it opens
to the left and the right.

00:00:32.896 --> 00:00:35.891
You can think of it opens
along the x-direction

00:00:35.891 --> 00:00:37.540
and so we know that the x-term is going

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.618
to be positive here,
which tells us that the

00:00:39.618 --> 00:00:42.659
y-term is going to be negative.

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:44.852
And we know that the vertices here are

00:00:44.852 --> 00:00:47.152
five to the right of the center

00:00:47.152 --> 00:00:49.416
and five to the left of the center

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:51.331
and so since the distance
from the vertices

00:00:51.331 --> 00:00:55.197
to the center is five in
the horizontal direction,

00:00:55.197 --> 00:00:56.635
we know that this right over here

00:00:56.635 --> 00:01:01.635
is going to be five squared or 25.

00:01:01.837 --> 00:01:04.856
And this we don't quite know, just yet.

00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:09.856
I just call this a squared.
We don't know what a is.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.552
Now let's look at these choices here.

00:01:13.552 --> 00:01:16.151
X squared over 25 minus y squared

00:01:16.151 --> 00:01:18.496
over nine equals one.

00:01:18.496 --> 00:01:20.667
Well, that seems to match the pattern

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:23.128
that I was able to
generate really quickly,

00:01:23.128 --> 00:01:26.054
just looking at the
graph, so I like this one.

00:01:26.054 --> 00:01:28.410
This has the x-term being negative.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.128
So this graph over
here, this would open up

00:01:30.128 --> 00:01:33.054
up and down, not to
the left and the right,

00:01:33.054 --> 00:01:35.747
so we could rule this out.

00:01:35.747 --> 00:01:38.870
This one over here. This
has x squared over nine.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.412
That would imply that our x-intercepts

00:01:41.412 --> 00:01:45.232
are plus or minus three
to the right and left

00:01:45.232 --> 00:01:46.729
of the center, not five.

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.148
Clearly, they aren't plus or minus three

00:01:49.148 --> 00:01:51.872
so we could rule this one out.

00:01:51.872 --> 00:01:54.082
This one has the y-term being positive

00:01:54.082 --> 00:01:55.000
and the x-term being negative,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.019
so once again, this
would open up and down.

00:01:57.019 --> 00:01:59.724
So we could rule that one out as well.

00:01:59.724 --> 00:02:01.639
And so our first choice
that we like that matched

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:04.094
our pattern, we could
feel pretty good about it.

00:02:04.094 --> 00:02:05.718
Now if you wanted to verify the nine

00:02:05.718 --> 00:02:07.553
or if you want, you might want to try out

00:02:07.553 --> 00:02:09.817
some other points or solve some points,

00:02:09.817 --> 00:02:11.535
if it wasn't multiple
choice but in this case,

00:02:11.535 --> 00:02:13.230
we are able to pick out.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.540
This is the only one that even matches

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.474
the general structure that
we were able to deduce.
