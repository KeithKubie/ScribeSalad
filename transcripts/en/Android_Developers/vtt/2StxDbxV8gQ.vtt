Abrams: A couple things
that I learned

00:00:01.467 --> 00:00:05.200
while developing for Android,
uh, specifically for games,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.067
while I was trying to make
the frame rate, uh, higher,

00:00:08.067 --> 00:00:11.534
I had to actually try to reduce
the amount of transparency

00:00:11.534 --> 00:00:13.334
I used in my images.

00:00:13.334 --> 00:00:15.501
I used 565 format,

00:00:15.501 --> 00:00:17.667
and I made sure
that my PNGs

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:20.200
didn't have
transparent chunks in them.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.334
Another technique
we needed to use

00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:25.033
was we used ogg files
for the sounds.

00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:28.334
They play much more quickly
than m4a files.

00:00:28.334 --> 00:00:30.968
So the game felt
much more responsive.
