00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.951
- So let's talk about the unit

00:00:01.951 --> 00:00:05.208
of measurement called the "gram."

00:00:05.208 --> 00:00:10.208
And the gram is a unit of
measurement for measuring mass.

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:13.430
Now, what is mass?

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.615
Well, you might have seen
in everyday language,

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:17.895
someone might look at a feather,

00:00:17.895 --> 00:00:20.875
let me see if I can draw a good feather.

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:22.824
So a feather like this.

00:00:22.824 --> 00:00:26.561
And say, "Hey, this is not very massive."

00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:28.931
This is not massive.

00:00:28.931 --> 00:00:31.531
And notice, you have that
word "mass" in there.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:35.405
And then they might point
to some big boulder,

00:00:35.405 --> 00:00:40.249
some big heavy boulder, let
me draw a big heavy boulder.

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:43.140
And say, "This is massive."

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.128
This is massive.

00:00:47.128 --> 00:00:48.097
And so, just with those examples,

00:00:48.097 --> 00:00:50.651
you might get an intuition
for what mass is.

00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:55.651
It's how much stuff there is,
and it's related to weight.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.605
And I said "related to weight,"

00:00:57.605 --> 00:00:59.217
not the same thing as weight,

00:00:59.217 --> 00:01:00.890
because later on when you take Physics,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.793
you will learn that mass
and weight are related,

00:01:03.793 --> 00:01:06.869
but that they're not
exactly the same thing.

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.197
Now, if you're on a given planet,

00:01:09.197 --> 00:01:13.347
and the same distance from
the center of that planet,

00:01:13.347 --> 00:01:15.759
roughly speaking, mass and weight

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.921
will be strongly related to each other.

00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:20.219
Something with more mass is
going to have more weight.

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:21.798
Two things with the same mass,

00:01:21.798 --> 00:01:23.628
once again if I'm on the same planet,

00:01:23.628 --> 00:01:25.292
at the same distance from
the center of the planet,

00:01:25.292 --> 00:01:27.301
they're going to have the same weight.

00:01:27.301 --> 00:01:30.109
So you'll often hear people say,

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:32.871
"How many grams does that thing weigh?"

00:01:32.871 --> 00:01:33.825
They really should be saying,

00:01:33.825 --> 00:01:35.961
"How many grams does that thing mass,"

00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:38.144
but it's okay, because as long
as we're staying on earth,

00:01:38.144 --> 00:01:41.429
roughly you know, at sea level,
plus or minus a little bit,

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.553
or even if we're a little bit
further away from sea level,

00:01:43.553 --> 00:01:46.405
mass and weight, it's not crazy

00:01:46.405 --> 00:01:48.105
to hold them a little bit interchangeable.

00:01:48.105 --> 00:01:51.064
And one way to gauge something's mass

00:01:51.064 --> 00:01:53.409
is to hold it if you can, and say,

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:54.431
"Okay, how much does this weigh,"

00:01:54.431 --> 00:01:56.344
because the more something weighs,

00:01:56.344 --> 00:01:57.890
the more its mass is going to be.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.327
The more something's mass is going to be,

00:02:01.327 --> 00:02:03.660
the more it's going to weigh, once again,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.239
assuming we're on the planet, etc., etc.

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:06.888
When you take Physics
class, you'll learn that

00:02:06.888 --> 00:02:08.606
they are different concepts that

00:02:08.606 --> 00:02:11.367
are closely related to each other.

00:02:11.367 --> 00:02:12.898
So, that's what a gram is.

00:02:12.898 --> 00:02:14.062
Now, another thing that you will see

00:02:14.062 --> 00:02:16.796
in the context of mass and measuring mass,

00:02:16.796 --> 00:02:18.509
is the kilogram.

00:02:22.093 --> 00:02:25.641
And all the kilogram is,
and you're going to see

00:02:25.641 --> 00:02:30.038
the prefix "kilo-" over and over again,

00:02:30.038 --> 00:02:33.507
in your, I guess your education careers,

00:02:33.507 --> 00:02:35.214
especially when you're
thinking about units.

00:02:35.214 --> 00:02:37.973
But "kilo-" is just a prefix for 1000.

00:02:37.973 --> 00:02:41.945
So that literally means 1000 grams.

00:02:41.945 --> 00:02:45.147
So instead of saying "2000 grams,"

00:02:45.147 --> 00:02:48.223
I could say "2 kilograms."

00:02:48.223 --> 00:02:49.188
So with that out of the way, let's see

00:02:49.188 --> 00:02:53.011
if we can get a sense for what one gram

00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:55.146
or different numbers
of grams of masses are

00:02:55.146 --> 00:02:58.121
and what might have a mass of one kilogram

00:02:58.121 --> 00:03:01.095
or 10 kilograms or 100 kilograms.

00:03:01.095 --> 00:03:05.749
And that's exactly why I got
all of these pictures prepared.

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:07.649
So if, if you want to
get a sense of something

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:12.649
that has a mass of one
gram, think of a paper clip.

00:03:13.386 --> 00:03:15.160
And I have this little
squiggly thing here,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.798
because that right there,
that means "roughly."

00:03:17.798 --> 00:03:20.540
Every paper clip isn't
going to be exactly 1 gram;

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.351
it might be 1 1/2 grams, it might be

00:03:22.351 --> 00:03:24.760
small paper clips that are 1/2 gram.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.653
But it gives you the sense of

00:03:25.653 --> 00:03:27.917
what would have a mass of 1 gram.

00:03:27.917 --> 00:03:30.154
And if you want to know how
much something with a mass

00:03:30.154 --> 00:03:33.185
of 1 gram weighs on the
surface of the earth,

00:03:33.185 --> 00:03:36.242
well, you could just hold that
paper clip and kind of judge,

00:03:36.242 --> 00:03:40.163
feel how much it's
pulling down on your hand.

00:03:40.163 --> 00:03:42.191
Now, or how much the weight of it

00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:44.564
is pushing down on your
hand, I guess I could say.

00:03:44.564 --> 00:03:45.806
Now, if you want to get a sense of things

00:03:45.806 --> 00:03:47.466
that are little bit more massive,

00:03:47.466 --> 00:03:51.061
a pencil is five times as
massive as a paper clip.

00:03:51.061 --> 00:03:53.245
And hopefully you'll see that,
if you hold five paper clips

00:03:53.245 --> 00:03:55.254
on one side and a pencil
on the other side,

00:03:55.254 --> 00:03:57.390
you'll see that they
roughly have the same mass,

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.288
and their weight will be roughly the same.

00:04:02.288 --> 00:04:03.914
Now, a little bit more massive,

00:04:03.914 --> 00:04:05.110
you could think of a field mouse.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.134
A field mouse is equivalent to the mass

00:04:07.134 --> 00:04:11.502
of roughly 4 pencils, or 20 paperclips.

00:04:11.502 --> 00:04:12.751
You want to get even more massive,

00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:14.713
you can think of a kitten.

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:16.546
So, a kitten after a couple of weeks,

00:04:16.546 --> 00:04:19.209
it's still a kitten now, it's
still not a fully grown cat,

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.189
it'll have a mass of
about 200 to 300 grams.

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:26.449
And this makes a rough amount of sense,

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.490
you can imagine this
thing having the same mass

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.147
as maybe 10 or 15 of
these little field mice.

00:04:33.147 --> 00:04:37.628
You can imagine the
mouse is about that size,

00:04:37.628 --> 00:04:38.905
right over there.

00:04:41.811 --> 00:04:43.512
I could do a better job drawing a mouse.

00:04:43.512 --> 00:04:46.001
But that makes some sense.

00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:47.224
So what if we get even larger?

00:04:47.224 --> 00:04:50.399
What if we get into the
ranges of, say, 1000 grams?

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:52.908
Well, now we can start
talking about kilograms.

00:04:52.908 --> 00:04:55.223
And just to be clear,
when I put a "g" here,

00:04:55.223 --> 00:04:57.164
that's just an abbreviation for "gram."

00:04:57.164 --> 00:05:01.694
So this is 1 gram, 5 grams, 20 grams.

00:05:01.694 --> 00:05:03.647
And now, if you want to go to 1000 grams,

00:05:03.647 --> 00:05:06.105
you could think of something like

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:10.672
a hard-cover textbook like this one.

00:05:10.672 --> 00:05:13.324
And they're obviously,
some textbooks are huge,

00:05:13.324 --> 00:05:14.794
but the one that I'm showing here

00:05:14.794 --> 00:05:17.390
I didn't weigh or figure out
the mass of this exact one.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.359
But it would have a mass of roughly

00:05:19.359 --> 00:05:23.445
1 kilogram, or 1000 grams.

00:05:23.445 --> 00:05:27.332
So that's a kilogram right
over there, 1000 grams.

00:05:27.332 --> 00:05:31.476
A fully grown cat, that's
about 3 to 5 kilograms,

00:05:31.476 --> 00:05:33.264
depending on how fully grown it is

00:05:33.264 --> 00:05:35.882
or I guess how big of a cat it is.

00:05:35.882 --> 00:05:37.762
So, that's pretty
interesting, a fully grown cat

00:05:37.762 --> 00:05:42.762
is more than 10 times
the mass of a kitten.

00:05:43.857 --> 00:05:46.725
Actually that makes sense,
most fully grown humans

00:05:46.725 --> 00:05:49.487
are more than 10 times their mass

00:05:49.487 --> 00:05:51.751
when they were very, very young,

00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:53.625
or actually roughly 10
times the mass of when

00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:58.572
they were very young, so
it actually makes sense.

00:05:58.572 --> 00:06:00.763
Now, if you want to get even larger,

00:06:00.763 --> 00:06:04.169
you can go to a large
ape, like a human being,

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:06.860
in particular, this one right over here.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.232
70 kilograms, and this is actually

00:06:08.232 --> 00:06:12.591
pretty close to my actual
mass, 70 kilograms.

00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:14.486
And you get a sense of
what that would mean

00:06:14.486 --> 00:06:16.869
if you're used to dealing with pounds.

00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:19.876
I weigh a little over 160 pounds,

00:06:19.876 --> 00:06:21.582
so that's about 70 kilograms.

00:06:21.582 --> 00:06:25.425
Or 1 kilogram is roughly 2.2 pounds

00:06:25.425 --> 00:06:27.773
if you are used to thinking
in terms of pounds.

00:06:27.773 --> 00:06:30.739
But, once again, pounds
are a unit of weight,

00:06:30.739 --> 00:06:34.046
while kilograms are a unit of mass.

00:06:34.046 --> 00:06:35.836
And then, if you want to get even heavier,

00:06:35.836 --> 00:06:38.809
you would get 10 times more massive

00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:41.259
than a human being, than a
normal-sized human being,

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:43.999
you might get to something like this cow,

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:47.463
and this cow would have
a mass of 750 kilograms.

00:06:47.463 --> 00:06:49.084
So, how many paper clips would you need

00:06:49.084 --> 00:06:51.312
to have the same mass as this cow?

00:06:51.312 --> 00:06:53.484
Well, you might be tempted to say 750,

00:06:53.484 --> 00:06:58.484
but remember this is 1
gram, this is 750 kilograms.

00:06:58.967 --> 00:07:03.967
So the mass of this cow
is actually 750,000 grams.

00:07:04.744 --> 00:07:08.300
So you would need about 750,000 of these

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.555
paper clips to have the
same mass as this cow.
