SHAMSHER MEHTA &gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Shamsher Mehta.

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.640
I'm the Director of the Confederation of Indian
Industry. My answer to this question would

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.360
be that whatever you do, be it business, be
it government, be it any other with society,

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.060
it must be inclusive, which means your decision
must impact not only a segment of society,

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.880
but across the segment. Right from the bottom
of the pyramid to right up to the top. And

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.789
it must be sustainable. And by sustainability
I mean that there is only one planet and therefore,

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:38.510
whatever we do we must ensure this federation
is a concern of everybody in a seamless manner

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.829
across the world. Thank you.
