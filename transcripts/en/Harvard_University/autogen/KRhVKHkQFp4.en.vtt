that in you'll see in the book that I

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:18.210
that in you'll see in the book that I
 

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:22.560
that in you'll see in the book that I
it's also like liberals this extends

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:22.570
it's also like liberals this extends
 

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:23.850
it's also like liberals this extends
beyond the black left especially when I

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:23.860
beyond the black left especially when I
 

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:25.890
beyond the black left especially when I
started looking at rank-and-file because

00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:25.900
started looking at rank-and-file because
 

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:27.600
started looking at rank-and-file because
there is this issue of a lot of issues

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:27.610
there is this issue of a lot of issues
 

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:29.280
there is this issue of a lot of issues
do kind of get severed with the black

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:29.290
do kind of get severed with the black
 

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:32.040
do kind of get severed with the black
left in the 1950s but not this issue and

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:32.050
left in the 1950s but not this issue and
 

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:34.560
left in the 1950s but not this issue and
so it really does go beyond that

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:34.570
so it really does go beyond that
 

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:36.330
so it really does go beyond that

because nuclear weapons testing during
 

00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:31.510
because nuclear weapons testing during
the Cold War years is pretty much a

00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520

in like whether you think about the
 

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.109
in like whether you think about the
connection with the environmental

00:46:38.109 --> 00:46:38.119
connection with the environmental
 

00:46:38.119 --> 00:46:40.830

environmental and I am really curious

00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040
environmental and I am really curious
 

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:57.609

is a huge issue in fact I did a lot of

00:47:01.930 --> 00:47:01.940
is a huge issue in fact I did a lot of
 

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:04.330
is a huge issue in fact I did a lot of
research on environmental racism and

00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:04.340
research on environmental racism and
 

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.640
research on environmental racism and
nuclear testing and I didn't put in this

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:06.650
nuclear testing and I didn't put in this
 

00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:08.680
nuclear testing and I didn't put in this
book it may be a different articles or

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:08.690
book it may be a different articles or
 

00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:11.859
book it may be a different articles or
another book but so in terms of nuclear

00:47:11.859 --> 00:47:11.869
another book but so in terms of nuclear
 

00:47:11.869 --> 00:47:13.690
another book but so in terms of nuclear
testing one thing that I would see is I

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:13.700
testing one thing that I would see is I
 

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:16.510
testing one thing that I would see is I
would go into again black reporters and

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:16.520
would go into again black reporters and
 

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:18.250
would go into again black reporters and
see how are they reporting on this and

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:19.340
they were being invited to some of these
 

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:20.680
they were being invited to some of these
nuclear tests and what their reactions

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:20.690
nuclear tests and what their reactions
 

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:22.450
nuclear tests and what their reactions
were and was pretty horrific the other

00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:22.460
were and was pretty horrific the other
 

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:24.340
were and was pretty horrific the other
piece though is the connection I saw was

00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:24.350
piece though is the connection I saw was
 

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:26.109
piece though is the connection I saw was
African Americans who then themselves

connection there and saying were the
 

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:34.690
connection there and saying were the
same ways what's happening here to test

00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:34.700
same ways what's happening here to test
 

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:37.720

so limited that they were the jobs were
 

00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:56.290
so limited that they were the jobs were
in nuclear plants and they were not

00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:56.300
in nuclear plants and they were not
 

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:58.300

giving any protective equipment and I

00:47:58.300 --> 00:47:58.310
giving any protective equipment and I
 

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:00.520

00:53:11.090 --> 00:53:11.100
and so I yeah I think there's a great
 

00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:12.920
and so I yeah I think there's a great
film that's going to be coming out and

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:12.930
film that's going to be coming out and
 

00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:14.300
film that's going to be coming out and
the in the fall

00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:14.310
the in the fall
 

00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:17.060
the in the fall
that's called bound and it looks at this

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:17.070
that's called bound and it looks at this
 

00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:18.680
that's called bound and it looks at this
issue of African students in African

00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:18.690
issue of African students in African
 

00:53:18.690 --> 00:53:19.700
issue of African students in African
American students and how there's that

00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:19.710
American students and how there's that
 

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:21.260
American students and how there's that
disconnect there so I think we really

00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:21.270
disconnect there so I think we really
 

00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:24.320
disconnect there so I think we really
need to get back to that and you know

00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:24.330
need to get back to that and you know
 

00:53:24.330 --> 00:53:25.820

a half-hour presentation you cannot

00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:42.180
a half-hour presentation you cannot
 

00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:44.960
a half-hour presentation you cannot
include all of the granularity that's in

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:44.970
include all of the granularity that's in
 

00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:46.970
include all of the granularity that's in
your book but I'm wondering in your

00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:46.980
your book but I'm wondering in your
 

00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:51.140
your book but I'm wondering in your
research what was your sense of how much

00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:51.150
research what was your sense of how much
 

00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:54.320
research what was your sense of how much
of this phenomenon mapped on to the left

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:54.330
of this phenomenon mapped on to the left
 

00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:57.350
of this phenomenon mapped on to the left
or to put it differently did you not

00:53:57.350 --> 00:53:57.360
or to put it differently did you not
 

00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:00.530
or to put it differently did you not
find some anti-nuclear weapons sentiment

00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:00.540
find some anti-nuclear weapons sentiment
 

00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:03.530
find some anti-nuclear weapons sentiment
among black conservatives as well

00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:03.540
among black conservatives as well
 

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.270
among black conservatives as well
well again George Schuyler I would argue

00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280
well again George Schuyler I would argue
 

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:07.370
well again George Schuyler I would argue
as conservative and and he certainly was

00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:07.380
as conservative and and he certainly was
 

00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:08.570
as conservative and and he certainly was
speaking out against this in his

00:54:08.570 --> 00:54:08.580
speaking out against this in his
 

00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:11.810
speaking out against this in his
writings but other than that I didn't

00:54:11.810 --> 00:54:11.820
writings but other than that I didn't
 

00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:13.850
writings but other than that I didn't
come across and I and I did try to look

00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:13.860
come across and I and I did try to look
 

00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:15.920
come across and I and I did try to look
at the entire spectrum but I didn't come

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:15.930
at the entire spectrum but I didn't come
 

00:54:15.930 --> 00:54:17.750
at the entire spectrum but I didn't come
across a lot on the right that we're

00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760
across a lot on the right that we're
 

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:18.710
across a lot on the right that we're
looking at this which was surprising

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720
looking at this which was surprising
 

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.930
looking at this which was surprising
excite frankly you know you obviously

excite frankly you know you obviously
 

00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:22.040
excite frankly you know you obviously
you don't want to lead your research and

00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:22.050
you don't want to lead your research and
 

00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:24.380
you don't want to lead your research and
the research leads you but I was in many

00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:24.390
the research leads you but I was in many
 

00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:25.970
the research leads you but I was in many
ways I think the bomb doesn't

ways I think the bomb doesn't
 

00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:27.830

I mean wanting to save humanity
 

00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:32.180
I mean wanting to save humanity
shouldn't be a right or left issue but

00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:32.190
shouldn't be a right or left issue but
 

00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:34.430
shouldn't be a right or left issue but
it's the way it broke down but again I'm

00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:34.440
it's the way it broke down but again I'm
 

00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:37.850
it's the way it broke down but again I'm
looking at not all Democrats not all

Republicans that I'm looking
 

00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:40.340
Republicans that I'm looking
specifically at African that the black

community as much as I possibly could in
 

00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:47.450
community as much as I possibly could in
a large scope and what I saw was it

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:47.460
a large scope and what I saw was it
 

00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:49.130
a large scope and what I saw was it
wasn't so much about politics it was

00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:49.140
wasn't so much about politics it was
 

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:51.170
wasn't so much about politics it was
they're looking at this issue through a

00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:51.180
they're looking at this issue through a
 

00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:52.970
they're looking at this issue through a
completely different lens that others

00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:52.980
completely different lens that others
 

00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:54.350
completely different lens that others
weren't they were looking at this to a

00:54:54.350 --> 00:54:54.360
weren't they were looking at this to a
 

00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:55.850

lens of race through a lens of
 

00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:58.370
lens of race through a lens of
colonialism and that did appear mostly

00:54:58.370 --> 00:54:58.380
colonialism and that did appear mostly
 

00:54:58.380 --> 00:54:59.750
colonialism and that did appear mostly
on people that were that lean

00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760
on people that were that lean
 

00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.310
on people that were that lean
progressive that leaned on the on the

progressive that leaned on the on the
 

00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:03.230
progressive that leaned on the on the
left but I don't I don't think it was

00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:03.240
left but I don't I don't think it was
 

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:05.120

you know I didn't I did search but I

00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:05.130
you know I didn't I did search but I
 

00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:07.370
you know I didn't I did search but I
didn't see tons of black politicians

00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:07.380
didn't see tons of black politicians
 

00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:08.840
didn't see tons of black politicians
that were on the right coming out or

00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:08.850
that were on the right coming out or
 

00:55:08.850 --> 00:55:09.410
that were on the right coming out or
concerned

00:55:09.410 --> 00:55:09.420
concerned
 

00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:17.289
concerned
journalists coming out I didn't see that

00:55:17.289 --> 00:55:17.299
 
 

00:55:17.299 --> 00:55:22.069
 
well we we look at a litany of broken

00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079
well we we look at a litany of broken
 

00:55:22.079 --> 00:55:26.109
well we we look at a litany of broken
agreements particularly with the u.s.

00:55:26.109 --> 00:55:26.119
agreements particularly with the u.s.
 

00:55:26.119 --> 00:55:29.240

because we had Saddam pretty much at bay

00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:29.250
because we had Saddam pretty much at bay
 

00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:31.069
because we had Saddam pretty much at bay
and then they came up with

00:55:31.069 --> 00:55:31.079
and then they came up with
 

00:55:31.079 --> 00:55:33.829
and then they came up with
yellowcake while the UN inspectors were

00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839
yellowcake while the UN inspectors were
 

00:55:33.839 --> 00:55:35.990
yellowcake while the UN inspectors were
in there and they trumped up the charges

00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000
in there and they trumped up the charges
 

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.049
in there and they trumped up the charges
and then they took out Saddam well they

00:55:39.049 --> 00:55:39.059
and then they took out Saddam well they
 

00:55:39.059 --> 00:55:41.120
and then they took out Saddam well they
took out a set of tried to take out

00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:41.130
took out a set of tried to take out
 

00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:43.730
took out a set of tried to take out
Assad and he took out Gaddafi and he was

00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:43.740
Assad and he took out Gaddafi and he was
 

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:45.410
Assad and he took out Gaddafi and he was
playing ball and they still wanted to

00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:45.420
playing ball and they still wanted to
 

00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:47.809
playing ball and they still wanted to
get rid of him so and I think that has

00:55:47.809 --> 00:55:47.819
get rid of him so and I think that has
 

00:55:47.819 --> 00:55:50.599
get rid of him so and I think that has
to do with colonialism and politics of

00:55:50.599 --> 00:55:50.609
to do with colonialism and politics of
 

00:55:50.609 --> 00:55:53.770
to do with colonialism and politics of
that sort but with regards to Obama's

00:55:53.770 --> 00:55:53.780
that sort but with regards to Obama's
 

00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:56.630
that sort but with regards to Obama's
agreement with Iran the same thing could

00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640
agreement with Iran the same thing could
 

00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:59.599
agreement with Iran the same thing could
happen there if I ran so much as steps

00:55:59.599 --> 00:55:59.609
happen there if I ran so much as steps
 

00:55:59.609 --> 00:56:00.440
happen there if I ran so much as steps
out of line

00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:00.450
out of line
 

00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:02.870
out of line
once they have the agreement and they

00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880
once they have the agreement and they
 

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:05.539
once they have the agreement and they
start backtracking then their backs are

00:56:05.539 --> 00:56:05.549
start backtracking then their backs are
 

00:56:05.549 --> 00:56:06.589
start backtracking then their backs are
against the wall

00:56:06.589 --> 00:56:06.599
against the wall
 

00:56:06.599 --> 00:56:09.620
against the wall
and I'm not saying they need nuclear or

00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:09.630
and I'm not saying they need nuclear or
 

00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:11.480
and I'm not saying they need nuclear or
it should develop nuclear but basically

00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:11.490
it should develop nuclear but basically
 

00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:15.980
it should develop nuclear but basically
it's a form of nuclear blackmail in

00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:15.990
it's a form of nuclear blackmail in
 

00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:19.819
it's a form of nuclear blackmail in
terms of the counter threat against them

00:56:19.819 --> 00:56:19.829
terms of the counter threat against them
 

00:56:19.829 --> 00:56:22.430
terms of the counter threat against them
not developing it is the destruction of

00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:22.440
not developing it is the destruction of
 

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:24.770
not developing it is the destruction of
their potential of developing it in the

00:56:24.770 --> 00:56:24.780
their potential of developing it in the
 

00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:28.910
their potential of developing it in the
name of stability within the region and

00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:28.920
name of stability within the region and
 

00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:31.069
name of stability within the region and
I would contend that the possibility is

00:56:31.069 --> 00:56:31.079
I would contend that the possibility is
 

00:56:31.079 --> 00:56:33.349
I would contend that the possibility is
that the main destabilizer in the region

00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359
that the main destabilizer in the region
 

00:56:33.359 --> 00:56:34.670
that the main destabilizer in the region
from the point of view of nuclear

00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:34.680
from the point of view of nuclear
 

00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:37.700
from the point of view of nuclear
weapons is Israel because they have 200

00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:37.710
weapons is Israel because they have 200
 

00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:41.030
weapons is Israel because they have 200
and what are they there for and isn't

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040
and what are they there for and isn't
 

00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:42.650
and what are they there for and isn't
anybody complaining about that and

00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:42.660
anybody complaining about that and
 

00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:44.530
anybody complaining about that and
telling them to get rid of theirs right

00:56:44.530 --> 00:56:44.540
telling them to get rid of theirs right
 

00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:46.789
telling them to get rid of theirs right
so there's a couple things that kind of

00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799
so there's a couple things that kind of
 

00:56:46.799 --> 00:56:48.920
so there's a couple things that kind of
unpackage there and one is the obvious

00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:48.930
unpackage there and one is the obvious
 

00:56:48.930 --> 00:56:51.910
unpackage there and one is the obvious
that it is you have to look and say okay

00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920
that it is you have to look and say okay
 

00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:55.370
that it is you have to look and say okay
how can he US or Israel for that matter

00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:55.380
how can he US or Israel for that matter
 

00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:57.200
how can he US or Israel for that matter
tell anybody what to do about nuclear

00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:57.210
tell anybody what to do about nuclear
 

00:56:57.210 --> 00:56:58.579
tell anybody what to do about nuclear
weapons in the region when Israel's the

00:56:58.579 --> 00:56:58.589
weapons in the region when Israel's the
 

00:56:58.589 --> 00:57:00.349
weapons in the region when Israel's the
only country that has them u.s. the only

00:57:00.349 --> 00:57:00.359
only country that has them u.s. the only
 

00:57:00.359 --> 00:57:01.910
only country that has them u.s. the only
one to actually use them terms of

00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920
one to actually use them terms of
 

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:02.990
one to actually use them terms of
blackmail if you're right

00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:03.000
blackmail if you're right
 

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.559
blackmail if you're right
a friend Dan Ellsberg always says that

00:57:05.559 --> 00:57:05.569
a friend Dan Ellsberg always says that
 

00:57:05.569 --> 00:57:08.359
a friend Dan Ellsberg always says that
we can we use nuclear weapons all the

00:57:08.359 --> 00:57:08.369
we can we use nuclear weapons all the
 

00:57:08.369 --> 00:57:09.680
we can we use nuclear weapons all the
time in the same way that if you rob a

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:09.690
time in the same way that if you rob a
 

00:57:09.690 --> 00:57:10.789
time in the same way that if you rob a
bank you can put them gone up to

00:57:10.789 --> 00:57:10.799
bank you can put them gone up to
 

00:57:10.799 --> 00:57:11.839
bank you can put them gone up to
somebody said you don't have to pull the

00:57:11.839 --> 00:57:11.849
somebody said you don't have to pull the
 

00:57:11.849 --> 00:57:12.799
somebody said you don't have to pull the
trigger and you can still get all the

00:57:12.799 --> 00:57:12.809
trigger and you can still get all the
 

00:57:12.809 --> 00:57:14.960
trigger and you can still get all the
money that you want I disagree with the

00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:14.970
money that you want I disagree with the
 

00:57:14.970 --> 00:57:17.030
money that you want I disagree with the
argument that if a country has nuclear

00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:17.040
argument that if a country has nuclear
 

00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.530
argument that if a country has nuclear
weapons if Iran had them and somehow

00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:18.540
weapons if Iran had them and somehow
 

00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:19.970
weapons if Iran had them and somehow
that makes them a more of a player or

00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:19.980
that makes them a more of a player or
 

00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:21.190
that makes them a more of a player or
keeps them

00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200
keeps them
 

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:23.940
keeps them
from from an attack from somebody else

00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:23.950
from from an attack from somebody else
 

00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:26.190
from from an attack from somebody else
we've just seen too many close calls

00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:26.200
we've just seen too many close calls
 

00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.300
we've just seen too many close calls
where we've just gotten lucky like with

00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:28.310
where we've just gotten lucky like with
 

00:57:28.310 --> 00:57:29.620
where we've just gotten lucky like with
the Cuban Missile Crisis so I don't

00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:29.630
the Cuban Missile Crisis so I don't
 

00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:30.850
the Cuban Missile Crisis so I don't
agree that that you know if everybody

00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:30.860
agree that that you know if everybody
 

00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:32.170
agree that that you know if everybody
has them then it'll just keep that over

00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:32.180
has them then it'll just keep that over
 

00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:34.570
has them then it'll just keep that over
them that's the solution but in terms of

00:57:34.570 --> 00:57:34.580
them that's the solution but in terms of
 

00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:37.180
them that's the solution but in terms of
Iran we have to take it one step at a

00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:37.190
Iran we have to take it one step at a
 

00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:40.570
Iran we have to take it one step at a
time and right now if this president

00:57:40.570 --> 00:57:40.580
time and right now if this president
 

00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:42.340
time and right now if this president
it's amazing to me if any other

00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:42.350
it's amazing to me if any other
 

00:57:42.350 --> 00:57:46.840

diplomacy he'd be on money right now
it's so we have to see how this plays

00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:52.730
it's so we have to see how this plays
 

00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:55.750

I'm curious I I heard you as arguing

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:10.700
I'm curious I I heard you as arguing
 

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:16.870
I'm curious I I heard you as arguing
that the solid areas between people

01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880
that the solid areas between people
 

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.700
that the solid areas between people
concerned about nuclear weapons reacting

01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:18.710

to what happened in Japan and African

01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:20.750
to what happened in Japan and African
 

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:22.090
to what happened in Japan and African
Americans that this was was building on

01:00:22.090 --> 01:00:22.100
Americans that this was was building on
 

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:25.090
Americans that this was was building on
pre-existing solid areas between African

01:00:25.090 --> 01:00:25.100
pre-existing solid areas between African
 

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:27.310
pre-existing solid areas between African
Americans and Japanese people but my

01:00:27.310 --> 01:00:27.320
Americans and Japanese people but my
 

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.230
Americans and Japanese people but my
understand is that that that those solid

01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:29.240
understand is that that that those solid
 

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:32.050
understand is that that that those solid
areas had had basically been fractured

01:00:32.050 --> 01:00:32.060
areas had had basically been fractured
 

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:34.180
areas had had basically been fractured
and that that that had all fallen apart

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:34.190
and that that that had all fallen apart
 

01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:36.340
and that that that had all fallen apart
that maybe 10 years 15 15 years earlier

01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:36.350
that maybe 10 years 15 15 years earlier
 

01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:38.530
that maybe 10 years 15 15 years earlier
people like Sarah Briggs had argued and

01:00:38.530 --> 01:00:38.540
people like Sarah Briggs had argued and
 

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:41.260
people like Sarah Briggs had argued and
seen black people had argued that that

01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:41.270
seen black people had argued that that
 

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:43.630
seen black people had argued that that
the Japanese Empire is an example to

01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:43.640
the Japanese Empire is an example to
 

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.280
the Japanese Empire is an example to
follow but I had understood that during

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:45.290
follow but I had understood that during
 

01:00:45.290 --> 01:00:47.650
follow but I had understood that during
the very ideological 1930s that all that

01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:47.660
the very ideological 1930s that all that
 

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:49.120
the very ideological 1930s that all that
had crumbled and so I'm wondering if

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:49.130
had crumbled and so I'm wondering if
 

01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:50.830
had crumbled and so I'm wondering if
that the drop of the bomb is is actually

01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:50.840
that the drop of the bomb is is actually
 

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:53.260
that the drop of the bomb is is actually
an agent of pulling together

01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:53.270

an agent of pulling together
solidarity's rather than just a story of

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:55.010
solidarity's rather than just a story of
 

01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:56.920
solidarity's rather than just a story of
continuity and then the question becomes

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:56.930
continuity and then the question becomes
 

01:00:56.930 --> 01:01:00.730
continuity and then the question becomes
what what makes that likely and so one

01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:00.740
what what makes that likely and so one
 

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:03.010
what what makes that likely and so one
question I have yeah I'm sympathetic to
