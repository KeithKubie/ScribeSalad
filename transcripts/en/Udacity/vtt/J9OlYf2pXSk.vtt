00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, being a conductor means the electrons are free to move, not protons.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Protons like I said before are really quite big. Electrons are tiny.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Electrons are easy to move around. So positive charges aren't going to do any flowing.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But what will happen is some electrons will flow from A to B.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Remember, electrons have a negative charge

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and they'll do that because this positive charge is attracting them.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And that is our second method of charging. Charging by conduction.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It's when you touch a charged object to an uncharged object,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and the uncharged object becomes charged.

00:00:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
There's one more very clever method of charging an object that involves polarization.
