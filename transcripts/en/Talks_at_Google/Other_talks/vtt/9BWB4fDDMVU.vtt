&gt;&gt;Male presenter: Hello, everybody. Thanks
for coming to Digital Arts@Google, the artist

00:00:10.161 --> 00:00:18.500
lecture series for the second exhibition.
Today, we have a great speaker line-up for

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:31.510
you: Eduardo Kac, Marina Zurkow, Sandra Cordero
and our very own Andrew Senior. So, the Digital

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:39.610
Arts@Google Exhibition Series was started
by Josh Mittlemen, when he was thinking about

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.269
Google's mission, which is to organize the
world's information and make it accessible.

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:52.150
And being here in New York City, and especially
in Chelsea, in the arts district, he thought,

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.530
"Well, art is a great way to access or understand
information and so Google should be involved

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:10.050
in art and so he found Nina Colosi and invited
her to curate a series of art shows here to

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:19.049
further that and to also foster a collaboration
between artists and engineers. And the, and

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:26.180
this is the third lecture series and they'll
be another one. The next show opens, let's

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:34.820
see what, Nina, remind me what. Next Thursday
is the opening for the next show here in Chelsea

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.909
Market. So, tonight we have first

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.030
[pause]

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:57.909
speaking first will be Eduardo Kac, a pioneer
of telecommunications art started in the pre-Web

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.510
80s and then emerged in the early 90s with
his radical works combining telerobotics and

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.220
living organisms. His visionary integration
of robotics, biology and networking explores

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:16.790
the fluidity of subject positions in the post-Digital
world. His work deals with the mythopoetics

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:24.069
of online experience, cultural impact of biotechnology,
conditions of memory in the digital age, distributive

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:31.739
collective agency and the creation of life
itself. At the dawn of the 21st Century, Kac

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:38.689
opened a new direction with contemporary art
with his transgenic art. First, the groundbreaking

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:44.819
Genesis in 1999, which included the artists
gene that he invented and then with his fluorescent

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.540
rabbit called Alba. Mr. Kac.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.409
&gt;&gt;Kac: Thank you.

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:52.409
[applause]

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:58.760
Thank you very much. So, in reality, and this
is an interesting coincidence, those are exactly

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.110
the works I'm gonna be presenting: the work
that goes with memory, the Genesis and GFP

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:15.709
Bunny. So, we have 20 minutes and I will then
begin in 1997, with this artwork called Time

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.879
Capsule. And it's an important work in my
introductory because, for me, it represents

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:28.860
a turning point. It's a moment in which I
begin to expand my digital work in the realm

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:36.709
of biology. The term "bioart" I coined back
in '97 specifically to signify, to connote,

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:45.630
this passage. And the Time Capsule has, as
referenced, these seven sepia tone photographs

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:53.500
that my grandmother brought from Poland before
'39, when she escaped the war. And it is in

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.739
front of the seven sepia tone photographs
that represent members of her family who did

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:07.670
not survive the war, that I implanted a microchip
live, on television and on the Web, in front

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:15.969
of them to confront the idea of analog memory
with digital memory, because a microchip records

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:23.050
information and in the context of the live
broadcast, one of the segments included a

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:30.320
reading of the microchip content inside my
body, both through the live program and the

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.320
Webcast.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:47.640
[Women and men speaking polish speaking on
the video ]

00:04:47.640 --> 00:05:05.760
So, the doctor who was assisting is asked
to describe what's going on and he says, almost

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.800
like narrating a soccer match, "Well, now
the artist is implanting a microchip and he

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:21.750
is slowly moving the needle and it's over
the skin. This was, he's narrating, cause

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:28.170
of course he was, he was afraid that he would
lose his license if he actually did the work

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:35.130
himself. So, he told me how to do this. Not
that I have the habit of using syringes. And

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:42.180
you see if you look behind him, you see the
seven sepia tone photographs on the wall.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:48.520
So, this idea of confronting the changing
role of memory as everything becomes digital.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:54.810
Analog memories are externalized, digital
memories become internalized, with the exception,

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:01.590
of course, that we also internalize analog
memories and, in this particular case, the

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:08.780
digital memory is retrieved. So, I had the
scanner connected to a robotic finger and

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:14.830
through the Web.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.840
[Women and men speaking polish continues on
the video]

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:33.440
This is the third segment. So, I myself did
not know what the number was. The content

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:39.570
of the microchip is a sequence of nine digits,
which you see on the screen there. And I had

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.790
bought the six-pack, not of beer, but of microchips
and just picked one out of the box at the

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.120
last minute. So, I myself did not know what
the number was.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:07:03.720
[Women and men speaking polish continues on
the video]

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:11.860
So, this, in '97, creating this work in which
tissue and microchips come together because

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:20.750
tissue forms around the microchip to secure
it in position. The microchip has biocompatible

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:31.361
glass. This question of digital, the digital
and the biological started to take center

00:07:31.361 --> 00:07:39.910
stage for me and in '98, I wrote a text called
"Transgenic Art" more clearly signaling the

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:49.310
fact that I wanted to focus on the creation
of new life forms in the context of art. And

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:54.720
produced then, in 1999, my first transgenic
work called "Genesis."

00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:31.850
[electronic music plays]

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:56.610
[bell chimes]

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:04.529
So, what is going on in this work? It's easier
to understand once we look at this diagram.

00:09:04.529 --> 00:09:10.240
The starting point for me was the appropriation
of a passage from the Bible, from the book

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:15.990
of Genesis. I don't own a Bible, so I went
online, found the King James Version, copied

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:21.740
and pasted into Microsoft Word. And if you're
thinking James and combine that with Bill

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.649
Gates, that may be enough for a conceptual
artwork.

00:09:24.649 --> 00:09:25.649
[laughter]

00:09:25.649 --> 00:09:30.899
But I'm not a conceptual artist, so I persevered
and translated that to Morse code. Straightforward

00:09:30.899 --> 00:09:36.120
Morse code, as you know, dots and dashes,
so what you see here under this arrow is a

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:42.750
direct Morse code translation of that passage
from the Bible, which is a significant passage

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:49.519
in the sense that this is where God gives
man total control over all life, and has been

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:57.209
down the drain from there, as you know. So,
inside the box, you see a code that I created

00:09:57.209 --> 00:10:06.029
specifically for this work. On the left side,
you have the, what linguists call the motivated

00:10:06.029 --> 00:10:15.379
section of the code. Because C, which represents
cytosine in DNA, is round and so is the dot,

00:10:15.379 --> 00:10:22.550
so I established that analogy. And because
T is straight and so is the dash, I established

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:29.980
that analogy. On the right, you have the arbitrary
part of the code, so space between the letters

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:37.170
became guanine and space between words became
adenine. So, how does this work? You have

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:45.870
a direct translation, if you look at the bottom;
you have C-T-C-C-G. So, C-T-C-C is dot dash

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:54.749
dot dot space. And it goes on like that. So,
C-T-C-C, dot dash dot dot, is the letter L

00:10:54.749 --> 00:11:03.339
that you have up here from the original English
text. The result is that the sequence of 360

00:11:03.339 --> 00:11:09.870
genetic bases encodes the passage from the
Bible. So, when I'm doing this, I'm still

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:16.769
working on the computer screen and I have
a text file. So I copied from my text file,

00:11:16.769 --> 00:11:23.230
pasted that into the email program and sent
that to a company specialized in DNA synthesis.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:29.380
Two weeks later, I got a FedEx package with
the DNA. And you look at the DNA and it's

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:35.990
disembodied DNA and it becomes evident to
you that all this narrative that DNA has a

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:41.089
central and dominant position in controlling
life, when you see DNA outside of the body

00:11:41.089 --> 00:11:44.949
it is very clear that without the body and
without the environment in which the body

00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:53.050
is located, DNA cannot do anything. So, what
I created then was the Genesis bacteria, which

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:57.259
you see in this video. So now, if we look
at this again, it will make more sense.

00:11:57.259 --> 00:11:58.259
[electronic music plays]

00:11:58.259 --> 00:12:06.899
You come into the gallery, you see the Genesis
DNA sequence on one wall; a very large projection,

00:12:06.899 --> 00:12:11.420
live from the Petri dish, which is in the
center. What you see now, the biblical passage,

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:17.389
which you see on the other wall. Behind you,
there is Morse. And here, the Web interface

00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:24.009
that allows you to turn on a UV light source
in the gallery; from home or in the gallery

00:12:24.009 --> 00:12:29.959
itself. And this is a short-wave UV, which
means that due to the high concentrated energy,

00:12:29.959 --> 00:12:36.769
it causes real biological mutation in the
DNA. In other words, if this work is in Tokyo,

00:12:36.769 --> 00:12:42.389
from New York you can change the word of God
in the body of the bacteria in Tokyo with

00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:50.809
just one click. So, after the work was finished,
it premiered at Ars Electronica in 1999, I

00:12:50.809 --> 00:12:57.620
took the bacteria back to the lab and read
the mutation and developed a series of works

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:03.050
with the mutant text in English because I
used the code to read it back to English.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:10.720
Now, if you think about what this means, you
are encoding digital information into a living

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:16.120
organism. You are changing that and then you
are retrieving it. That's exactly what we

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:21.889
do with computers; input, processing and output,
except that you're doing that with a living

00:13:21.889 --> 00:13:28.920
organism in real time. So, to me, that represents
certain significant aspects of life in the

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:36.480
21st Century in which, not only philosophically,
but materially, there is fundamentally really

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:44.899
no separation between digital and biological.
Processes can occur in similar manner in both

00:13:44.899 --> 00:13:53.059
environments, in both media, if we can say
so. But of course, when you talk about the

00:13:53.059 --> 00:13:59.740
living, when you talk about in the context
of art, creating an entirely new life form,

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:05.800
you have to recognize that you're not dealing
with an object because the life form that

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:13.061
you create is alive like you and I. So, it
shares the same properties of any living organism

00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:22.730
and empathy and responsibility become paramount
in this context. And a good example of that

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:29.430
case is the second transgenic artwork that
I created called GFP Bunny. GFP Bunny is a

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:35.250
piece in which I used GFP, green fluorescent
protein, the DNA that codes for this protein,

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:42.600
that produces green light, and created a green
glowing bunny. There was an agreement between

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.899
myself and the lab that I commissioned to
make this work for me and the director of

00:14:45.899 --> 00:14:52.260
the lab, at the very last minute, it was the
year 2000, you remember Doomsday, the apocalypse,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:56.629
Y2K, everything satellites will fall, computers
will stop, it's the end of the world? Maybe

00:14:56.629 --> 00:15:01.980
that played a role in his decision to censor
the work, but the fact is that that censorship

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:07.529
became very controversial. We have a four
minute clip that shows a bit of the controversy

00:15:07.529 --> 00:15:08.529
around this work.

00:15:08.529 --> 00:15:13.059
&gt;&gt;Male video narrator: This is the BBC World
service.

00:15:13.059 --> 00:15:19.119
&gt;&gt;Female video narrator: Have you heard of
Alba the bunny? Alba lives at an agricultural

00:15:19.119 --> 00:15:24.720
institute near Paris and she looks like any
other plain, old, white rabbit. Well, that's

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:31.160
until you put her under a blue light, at which
point, dear little Alba begins to glow green

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.600
and it's not in the name of science, before
you ask, but in the name of art.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.800
&gt;&gt;ABC Male video narrator (Peter Jennings):
We touched on the genetic engineering controversy

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:44.380
earlier in the broadcast. When we saw this
story in yesterday's edition of the Boston

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:50.399
Globe, we thought, "Surely not." On the contrary,
surely. Here's ABC's Bill Blakemore.

00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:56.360
&gt;&gt;Bill: Directors of the lab in France that
created the rabbit are not letting anyone

00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:01.689
in to see it, but you can see a picture of
the rabbit, Alba, on the website of the artist

00:16:01.689 --> 00:16:05.740
in Chicago, Eduardo Kac, who commissioned
the lab to create her.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:09.290
&gt;&gt;Stuart Newman: When you start to genetically
engineer animals as part of an artwork, I

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:14.329
think that you're really beginning to cross
a line that isn't necessary to cross.

00:16:14.329 --> 00:16:19.029
&gt;&gt;Bill: But animal rights groups say that
Alba's artistic visibility may publicize her

00:16:19.029 --> 00:16:20.329
plight as a lab animal.

00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:24.240
&gt;&gt;Lisa Lange: If this has been highlighted
in this experiment then it is helpful for

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.540
laboratory animals everywhere.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:32.601
&gt;&gt;Male BBC Video narrator: Email us at this
address, alcookbbc.co.uk. It's time now to

00:16:32.601 --> 00:16:37.709
talk about a rabbit that's got a few people
into a bit of a stew. That's because this

00:16:37.709 --> 00:16:44.779
rabbit is the center of a project that sparked
off a debate involving art and science. Spell

00:16:44.779 --> 00:16:48.410
out, if you will, the artistic message of
this project.

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:54.370
&gt;&gt;Kac: Well, there are several messages, but
one of them is the fact that Alba, like any

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:58.779
other transgenic animal, has a cognitive and
emotional life that must be acknowledged in

00:16:58.779 --> 00:16:59.779
a social space.

00:16:59.779 --> 00:17:00.779
[jazz type music]

00:17:00.779 --> 00:17:01.779
&gt;&gt;man from video #1: Who plays God in the
21st century? It looks like you and your buddies

00:17:01.779 --> 00:17:02.779
do, huh? Rabbits, you know, have existed in
for how many billions of years and why do

00:17:02.779 --> 00:17:31.490
you think you're so important that you can
mess with it? I think you're a pawn of these

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:34.920
biotechnology companies and I'm sure you probably
didn't have to pay very much for this to happen.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.270
I'm sure they loved to tally it as another
one of their successes.

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:46.940
&gt;&gt;man from video #2: When ancestral man picked
up a stone and called it a tool, we radically

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:57.450
changed this planet. Ever since that time,
ok? And when we accepted the line from Genesis

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:11.370
that we hold dominion over all the animals
and the fish of the sea, as a society, this

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:21.050
is generally what we do. All societies, and
we must question each and every technological

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:30.700
advance and we haven't done a good job of
it and I'm glad that you are doing this project

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:37.340
to bring these issues to the forefront to
produce these forums when we can't hash these

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.960
problems out because, prior to this, there
isn't enough discussion.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.340
&gt;&gt;Male NPR announcer: This is wait, wait,
don't tell me. The NPR News Quiz.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:44.340
&gt;&gt;Male NPR Host: So, you're ready to play
here?

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.340
&gt;&gt;man #3: Sure.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.120
&gt;&gt;NPR Host: All right, here's your first limerick.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:53.690
&gt;&gt;NPR announcer: Old Noah cried out, "Oh,
dagnabit, we really must learn to cohabit.

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:59.211
If you glow in the dark, come on down to the
ark. I've got space for a mutant, green"

00:18:59.211 --> 00:19:00.270
&gt;&gt;man #3: Rabbit?

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:01.320
&gt;&gt;NPR Host: Yes.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.320
[bell rings]

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.890
Unbelievable as it may sound, it's true. Alba
is an albino rabbit that, under regular light,

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.000
just looks furry and cute, but turn on the
black light--

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.570
&gt;&gt;Kac: So, this gives us a sense of the kinds
of conversations, debates, discourses that

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:23.320
have been generated around this work, which
was part of my intention originally. And basically

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:31.620
to conclude, I will point out that because
of the censorship and the particular nature

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:37.840
of the reception of this work, which has been
going on for ten years, I have developed a

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:44.640
whole series of works under the rubric of
Rabbit Remix. But the one that I would like

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:56.140
to present to, to close my presentation tonight
is this one called La Googleglyph. And I am

00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:05.510
very thankful to Scott and Nina for their
help in making this a reality. So, in January

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:14.100
of this year, I created this work initially
and I looked at this satellite from a company

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:19.400
called Digital Globe, which is one of the
company's that Google uses for Google Earth

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:25.840
and this satellite, called WorldView 2 had
blown up at that point. And I studied it and

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:31.500
came to the conclusion that the satellite
sees the world in grids of pixels that measure

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:39.920
50 centimeters. So, I created a blogoglyph,
which is a series from the Rabbit Remix that

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:47.360
has this bunny image, using pixels measuring
50 centimeters. So, here I am standing on

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:55.190
the roof of the building where I had my exhibition
and we have the work now visible. It was created

00:20:55.190 --> 00:21:04.130
specifically for this satellite. So, let's
see if we can zoom in and actually see it

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:09.460
through Google Earth itself. It is my goal
to basically create La Googleglyphs all over

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:21.510
the planet and allow us, with just a few clicks
to zoom in and see them. Hold on. There. There

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.100
it is.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.390
[laughter]

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:32.771
And, into the eye of the storm. There we go.
Thanks.

00:21:32.771 --> 00:21:35.610
[applause]

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:59.760
&gt;&gt;presenter: We have a few minutes for questions
for Eduardo. All the way in the back.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:12.050
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #1: So, I think that
obviously the rabbit thing [inaudible]. I

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:15.010
guess I was a little more angry with myself,
too, when you described it there until I realized

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:19.920
[inaudible]. I guess I really do kind of have
questioned the empathy of working with an

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:44.780
animal who can't choose to make that decision.
My own kind of moral test is would I do that

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:55.870
to a family member or loved one? I would say,
you know, a family member or a loved one wanted

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:57.400
to do that themselves, but if they didn't
have an ability to choose then [inaudible]

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.650
I guess I question whether you were true to
the rabbit when it couldn't really choose

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:08.310
it and would you advocate even given then
positive benefits to animal research or any

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:18.150
testing would not want to draw the plight
of criminals in the United States to light

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:19.990
by making [inaudible].

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:23.060
&gt;&gt;presenter: How would you respond?

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:28.530
&gt;&gt;Kac: Sure. This comment gives me the opportunity
to clarify a very important point. Is that

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:34.420
you don't take an existing rabbit and modify
it. That's impossible. So, the work you do,

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:40.990
you do in the microscope with a single cell.
You, pretty much, you combine transgenics

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:49.160
with IVF. So, basically, you have the egg
and then you have the male reproductive cell

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:55.471
inside the egg and it is in the male reproductive
cell, just one single cell, that you introduce

00:23:55.471 --> 00:24:01.982
the DNA. So, there is no rabbit there that
you introduce. I understand that for, if we're

00:24:01.982 --> 00:24:06.920
not familiar with the process, we might picture
something cruel that you take a bunny and

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.690
you inject something to it, but it's not like
that at all. We work in the microscope with

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:16.240
an individual cell and then you're bringing
into the world a healthy bunny. So, it's a

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:23.970
very different process. And the other aspect
of this is that it is intrinsic to life that

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:32.810
the life that comes into the world does so
by a process that is developed by a previous

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:38.960
generation or by another living being. In
other words, no single life form in the world

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:45.060
ever has the choice to come into the world.
It's always a decision, say, of our parents

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:51.970
or if it's a non-human, it's a decision of
a human, so it is always, in this case there's

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:58.750
no exception. The decision is always made
by others. The question here is bringing into

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:04.880
the world a life form that did not exist before
and then we're back to the beginning of your

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:11.060
comment, which has to do with the responsibility
and ethics. That is why, for me, it was absolutely

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:18.170
indispensible to bring the bunny home so that
I could be personally responsible for it and

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:23.320
when the censorship came, I started a whole
campaign to free the bunny and I went back

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:28.160
to Paris. I spent nine days in Paris every
day mobilizing public opinion, and I created

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:34.440
a flag, and I gave public talks, and I tried
to work with the lab, and once it became clear

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:39.190
that that was not going to happen, rather
than succumbing and accepting what they wanted,

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:44.890
which was to make Alba disappear, then I continued
to develop a whole series of works to keep

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:51.780
her virtually alive so that her memory would
not be erased by those who tried to make her

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:52.780
disappear.

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.860
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #1: Whatever happened
to Alba?

00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:01.440
&gt;&gt;Kac: She never left the lab. And rabbits
usually live, on average, eight years. So,

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.990
it's ten now.

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:08.300
&gt;&gt;Female audience member #1: Do you still
have that microchip in your ankle?

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.300
&gt;&gt;Kac: I do.

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:10.300
&gt;&gt;member #2: Has it ever come in handy?

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:14.250
&gt;&gt;Kac: No, but it, if you're wondering if
it makes airports sound alarms, it does not.

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:20.080
My belt has more metal than the microchip.
But next time, if you remind me, next time

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.085
I'll bring the scanner and you can scan it.

00:26:21.085 --> 00:26:23.800
&gt;&gt;presenter: [inaudible]. Any more questions
for Eduardo?

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.740
&gt;&gt;Kac: Thank you. One more?

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:56.910
&gt;&gt;Male audience member#2: Hi, I was wondering
about the all the process of how you transcoded

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:57.910
the passage of the Bible into Morse code and
how that was transcoded to DNA code, I got

00:26:57.910 --> 00:26:58.910
lost because the bacteria that was created
out of that or from that?

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:02.630
&gt;&gt;Kac: Sure. See, the way you do this is you
take the DNA and you insert that DNA in what

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:07.950
is called a plasmid. A plasmid is a ring of
DNA at this point, you find it in nature,

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:14.190
but at this point is engineered with areas
specifically for you to insert the DNA that

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:20.290
you're interested in working with. So, you
move your DNA into the plasmid, the plasmid

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:27.770
goes into the bacterium, basically in a solution;
it's pretty mechanical, really. It's a solution

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:34.870
that makes the bacteria open up and in that
liquid it, the plasmid just naturally moves

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:41.930
in. And how do you know that all bacteria
have actually accepted your DNA? The plasmid

00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:49.240
has also a sequence that endows the bacterium
to resistance to antibiotics. In other words,

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:53.340
after you do that work, you put the bacteria
in another medium with antibiotics. Those,

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:57.270
that's what you're doing, pretty much straight
forward Darwinian selection at that point.

00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:02.650
Those that have accepted your DNAs survive
and those that didn't just don't.

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:05.740
&gt;&gt;member #3: You killed the bacteria.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:11.680
&gt;&gt;Kac: I do, yes. I do. And another way that
you see it is there is another sequence in

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:18.720
there, which allows the bacteria to glow with
the same gene that Alba glows. So, you do

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:23.630
this first phase to select and then you have
confirmation because all you have to do is

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:28.170
put the Petri dish on a UV light box and boom.
If they glow, you see that they accepted your

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:29.170
plasmid.

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:30.170
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yes.

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:38.570
&gt;&gt;member #4: Does anyone like, dog breeders
or horse breeders, can anyone step forward

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:43.540
if [inaudible] we breed for these other [inaudible].

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:49.480
&gt;&gt;Kac: No, and the at one point the media
never really talked about because obviously

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:53.330
they're more interested in selling papers
than really disclosing how this works, is

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:58.280
that Alba doesn't glow all the time. If she
was walking here, she wouldn't be glowing

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:05.470
because you absolutely must have two things
to see the glow. One is a blue light of a

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:15.030
very specific frequency because the GFP protein
and the source have to go together. There

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:18.720
are several kinds of lights, several kinds
of proteins, they have to go together. So,

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:22.720
it has to be a very specific frequency of
blue for that particular protein. That's one

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:29.090
thing. And for you to see, you need to do
so through a yellow filter because you gotta

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:33.420
block the blue light, otherwise you're gonna
have, she's albino, so otherwise you're gonna

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:37.410
have blue and white and that's what you're
gonna see. You gotta block the blue and then

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:44.741
you can see the green emission. And, of course,
this is never mentioned. Ok, thanks.

00:29:44.741 --> 00:29:48.790
[applause]

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:58.560
&gt;&gt;presenter: Next up we have Andrew Senior
who is a British artist, living and working

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:03.350
in New York, in sculpture and electronic art.
He is exhibited internationally including

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:11.880
an honorable mention at PreVida 8.0, the BlindArt
Foundation Prize, and Madrid Abierto, 2008.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:20.150
He has co-chaired the ACM Multi Media Conference
Arts Track and Andrew Senior's art is informed

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:26.220
by his technical research in human-computer
interaction, multimedia and computer vision,

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:31.460
for which he holds several patents and is
published extensively. He currently works

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:37.970
on speech recognition in the research group
at Google, here in New York City.

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:38.970
[applause]

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:49.420
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Thank you very much, Scott. So,
today I'd like to talk about the piece that

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:56.450
I have in this exhibition, which is Couch
Potato Farm, and after I've spoken, Sandra

00:30:56.450 --> 00:31:03.000
will talk about the piece that I worked with
her and Jason Weston on, called Refugium.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:14.870
That was a collaborative effort. But I'll
talk about Couch Potato Farm first. And like

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:22.390
Scott himself and Eduardo, I got interested
in artificial life projects a few years ago

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:31.680
and Couch Potato Farm was my first work investigating
artificial life. Previously, I'd worked in

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:37.070
steel sculpture and landscape art and then
started to transition to electronic works.

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:41.860
These are some of the previous works and then
I started to think about artificial life and

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:47.740
we've just seen some of the most important
work in artificial life. But artificial life

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:54.370
covers a wide range of types of art, including
biological experimentation, like we've just

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:59.190
seen, robotic systems that behave like living
creatures, or computer simulation of life

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:08.750
and that's what Couch Potato Farm is. It's
an electronic simulation of an ecosystem.

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:12.820
So, I imagined what would life be like if
it could live in television signals, instead

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:19.940
of living in the real world? And we have all
these different sources of electromagnetic

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:25.730
radiation that surround us all the time. Increasingly,
we have Wi-Fi, television, radio, cellular

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:32.730
telephones, we still don't really know the
effects that they have on real life, but this

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:38.140
initial work now in capturing the energy from
television transmissions to power electronic

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:45.250
devices. So, we do actually have now examples
of life that is powered by television signals.

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:48.850
But I wondered what would happen if we could
actually have an ecosystem that lived within

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:54.370
the television signals? So, I created Couch
Potato Farm that is a virtual ecosystem that

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:59.890
watches television. So, it's a software system
into which I feed a television signal from

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:06.950
a television tuner. So, this is an example
image from a television program and it lives

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:13.460
off the television signal and you can see
its effects by it's, it changes the television

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:16.880
signal. So, if we had a clean transmission
we'd see the image on the left, but after

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:23.130
the ecosystem has extracted some of the energy
from that television signal, then we get an

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:27.840
image, a distorted image on the right. And
you can see the work in the back corner of

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:37.050
the lobby here running on a series of programs
just from live television. So, I wanted to

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:43.320
explain a little bit about how the system
works. It takes in television signals from

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:48.580
the TV tuner and then processes them through
two kinds of artificial life systems. One

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:57.340
is a cellular automaton, which is similar
to Conway's Life. So, this is an earlier example

00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:04.530
of a computer program that, in some sense,
simulates life. It takes the state of one

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:11.280
time, applies the series of rules, and then
generates a new state. And the basic domain

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:20.530
of my Couch Potato Farm is a cellular automaton,
like this, that lives off the television signals.

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:25.570
So, it takes in red, green and blue energies
in each pixel and now it has three layers

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:33.669
instead of this single layer like Conway's
Life. And adjacent cells affect each other,

00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:38.639
but they're also affected by the external
signal. So, where we have a lot of blue, then

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:43.950
we'll get very strong blue potatoes I call
them in this field because they watch television

00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:50.859
all the time. And that blue, if you have a
strong blue potato in a particular pixel,

00:34:50.859 --> 00:34:56.369
then it will tend to drain out the color from,
the blue color from the television signal.

00:34:56.369 --> 00:35:03.619
So, what you see in the affected television
has the blue color drained out. And so we

00:35:03.619 --> 00:35:13.319
have a time delay as we see one color, then
that gets drained out of subsequent images.

00:35:13.319 --> 00:35:19.320
Then I hypothesized another part of the ecosystem,
which were animals, which were mobile creatures

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:26.170
that can move around within the ecosystem
and they would interact. They would feed off

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:31.970
the potatoes as they moved around and interact
with each other. So, there are four species

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:39.740
in this ecosystem. Particular animals eat
other animals of different species, or they

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:45.880
mate with animals of the same species and
opposite gender. And they also affect the

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:52.670
television signal in different ways to produce
an affected video.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:54.849
[pause]

00:35:54.849 --> 00:36:09.839
I guess you'll have to look at the work itself.
This video isn't working on this display.

00:36:09.839 --> 00:36:16.920
And so, the animals are encoded with a genetic
algorithm. So, every time they mate, then

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:23.260
they produce offspring with potential mutations
and a combination of the genes of the two

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:29.000
parents. And the genes encode a variety of
factors, including the speed of the animals,

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.759
their longevity, the range at which they can
detect other animals of the same or different

00:36:33.759 --> 00:36:40.140
species. And so, as an ecosystem watches a
particular program, then you'll get a particular

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:46.690
convergence on a solution that works for that
television program. And as the program changes,

00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:56.170
then you'll get a different population arising
that matches the characteristics the new program.

00:36:56.170 --> 00:37:03.690
So, when the animals mate, then they're, the
mother is static for awhile and then produces

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:19.569
a new child which has the genes spliced from
the two parents with some possible mutation.

00:37:19.569 --> 00:37:30.100
So, this is an earlier video that shows, this
is showing the original signal at the bottom

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:38.910
right and the potato field in the larger image
with the strong colors that it adapted based

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:44.609
on the colors that have been seen in the previous
images in the original signal. Then as we

00:37:44.609 --> 00:37:50.999
go along, we'll see the affected signal. Here's
the affected signal with patches of color

00:37:50.999 --> 00:37:57.910
drained out from the original signal based
on the presence of the, this potato field.

00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:04.369
And then finally here we have the field with
the creatures moving around, eating the potatoes

00:38:04.369 --> 00:38:11.450
and leaving trails of blackness. The large
image here is just the animals themselves

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:20.980
in isolation visualized. And then here we
have the affected TV, which is what you see

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:27.220
on the monitor in the exhibition. So, the
animals have these auras around them which

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:33.390
are affecting the TV. In this case, they're
brightening the images; they're also delaying

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:42.480
through time. So, presenting a television
from the past and also shifting the television

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:53.119
image effects that surround the presence of
the creatures. And then finally, I wanted

00:38:53.119 --> 00:38:58.180
to talk about one other work that I've done
which is another artificial life piece called

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:04.420
Earthwords, which imagines what would words
be if they were alive, and how do texts come

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:12.560
about by imagining that individual words could
be alive. And it imagines handwritten words

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:18.859
as organisms, moving around and particular
words have affinities to each other based

00:39:18.859 --> 00:39:23.730
on their presence in an original text. So,

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:39.540
[pause]

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:48.109
so this shows the initial text, but I took,
which is a piece by Derrida talking about

00:39:48.109 --> 00:39:54.279
signs and inscriptions on monuments and I
had taken that this is the origin which defines

00:39:54.279 --> 00:39:59.460
the affinities between the words and then
we'll move into a different screen which actually

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:04.790
imagines the words as alive and interacting
with each other. And as this comes up I can

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:05.790
take questions.

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:06.790
&gt;&gt;presenter: Ok.

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:14.750
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Thank you very much and then Sandra
will talk about her joint work next.

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:22.700
&gt;&gt;presenter: Are there questions for Andrew?

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:28.660
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #5: Is it the cycle
of couch potatoes, how, it's continuous? Does

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:29.660
it reboot itself or start over?

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:33.789
&gt;&gt;Andrew: It does have, it can reset. If all
the creatures die out then I restart the ecosystem,

00:40:33.789 --> 00:40:35.490
with a new set of initial conditions.

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:37.839
&gt;&gt;member #5: What we're seeing here is live,
right?

00:40:37.839 --> 00:40:44.390
&gt;&gt;Andrew: So, in this case, I switched the
work to HD for this exhibition and I haven't

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:49.381
yet got the HD running live up 30 frames a
second, so this is actually stored video,

00:40:49.381 --> 00:40:57.539
but the idea is it can run live but not in
HD at the moment.

00:40:57.539 --> 00:41:00.680
&gt;&gt;member #5: [inaudible]

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:10.309
&gt;&gt;Andrew: As, as an artwork, as a display
on the wall and ideally it would be running

00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:16.299
live. I mean, making progress and making it
faster to run in real time on live signals

00:41:16.299 --> 00:41:21.160
and in an earlier implementation, you could
also have conditions in the ecosystem that

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:24.210
will actually change the channels so that
they, the creatures could actually change

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:29.869
the channel based on their genetic makeup
and the conditions in the ecosystem.

00:41:29.869 --> 00:41:33.771
&gt;&gt;presenter: Any more questions?

00:41:33.771 --> 00:41:37.059
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #6: I have one. Do
you see it as feasible that life forms could

00:41:37.059 --> 00:41:42.329
evolve, like, let's just say for example,
you have a virus, virus is being mutated and

00:41:42.329 --> 00:41:45.249
grow and [inaudible].

00:41:45.249 --> 00:41:53.210
&gt;&gt;Andrew: I, yes, potentially computer viruses.
This, Couch Potato Farm, is completely a figment

00:41:53.210 --> 00:42:00.410
of my imagination, but potentially with, if
people coded genetic algorithms into the virus

00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:07.349
that's on the, could spread themselves, then
yeah. But I think they would have to be encoded

00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:15.739
deliberately. So, this is the Earthwords showing
the words crawling around and as they find

00:42:15.739 --> 00:42:20.970
words to which they have an affinity, then
they actually lock together and form a joint

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:25.279
phrase. Here, we see "a" and "monument" which
could go together in the original text and

00:42:25.279 --> 00:42:31.269
now they become a single creature, which will
now crawl around the environment looking for

00:42:31.269 --> 00:42:35.290
other words they were adjacent to in the original
piece.

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:37.510
&gt;&gt;member #6: Does it ultimately resolve?

00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:48.720
&gt;&gt;Andrew: No, because they also can fall apart
as well. Just randomly, they disconnect when

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:56.510
they get very large. Ok, thank you.

00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:57.619
[applause]

00:42:57.619 --> 00:43:05.130
&gt;&gt;presenter: Next up is Sandra Cordero, who
also lives and works in New York. She studied

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:09.980
animation and painting at New York University
and Hunter College. Her work has been shown

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:16.890
at the Queens Museum of Art and at films festivals
across the country. She is a member of the

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:22.330
Sperm Whale Collective, which creates interactive
installations and visuals at events throughout

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:23.330
the Northeast.

00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:35.710
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Thank you. Volume good? In the back?
Yes? Hi, so, I'm Sandra. I'm going to talk

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:41.369
about Refugium 1 &amp; 2, which is the piece in
the room back there. It was collaboration

00:43:41.369 --> 00:43:49.890
between myself, Andrew, who you just met,
and Jason, who also works at Google. A Refugium

00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:56.471
is a haven for populations of flora and fauna
which were previously more widespread. And

00:43:56.471 --> 00:44:01.390
just to give you an idea of the timeline for
this, we started working on this in July.

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:08.119
We made this piece specifically for this exhibition.
We wanted to combine traditional media with

00:44:08.119 --> 00:44:13.160
digital art. So the idea was that I would
contribute paintings, which would then be

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:21.049
used as jpegs and then Andrew and Jason would
create visual effects to manipulate the images.

00:44:21.049 --> 00:44:26.000
We got the theme of the show, which was gonna
be the future, which got us thinking what

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:32.119
natures gonna look like many, many years from
now. And we wanted to find a way of conveying

00:44:32.119 --> 00:44:37.680
this by mixing painting and video. So, we
came up with the idea that I would create

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:43.410
a painting of a forest scene. Andrew had this
idea of trees in a forest seen from below

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:48.589
and then putting effects on the image so that
you get the sense of leaves moving in the

00:44:48.589 --> 00:44:54.299
breeze and Jason was more interested in what
ocean life would be like in the future, so

00:44:54.299 --> 00:45:00.239
he wanted to work with marine, a marine painting
where he would create effects that evoke the

00:45:00.239 --> 00:45:07.010
motion of waves in the sea. Prior work and
inspiration, I know for me, personally, I

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:14.349
really like Jacco Oliviers work. He does really
large animated paintings which he then projects

00:45:14.349 --> 00:45:23.319
onto a wall and The Sperm Whale is a collective
that Jason and I are members of which mixes

00:45:23.319 --> 00:45:29.480
traditional and digital art. For example,
in this image the drawings were made in pastel

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:38.740
on paper, scanned in, and then animated digitally
using Orco, which is an Open Source program

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:44.859
written by members of The Sperm Whale. And
as we were discussing how we, this was gonna

00:45:44.859 --> 00:45:48.819
be displayed, like what kind of screens we'd
mount it on, how we were going to show it,

00:45:48.819 --> 00:45:52.809
we just started wondering, "Well, what would
happen if we projected onto the paintings

00:45:52.809 --> 00:45:59.950
themselves, instead of using flat screens?
Well, what would that look like?" So, we started

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:07.369
making some rough drafts. Andrew wrote the
first test in processing, which is an Open

00:46:07.369 --> 00:46:14.750
Source, Java-based graphics language. This
is a still photo that he used to manipulate

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:22.720
in the rough draft, where the leaves are moving
very subtly. The final version was written

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:29.960
in C++ with OpenGL and also used some code
from Orco, which is another graphics-based

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:36.999
language. And everything in that you see in
the next room is being rendered real-time.

00:46:36.999 --> 00:46:44.339
This is the painting that Jason used for one
of his rough drafts that I did of spiny lobsters.

00:46:44.339 --> 00:46:49.470
Spiny lobsters have been around for millions
of years; longer than humans. And they'll

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:54.970
probably be around for millions of years after
we're gone. They're getting along just fine

00:46:54.970 --> 00:47:00.730
without us. And this is a draft of him projecting
effects onto the painting. We were playing

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:09.420
around with having the projection bleed beyond
the edges of the canvas and make an animated

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:15.920
border. So, meanwhile, I just happened to
be having a trip booked to visit my mother,

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:22.069
who lives in Wisconsin. And she just happens
to live in a forest and this is a photo of

00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:29.130
her backyard. So, I spent a few days just
taking photos, sketching a lot of the plant

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:34.079
life out there and then when I got back to
New York, I make made some compositional layouts

00:47:34.079 --> 00:47:41.170
just to get an idea. This is the first one.
I was inspired by all these really weird alien-looking

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:46.549
fungus that were growing in the logs and tree
trunks in the forest. The second idea, I was

00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:53.430
thinking of a swampy future where we've created
so much global warming that we have these

00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:58.720
mutant Venus flytraps that you see at the
bottom of the screen, that are just eating

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:04.900
up every protein source they can find in their
environment. And the third one, which is the

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:09.390
one we all agreed was the most successful,
was also the most at keeping with Andrew's

00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:20.470
original idea of looking up through the leaves
in a forest. It's a mix of domestic and wild

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:25.960
vegetation. This is the painting that was
created from it. You can see, for example,

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:32.039
the chartreuse leaves at the bottom are inspired
from my mom's rhododendrons. Next to them,

00:48:32.039 --> 00:48:37.759
are leaves based on sketches of weeds I took
that were growing in the driveway. And some

00:48:37.759 --> 00:48:43.380
of them I took more liberty with like the
purple thistle things. I wanted to see what

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:50.410
they would look like in the future. I wanted
to keep that sense of a much warmer environment,

00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:57.460
where you've got a lot of humidity's and you
see the sun through yellow haze and the pollen

00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:05.059
just hanging in this really thick air. So,
while I was doing that, the Jason and Andrew

00:49:05.059 --> 00:49:12.039
writing the effects, which were then used
on jpegs which I took of the paintings. They

00:49:12.039 --> 00:49:17.660
wrote ten different effects, which are cycling
through randomly and the effects change every

00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:24.540
ten minutes. Four of the effects chop up the
image into hot blocks and then these patches

00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:29.920
are moved around randomly, or using a sine
wave over time. So, you can get that effect

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:37.819
of leaves in the wind or of an ocean wave
moving over the image. Two of the effects

00:49:37.819 --> 00:49:45.519
work on the contrast in color of the image
and change it slowly over time. Three of the

00:49:45.519 --> 00:49:50.119
effects take pixels of the same color and
drop them down the canvas at a speed which

00:49:50.119 --> 00:49:54.489
is a function of their color. So, certain
colors move faster, slower and it creates

00:49:54.489 --> 00:50:01.369
this effect of the image melting. And there's
one colorful effect where it starts out black

00:50:01.369 --> 00:50:07.289
and then the image fills in based on the color.
Like, different colors have different starting

00:50:07.289 --> 00:50:13.940
points and then when the image is completely
filled in, it starts fading to black again.

00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:19.559
And so once this was ready, we installed it.
I think it was Andrew who had the idea to

00:50:19.559 --> 00:50:25.670
use one projector for both images, just to
help with installing. And then they had to

00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:30.479
write a program to tweak the placement of
the projected images so that they aligned

00:50:30.479 --> 00:50:35.910
with the paintings because we didn't want
them, we decided we didn't want the projection

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:42.569
bleeding onto the wall behind the canvas.
And it was, and we had to figure out a way

00:50:42.569 --> 00:50:50.359
of compensating for the key stoning of the
projected image. So, yeah I think it was an

00:50:50.359 --> 00:50:56.160
interesting experience for viewers, people
have said. How is it working? Like, they didn't

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:59.799
quite get, they thought, some people thought
that the image was emanating from the painting

00:50:59.799 --> 00:51:02.759
and some people would look around and say,
"Where's the projector?" Or, "Where's the

00:51:02.759 --> 00:51:09.829
other projectors?" So, I think it was successful
in that sense, in combining traditional and

00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:19.630
digital art together. Yeah, any questions?

00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:21.950
[pause]

00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:28.920
Nice. Thank you.

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:31.240
[applause]

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:51.720
&gt;&gt;presenter: Our last speaker of the evening
is Marina Zurkow, who is a video and media

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:55.980
artist whose works have taken the form of
multi-channel videos, customized multi-screen

00:51:55.980 --> 00:52:03.289
computer pieces, performative and interactive
works. Her recent animated psychological narratives

00:52:03.289 --> 00:52:11.160
address humans and their relationships to
animals, plants and the weather. Since 2000,

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:17.279
Zurkow has exhibited at the Sundance Film
Festival, Rotterdam Film Festival, The Soul

00:52:17.279 --> 00:52:22.650
Media City Biennial, Ars Electronica, The
Creative Time, The Kitchen, The Walker Art

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:29.960
Center, The National Museum for Women in the
Arts and Eyebeam, among other venues. She

00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:34.319
has been New York Foundation for the Arts
Fellow, a Rockefeller New Media Fellow and

00:52:34.319 --> 00:52:41.029
a Creative Capital Grantee. Zurkow is on the
faculty of NYU's Interactive Technology Program

00:52:41.029 --> 00:52:46.961
 ( ITP) and lives in Brooklyn. She is represented
by Wulkowitz Gallery in New York.

00:52:46.961 --> 00:52:48.070
[applause]

00:52:48.070 --> 00:52:57.160
&gt;&gt;Marina: This is an unexpected prop, this
mic, so I'm gonna juggle my text. I'm gonna

00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:04.470
try to really stick to this text so I don't
start blathering. So, last year I completed

00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:12.299
a body of 11 works that fall under this title,
"Crossing the Waters." The works were made

00:53:12.299 --> 00:53:17.980
between 2006 and 2009 and the pieces thematically
address climate change. And in each of these

00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:24.140
works, I took a fairly different approach
to the material, somewhere between moving

00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:31.770
paintings and psychological narrative. So,
a few things about this series. The works

00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:37.809
are all very long, slow loops and they are
unconventionally formatted for moving images,

00:53:37.809 --> 00:53:43.020
often displayed on custom-built multi-monitor
units. Many of them are hung on the wall.

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:53.049
They have plug and play custom computing parts
and so on. The intention of the work is to

00:53:53.049 --> 00:53:58.739
create these pieces that you would end up
living with. They're not linear pieces, they're

00:53:58.739 --> 00:54:07.299
meant to be seen over, anywhere from, some
pieces run 9 to 20 minutes, or had been running

00:54:07.299 --> 00:54:15.970
9 to 20 minutes. And here's just another example
of some smaller works from Bryce Wolkowitz

00:54:15.970 --> 00:54:22.220
Gallery. Often, the pieces are designed modularly,
so I've reformatted them. In this case, they've

00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:30.920
been scaled up installation context in a institution.
The same piece, here, you can see in Croatia

00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:35.920
in a gallery called "Grey Area" and this was
a, this is a gallery that only exists in this

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:44.880
villa doorway and is meant to be seen from
boats passing by. This is the original format

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:49.380
for the pieces out in the lobby, Slurb, and
it was commissioned by the city of Tampa for

00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:54.940
an outdoor Biennial festival called Lights
on Tampa and exhibited there in 2009. So,

00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:56.380
I thought, I'm not gonna show the piece because
obviously, it's out there and I hope that

00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:59.710
you'll have a chance to see it and listen
to the soundtrack, which you can only hear

00:54:59.710 --> 00:55:05.989
through the headphones out there, but the
soundtrack is pretty key to the piece. It's

00:55:05.989 --> 00:55:12.969
an 18 minute loop and a seamless 18 minute
loop. So, I thought I'd use the piece though,

00:55:12.969 --> 00:55:18.039
to describe a process of constructing the
work that I make and use Slurb as a model

00:55:18.039 --> 00:55:26.450
to demonstrate that. First of all, almost
all of the projects in this series are rotoscoped

00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:30.910
and rotoscoping is an animation technique
where you draw directly on top of video material,

00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:39.079
frame by frame. In my case, the work is completely
hand done. And the second thing I wanna say

00:55:39.079 --> 00:55:47.259
is that, despite the fact that the works look
like extremely unified pictures, they are

00:55:47.259 --> 00:55:53.140
actually a collage, cobbled together from
really disparate sources. Many of the works

00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:57.390
have a futuristic, or fantastic, tone to them,
but all of the source material for the rotoscoping

00:55:57.390 --> 00:56:05.319
was found on the Internet, a space that I'd
call in itself an inter-dependent ecosystem,

00:56:05.319 --> 00:56:10.529
and a space in which you find both competing
and complementary mean pools. All the footage

00:56:10.529 --> 00:56:14.200
I use is real, in other words, and it might
resonate as something you've saw somewhere

00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:19.210
before, from new sites, from Google searches,
YouTube and so on. The third thing is that

00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:24.489
nearly all of the elements in these works
are composed as loops. Because I work alone

00:56:24.489 --> 00:56:28.469
most of the time, and hand drawn animation
is labor intensive, using looped character

00:56:28.469 --> 00:56:34.539
behavior is very economical and efficient.
But these loops also have a really distinct

00:56:34.539 --> 00:56:41.960
stutter to them. They're very imperfect and
that adds or breaks the seamless rendered

00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:53.569
space that these pieces seems to exude and
create a kind of a brokenness. Finally, I

00:56:53.569 --> 00:56:58.059
look at these works as ambient moving paintings,
more of a narrative cartoons. And they're

00:56:58.059 --> 00:57:01.999
reminiscent of Asian scroll paintings in both
their formats and the way that the landscape

00:57:01.999 --> 00:57:07.940
is moved across the screen. What you're looking
at here is almost half of the story board

00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:14.509
for Slurb, and the 18 minute length of the
piece was determined by just a simple empirical

00:57:14.509 --> 00:57:20.019
process of seeing how long it would take to,
in a generous fashion, move this story board

00:57:20.019 --> 00:57:28.519
across the picture plane. Tampa is the site
that you see in Slurb that's half submerged.

00:57:28.519 --> 00:57:34.859
And the piece itself really looked at the
Gulf of Mexico's changing ecology, while speculating

00:57:34.859 --> 00:57:39.410
on the reality of this present day return
to a primordial sea, and what that kind of

00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:45.519
a return to an older, more primitive form
of sea, what might mean if you mixed together

00:57:45.519 --> 00:57:52.979
all of these new, speculative societies. Tampa
and the entire Gulf coast, including New Orleans,

00:57:52.979 --> 00:57:58.109
is at risk for flooding of the Gulf. It occurs
during hurricane season and the volume of

00:57:58.109 --> 00:58:02.630
these conditions is worsening from climate
change. For Lights on Tampa, I wanted to make

00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:06.950
a piece that addressed this and to create
a confluence of facts and speculations that

00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:12.809
were specific to the Gulf coast, but also
global in scope. The Gulf and the Southern

00:58:12.809 --> 00:58:17.769
Atlantic Coast used to have a healthy shrimp
fishing industry, but pollutants, agricultural

00:58:17.769 --> 00:58:23.749
run-off, over-fishing, and ocean warming,
have worldwide altered the oceans' chemical

00:58:23.749 --> 00:58:28.719
balance, rendering it acid and deprived of
oxygen. The result isn't only a significant

00:58:28.719 --> 00:58:35.049
decrease in diversity, but also a phenomenon
referred to as "the rise of slime." Slime

00:58:35.049 --> 00:58:40.640
being toxic algae, jellyfish, and other more
primitive forms of sea life. And these are

00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:47.809
forms that survive really well in the aforementioned
conditions of an epoxic ocean. So, these trawling

00:58:47.809 --> 00:58:53.130
boats used to be fitted for shrimp catches
and they've now been reconfigured to catch

00:58:53.130 --> 00:59:00.910
jellyfish for the Asian market, where they're
considered a delicacy. To explore this story

00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:06.150
of a transformed ecology, I wanted to transpose
class and cultural concerns and ask questions

00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:10.970
about who and how might thrive in these new
conditions. I started to research my cast

00:59:10.970 --> 00:59:18.270
of characters, looking for ways to soften
this relatively unpleasant scenario. I wanted

00:59:18.270 --> 00:59:23.140
to make something that had the feeling J.J.
Grandville's 19th Century satirical illustrations,

00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:33.339
creating hybrid creatures and car wrecked
mermaids and a macabre Steven King chorus

00:59:33.339 --> 00:59:38.809
that had some traces of ethnographic portraiture
and that also mined a rich history of traditionally

00:59:38.809 --> 00:59:48.720
aquatic and contemporary water-based lifestyles.
So, I became interested in portraying contemporary

00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:51.901
people accustomed to living on the water,
like the members of the Intha tribe that you

00:59:51.901 --> 01:00:00.460
see in these images. They live in Myanmar
and they live in a, not only Myanmar, there's

01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:06.450
other similar aquatic communities in Cambodia
and Vietnam, but many of them now, the lakes

01:00:06.450 --> 01:00:10.729
that they've lived on for hundreds of years
in this way and they live in houseboats and

01:00:10.729 --> 01:00:14.799
they farm hydroponically, they're, it's become
quite unsustainable cause their waterways

01:00:14.799 --> 01:00:20.630
have also become polluted by some of the same
things that I described are happening in the

01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:24.980
oceans. So, this is, for instance, a hydroponic
raft-based hydroponic farm system from this

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:32.599
community. I was also really interested in
the optimistic design of these amphibious

01:00:32.599 --> 01:00:37.660
houses. These are being implemented in the
Netherlands and also I was really interested

01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:42.079
in this tailgate party from hell scenario.
So you can get a sense of all of that in the

01:00:42.079 --> 01:00:47.540
piece, I think. And I think this is a picture
from Morpeth, England, from the floods from

01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:52.230
two years ago. This was from a very, very
small river, very heavy rains and utterly

01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:57.010
shocked the community. They've never really
experienced anything like this. So, this is

01:00:57.010 --> 01:01:06.280
a fairly, it's a reality. It's not that far
to speculate. Finally, with Slurb, I wanted

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:11.279
to make a travel narrative, one that unfolded
like a Chinese scroll and circled around continuously

01:01:11.279 --> 01:01:15.829
like a carousel, one that would take you from
the city of Tampa and follow its landmarks

01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:21.489
out past the broken highways and into the
suburbs and then back around again. This is

01:01:21.489 --> 01:01:30.969
actually one of the first 11 centuries, 12
century scroll from Japan, animal scroll.

01:01:30.969 --> 01:01:36.920
This is also very long. This is the site of
the projection for Slurb. Across the plaza

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:42.170
from Tampa's ice hockey stadium was the parking
lot. Well, here. This is the parking lot that's

01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:47.069
across from this building on the right and
fortunately, during the week that the piece

01:01:47.069 --> 01:01:52.079
was projected, the circus was in town and
so, every evening at dusk, when the projector

01:01:52.079 --> 01:01:57.279
would fire up, coincidentally, the elephants
would have to walk across the plaza and into

01:01:57.279 --> 01:02:01.181
the ice hockey stadium. So it really had this
kind of pop off the screen effect, because

01:02:01.181 --> 01:02:06.299
if you hear the music, there's a kind of a
circus theme or a really distorted circus

01:02:06.299 --> 01:02:13.549
theme that's under, that underlines it. So
when I made Slurb, there wasn't the same kind

01:02:13.549 --> 01:02:17.670
of public upset around the health of the Gulf
of Mexico as there is post the British Petroleum

01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:22.490
disaster and now Slurb is encoded with a very
different resonance as I experienced in May

01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:28.229
in Austin, when I showed the work. And the
really disturbing thing was in Texas, where

01:02:28.229 --> 01:02:34.969
people were, it was, it was the oil was imminent
and there was a real sense with the piece

01:02:34.969 --> 01:02:38.910
and I, it was up, I was there for a week in
residence and so I spoke to a lot of different

01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:45.569
kinds of people. And disturbingly, the response
was how comforting this piece was to them

01:02:45.569 --> 01:02:53.049
because they felt like, look at your eyes,
they felt like this piece demonstrated our

01:02:53.049 --> 01:02:58.729
adaptability and that in the end, we would
all be ok.

01:02:58.729 --> 01:03:00.130
[laughter]

01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:12.390
Yeah. I thought, "Wow. Ten gone, ten left."
Ok. I'm gonna jump ahead actually, and show

01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:31.289
a little bit of a new work. So, I can take
my time with this cause its 144 hours long.

01:03:31.289 --> 01:03:32.289
[laughter]

01:03:32.289 --> 01:03:38.091
So, this piece is called "Mezacausim, North
Umberland, United Kingdom." And it's an animated

01:03:38.091 --> 01:03:43.049
landscape representing one year of real time
on the moors of Northern England. It's the

01:03:43.049 --> 01:03:47.229
first in a series of works that use data inputs,
or algorithms, to determine the activities

01:03:47.229 --> 01:03:52.819
you see on screen. This piece runs as 144
hour cycle, 146 hour cycle. I'm sorry, my

01:03:52.819 --> 01:03:57.430
math is really terrible. Animated objects
were placed on a stage and code determines

01:03:57.430 --> 01:04:02.839
the frequency and order of their appearance.
No cycle is identical to the last as the characters

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:07.819
and seasonal weather are determined by a simple
probability equation. One hour of world time

01:04:07.819 --> 01:04:13.020
elapses in each minute of screen time. Because
of the long duration of the events unfolding,

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:17.269
Mezacausim is ideally meant to be seen by
passers-by in public space, or if you left

01:04:17.269 --> 01:04:21.910
your web browser open constantly, I suppose
that would also be a good way to see the work.

01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:27.079
Where one might become invested in the fate
of the protagonist on a summer's eve, and

01:04:27.079 --> 01:04:34.229
be surprised 72 hours later when it's snowing
and the animated field is full of refugees.

01:04:34.229 --> 01:04:38.380
The title "Mezacausim" is drawn from the field
of environmental science and refers to experimental,

01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:43.950
simulated ecosystems that allow for manipulation
of the physical environment for "organismal,

01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:50.150
community and ecological research." Mezacausim,
North Umberland is the first in this series,

01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:54.239
which will include an array of landscapes
that use different data strategies to determine

01:04:54.239 --> 01:05:00.249
their unfolding. The landscapes include Tsujiki,
the largest fish market in the world in Tokyo,

01:05:00.249 --> 01:05:05.900
a depleted oil field in Texas, a horse racetrack
and a farm that grows animals for pharmacological

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:11.589
purposes. These landscapes reflect common
global concerns while being geographically

01:05:11.589 --> 01:05:16.279
distinct and culturally specific. Each site
evinces a particular and heavy dependence

01:05:16.279 --> 01:05:20.880
on resources, is an extreme example of managed
nature, which is definitely the case. Oh,

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:22.779
this is awesome that he gets up. He doesn't
get up very often and so, sometimes I've shown

01:05:22.779 --> 01:05:28.609
this piece and he's just sitting there the
entire time. People just say like, "I don't

01:05:28.609 --> 01:05:35.150
really understand what's going on. This piece
doesn't, nothing really ever happens." Sorry

01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:37.599
to interrupt myself, but--

01:05:37.599 --> 01:05:38.599
[laughter]

01:05:38.599 --> 01:05:44.539
It's very exciting. So, the landscapes reflect
common global concerns while being geographically

01:05:44.539 --> 01:05:51.170
distinct, culturally specific and each site
is evidence of a particular heavy dependency

01:05:51.170 --> 01:05:57.209
on resources. An extreme example of managed
nature or possesses a rich cultural or mythological

01:05:57.209 --> 01:06:04.269
history and embodies a tension between the
magically real and the pathologically monetized.

01:06:04.269 --> 01:06:10.709
So, I think that's really all I wanna say
today, but I thought maybe I could just leave

01:06:10.709 --> 01:06:37.329
this running. If you had any questions, I'd
be happy to answer them.

01:06:37.329 --> 01:06:39.549
[applause]

01:06:39.549 --> 01:06:41.759
Yes.

01:06:41.759 --> 01:06:57.799
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #7: So, there's this
[inaudible].

01:06:57.799 --> 01:07:27.229
&gt;&gt;Marina: I've never really heard those pitched
against each other, but.

01:07:27.229 --> 01:07:35.249
&gt;&gt;member #7: [inaudible].

01:07:35.249 --> 01:07:41.349
&gt;&gt;Marina: Well, it's really; I worked on this
for the last year. I'm pretty much done. I

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:45.769
have some code tweaks and some other things
that I need to finish in the piece, but A.

01:07:45.769 --> 01:07:51.809
the piece is a black hole. It'll just absorb
anything I put into it. There are a couple

01:07:51.809 --> 01:07:57.640
hundred animated characters and weather instances
in the piece. There's snow and wind and different

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:02.690
animals at different seasons. And it's, and
there's machinery, farm machinery and refugees.

01:08:02.690 --> 01:08:11.170
There's a lot of stuff in this piece and I
at the same time felt that the piece was incredibly

01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:17.630
boring. And in a way, it is, and I've made
a commitment to producing a truly ambient

01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:21.889
work that you don't know where it's in the
front and where its, where things are the

01:08:21.889 --> 01:08:25.690
subject or the object of the work. And it's
something that I've become really interested

01:08:25.690 --> 01:08:29.599
in. And there's a book I'm very keen on called
"Ecology Without Nature" by Timothy Morton,

01:08:29.599 --> 01:08:35.150
who's a literary critic, an eco-critic and
who talks a lot about sound art and producing

01:08:35.150 --> 01:08:39.920
this literally ambivalent world in which there's
things that are in foreground and in the background,

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:45.429
they sort of shift space. And so, I'm very
interested in that as a kind of response to

01:08:45.429 --> 01:08:53.159
the noisy, fast, crazy, very clearly defined
space in which we mostly occupy; the subjective

01:08:53.159 --> 01:08:56.049
position. So, I have to stand behind this
experiment and hope for the best. It's a long

01:08:56.049 --> 01:09:01.699
answer to that question in terms of how do
I push back. I feel like I am pushing the

01:09:01.699 --> 01:09:06.940
boundaries of my own tolerance and hopefully,
this has resonance for other people. Especially

01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:10.009
when I think you see more than one of these.
This is the first one and it's, it's such

01:09:10.009 --> 01:09:15.819
a weird choice. I had a residence last summer
in Northern England, so I, and I went there,

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:20.040
really, to do this kind of nature 2.0, really
very reconfigured view of what nature and

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:25.190
our relationship to the natural world is,
and had gone as a researcher and this was

01:09:25.190 --> 01:09:29.560
one of the outcomes. The other outcome is
I'm doing a performance piece there where

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:38.489
producing food made out of invasive species,
which is, and producing them as kind of ethnic

01:09:38.489 --> 01:09:43.310
food stuffs, for many reasons because there's
a very intense connection between rhetoric

01:09:43.310 --> 01:09:49.920
around invasive species and rhetoric around
race. So, these have become in tandem in a

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:54.659
way with other manifestations that are more
direct. These are very much about mediation

01:09:54.659 --> 01:10:01.310
and narratives; stories that we tell ourselves
about the natural world and so, I'm not sure

01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:04.052
what I'm doing but I know for certain I'm
finished with that work. So, it seems like

01:10:04.052 --> 01:10:05.052
a kind of new exploration.

01:10:05.052 --> 01:10:06.052
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #8: Just following
up on his question about how do you know if

01:10:06.052 --> 01:10:07.052
it's successful or not? How do you describe
how there are so many elements potentially

01:10:07.052 --> 01:10:15.329
involved with the piece, that could seem to
be pure chaos [inaudible]. There's a simplicity

01:10:15.329 --> 01:10:34.150
to it, that might be the potential for all
the chaos.

01:10:34.150 --> 01:10:37.760
&gt;&gt;Marina: Yeah, well you know it's interesting
because I come from film and this extremely

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:46.469
linear authored old-fashioned mentality about
making and a question is how much can I give

01:10:46.469 --> 01:10:51.630
that up and how much can I let accident really
happen in this space? And one thing I'm not

01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:56.670
really, I'm interested in bringing in more
procedurally produced elements into this work.

01:10:56.670 --> 01:11:01.659
I think some of the weather components start
to look like that anyway and there's no reason

01:11:01.659 --> 01:11:06.079
why they're not being produced algorithmically,
but I'm not willing to relinquish my hand

01:11:06.079 --> 01:11:14.110
in the 2D space, which demands order, layering,
a sense, it's artifice of perspective and

01:11:14.110 --> 01:11:19.349
a sense of pictorial cohesion. So, that, in
a way, is what has saved it, but is also what,

01:11:19.349 --> 01:11:22.650
I think, is in the end a limitation on this
system that I'm proposing. And I, again, I

01:11:22.650 --> 01:11:31.770
don't know where this is gonna go in a couple
years. I have no idea. Yes?

01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:37.889
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #9: What's driving
the piece? Are these autonomous agents, these

01:11:37.889 --> 01:11:38.889
elements?

01:11:38.889 --> 01:11:43.469
&gt;&gt;Marina: Oh gosh, nothing that fancy.

01:11:43.469 --> 01:11:45.070
[Marina laughs]

01:11:45.070 --> 01:11:51.840
They're independent swfs and they're, there
are monthly buckets so there's a bucket for

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:56.340
January, February, March and then each of
those is divided into a dawn, day, dusk and

01:11:56.340 --> 01:12:03.320
night. And in each of those timeframes, there's
a probability number, a percentage that says

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.150
this will come out. Super simple.

01:12:05.150 --> 01:12:07.730
&gt;&gt;member #9: Like the birds just flew out.

01:12:07.730 --> 01:12:08.730
&gt;&gt;Marina: Mm-hmm.

01:12:08.730 --> 01:12:14.929
&gt;&gt;member #9: Now, if they flew out, feasibly
they could have flown out, he wouldn't be

01:12:14.929 --> 01:12:18.540
sitting there. And they would've landed on
him, right?

01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:23.660
&gt;&gt;Marina: Yeah, but the piece is very, he
is always sitting there when the birds come

01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:27.960
and, they eat him in the summer. They peck
at his flesh. And the squirrels, oh, here's

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:31.620
the squirrels. So, the squirrels eat him also.
They only come out when he's sitting there,

01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:34.449
so he only leaves at night. So, now it's the
workaround.

01:12:34.449 --> 01:12:39.719
&gt;&gt;member #9: Every time, let's say, two birds
come out, are they gonna land on him and do

01:12:39.719 --> 01:12:40.719
the same thing?

01:12:40.719 --> 01:12:43.760
&gt;&gt;Marina: Well, there's a bunch of them, but
yes. Currently there's not anything more sophisticated

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:44.760
than--

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:47.730
&gt;&gt;member #9: They're not running in their
own--

01:12:47.730 --> 01:13:04.880
&gt;&gt;Marina: No, they're, they're placed on an
X-Y in the stage, so they're, this is super

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:21.770
compromise. I feel guilty having to confess
that, but--

01:13:21.770 --> 01:13:22.770
[laughter]

01:13:22.770 --> 01:13:23.770
Good.

01:13:23.770 --> 01:13:28.250
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #10: So, it seems like
you've come to terms with the fact that you

01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:30.730
don't enjoy watching [inaudible] works in
a gallery setting. I mean, nobody really,

01:13:30.730 --> 01:13:35.110
I mean, I've never really seen a successful
marketing in that people go into the gallery

01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:39.449
and they watch the entire work through. Because
it's not meant for it, you walk in and it's

01:13:39.449 --> 01:13:40.449
at a random point.

01:13:40.449 --> 01:13:41.449
&gt;&gt;Marina: Right.

01:13:41.449 --> 01:13:42.449
&gt;&gt;member #10: I mean your works designed around
that idea that people could come and [inaudible].

01:13:42.449 --> 01:13:43.449
So what are some other successful ways [inaudible]?
I mean some spaces they have these special

01:13:43.449 --> 01:13:44.449
[inaudible] more like a movie theater.

01:13:44.449 --> 01:13:45.449
&gt;&gt;Marina: Right, like Eve Sussman has an 83
minute piece up about Alcázar with a screening

01:13:45.449 --> 01:13:46.449
schedule. Yeah.

01:13:46.449 --> 01:13:48.699
&gt;&gt;member #10: So, I mean what ways can you
as artists have to deal with that scenario?

01:13:48.699 --> 01:13:54.960
&gt;&gt;Marina: Well, I mean, it's funny because
this wouldn't even work in a gallery. This

01:13:54.960 --> 01:14:01.210
needs to be in a different kind of public
space with regular, commuter space, it's perfect

01:14:01.210 --> 01:14:05.989
for. Because if you saw this, it's even hard
to show this here. I have to explain this

01:14:05.989 --> 01:14:10.489
machination or show you little bits and pieces
or can some experiences for you, but you don't

01:14:10.489 --> 01:14:14.090
get a sense of really, I mean it's great,
but a dump truck came out. But who knows what's

01:14:14.090 --> 01:14:20.250
really gonna happen and so these are spaces
that are meant to be seen with very long periods

01:14:20.250 --> 01:14:32.159
of passing by or waiting. Or loitering. So,
this isn't even a good, this isn't a good

01:14:32.159 --> 01:14:33.159
gallery solution.

01:14:33.159 --> 01:14:34.159
&gt;&gt;member #10: But it is for somebody, then,
you'd have to buy and take it home to.

01:14:34.159 --> 01:14:35.159
&gt;&gt;Marina: Well, yeah, it's great if you want
it in your living room, sure. Oh, yes I see

01:14:35.159 --> 01:14:38.280
what you're saying, but I don't know, it's
this sounds like a very complicated, longer

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:41.449
conversation about what galleries or how their
willing to represent work and how to, is this

01:14:41.449 --> 01:14:51.320
interesting or not to sell on the part of
a dealer. So, we're a particularly biased

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:55.760
community, sitting in this room, interested
in these issues.

01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:00.470
&gt;&gt;Female audience member #11: Do you draw
all the characters?

01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:08.250
&gt;&gt;Marina: I do. I've had, I have help from
some really wonderful animators on this, but

01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:25.210
I draw and determine all the key frames and
then people have done some of the rotoscoping

01:15:25.210 --> 01:15:27.550
with me. Sorry, I can't answer that in a more
coherent way.

01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:29.900
&gt;&gt;presenter: Are there any more questions?
I have a question. You had several pieces

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:35.449
that actually had a whole lot of screens.
This is, it looks like one screen.

01:15:35.449 --> 01:15:36.449
&gt;&gt;Marina: Yeah.

01:15:36.449 --> 01:15:37.449
&gt;&gt;presenter: But you had some that had, like
20 screens or something like that?

01:15:37.449 --> 01:15:38.449
&gt;&gt;Marina: I've done as much as for 21 screens,
yeah.

01:15:38.449 --> 01:15:39.449
&gt;&gt;presenter: So, how do you, how do you keep
it [inaudible]?

01:15:39.449 --> 01:15:40.449
&gt;&gt;Marina: Well, there's a piece for 21 screens
is in the San Jose Convention Center and it's

01:15:40.449 --> 01:15:46.020
on a Cisco system. It's on Cisco's sort of
scheduling system. So, the piece is a site-specific

01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:50.719
piece where you're looking at the space that
you're standing in but the space is flooded.

01:15:50.719 --> 01:15:59.099
So, it's a very sort of, and it's on a closed
circuit system, so most of the people who

01:15:59.099 --> 01:16:07.820
went to see the piece kept asking me if it
was live. Just because closed circuit is such

01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:13.639
a dominant paradigm for people to think this
is real or true or live. But that was quite

01:16:13.639 --> 01:16:15.520
simple. With the four screen piece, the poster
children, the polar bear piece, which I didn't

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:23.050
show tonight, but all that stuff's on my website.
Its two computers that are checking each other

01:16:23.050 --> 01:16:33.860
 [ ]. They're just checking to see if they,
to see that they remain in sync. So, it gets

01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:34.860
more complicated the more screens you have.
Now there are systems like Akman makes an

01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:37.239
M-player system that has a board that'll synchronize
at least six monitors to stay in sync with

01:16:37.239 --> 01:16:50.929
each other. So, I like Akman, it's MA and
PA M-players make really great company. Thank

01:16:50.929 --> 01:16:52.360
you.

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.800
[applause]
