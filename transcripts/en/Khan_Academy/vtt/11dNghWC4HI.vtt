00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.230
We figured out the eigenvalues
for a 2 by 2 matrix, so let's

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.240
see if we can figure
out the eigenvalues

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.920
for a 3 by 3 matrix.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.730
And I think we'll appreciate
that it's a good bit more

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.420
difficult just because the math
becomes a little hairier.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:22.830
So lambda is an eigenvalue
of A.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.810
By definition, if and only if--
I'll write it like this.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.180
If and only if A times some
non-zero vector v is equal to

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.075
lambda times that non-zero
vector v.

00:00:36.075 --> 00:00:41.040
Let we write that for
some non-zero.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.930
I could call it eigenvector v,
but I'll just call it for some

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.820
non-zero vector v or
some non-zero v.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.480
Now this is true if and only if,
this leads to-- I'll write

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.220
it like this.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.520
This is true if and only if--
and this is a bit of review,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.880
but I like to review it just
because when you do this 10

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.760
years from now, I don't want you
to remember the formula.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.230
I want you to just remember the
logic of how we got to it.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.910
So this is true if and only if--
let's just subtract Av

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.270
from both sides-- the 0 vector
is equal to lambda- instead of

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.840
writing lambda times v, I'm
going to write lambda times

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.340
the identity matrix times v.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.580
This is the same thing.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.890
The identity matrix
times v is just v.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.660
Minus Av.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.280
I just subtracted Av from both
sides, rewrote v as the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.140
identity matrix times v.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.760
Well this is only true if and
only if the 0 vector is equal

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.630
to lambda times the identity
matrix minus A times v.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.740
I just factored the vector v out
from the right-hand side

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.540
of both of these guys, and
I'm just left with some

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.700
matrix times v.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.900
Well this is only true-- let
me rewrite this over here,

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.110
this equation just in a form
you might recognize it.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.110
Lambda times the identity
matrix times A.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.330
This is just some matrix.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:09.000
This matrix times v has got
to be equal to 0 for some

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.910
non-zero vector v.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.020
That means that the null space
of this matrix has got to be

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.070
nontrivial.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.880
Or another way to think about it
is that its columns are not

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.310
linearly independent.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.800
Or another way to think about it
is it's not invertible, or

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.550
it has a determinant of 0.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.250
So lambda is the eigenvalue of
A, if and only if, each of

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.550
these steps are true.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.780
And this is true if and only
if-- for some at non-zero

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:43.560
vector, if and only if, the
determinant of lambda times

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.630
the identity matrix minus
A is equal to 0.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.560
And that was our takeaway.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.160
I think it was two videos
ago or three videos ago.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.620
But let's apply it now to
this 3 by 3 matrix A.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.680
We're going to use the 3
by 3 identity matrix.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.985
So we want to concern ourselves
with-- lambda times

00:03:01.985 --> 00:03:05.650
the identity matrix is just
going to be-- times the 3 by 3

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.410
identity matrix is just
going to be-- this is,

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.900
let me write this.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.920
This is lambda times the
identity matrix in R3.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.950
So it's just going to be
lambda, lambda, lambda.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.100
And everything else is
going to be 0's.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.400
The identity matrix had 1's
across here, so that's the

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.200
only thing that becomes
non-zero when you

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.230
multiply it by lambda.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.760
Everything else was a 0.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.690
So that's the identity
matrix times lambda.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.700
So lambda times the identity
matrix minus A is going to be

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.230
equal to-- it's actually pretty

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.550
straightforward to find.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.170
Everything along the diagonal is
going to be lambda minus--

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.060
let's just do it.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.900
Lambda minus minus 1-- I'll
do the diagonals here.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.230
Lambda minus minus 1
is lambda plus 1.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.040
And then 0 minus 2-- I'll do
that in a different color.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.250
0 minus 2 is minus 2.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.190
0 minus 2 is minus 2.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.620
0 minus 2 is minus 2.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.270
Let's do this one.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.380
0 minus 2 is minus 2.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.460
0 plus or minus minus 1 is
0 plus 1, which is 1.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.560
And then let's just
do this one.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.460
0 minus minus 1.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.810
That's one.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.700
Let me finish up the diagonal.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.695
And then you have
lambda minus 2.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.900
And then you have
lambda minus 2.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.280
So lambda is an eigenvalue
of A if and only if the

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.740
determinant of this matrix
right here is equal to 0.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.570
Let's figure out its
determinate.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.050
And the easiest way, at least
in my head to do this, is to

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.025
use the rule of Sarrus.

00:04:43.025 --> 00:04:45.620
So let's use the rule of
Sarrus to find this

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.650
determinant.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.460
So I just rewrite these
rows right there.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.070
I could just copy and
paste them really.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.640
I just take those two rows.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.070
And then let me paste them,
put them right there.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.720
It's a little bit too close
to this guy, but I

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.310
think you get the idea.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.130
And now the rule of Sarrus I
just take this product plus

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.090
this product plus this product
and then I subtract out this

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.110
product times this product
times this product.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.570
We'll do that next.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:24.220
So this product is lambda plus
1 times lambda minus 2 times

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.020
lambda minus 2.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.400
That's that one there.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.470
And then plus, let's see,
minus 2 times minus 2.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.216
That's plus 4.

00:05:32.216 --> 00:05:34.640
And then we have minus 2 times
minus 2 plus 4 times 1.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.790
So that is plus 4 again.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.910
And then we do minus this column
times this column.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.840
Minus this column minus this
column and then-- or I

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.210
shouldn't say column,
but diagonal really.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.890
So we say minus 2
times minus 2.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.750
Let me write this.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.510
Minus 2 times minus
2, which is 4.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.670
Times lambda minus 2.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.490
That was this diagonal.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.970
And then we have minus-- what
is this going to be?

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.510
Going to be minus 1 times
lambda plus 1.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.840
So minus lambda plus 1.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.010
And then you go down
this diagonal.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.410
Minus 2 times minus 2 is 4.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.410
So it's going to be 4 times
lambda minus 2 and we're

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:21.840
subtracting.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.750
So minus 4 times
lambda minus 2.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.200
And let's see if we
can simplify this.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.660
So this blue stuff over here--
let's see, these guys right

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.230
here become an 8 and then
this becomes-- this

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.510
becomes lambda plus 1.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.550
Times-- if I multiply these two
guys out, lambda squared

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.860
minus 4 lambda.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.440
Minus 2 lambda and then
minus 2 lambda.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.690
So minus 4 lambda.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.200
Plus 4.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.190
And then I have this
plus 8 here.

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.130
And then I have-- let's see.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.900
I have minus 4 times lambda.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.260
Let me just multiply
everything out.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:07.900
So I have minus 4 lambda plus 8
minus lambda minus 1 minus 4

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:14.450
lambda plus 8.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.800
And then let me simplify
this up a little bit.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.310
So this guy over here--
let's see.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:24.305
The constant terms, I have an 8,
I have a minus 1, I have an

00:07:24.305 --> 00:07:26.220
8 and I have an 8.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.680
So that's 24 minus 1.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.910
So that is a 23.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:36.220
And then the lambda terms
I have a minus 4 lambda.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.090
I have a minus lambda and
I have a minus 4 lambda.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.320
So it's minus 8, minus 1.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.750
So I have minus 9 lambda.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:45.670
Plus 23.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.530
And now I have to simplify
this out.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.020
So first I can take lambda and
multiply it times this whole

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:51.910
guy right there.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:08:00.000
So it's going to be lambda cubed
minus 4 lambda squared

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.770
plus 4 lambda.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.895
And then I can take this
one and multiply

00:08:03.895 --> 00:08:05.400
it times that guy.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.440
So plus lambda squared.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.980
Minus 4 lambda plus 4.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.990
And now of course, we have
these terms over here.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.740
So we're going to have
to simplify it again.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.100
So what are all of our
constant terms?

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.880
We have a 23 and we
have a plus 4.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.790
So we have a 27.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:27.350
Plus 27.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.220
And then, what are all
of our lambda terms?

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:33.559
We have a minus 9 lambda and
then we have a-- let's see.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:37.090
We have a minus 9 lambda, we
have a plus 4 lambda, and then

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.120
we have a minus 4 lambda.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.429
So these two cancel out.

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:45.140
So I just have a
minus 9 lambda.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.840
And then, what are my lambda
squared terms?

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.300
I have a plus lambda squared
and I have a

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.190
minus 4 lambda squared.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.500
So if you add those two
that's going to be

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.025
minus 3 lambda squared.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.130
And then finally, I have only
one lambda cubed term, that

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:05.670
right there.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:10.450
So this is the characteristic
polynomial for our matrix.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:15.170
So this is the characteristic
polynomial and this represents

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:18.350
the determinant for
any lambda.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:21.410
The determinant of this
matrix for any lambda.

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:25.210
And we said that this has to be
equal to 0 if any only if

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:26.820
lambda is truly an eigenvalue.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:31.260
So we're going to set
this equal to 0.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.570
And unlucky or lucky for us,
there is no real trivial--

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:36.380
there is no quadratic.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.990
Well there is, actually, but
it's very complicated.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.600
And so it's usually
a waste of time.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.300
So we're going to have to do
kind of the art of factoring a

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.440
quadratic polynomial.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.270
I got this problem out of a book
and I think it's fair to

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.020
say that if you ever do run into
this in an actual linear

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.970
algebra class or really, in an
algebra class generally-- it

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.380
doesn't even have to be in the
context of eigenvalues, you

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.920
probably will be dealing
with integer solutions.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:03.740
And if you are dealing with
integer solutions, then your

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.540
roots are going to be factors
of this term right here.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.960
Especially if you have a
1 coefficient out here.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.140
So your potential roots-- in
this case, what are the

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.145
factors of 27?

00:10:13.145 --> 00:10:18.720
So 1, 3, 9 and 27.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.230
So all these are potential
roots.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:21.410
So we can just try them out.

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:24.280
1 cubed is 1 minus 3.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.900
So let me try 1.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:31.300
So if we try a 1, it's 1 minus
3 minus 9 plus 27.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.630
That does not equal 0.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:36.640
It's minus 2 minus
9 is minus 11.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.510
Plus 16.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:38.580
That does not equal 0.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.490
So 1 is not a root.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:46.060
If we try 3 we get 3
cubed, which is 27.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.960
Minus 3 times 3 squared
is minus 3 times 3,

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.800
which is minus 27.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.320
Minus 9 times 3, which
is minus 27.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.470
Plus 27.

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:56.820
That does equal 0.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.450
So lucky for us, on our second
try we were able to

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.790
find one 0 for this.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:06.070
So if 3 is a 0, that means that
x minus 3 is one of the

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:07.550
factors of this.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.310
So that means that this is going
to be x minus 3 times

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.070
something else.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.010
Or I should say,
lambda minus 3.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.240
So let's see what the
other root is.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:22.310
So if I take lambda minus 3 and
I divide it into this guy

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:30.250
up here, into lambda cubed minus
3 lambda squared minus 9

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:34.870
lambda plus 27, what do I get?

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:38.800
Lambda goes into lambda cubed
lambda squared times.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.220
Lambda squared times that.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.650
Lambda squared times lambda
is lambda cubed.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:48.710
Lambda squared times minus 3
is minus 3 lambda squared.

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:53.280
You subtract these guys,
you get a 0.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.270
You get 0.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:57.100
And then we can put here--
well, we could

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:57.810
do it either way.

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:01.030
We could put it down
the minus 9.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.690
We could bring down
everything really.

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:09.980
So now you have minus
9 lambda plus 27.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.910
You can almost imagine we just
subtracted this from this

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:12.960
whole thing up here.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.480
And we're just left with
these terms right here.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.380
And so lambda minus
3 goes into this.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:23.160
Well lambda minus 3 goes
into 9 lambda.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.110
It goes into 9 lambda
minus 9 times.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:30.160
So I'll just write
minus 9 here.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:38.820
Minus 9 times lambda minus 3
is minus 9 lambda plus 27.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.550
So it went in very nicely.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:45.650
So you get to 0.

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:53.150
Our characteristic polynomial
has simplified to lambda minus

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:58.730
3 times lambda squared
minus 9.

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:01.070
And of course, we're going to
have to set this equal to 0 if

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:03.850
lambda is truly an eigenvalue
of our matrix.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:05.890
And this is very
easy to factor.

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:12.770
So this becomes lambda minus 3
times-- lambda squared minus 9

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:18.310
is just lambda plus 3 times
lambda minus 3.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.870
And all of that equals 0.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.650
And these roots, we already
know one of them.

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:24.010
We know that 3 is a root and
actually, this tells us 3 is a

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:24.980
root as well.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:30.500
So the possible eigenvalues of
our matrix A, our 3 by 3

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.960
matrix A that we had way up
there-- this matrix A right

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:38.040
there-- the possible eigenvalues
are: lambda is

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:44.410
equal to 3 or lambda is
equal to minus 3.

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.140
Those are the two values that
would make our characteristic

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:52.710
polynomial or the determinant
for this matrix equal to 0,

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:56.120
which is a condition that we
need to have in order for

00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:02.540
lambda to be an eigenvalue of a
for some non-zero vector v.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:04.050
In the next video, we'll
actually solve for the

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.840
eigenvectors, now that we know
what the eigenvalues are.
