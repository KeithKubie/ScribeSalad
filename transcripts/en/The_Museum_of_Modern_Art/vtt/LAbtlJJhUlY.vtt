00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.160
Welcome to a special episode of IN THE STUDIO.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.780
My name is Marlene Weisman, we’re here
in my Brooklyn studio.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.740
This is a special takeover edition of IN THE STUDIO in conjunction with Club 57.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.760
Club 57 was a club that was located on Saint
Mark's Place, downtown in New York City.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.000
It was more than just a downtown club that
showcased bands, it was really a hotbed of

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.210
creativity and art.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.710
In that era, I was a graphic designer for
a lot of the downtown clubs.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.750
I did a lot of work for the Peppermint Lounge,
Danceteria, Tramps, and The Bottom Line.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.970
I'd do the newspaper ads, and street posters
and fliers.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.870
Doing graphics then was a very tactile and
physical thing.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.570
We would have to make an actual, physical,
mechanical, and we use Xeroxes all through

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.980
doing graphics.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.840
I have a little notebook here.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.160
This is what I looked like going to the clubs.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.540
But talking back about the black and white
Xerox aesthetic, I have some samples of band

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.810
fliers because I kept a few of these, too.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.530
And bands really wanted to have that Xerox-y
anti-art quality to them.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.000
It was a mixture of things.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.200
It was a DIY, do-it-yourself aesthetic.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.150
People didn't want to be perceived as sell-outs
or too fancy.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.740
They just wanted really barebones fliers,
and as you can see in this flier, there are

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.320
a lot of little elements that were pasted
in and a lot of hand lettering.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.010
So while I was doing that kind of graphic
design

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.220
I got the idea that maybe the Xerox machine
would be a great source of doing art.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.720
I happened to see a flier for a show at Club 57

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.420
that Keith Haring put together.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.300
And I saw this and got really excited because
that's exactly what I was doing.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.759
I brought three pieces down and he looked
at them, and he said, "These are great.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.759
Put them up."

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.400
And thus began my association with Club 57.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.380
A lot of memories from that time, a lot of
not memories, but it was great to be part

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:19.260
of New York City in that era.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.700
So what is Xerox art?

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.439
Well, you can simply Xerox something, cut
it up, paste it into a collage, and then say

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:32.829
you're finished, but what I'm going to do
is take it a step further and show the technique

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:40.709
of taking a reproduced piece out of a Xerox
machine, placing it on a piece of paper, and

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.769
transferring the ink off to make a whole new
piece of art on a different piece of paper.

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.019
And the possibilities are endless.

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.139
I have a narrative piece that's I call a memoir
type piece.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:59.249
I have a collage piece that I've coupled the
Xerox transfers with pieces of painting that

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:00.249
I've done.

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:05.790
I also did a Warhol-ian piece, so a piece
in the style of what Andy would have done

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.029
with repeated images.

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:12.629
So with this technique, you can choose cold-pressed
and hot-pressed paper.

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.090
There are benefits to each one when doing
Xerox transfers.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.870
Hot-pressed sometimes will work over better
with the transfer because there's less tooth

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:23.870
to it.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.389
It's so smooth, the surface, to receive the
toner.

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.970
So let's talk about the solvent part of a
Xerox transfer.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.969
In the '80s, I used acetone which is not
the safest chemical to use.

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:37.620
You have to be a little careful.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:45.860
There are now things that you can use as well,
a golden gel or matte mediums work, gesso works.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.790
You can even use packing tape that are a lot
less toxic.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.959
You can always get a more familiar product
which is nail polish remover.

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.749
This will work as well.

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:57.650
Again, safe handling is really important.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:04.409
I would only use a little bit at a time, pouring
it into a metal cup or a glass cup.

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:09.260
So another element of Xerox transfer art,
of course, is the Xeroxes themselves.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.559
I have a big folder of images that I organized.

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:16.870
When I make the images, I do them in a few
different sizes because there's nothing worse

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.340
than getting back to your studio and saying,
"Oh, I wish I had that 50% smaller!"

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.090
You have to, of course, make sure that you're
using a Xerox machine that is toner-based,

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.700
not laser, toner-based because that's the
chemical that will...I think it's a powder

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.410
that will come off and onto your substrate,
onto your paper.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.300
So final supplies that are good to have on
hand for doing Xerox transfer art is tape,

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.440
a good artist tape, so gentle on the paper.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.790
You'll need a burnisher.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.250
I have the burnisher I actually used back
in the Club 57 days.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.933
Maybe it's my lucky burnisher, but readily
available.

00:04:56.933 --> 00:05:01.790
But more readily available is something called
a bone folder and this can be bought at any

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.410
art supply store.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.690
You'll need a kitchen sponge, a plain kitchen
sponge which I'll show in a demonstration.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.130
We're going to cut into strips.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.900
So having some scissors handy is really good.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:22.350
And the other thing I would recommend are
to have pencils and other media to draw and

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.270
paint into the compositions when you're done
with them.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.560
So, enough talking here, let's make an art
piece.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.690
Here we go.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.720
I'm going to take a piece of Xerox here.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:43.030
I think I will cut out the piece I'm going
to transfer.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:52.190
I'm doing that because I think it will avoid
getting unwanted Xerox transfer onto there

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.150
because I don't want this piece, but I want
this piece, and I'm leaving a lot of white

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:03.270
space around what I'm cutting because we need
some room to tape around the sides.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.450
So here's one element.

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.440
I think I'm going to place that down for now.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:15.620
Okay, so, I think I have a nice amount of
images.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:22.470
Now we have our elements and I'm going
to move them around a little bit.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.960
And again, remember, when you're transferring,
everything is the opposite direction.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:33.240
So what I'm doing is now looking through the
back of the paper, and now I have a little

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.340
bit of an idea of what I want to do.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.300
I think I'm going to start with the bottom
image.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.350
So I'm going to put these aside.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:48.960
And I'm going to make a little flap with the
tape and securely tape it down.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:55.090
This way, if I want to go over an area of
the transfer, I can do that.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.520
The next thing you're going to do is take
your acetone.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.510
I'll use the polish remover in this case.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.720
You don't need that much, just a little bit.

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.260
And I'm also going to cut a piece of sponge.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:21.580
Dab a little bit on the sponge, get it wet
a little bit and then go over your area.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.500
And you can see the image through the back

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.420
And then really quickly, really quickly start burnishing.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.900
I don't know if this is working, but we'll
find out.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:41.880
I have a good feeling that it is transferring.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:49.980
So I'll do a little…another section at a
time, and I will...I'm holding down the paper

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.410
really tightly.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:58.100
So there's very little gapping between the
Xerox and the paper.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:09.180
Now, this may be a little too much, we'll
see, acetone, because the sponge kind of fell

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:13.560
in there which you should leave it out of
the little cup.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:22.400
But a good sign is when you start seeing the
transfer getting light on the back, you know,

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:27.190
that maybe something is going on that you
are getting the effect you want.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.650
So I'm going to take a little peek.

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:33.829
It looks good, okay, but I'm not going to
lift it up yet, so I'm going to keep going

00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:35.980
courageously.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:46.240
Very quickly because I don't want the acetone
to just spread and blur the image.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:52.320
All right, so let's see what we get, the big
reveal, in a minute.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:58.529
So now I see a little part I missed.

00:08:58.529 --> 00:09:01.639
So I didn't lift it up fully yet.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.120
So I'm going to do that again.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.779
Sometimes missing part of an image makes it
more interesting.

00:09:08.779 --> 00:09:16.059
So again, in all great art, accidents are
a really fun part.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.379
So let's see.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.900
Well, pretty good.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.120
So that is how you do a transfer.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:32.170
And again, it really transformed the image
which was a Xerox of a Dover book

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:37.279
of an old engraving, but it really put a lot
of depth into the image.

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:41.009
I want to fill out this other area with this
other mysterious piece of machinery.

00:09:41.009 --> 00:09:42.639
I think this is a printing press.

00:09:42.639 --> 00:09:43.800
I'm not really sure what this is.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.959
It's some kind of piston engine.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.680
I'm going to fill in the space here and in
this case I'm off the edge, so that's okay.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.230
You should have proper ventilation.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:07.610
I have a fan going usually because
these fumes get a little overwhelming after

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:13.240
a while, but it's no worse than taking off
your nail polish.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:19.579
And as you can see, the back emerging, it
really gives you a good guide.

00:10:19.579 --> 00:10:22.850
It doesn't matter what direction you're burnishing.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:25.620
It could be any direction, really.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:33.699
Okay, let’s see if I…oh, there, so there
we go.

00:10:33.699 --> 00:10:38.620
Now I have my unusual machine which I can
draw and paint into.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.040
I can choose to connect these.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.560
Let's see what happens.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:11.809
Okay, did we get a transfer?

00:11:11.809 --> 00:11:16.180
Carefully take off the tape because you don't
want to rip the paper.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.610
And not bad.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:21.829
We lost a little over here, but that's an
easy draw into.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.840
And we have a scissor-wielding angel for everyone
to enjoy.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.920
Okay.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.680
Well, let's see.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.800
And we got a nice transfer.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:45.520
And because I cut that away, it kind of, you
know, works with the composition.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:50.960
I like to have the images be different sizes
because then you get a kind of a feeling of

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:52.560
a flow, which is fun.

00:11:52.589 --> 00:11:56.800
So I generally know where I'm going to put
these and it also brings your eye

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.160
down into the machine.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:07.019
You know, I think maybe it will be interesting
to make one of these clocks kind of coming

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.520
off from the edge of the page.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.000
Wow, okay, looking good.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.360
I'm just going to tape this little guy down
here.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.320
And there we go.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:50.800
Okay, I think that what I'd like to do is
see if I could connect these two elements

00:12:50.839 --> 00:12:54.959
to make them a full whimsical, mysterious
machine.

00:12:54.959 --> 00:13:01.379
How I like to do that is to use Prismacolor
pencils and also waterproof felt tip pens

00:13:01.379 --> 00:13:04.400
that the cartoonists use or illustrators use.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:12.389
So pretty much I'm just extending the lines
to kind of connect these two.

00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:17.089
Maybe I'll go back in with this pencil now
and again, another thing you can work on for

00:13:17.089 --> 00:13:19.309
hours and you could just keep going.

00:13:19.309 --> 00:13:21.480
So I think I finished playing with this a
little bit.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:26.360
I can go in more, but for demonstration's
sakes, maybe we'll go on to some color.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.529
I have my Dr. Martin's inks.

00:13:28.529 --> 00:13:31.029
I haven't used these in a long time.

00:13:31.029 --> 00:13:33.480
And you'll see how dense these are.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:38.740
You could just take a teeny and that's already
so dense.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:43.029
That was just a teeny, little dab but I’ll
lighten it.

00:13:43.029 --> 00:13:47.550
Sometimes I even use a little piece of board
to mix my color.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:54.610
A little yellow, let's see what we get.

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:58.920
But as you can see I'm using very small quantities
of these.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.489
They go a long way.

00:14:00.489 --> 00:14:03.890
So I added a nice little gradient effect.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:05.980
It gives a little interest.

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:11.629
The beauty of using these watercolors is that
the tones show through.

00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:12.779
And you can keep building.

00:14:12.779 --> 00:14:18.490
If you thought you went too light and you
wanted more color, you can just go over it.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:23.239
And it's just great how the transfers hold
up to water media.

00:14:23.239 --> 00:14:26.019
And this hot-pressed mixed media
paper is holding up pretty well too.

00:14:26.019 --> 00:14:27.440
It’s not buckling at all.

00:14:30.509 --> 00:14:32.069
So the machine is looking good.

00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:37.339
I like the color in there and I think that
to complete the piece, I think it would make

00:14:37.339 --> 00:14:42.839
sense to bring some color up so the obvious
place is to add some color to the clocks,

00:14:42.839 --> 00:14:44.240
to the stopwatches.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.009
If you want to tone down a color, I’ve done
this in many of my pieces.

00:14:51.009 --> 00:14:55.790
I can just go over it again with a Prismacolor
pencil.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.360
Just checking if it’s dry.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:09.420
Okay so we finished the gears and we finished
the watches and added our color.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:22.950
And I think there's one more spot that color
could be put in to complete the piece.

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:26.819
Okay so I think this is an interesting place
to stop.

00:15:26.819 --> 00:15:32.220
I think if I kept going, I would maybe define
the wing a little more, work with my pencils

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.799
again like I had shown on connecting the machine.

00:15:34.799 --> 00:15:37.699
I think that maybe I regret the color.

00:15:37.699 --> 00:15:41.999
I think maybe this worked—had more punch
as a black and white piece.

00:15:41.999 --> 00:15:47.310
But I think that it was good for demonstration
purposes to show how you can add color and

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:52.239
how the translucent vibrancy of the color
kind of plays with the toner.

00:15:52.239 --> 00:15:53.500
You can take this in any direction.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:57.070
There are a lot of things you can do.

00:15:57.070 --> 00:16:03.089
What I like to do is be a little less illustrative
and maybe go a little more painterly.

00:16:03.089 --> 00:16:08.550
I have an example up there of something I've
worked on that I was inspired by Corey's video

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:15.389
on the de Kooning paintings and I started
playing with firm brush strokes.

00:16:15.389 --> 00:16:20.670
And maybe if I worked on this a little more,
I would start putting elements like that and

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:26.649
take this to a whole different area a little
more edgy which I would like to do.

00:16:26.649 --> 00:16:29.100
But for our purposes, I think we did well.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:35.610
I hope you enjoyed learning about Xerox transfer
techniques and a little bit about Club 57

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:40.510
and what it was like downtown in New York
City in the 1970s and 1980s.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:41.870
I hope you get a chance to come to see the
Club 57 exhibition.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:46.029
