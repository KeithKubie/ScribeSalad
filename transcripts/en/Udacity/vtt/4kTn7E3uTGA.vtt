00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.870
I'm really excited that the project that Udacity and Figure Eight are

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.375
doing together is focused on disaster response.

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:20.520
The Figure Eight creates software that people use to train their machine learning models.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.950
So, I used Figure Eight to respond to a lot of disasters before I joined the company.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.330
For a lot of these disasters,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.750
we have data that we can go back and look at.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.590
We can use our data science knowledge to build

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.590
machine learning models that can automate some of processing the next time around.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.785
While this Nanodegree could have taken any kind of dataset,

00:00:38.785 --> 00:00:43.330
they're taking one where immediately is going to have a positive impact on the world.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.800
So, it fills my heart to know that a lot of

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.400
really smart people are going to be analyzing this in new ways,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.990
and that's going to help us have

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.720
a positive impact in the world as we respond to future disasters.
