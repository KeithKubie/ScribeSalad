00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.160
Now we turn to the concept
of a vertex cover,

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.400
which will play a role analogous to the
one played by the concept of minimum cut

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.010
in our discussion of maximum flows.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.870
Given a graph, G,
we say that S is a vertex cover

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.360
if every edge is incident
on a vertex in S.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.619
Thus we say that S covers all the edges.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.450
Take this graph for example here.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.830
If we include this vertex,
then we cover these three edges.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.619
Including this vertex covers
these three more, and

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.110
this vertex includes these more edges.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.170
And lastly,
we need to cover this edge here so

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.750
we'll ad this vertex here as well.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.010
One pretty easy observation
to make about a vertex cover

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.450
is that its size serves
as an upper bound for

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.890
the size of a matching in a graph
as stated in the proposition here.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.310
The proof is simple.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.410
Clearly for every edge int he matching
at least vertex must be in the cover,

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.120
and of course all these
vertices must be distinct

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.630
because no vertex is
in two matched edges.
