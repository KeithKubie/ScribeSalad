00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.132
60 times the square root of 3y is correct. That's amazing if you figured this

00:00:04.132 --> 00:00:08.630
one out, I know it was tough. Now there are a lot of ways to simplify this

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.115
radical, I'm going to show you the quickest way. We start by splitting 108 into

00:00:13.115 --> 00:00:19.410
36 times 3, 36 is the largest perfect square that goes into 108. First 75 we'll

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.704
split it up into 25 times 3. Now we can apply the product rule and split up

00:00:23.704 --> 00:00:28.427
this radical into two separate radicals. The square root of 36 times the square

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:33.247
root of 3y. We do the same thing for this radical. This allows us to take the

00:00:33.247 --> 00:00:38.980
square root of 36 which is 6. and the square root of 25, which equals 5. We

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.378
know 5 times 6 equals 30, and 6 times 5 also equals 30. We have two like

00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:48.536
radicals, since they're both the square root of 3y, and we add 30 and 30 to get

00:00:48.536 --> 00:00:53.264
our final answer, 60 times the square root of 3y.
