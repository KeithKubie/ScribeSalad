has now recently been vindicated and

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490
has now recently been vindicated and

bands David Bradley well they haven't

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980
bands David Bradley well they haven't
 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.880
bands David Bradley well they haven't
actually got to the diffuse bounds yet

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890
 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.009
but I as i said earlier in the previous

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019
but I as i said earlier in the previous
 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.569
but I as i said earlier in the previous
question it's hard to believe that

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579
question it's hard to believe that
 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.850
question it's hard to believe that
they're not about that c6 is not

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860
they're not about that c6 is not
 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.690
they're not about that c6 is not
involved because if it's not involved

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700
involved because if it's not involved
 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.100
involved because if it's not involved
there there's something else out there

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110
there there's something else out there
 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.959
there there's something else out there
even probably more exciting and lurking

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969
even probably more exciting and lurking
 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.400
even probably more exciting and lurking
they're responsible for this and that

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410
they're responsible for this and that
 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.830
they're responsible for this and that
would be really exciting as well but by

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840
would be really exciting as well but by
 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.650
would be really exciting as well but by
and large the fact that it is there in

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660
and large the fact that it is there in
 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.819
and large the fact that it is there in
space is quite nice I I like that

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829
space is quite nice I I like that
 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.910
space is quite nice I I like that
because as I said the horizon program I

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920
because as I said the horizon program I
 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.300
because as I said the horizon program I
was pretty sure then that it must be

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310
was pretty sure then that it must be
 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.429
was pretty sure then that it must be
inspected I mean it has to be in

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439
inspected I mean it has to be in
 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.420
inspected I mean it has to be in
interstellar space but what I think the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430
interstellar space but what I think the
 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.160
interstellar space but what I think the
most recent results indicated is that

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
most recent results indicated is that
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.580
most recent results indicated is that
there's a lot more than we expected my

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590
there's a lot more than we expected my
 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.340
there's a lot more than we expected my
friend might juror at UCLA made an

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350
friend might juror at UCLA made an
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.740
friend might juror at UCLA made an
estimate now that from the camis work

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750
estimate now that from the camis work
 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.719
estimate now that from the camis work
and other people have also detected

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729
and other people have also detected
 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.359
and other people have also detected
material in space of c60 in space

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369
material in space of c60 in space
 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.469
material in space of c60 in space
there's about one percent of the carbon

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479
there's about one percent of the carbon
 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.859
there's about one percent of the carbon
which is amazing it really it's on and

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869
which is amazing it really it's on and
 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.460
which is amazing it really it's on and
so there you go there's more c60 around

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470
so there you go there's more c60 around
 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.710
so there you go there's more c60 around
them there is planet Earth there you go

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720
them there is planet Earth there you go
 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.510
them there is planet Earth there you go
it's a it's great I tonight obviously

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520
it's a it's great I tonight obviously
 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.120
it's a it's great I tonight obviously
very pleased in it and also that there's

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130
very pleased in it and also that there's
 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.249
very pleased in it and also that there's
so many exciting things to do in the

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259
so many exciting things to do in the
 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.219
so many exciting things to do in the
future it's a disk c where c 60 years

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229
future it's a disk c where c 60 years
 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.940
future it's a disk c where c 60 years
and to try to understand the way in

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950
and to try to understand the way in
 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.190
and to try to understand the way in
which c60 is involved in the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200
which c60 is involved in the
 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.880
which c60 is involved in the
interstellar medium because it's got to

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890
interstellar medium because it's got to
 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.369
interstellar medium because it's got to
be made in in a star I don't think it

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379
be made in in a star I don't think it
 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.309
be made in in a star I don't think it
could be made in the interstellar medium

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319
could be made in the interstellar medium
 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.649
could be made in the interstellar medium
as possible it's got to be made at a

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659
as possible it's got to be made at a
 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.619
as possible it's got to be made at a
point where companies is nucleating very

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629
point where companies is nucleating very
 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.869
point where companies is nucleating very
rapidly and they always thought that are

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879
rapidly and they always thought that are
 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.229
rapidly and they always thought that are
called borealis stars RCB stars where

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239
called borealis stars RCB stars where
 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.869
called borealis stars RCB stars where
the place with a lot less hydrogen and

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879
the place with a lot less hydrogen and
 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.670
the place with a lot less hydrogen and
helium but you know some of these

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680
helium but you know some of these
 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.349
helium but you know some of these
objects have quite a lot of hydrogen and

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359
objects have quite a lot of hydrogen and
 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.330
objects have quite a lot of hydrogen and
that indicates that we really don't

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340
that indicates that we really don't
 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.420
that indicates that we really don't
understand carbon that well yet because

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430
understand carbon that well yet because
 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.240
understand carbon that well yet because
you would have expected that if there

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250
you would have expected that if there
 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.190
you would have expected that if there
was still a lot of hydrogen around that

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200
was still a lot of hydrogen around that
 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.659
was still a lot of hydrogen around that
carbon would go off in some other

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:41.669
carbon would go off in some other
 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:43.280
carbon would go off in some other
direction but it looks like the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290
direction but it looks like the
 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.839
direction but it looks like the
conditions and these stars even those

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849
conditions and these stars even those
 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.899
conditions and these stars even those
hydrogen as such that they favor c60 so

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909
hydrogen as such that they favor c60 so
 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.690
hydrogen as such that they favor c60 so
it's very exciting and obviously and I'm

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700
it's very exciting and obviously and I'm
 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.539
it's very exciting and obviously and I'm
quite satisfied with that last very

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549
quite satisfied with that last very
 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.560
quite satisfied with that last very
wrong at the end of that horizon program
