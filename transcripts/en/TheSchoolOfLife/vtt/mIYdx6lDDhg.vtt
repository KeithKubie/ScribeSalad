00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.000
From a distance, philosophy seems weird, irrelevant,
boring...

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.540
 and yet also – just a little – intriguing.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.160
But what are philosophers really for?

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.830
The answer is, handily, already contained
in the word philosophy itself.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.520
In Ancient Greek, philo means love
and sophia means wisdom.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.600
Philosophers are people devoted to wisdom.

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.840
Being wise means attempting to live and die well.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.650
In their pursuit of wisdom, philosophers have
developed a very

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.249
specific skill-set. They have, over the centuries,
become experts in

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:39.329
many of the things that make people not very
wise. Five stand out:

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.260
There are lots of big questions around: What
is the meaning of life?

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.940
What's a job for? How should society be arranged?

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.999
Most of us entertain them every now and then,
but we despair of trying

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:56.659
to answer them. They have the status of jokes.
We call them

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.479
'pretentious'. But they matter deeply because
only with sound answers

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:04.110
to them can we direct our energies meaningfully.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.759
Philosophers are people unafraid of asking
questions. They have, over

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.060
the centuries, asked the very largest. They
realise that these

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.630
questions can always be broken down into more
manageable chunks and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.689
that the only really pretentious thing is
to think one is above

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.589
raising big naive-sounding enquiries.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.229
Public opinion – or what gets called ‘common
sense’ – is sensible and

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.539
reasonable in countless areas. It’s what
you hear about from friends

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.749
and neighbours, the stuff you take in without
even thinking about it.

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:38.499
But common sense is also often full of daftness
and error.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.439
Philosophy gets us to submit all aspects of
common sense to reason.

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.429
It wants us to think for ourselves. Is it really
true what people say

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.539
about love, money, children, travel, work?
Philosophers are interested

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.310
in asking whether an idea is logical – rather
than simply assuming it

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.380
must be right because it is popular and long-established.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.220
We’re not very good at knowing what goes
on in our own minds.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.200
Someone we meet is very annoying, but we can’t pin down what the issue is.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.090
 Or we lose our temper, but can’t readily tell what we’re so cross about.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.360
We lack insight into our own satisfactions
and dislikes.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.450
That’s why we need to examine our own minds.
Philosophy is committed

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.739
to self-knowledge – and its central precept
– articulated by the

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.519
earliest, greatest philosopher, Socrates – is
just two words long:

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.239
Know yourself.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.230
We’re not very good at making ourselves
happy. We overrate the power

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.650
of some things to improve our lives – and
underrate others.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.720
We make the wrong choices because, guided by advertising and false glamour,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.560
we keep on imagining that a particular kind of holiday, or car, or computer

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.080
will make a bigger difference than it can.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.260
At the same time, we underestimate the contribution
of other things –

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.580
like going for a walk - which may have little
prestige but can

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.230
contribute deeply to the character of existence.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.799
Philosophers seek to be wise by getting more
precise about the

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.799
activities and attitudes that really can help
our lives to go better.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.000
Philosophers are good at keeping a sense of
what really matters and what doesn't. 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.520
On hearing the news that he’d
lost all his possessions in a shipwreck,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.760
the Stoic philosopher Zeno
simply said:

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.680
‘Fortune commands me to be a less encumbered philosopher.’

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.660
It’s responses like these that have made the very term ‘philosophical’
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.740
a byword for calm, long-term thinking and strength-of-mind,

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.560
 in
short, for perspective.

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.200
The wisdom of philosophy is – in modern
times – mostly delivered in

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.409
the form of books. But in the past, philosophers
sat in market squares

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.400
and discussed their ideas with shopkeepers
or went into government

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.860
offices and palaces to give advice. It wasn’t
abnormal to have a

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.659
philosopher on the payroll. Philosophy was
thought of as a normal,

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.920
basic activity – rather than as an unusual,
esoteric, optional extra.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.580
Nowadays, it’s not so much that we overtly
deny this thought but we

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.170
just don’t have the right institutions set
up to promulgate wisdom

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.420
coherently in the world. In the future, though,
when the value of

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.260
philosophy is a little clearer, we can expect
to meet more

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.859
philosophers in daily life. They won’t be
locked up, living mainly in

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:16.970
university departments, because the points
at which our unwisdom bites

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.410
– and messes up our lives – are multiple
and urgently need attention -

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.920
right now.
