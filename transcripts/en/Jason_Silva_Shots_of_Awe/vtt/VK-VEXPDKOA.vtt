00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.410
So one of my favorite lines
from Ernest Becker's book,

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.570
"The Denial of
Death," is the notion

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.900
that character is a vital lie.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.280
So of course the self is a
house of cards constructed

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.650
with interconnected
webs of meanings,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.070
cultural affiliations,
stereotypes,

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.810
artificial renderings
about who we

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.460
are as we navigate this world.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.990
We construct self esteem.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.810
We construct a foundation so
that we can stand with dignity.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.830
But ultimately it's all the lie.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.660
Human beings are food for worms.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.740
The fact that we're
going to die imbues even

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.950
our greatest ecstasies
with a sting, with a burn.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.110
I've had such a good life.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.360
And so when he says
character is a vital lie,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.370
he inserts the word "vital" in
there, as if to say "noble."

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.970
Man is noble even
if he is doomed.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.560
Man is noble even
if he is worm food.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.520
Therein lies our beauty.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.770
Therein lies our tragedy.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.580
And therein lies the anxiety
that eats me up from inside

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.770
sometimes, and probably what
pushes me to try to make art.
