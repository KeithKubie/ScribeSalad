00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.990
Okay Michael, so what are our features? When we

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.900
have a bunch of documents let's say full of words?

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.920
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure, it could be things like the number of words in the document?

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.540
&gt;&gt; That could be, but what sort of,

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.550
and that's actually perfectly reasonable thing but what's the

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.350
simpliest set of features that you might start with

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.520
from which you might then compute more interesting features?

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.390
&gt;&gt; Well there's a super, duper big set of features which are the words.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.190
&gt;&gt; Right, so in

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.380
fact that is exactly what we have, is we have words.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.340
Maybe we have punctuation and, you know. Words are sort of the

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.580
obvious thing to do. I typed in machine learning, why don't

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.350
I just return every single document that has machine followed by learning.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.360
&gt;&gt; Maybe you should.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.480
&gt;&gt; Maybe I should and maybe that's a

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.700
perfectly reasonable thing to do. In the case of

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.840
machine learning, should I return documents that contain

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.460
the word Machine but don't contain the word learning?

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.250
&gt;&gt; I wouldn't score them very highly.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.220
&gt;&gt; I might not score them as highly, but I might still return

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.970
them as being at least more relevant

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.170
than documents that contain neither Machine nor Learning.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.680
&gt;&gt; Right, that are just about turtles, say.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.170
&gt;&gt; Right exactly, although it's turtles all the way down Michael.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.320
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.600
&gt;&gt; OK. So if our features are words, which are the sort of the most

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.410
obvious things to get at, we can compute

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.250
other things like the number of words or

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.120
whatever. But basically our features are going to be

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.140
words or counts of words or something like

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.710
that. As it's sort of a. Reasonable first

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.840
step. And, in fact, the very early retrieval

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.670
systems, which, you know, predate both of us, actually Michael,

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.290
used simple things like words. Now, there's a lot of

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.810
way, details to this you could imagine. Like maybe you'd

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.510
want to transform all plurals into their singular version, get

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.140
rid of words like the. And there's a bunch of

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.720
complicated stuff you might want to do. But, it's not particularly

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.570
relevant for this discussion. So, just assume whatever you want

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.630
to assume about the kind of words that you have. Okay?

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.510
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.460
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, what's the problem

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.310
with using words? Can you think of any problems with using words?

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.480
&gt;&gt; Well, there's a lot of them.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.320
&gt;&gt; Right. That's actually the first thing.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.180
There's a lot of words. Which means there

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.140
are a lot of features. Which means

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.910
the curse of dimensionality is going to hurt us.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.180
&gt;&gt; I would think that they'd be

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.600
pretty good indicators of meaning, except I guess

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.710
there's kind of two complimentary problems. One is

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.900
that some words mean more than one thing.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.420
&gt;&gt; Mm. I like that. So we have good indicators.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.560
Words are good indicators of meaning because, you

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.810
know. The words, but, you could be in the

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.790
case where you have words mean multiple things. You

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.295
said there were two problems, what's the second one.

00:02:16.295 --> 00:02:18.830
&gt;&gt; Sort of the opposite, which is, you

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.048
can say the same thing using completely different words.

00:02:23.048 --> 00:02:27.720
&gt;&gt; yes. So that's that many words mean the same thing. In

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.510
particular, words, the fact that words

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.830
can have multiple meanings. It's called polysemy.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.370
The fact that many words can mean the same thing is called synonymy. So, can

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.200
you think of a word that might have

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.570
multiple meanings? That indicates the problem of polysemy?

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.230
&gt;&gt; Well, so, you know, learning, in the machine learning example,

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.190
learning. Sometimes refers to, this statistical process that we've been talking

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.160
about. But it also refers to the thing that, people do.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.780
And in some, in some scenarios, it actually means to teach. Like,

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.810
I'm going to learn you something.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.250
&gt;&gt; That's true, but that's just too on point.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.830
I'm going to pick something else. That I think you

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.700
will appreciate at the end. Let's think of a

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.060
word like car. So car has multiple meanings, Michael.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.560
&gt;&gt; Hmm.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.530
&gt;&gt; Can you think of them?

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.740
&gt;&gt; I'm mostly stuck on one at the moment. Unless you're thinking of.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.070
&gt;&gt; Which one is that?

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.600
&gt;&gt; I'm thinking of the vehicle that you drive around.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.140
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.050
&gt;&gt; But I guess one could also be referring to

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.150
a list deconstruct or in LISP.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.340
&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly. It's the first in what are those things called?

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.160
&gt;&gt; CON, CON cells?

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.200
&gt;&gt; CON. Thank you. Right, so car is

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.360
either an automobile or it's the first element

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.510
in a cons cell, which all of you people who've heard of lisp knows is an awesome

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.450
reference. [LAUGH] For those of you who've never

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.898
used lisp, which is clearly the greatest language every

00:03:46.898 --> 00:03:48.581
written in all of history, or that ever

00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:51.580
will be written. Because it is a superset and

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.870
subsumes all other languages, including natural languages. Imagine this

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.330
word, instead, is apple. And so apple can refer

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.360
to a fruit, or it can refer to a

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.530
computer company, or to a music company for that matter.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.450
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.210
&gt;&gt; But, I prefer car. So, car can mean

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.430
automobile, or it can mean the first element in

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.140
a cons cell. If you're using Lisp. Now sticking

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.240
to this car example synonymy is a similar problem

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:22.810
in that car and automobile often refer to the same thing. So

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.280
you see this. So polysemy is a problem multiple things and synonymy

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.740
is a problem meaning the same thing. And a paticular word like

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.830
car in this case. Can cause both polysemy problems and synonymy problems.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can see that. So in the

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.860
example you gave before about machine learning, you would,

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.610
if you'd just returned documents that had machine and

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.430
learning right after each other, then you'd miss all

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.410
the stuff on, for example, data mining. Right, in fact, that's

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.650
a very good example so, there's a huge split in the community

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.970
between those who care about data mining and those who care about

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.520
machine learning. And often the people in one camp don't believe the

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.560
people in the other camp are doing what they're doing. But for

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.310
the person who isn't religiously commited to one of those camps or

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.060
the others, when you talk about machine learning you probably also care

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.460
about data mining. When you talk about data mining you probably also

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.980
care about what people inside the field might call it instead

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.140
of machine learning. And so you would be missing out on

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.810
a whole swath of papers or interetinst discussions if you happend

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.880
to put in the word machine learning. But similarly if you put

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.840
in the word like data mining you might end up getting

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.900
all kinds of documents that are about the data or about the

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.020
data than you get when you literally mine for ocal. Who

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.170
knows? And it would cause you huge problems for getting the exactly

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.850
relelvant set of documents that you want. So we

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.240
can actually talk about this in terms of, the

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.970
kind of errors that you get in say supervised

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.990
learning, what kind of errors do polysemy give you, Michael?

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.390
&gt;&gt; False, well there's false positive and false negative and

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.840
this one of the things where we, its going to return

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.070
things that aren't relevant, its going to say they're positive when

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.210
they're not. So you've given me the answer, false positive. Okay.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.530
&gt;&gt; Looks like false positive.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.130
By contrast synonymy gives you what?

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.900
&gt;&gt; True positives.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:02.320
&gt;&gt; No,

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.800
&gt;&gt; No wait, I negated the wrong word, false negatives.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.370
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.320
&gt;&gt; In other words it's going to, wait is that right? Does the, so false

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.230
negative means, oh it's going to tell you

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.940
something's not there, when actually it really is.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.810
&gt;&gt; Right, so

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.950
&gt;&gt; Typing in car will not just give me the automobile

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:23.385
articles about my Tesla, which is a black P85. With black leather,

00:06:23.385 --> 00:06:26.420
[LAUGH] fully loaded and is like the greatest car on

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.440
the planet, but it will also give me really awesome, but

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.690
in this case not what I'm looking for, documents about LISP.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.690
Meanwhile, when I type in car, I will actually get all

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.870
these things on automobiles. But I won't get articles that

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.600
talk about automobiles without actually using the word car. So you

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.760
can imagine that these sorts of problems come up all the

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.110
time. You've got a set of features, in this case words,

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.995
which have this problem that although they're good indicators. They

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:54.860
are insufficient, that is we have a set of features

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.270
that will generate false positives and false negatives on their

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.040
own and more to the point, doing feature selection will

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.950
not solve this problem. I can throw away a bunch

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:06.640
of irelivent words and even useless words, but I am

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.210
still going this problem of generating false positives. For our

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:14.240
polysemy and false negatives, or synonomy. And this goes beyond

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.080
simply, information retrieval and text retrieval into

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.080
any generic problem where you have possibly

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.010
a large set of features that have

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.720
this problem with false negatives and false positives.
