00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is 20 m/s.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It went from 0 to 10 in its first second.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It'll go from 10 to 20 in it's second second.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
That is what constant acceleration means.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In fact, after 9 seconds, for example, the object will be going 90 m/s.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It seems like, again, we're seeing this proportionality.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In fact, this velocity seems to be proportional to time.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Here's it's just 10 times whatever the time is.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So, we have this relationship--v proportional to t.

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Wow, we've really discovered a lot about motion.
