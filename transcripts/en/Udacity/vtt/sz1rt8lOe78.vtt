00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
There is one fundamental issue about calibration and validation, namely that

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
prediction does not always go hand in hand with understanding.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Look at these two models for the motion of a planet in the solar system.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Let's look at the left model--here the earth is fixed in space

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and close to the earth--thus the center of some large circle.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This point moves around that circle and a point on that second circle,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
which then moves in this direction.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This is called an epicycle, and we can continue that process.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
That point could be the center of another circle and so on and so on until finally

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
we say that the planet is moving around that final circle.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
That's one of the antique models and let's have a look at the right one.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Here the sun is at the center, the earth moves in a circle around the sun,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and that planet moves in circle.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Here comes the last quiz for you--which of these models allows a more flexible calibration

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and which of these two models allows a more accurate prediction of the apparent motion

00:01:03.000 --> 99:59:59.000
of the planet as seen from earth.
