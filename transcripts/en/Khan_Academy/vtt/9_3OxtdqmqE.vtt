00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.150
We know that if we have two
lines that are parallel-- so

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.560
let me draw those two
parallel lines, l and m.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.580
So that's line l and line m.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.990
We know that if
they are parallel,

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.040
then if we were to draw a
transversal that intersects

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.450
both of them, that the
corresponding angles are equal.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.010
So this is x, and
this is y So we

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:27.709
know that if l is parallel
to m, then x is equal to y.

00:00:27.709 --> 00:00:29.500
What I want to do in
this video is prove it

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.460
the other way around.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.830
I want to prove-- So
this is what we know.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.630
We know this.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:42.160
What I want to do is prove
if x is equal to y, then l

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.442
is parallel to m.

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:44.650
So that we can go either way.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.080
If they're parallel, then the
corresponding angles are equal.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.455
And I want to show if the
corresponding angles are equal,

00:00:49.455 --> 00:00:51.500
then the lines are
definitely parallel.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.890
And what I'm going to do is
prove it by contradiction.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.820
So let's put this
aside right here.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.220
This is our goal.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.650
I'm going to assume
that this isn't true.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.710
I'm going to assume
that it's not true.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.730
So I'm going to assume
that x is equal to y

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:16.980
and l is not parallel to m.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.010
So let's think about what type
of a reality that would create.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.310
So if l and m are not parallel,
and they're different lines,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.490
then they're going to
intersect at some point.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.960
So let me draw l like this.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.160
This is line l.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.346
Let me draw m like this.

00:01:30.346 --> 00:01:31.470
They're going to intersect.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.020
By definition, if two
lines are not parallel,

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.980
they're going to
intersect each other.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.560
And that is going to be m.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.450
And then this thing
that was a transversal,

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.640
I'll just draw it over here.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.200
So I'll just draw it over here.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.310
And then this is x.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.080
This is y.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.870
And we're assuming
that y is equal to x.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.970
So we could also call the
measure of this angle x.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.800
So given all of this
reality, and we're

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.890
assuming in either case
that this is some distance,

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.590
that this line is
not of 0 length.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.450
And so this line right over here
is not going to be of 0 length.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.910
Or this line segment
between points A and B.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.120
I guess we could say that AB,
the length of that line segment

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.900
is greater than 0.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.830
I think that's a fair
assumption in either case.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.230
AB is going to be
greater than 0.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.210
So when we assume that these
two things are not parallel,

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.560
we form ourselves a
nice little triangle

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.470
here, where AB is
one of the sides,

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.610
and the other two
sides are-- I guess

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.280
we could label this point of
intersection C. The other two

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.180
sides are line segment
BC and line segment AC.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.450
And we know a lot about finding
the angles of triangles.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.150
So let's just see what
happens when we just

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.070
apply what we already know.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.820
Well first of all, if
this angle up here is x,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.090
we know that it is supplementary
to this angle right over here.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.510
So this angle over here is going
to have measure 180 minus x.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.700
And then we know that
this angle, this angle

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.320
and this last angle--
let's call it angle

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.560
z-- we know that the sum
of those interior angles

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.190
of a triangle are going to
be equal to 180 degrees.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:22.970
So we know that x plus 180
minus x plus 180 minus x plus z

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.990
is going to be equal
to 180 degrees.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.790
Now these x's cancel out.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.620
We can subtract 180
degrees from both sides.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.380
And we are left with
z is equal to 0.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.300
So if we assume
that x is equal to y

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.660
but that l is not parallel to
m, we get this weird situation

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.860
where we formed this
triangle, and the angle

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.340
at the intersection
of those two lines

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.340
that are definitely not
parallel all of a sudden

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.210
becomes 0 degrees.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.860
But that's completely
nonsensical.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.110
If this was 0
degrees, that means

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.620
that this triangle
wouldn't open up

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.200
at all, which means
that the length of AB

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.060
would have to be 0.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.560
Essentially, you
could call it maybe

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.780
like a degenerate triangle.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.071
It wouldn't even be a triangle.

00:04:08.071 --> 00:04:08.890
It would be a line.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.770
These two lines would
have to be the same line.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.640
They wouldn't even
form a triangle.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.670
And so this leads us
to a contradiction.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.040
The contradiction is
that this line segment

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.070
AB would have to be equal to 0.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.050
It kind of wouldn't be there.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.810
Or another contradiction
that you could come up with

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.000
would be that these
two lines would

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.380
have to be the same
line because there's

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.436
no kind of opening between them.

00:04:35.436 --> 00:04:37.310
So either way, this
leads to a contradiction.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.260
And since it leads to
that contradiction,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.540
since if you assume x equals
y and l is not equal to m,

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.340
you get to something that
makes absolutely no sense.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.350
You contradict your
initial assumptions.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.120
Then it essentially proves
that if x is equal to y,

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.917
then l is parallel to m.

00:04:56.917 --> 00:04:58.750
Because we've shown
that if x is equal to y,

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.260
there's no way for l and m
to be two different lines

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.760
and for them not to be parallel.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.930
And so we have
proven our statement.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.370
So now we go in both ways.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.370
If lines are parallel,
corresponding angles are equal.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.240
If corresponding
angles are equal,

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.079
then the lines are parallel.
