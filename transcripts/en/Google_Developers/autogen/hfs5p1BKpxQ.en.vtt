scripting is you compile from native to

that you're after and some of the

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.060
issues still with in scripting the first
one is if you're really developing a

one is if you're really developing a
 

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:52.620
one is if you're really developing a
native application and it

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:52.630
native application and it
 

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.150
native application and it
memory management issues for instance

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:54.160
memory management issues for instance
 

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.250

said most of the performance perhaps we

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:09.730
said most of the performance perhaps we
 

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:13.680
said most of the performance perhaps we
get to 2x within two acts of native

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:13.690
get to 2x within two acts of native
 

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.350
get to 2x within two acts of native
performance you would still like to get

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:16.360
performance you would still like to get
 

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.840
performance you would still like to get
to the remainder of that performance so

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:20.850
 
 

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.160
 
that brings us to why are we trying to

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:23.170
that brings us to why are we trying to
 

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:24.900
that brings us to why are we trying to
bring native code to the web why are we

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:24.910
bring native code to the web why are we
 

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:25.860
bring native code to the web why are we
talking about bringing native code to

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:25.870
talking about bringing native code to
 

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.360
talking about bringing native code to
the web we still as i said we still

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:27.370
the web we still as i said we still
 

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:29.280
the web we still as i said we still
think there's there's better performance

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:29.290

well there's that embed tag and it says

portable it's not something I can run
 

00:19:06.809 --> 00:19:08.149
portable it's not something I can run
natively on the platform so it's going

natively on the platform so it's going
 

00:19:08.159 --> 00:19:10.519
natively on the platform so it's going
to say I need a translation of that to

to say I need a translation of that to
 

00:19:10.529 --> 00:19:12.980
to say I need a translation of that to
run on my platform so it'll ask for a

Native Client sandbox is also running
inside the chrome sandbox so we have

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:37.140
inside the chrome sandbox so we have
 

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.650
inside the chrome sandbox so we have

the inception challenged that's that's
 

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:45.260
the inception challenged that's that's
anyway so we have sandboxes inside of

the cones of silence right so now we
have two processes that can't talk to

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:56.070
have two processes that can't talk to

bit about why we need native code in the

you can get and we've told you a little

you can get and we've told you a little

you can get and we've told you a little

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:24.930
bit about how we do it how this works
 

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:27.530
bit about how we do it how this works
under the hood so where are we going

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:27.540
under the hood so where are we going
 

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:30.980
under the hood so where are we going
with this next we're trying to bring

with this next we're trying to bring
 

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:32.780
with this next we're trying to bring

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:32.790
these native capabilities to the web
 

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:34.850
these native capabilities to the web
because it enables a really rich
