00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.840
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: My name
is Brian Fitzpatrick.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.540
Most people know me as Fitz.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.840
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And my name
is Ben Collins-Sussman.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.990
Most people call me Ben
Collins-Sussman.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.200
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And we're
here to talk about working

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.950
with human beings.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.810
A couple little notes,
first of all.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.690
We're using the experimental
service called SpeakerMeter so

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.430
that you can talk all about
this show on the

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:22.930
SpeakerMeter site.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.590
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: As we
speak, you can rate us up and

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.000
down, which could be
very exciting.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.490
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Exactly.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.430
So good or for bad, we would
love to hear feedback.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.010
But thanks to everyone for
coming to this live taping of

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.800
the Ben and Fitz show.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.640
As all of you hopefully know,
we talk a lot about things

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.590
related to working with people
in computer science, in

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.280
software engineering.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.570
Human beings, otherwise known
as a giant pile of

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.370
intermittent bugs.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.830
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.480
Good way to put it.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.640
Really, probably one of the
hardest things that we don't

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.000
acknowledge about writing
software is having to work

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.730
with other people.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.940
Right?

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.840
We study and study how to use
our languages and our

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.980
compilers, and then you get
to sitting down to writing

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.599
software with other people, and
you discover that they are

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.740
in the way as much as the
programming language, or

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.480
perhaps more.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.710
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.880
Well, the social stuff is
really hard, right?

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.740
It's more squishy, it's a
lot less deterministic.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.830
I mean, your compiler is
incredibly consistent.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.480
It's going to do the same thing,
no matter what kind of

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.560
garbage you throw at it.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.820
Go ahead.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.310
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
If you want to be

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.400
a successful engineer--

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.620
this is what we tell our
friends, we tell our family.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.690
If you want to ship software
and be really good at

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.390
engineering, you need to also
focus on the social, and not

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.800
just the technical.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.250
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: But it's also
key to being an efficient

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.970
engineer, so you don't waste a
lot of your energy bickering

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.240
and arguing and yelling, et
cetera, that sort of thing.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.930
So let's get started here.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.030
We're going to talk about--

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.790
there's four main areas that
we're going to focus on in the

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.410
show today.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.680
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
By the way.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.150
We're not actual doctors.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.410
We should put that out.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.390
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We're
not actual doctors or

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.060
chemists of any sort.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.810
These are just remarkably
comfortable, and we think

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.270
everyone's going to be wearing
white in the future.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.910
So to start off, we have four
different areas we're going to

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:58.310
talk about.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.370
One is just general personal
behaviors, right?

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.170
You sort of have to get
an idea of, how

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.300
do you like to work?

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.400
What are you good at working
with other people, and where

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.820
are you bad, and that
sort of thing?

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:07.890
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And then
we're going to talk about

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.306
social dynamics of being
honest-- oops,

00:02:11.306 --> 00:02:14.230
did we lose a mic?

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.140
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
Check, check.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.950
Did you turn your mic off?

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:16.830
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: I
turned my mic off.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:17.580
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
OK, talk's over.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.610
Thank you for coming.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.190
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: You
just talk while I--

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.690
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
Oh, there you go.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.000
You're back on.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.700
OK.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.170
All right.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.970
Well done.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:24.470
OK.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.190
Number two.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.290
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Number two,
we're going to talk about

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.800
the social dynamics of
being on a team.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.170
This is, how do you interoperate
with your team,

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.800
how do they interoperate
with you.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.160
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And next,
we're going to talk about how

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.280
your team operates with outside
contributors, or folks

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.180
that work with you that are
not in your core team.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.160
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: But may
work closely with you.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.720
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Exactly.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.890
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And then
finally, we're going to talk

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.480
how you interact with other
people who are not on your

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.840
team at all, probably
your users.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.700
Probably the most important
group you need to work with at

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.660
some point.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.000
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So we're glad
to have all of you here

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.160
today on this live,
taped show.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.540
We're going to go to
the phones now

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.860
and take some calls.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.410
We're going to start with some
questions, possibly work with

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.240
the way that you sort of work
with your team, or the way

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.750
you're sort of used to
working, et cetera.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.010
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.400
So questions about personal
behavior.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.640
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
We have a caller.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.330
We got Harlan from Kentucky.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.140
Go ahead, Harlan.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.598
CALLER: Hi, I'm Harlan
from Greenup.

00:03:12.598 --> 00:03:15.352
I have an open-source project on
Google Code, and I want to

00:03:15.352 --> 00:03:17.944
hide it until it's totally ready
to take over the world.

00:03:17.944 --> 00:03:19.402
How can I do that?

00:03:19.402 --> 00:03:21.346
Oh, I also need to wipe
all the history

00:03:21.346 --> 00:03:22.318
before revealing it.

00:03:22.318 --> 00:03:24.280
Can you tell me how
to do that?

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.820
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So Harlan
wants to hide his source code

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.030
before it's ready.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.740
Until it's ready.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.700
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, Harlan,
why do you want to

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.246
hide all of your history?

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:34.198
CALLER: Well, I don't know.

00:03:34.198 --> 00:03:36.221
I don't want people to see all
the screw-ups I made when I

00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:37.890
was starting out.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.620
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, that's
understandable right?

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.060
You don't want people to see a
lot of the mistakes you make

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.380
in that sort of thing.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.870
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And we all
make mistakes as we work.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.880
The problem is, it's easy
to take it too far.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.620
Right?

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.260
So everyone's a little bit
insecure to some degree.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.590
And part of it is the fact that
we have this concept in

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.110
our head of people doing
miraculous things with

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.840
software development.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.430
That someone like Linus Torvalds
just woke up one day,

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.250
and the Linux kernel sprung
out of his head,

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.145
fully formed, right?

00:04:03.145 --> 00:04:05.000
And I want to be
just like that.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.990
And so maybe if I cover up my
mistakes, everyone will

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.470
realize what a genius I am.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.760
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.970
And there's a lot of heroes that
we have like that, right?

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.260
And in reality, these guys, they
may be really good, and

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.120
they may have done something
incredible, but they're

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.430
mythologized to an extent.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.079
They don't necessarily deserve
every last bit of the credit

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:21.829
that they were given.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:22.760
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: They do
deserve a lot of credit.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.970
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: They
do, absolutely.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.050
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So I would
say, the thing that you

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.760
should credit these folks
for aren't just--

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.170
yeah, sure, they started
a project.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.760
They may not have done the
entire project by themselves,

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.000
but they actually led a team.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.830
They created a team, they
organized a team, and started

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.700
something big, and coordinated
something big.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.280
And so it had a huge impact.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.700
So I think the moral here is
that you should be thinking

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.780
about, how do you work with a
team, not how do I present

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.120
myself as a genius.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.640
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.880
You don't have to hide
all your mistakes.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.550
Mistakes are OK.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.130
Everybody makes mistakes.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.520
Let's move to our next caller.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.188
We have Dan from Albuquerque.

00:04:57.188 --> 00:04:57.676
CALLER: Hi.

00:04:57.676 --> 00:05:00.604
I've been working on this
amazing piece of code for a

00:05:00.604 --> 00:05:03.532
month and a half, and my
co-workers keep bugging me to

00:05:03.532 --> 00:05:05.484
show them what I've
got done so far.

00:05:05.484 --> 00:05:08.412
I totally know they're just
going to slow me down.

00:05:08.412 --> 00:05:12.340
How do I get them to leave
me alone so I can code?

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.703
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: OK.

00:05:12.703 --> 00:05:17.180
So he wants to live in a cave by
himself and write code, and

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.670
just show up with this sort
of finished product.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:19.620
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Well, he
sounds like he's worried about

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.960
being slowed down
by other people.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.120
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.170
But you can be making really
great progress super fast, but

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.950
if you're doing the wrong
thing, this isn't

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:28.710
really worth it, right?

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.300
So if you're working with other
folks, you need to sort

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.230
of have that interaction, that
tight feedback loop.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.130
When you're writing code, you
don't write 10,000 lines of

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.115
code and then hit Compile.

00:05:39.115 --> 00:05:40.240
Does anybody here do that?

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.350
Because I don't do that.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.410
I don't think you do that.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.890
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: You have
a tight feedback loop.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:44.100
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.650
You write some code and
you compile it.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.370
Then you write some code
and you compile it.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.770
Same way with your team.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.790
You write some code and you get
some feedback on not just

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.210
the style of what you wrote, but
the design of your code,

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.680
and that sort of thing.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.980
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
That's all right.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.100
The question is, any project
needs to be in a tight

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.140
feedback loop of, are you
working on the right thing?

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.270
Are you solving the
right problems?

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.850
Did you make the right choice?

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.500
If you go too far without
getting any feedback, you may

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.870
wake up and discover you've
created something that's

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.075
redundant, or you made
a bad design decision

00:06:11.075 --> 00:06:12.430
that you can't undo.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.520
So there's a high risk to
working alone for too long.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.400
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: There's
also, it's a

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.890
low bus factor, right?

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.160
If this person in the cave gets
hit by a bus, or giant

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.980
rock falls and covers the
entrance of the cave, nobody

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.430
can pick up that bit
of code, right?

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.240
But more than anything, I think
there's just a risk of

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.670
wasting time.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.030
It's one thing to sit down and
write a whole bunch of code.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.670
But if it's not the right code,
it doesn't matter how

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:35.600
much you get written.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.510
Right?

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.130
Great.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.100
All right, let's take
a new question.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.464
We have Bill from Peoria.

00:06:41.464 --> 00:06:44.308
CALLER: I was wondering how you
guys feel about the social

00:06:44.308 --> 00:06:47.942
issues implied by the use of
mitichlorians in Star Wars:

00:06:47.942 --> 00:06:50.670
The Phantom Menace.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.570
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: I
think there's only

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.420
three Star Wars movies.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.670
Sorry.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.960
Let's take some calls about
working with your team.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:02.770
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Stay on topic?

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:03.040
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.340
Problems with working your
teammates, concerns about,

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.900
that sort of thing.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.217
So we've got Sarah
from Wilmington.

00:07:10.217 --> 00:07:13.199
CALLER: Hey there,
I love you guys!

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:14.690
We have got a new team leader.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.672
He wants us to write a freaking
mission statement.

00:07:17.672 --> 00:07:19.660
What the hell's with that?

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.280
Can you get me an interview
at Google?

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.145
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well,
Google is hiring!

00:07:25.145 --> 00:07:26.740
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So it
sounds like she doesn't like

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.110
the idea of a mission
statement.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.580
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, when
most people hear mission

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.830
statement, you think of
smarmy, giant, big

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.130
corporations saying stuff like,

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.460
we're focused on focusing.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:37.420
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
We empower people.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.650
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We empower
people to do the

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.150
things that they do.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.850
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Or Kumbaya.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.560
Hold hands, let's
have a mission.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.890
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: A mission
statement is actually, I

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.300
think, really important
for a team.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.390
Because it's a way of
keeping you focused

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:50.160
on what you're doing.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.500
It typically has got a direction
and a limiter.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.980
So you know we're going to go
this way, and we're going to

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.420
do this, but we're not going to
do all these other things.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.810
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: The limiter
is also important,

00:07:58.810 --> 00:07:59.300
like you say.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.030
It's not just about
what you're doing.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:02.930
It's also about what
you're not doing.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:03.885
That's just as important.

00:08:03.885 --> 00:08:07.110
Because it's very easy to sort
of have feature creep.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.060
And it's important-- well,
actually, you have a cool

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.230
story about this, I remember.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:14.990
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We worked a
lot of different projects at

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.560
Google when we were
open sourcing.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.710
And there was one product, about
five years ago, that was

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:19.430
going open source.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.920
And actually wanted to do their
development in the open.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.180
And I talked to them about
the importance

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.090
of a mission statement.

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:27.000
And the team lead was really
enthusiastic, and they got the

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.210
whole team together
to do this.

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:30.750
And a lot of people on the
team weren't really

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:31.700
interested in it.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.320
But one of the things that
became really obvious quickly

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.820
is that two of the tech leads
on the team actually didn't

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.799
agree on what the product
was doing.

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:41.390
And I mean, this isn't like
completely unusual here.

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.580
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: But nobody
realized it, right?

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.000
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: They had
never actually codified what

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.120
they were doing and what they
weren't doing and working on.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.660
So you know, years later,
I talked to this guy.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.660
I'm like, thanks so much for
supporting me when some of

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.610
your team members weren't
excited about this.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.830
He's like, well, I thought it
was a waste of time, but I

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:55.890
figured, what's an
hour, you know?

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:56.940
We'll give it a try.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.520
But like he said, he discovered
really quickly that

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.630
this was something that they
actually needed to do as a

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.910
team to be more efficient,
to get

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.040
everybody on the same page.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.130
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: We
should point out.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.320
You should do more than just get
everybody to agree on what

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.130
the mission is.

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:11.500
You need to document it.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.750
If you simply all agree on what
something is, and it's

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.100
not written down anywhere, it's
not on a web page, you

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.850
will still find other people
coming in and arguing with you

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.520
about it, or trying to question
what's going on.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.120
But if it's on a web page,
it's official, right?

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:25.850
People get amazed.

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:27.420
Oh, it's there on a web page!

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.750
I guess it's real.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.190
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So whether
it's a new person, an open

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:32.560
source project, or someone
coming to join your team,

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.990
they'll show up and they'll
ask a question.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.000
You respond by email, say, well,
this is why we do this.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.740
They will argue with
you for a week.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.140
But if you say, it's right on
this web page, which is maybe

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.890
an easily editable wiki,
for all we know.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:43.520
They're like, oh, it's
on a web page.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.390
Somebody thought about
this, you know?

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:46.460
Maybe we should move on.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:47.840
It's a very serious business.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.380
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: But you
know, put it in the same place

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.890
where you'd put your other
documentations.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:54.020
Your design decisions, your
goals, your failures.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:54.610
Right?

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:57.210
You keep a trail of
documentation so people know

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:58.940
where you've been and
where you're going.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:09:59.250
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.380
So documentation, important
element of communication.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.010
Mission statements,
not all bad.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:04.500
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: We
have another caller.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.140
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We've
got Tom from Seattle.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.598
CALLER: Hi guys, this is Tom.

00:10:07.598 --> 00:10:09.542
I'm thinking about submitting
a proposal for

00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:11.000
Google Summer of Code.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.430
I found two projects that
look pretty interesting.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.103
One is super well-known, but I
poked around on their mailing

00:10:16.103 --> 00:10:18.896
list, and they were basically
all insulting each other and

00:10:18.896 --> 00:10:19.585
being jerks.

00:10:19.585 --> 00:10:22.641
The other project is more
obscure, but their committers

00:10:22.641 --> 00:10:23.635
seemed pretty cool.

00:10:23.635 --> 00:10:26.120
Which one do you think
I should go for?

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.426
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: All right,
so he's asking which

00:10:27.426 --> 00:10:32.310
Summer of Code open source
project he should join.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:33.610
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well,
Summer of Code.

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:36.790
Everybody here knows Google
Summer of Code?

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:40.200
Who has never heard
of Summer of Code?

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.580
So Summer of Code is a way for
students to flip bits and not

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:43.350
burgers in the summer.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.260
They get paid to work
on open source.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.630
That's a huge thing.

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.380
Culture is really important,
though, and you can't really

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.420
expect it to change.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:51.670
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.350
So what you'll find is a lot--
and this is not just true in

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.570
open source, pretty much any
team in a corporation--

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:01.350
you'll find that certain teams
are slightly dysfunctional in

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.280
the way they interoperate with
each other, and some are

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.320
really smooth and everyone
respects each other.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.800
And you don't see a single team
flip-flopping back and

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.390
forth, week to week, between
those behaviors.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:10.850
They tend to perpetuate.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:14.340
And in fact, I guess you could
think of it as a culture, just

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.570
like a yeast culture.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:16.020
It perpetuates.

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:16.540
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
Right, right.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.200
So we're in San Francisco,
home of

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.570
fabulous sourdough bread.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:21.230
Go to any baker that
makes sourdough

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:22.730
bread, and talk to him.

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:23.790
How do you make your
sourdough bread?

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:24.870
The first thing they're
going to put in

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.780
there is the starter.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:30.990
So the starter is yeast and
bacteria that happen to get

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.980
together and do some really
awesome stuff for bread.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.600
So they take this, and then they
put it into the new flour

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.000
and whatnot, they make a loaf
of bread out of it.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.080
That starter culture inoculates
this loaf of bread,

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.600
and you get more of
what you want.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.330
As opposed to, you know, the
bread just getting taken over

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.930
by wild yeast and another junk
that gives bad taste.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:50.380
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And the
culture needs to be strong

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.380
enough to resist other cultures
that may come

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.210
floating by.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:54.160
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
Right, exactly.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.910
So what we're saying is that
software developers are a lot

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:00.220
like bacteria, right?

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:00.420
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: No.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.890
But what you start with
is what you get.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:03.260
Right?

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.890
So if you start a project with
a few people who are all very

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:09.220
respectful, and they trust each
other, and there's some

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.190
humility, that tends
to perpetuate.

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:14.630
They tend to attract more people
of the same behavior

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:15.290
into the project.

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:18.430
And if you start the project
with people being angry and

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.440
screaming and one-upping each
other, that tends to

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.470
perpetuate, as well.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:22.580
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.240
Over the long term, you can
see projects go from more

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.260
quiet to more aggressive.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
But you really see a project
go from aggressive to more

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.570
peaceful and quiet.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:32.980
But so beyond that,
obviously, I think

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.470
interest is really important.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:38.010
But you've got to find a style
that matches your--

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:38.630
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Oh,
we're answering his

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:40.880
question, that's right.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.600
Yes.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.030
Think about the culture that
you want to be part of, not

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.300
just what project.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.810
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So if you're
OK with the big rah-rah

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:49.430
fight and aggressive culture,
then go for that.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.790
Right?

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.130
So OK.

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:51.350
All right.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:52.910
We have another caller here.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.760
Reginald from Schenectady.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.210
CALLER: I just hired a bunch
of really good software

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.660
engineers for my project, but
they're not following

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:01.640
directions the way I'd hoped.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.600
They don't really seem to
care about the product.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.550
How can I get them to
really kick ass?

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:09.220
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, OK,
Reginald, do they understand

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.270
the vision of what you're trying
to do in your product?

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:12.020
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Are they excited?

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.499
CALLER: Well, we've got a
product plan from the sales

00:13:13.499 --> 00:13:15.964
guys, and I told everyone
how important this is.

00:13:15.964 --> 00:13:18.132
It just seems like they're
ignoring my orders, no matter

00:13:18.132 --> 00:13:18.922
how much I yell at them.

00:13:18.922 --> 00:13:21.880
How can I get them
to listen to me?

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.930
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Well, clearly you

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:23.580
need to yell at more.

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.450
No.

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:26.726
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Beatings
will continue until morale

00:13:26.726 --> 00:13:27.960
improves, right?

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.270
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
So the problem is--

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:31.370
I mean, maybe this is
self-evident to a lot of

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:33.850
programmers, but maybe not to
all managers, is that way to

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:35.570
motivate people is not
necessarily to yell at them

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:36.870
and bark orders.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:39.560
That may be good for factory
workers, may not be the

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.960
greatest thing for knowledge
workers.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.660
Programmers want
to have turns.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.830
We talk about driving
the bus, right?

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:48.140
They want to all feel like they
get a turn to drive the

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.970
bus and have a stake
in the project,

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:53.170
decide where it's going.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:54.690
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: If you give
them the opportunity to drive,

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.090
and not just sit in the bus and
do what you tell them to

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:58.480
do, they're going to
do a lot more.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.810
You're going to get a lot
more out of them.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:02.420
They could possibly do some
amazing stuff that you

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:03.100
didn't think of.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:03.370
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:05.960
In which case, your role becomes
not barking orders,

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.110
but instead, just removing
roadblocks so they can drive

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:11.320
the bus whatever way makes
sense most to them.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.160
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.380
We talk about sort of servant
leadership where your job as a

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.160
leader isn't to bark orders and
yell at people what to do,

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.900
but to sort of clear the road.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:20.450
Clear the path for them.

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:21.010
Help them out.

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.670
Get them what they need to
get their work done.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:24.590
So thanks.

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:25.500
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: There's a
lot more to say about that.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.000
Well, let's keep going.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.300
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
So we have a call

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.162
from Larry from Hartford.

00:14:30.162 --> 00:14:32.622
CALLER: That one guy who was
working in a cave before

00:14:32.622 --> 00:14:34.098
didn't want anyone to bug him.

00:14:34.098 --> 00:14:36.189
But you told him it's
important to

00:14:36.189 --> 00:14:37.050
work with the team.

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:40.494
But surely, you can't do
that from the start.

00:14:40.494 --> 00:14:42.954
If he did, he'd never
get off the ground.

00:14:42.954 --> 00:14:45.168
What kind of hippie free
love crap are you

00:14:45.168 --> 00:14:47.650
guys dishing out here?

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:50.230
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So he's
saying, if you start

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.860
collaborating from day one,
you'll never get anywhere.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.280
Which is kind of true.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.190
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: If you
start too early--

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:59.230
I mean, you can look at, what,
Google Code, GitHub,

00:14:59.230 --> 00:14:59.970
SourceForge.

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.810
And there is just tons of
projects where someone comes

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:04.370
out and says, I have
this great idea!

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:05.520
And then nothing happens.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.690
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Here's my
readme file describing how I'm

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:10.030
going to take over the world,
and nobody shows up.

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.360
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Or a bunch of
people show up and want to

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.550
do a whole bunch of
different things.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.960
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.200
And they all argue forever, and
they never do anything.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.810
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So that's
what too early looks like.

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:18.080
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: But if you
go to the other end of the

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.040
extreme, the other end of the
spectrum, which is, if you do

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.750
everything yourself, not only do
you have this risk of doing

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:27.190
the wrong thing, but if you
just sort of reveal to the

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:29.740
world something that's
mostly done, that's

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:30.810
collaborating too late.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:32.690
And nobody wants to get
involved, probably

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:34.060
because it's done.

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:34.350
Right?

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.360
Or there's no chance to
make a mark on it.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.580
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Even if it's
not done, it's so far

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.220
past the mark, I guess, that
people just aren't going to

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.150
come and take your orders.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.195
There's not a lot of chance for
them to have an effect on

00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:45.530
what they do.

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:47.120
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And you
see that sometimes with

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.710
companies that take gigantic
products, open source them,

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:50.990
throw them over a wall.

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:55.150
Nobody comes because it's
finished and too hard to

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:55.890
figure out.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:58.400
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So I think
the real answer for Larry is

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.420
design, prototype,
then collaborate.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:02.680
That's when you bring
other people in.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:05.020
Because you've got something to
sort of show and work with

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:05.680
and chew on.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.330
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: That's
a sweet spot, we call it.

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:11.310
So if there is a prototype, sort
of a proof of concept,

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:13.770
that's enough to show people
that it's not vapor.

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:17.450
And it's still early enough that
people can get involved

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:19.810
and feel like they have a stake,
but it's late enough

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:22.810
that people aren't going to be
arguing about what to do.

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:23.780
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And that
doesn't mean you shouldn't

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.890
talk to anyone about it.

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:29.180
Talking to friends or something,
or getting advice

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.510
from people, hey, what do you
think about this, and getting

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:31.370
feedback is a good thing.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:33.770
But sort of opening the
floodgates for help and

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:36.170
collaboration is what we're
talking about there.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:36.440
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
All right.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:42.080
So our next caller is Chromos
from Azjol-Nerub.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.172
CALLER: My girlfriend and I have
been playing Warcraft for

00:16:44.172 --> 00:16:46.265
seven years, but the last couple
raids, things have

00:16:46.265 --> 00:16:47.294
started to get rocky.

00:16:47.294 --> 00:16:49.230
I found out from her friend
she's been talking about

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.938
joining another guild, and I'm
not sure my 25 men will be

00:16:51.938 --> 00:16:53.102
able to run anymore.

00:16:53.102 --> 00:16:56.010
What can I do to patch
things up?

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:56.880
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Is that
a Warcraft question?

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.850
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: I can tell
you that the Red Dragon

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:01.620
Dynasty doesn't do any
recruiting at all, except in

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:02.875
the realm forums, strictly.

00:17:02.875 --> 00:17:05.105
And if you see someone doing
that, you should contact one

00:17:05.105 --> 00:17:05.730
of the officers.

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:08.180
But not during raid times.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.280
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: OK, thanks.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.650
So let's try and focus a little
more on topic here.

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:15.460
Let's go back to the calls on
our teams here, please.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.470
Now we've got Vern
from Las Cruces.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.410
CALLER: Long time listener
and first time caller.

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:23.918
I have a friend who has
a serious problem.

00:17:23.918 --> 00:17:28.270
He hasn't told anybody
about it yet.

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:29.870
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: What
kind of a friend?

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:31.465
Tell us more about
your friend.

00:17:31.465 --> 00:17:31.795
CALLER: Yeah.

00:17:31.795 --> 00:17:34.187
Well, he seems to be writing
less code lately,

00:17:34.187 --> 00:17:35.920
and advising my--

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:36.910
his--

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:38.395
teammates more and more.

00:17:38.395 --> 00:17:41.365
It's not like he's their
manager, but people keep

00:17:41.365 --> 00:17:43.840
looking to him to fix arguments,
and decide stuff,

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.325
and give advice and things.

00:17:45.325 --> 00:17:49.290
Should I get him to see
a doctor or something?

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:50.840
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Well, we
only look like doctors.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.410
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, your
friend sounds like they're

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:57.600
suffering from what we call
accidental manager, or

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.720
leadershipitis.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.220
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So you
have this situation.

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.990
And anytime you have a group
of people working together,

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:05.090
even if there's nobody assigned
to be the manager or

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:07.850
the leader, somebody will fall
into that role, whether they

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:08.870
like it or not.

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:11.340
They'll start advising
people, resolving--

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.040
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, it
might not be they'll go

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:12.870
kicking and screaming.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.700
But they'll see a need, and
determine that I'm the person

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:16.570
who's going to step into this.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:17.870
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It's not
necessarily a bad thing.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:19.710
I think it's just
human nature.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:20.720
There's a power vacuum.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.950
Somebody falls into it.

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:23.790
And it's scary.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.970
If you call that
a manager, then

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:27.080
programmers get very scared.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.730
Because the word manager
is a dirty word.

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.820
We hear the word manager, we
think of pointy-haired Dilbert

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.910
characters.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:36.660
Manager is a scary thing, which
is why we like to talk

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.260
about leaders instead
of managers.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.060
People can be leaders without
being managers.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.170
People can be leaders without
having a title.

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:43.500
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.280
So the answer to Vern's
question, it's OK.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.700
And it's not a bad thing,
necessarily.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:49.880
All right.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:50.420
So that was good.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.720
Let's talk a little more
about leadership.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.020
Is there anyone out there who's
leading teams that has

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.870
some questions?

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:57.930
Scott from Bismarck.

00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:58.390
Go ahead, Scott.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.690
CALLER: We have a new manager
starting next week.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:02.300
I haven't met the guy yet,
but I want to get off

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:02.990
on the right foot.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.434
Do you guys have any
tips for me?

00:19:05.434 --> 00:19:07.330
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So the
question is, how to get off on

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:08.870
the right foot with
a new manager.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:12.150
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Don't
wait around for orders.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:13.870
Basically, I'd say take
responsibility.

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:16.860
If your team lead says, you
know, I want you to go in and

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.530
look at a particular treatise
having an issue, don't just

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:20.650
deal with that and come back.

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:24.240
Go out in the forest and find
other similar issues, and come

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:24.740
back, and say, look.

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.590
I found this, and this is
what I'm going to do.

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:28.660
I mean, I think the worst thing
to do is come back and

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:29.800
say, what do I do next?

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.730
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: You're
saying, so, act like an adult.

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:33.340
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Oh,
well, that's crazy.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.670
But if you come to your manager,
or your leader, and

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:38.410
you say, you know, this is what
I think I'm doing next.

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:39.630
What do you think about that?

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:41.370
As opposed to, what do
you want me to do.

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:42.190
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So
there's a proactive

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:43.530
communication.

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:44.790
Don't wait for orders.

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:47.090
Proactively pursue some
responsibility.

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:50.230
Go out and figure out what you
think you should be doing.

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:51.590
Don't just be a yes man.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:52.450
Have some opinions.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.480
Express what you really think.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.250
Tell your manager about
your roadblocks.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:57.580
Tell your manager about
your successes.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.310
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
Communicate.

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:03.030
Act like an adult, communicate,
and get your work

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:03.450
done, right?

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:05.860
There's a guy who started to
work with me few years ago,

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.370
and he'd been in the industry
for like 20 years at this

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:11.210
company, And the first day he
comes to me, and it's quarter

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.060
to five, and he's like, look.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:13.790
I've got to leave early.

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:15.600
I had an appointment that
I couldn't change.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.400
I'm really sorry.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.300
But I'll be here late tomorrow,
it's no problem.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.790
And I said, look, man, I don't
care when you come and go.

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:22.620
As long as you put in your
85 hours a week,

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.460
you're fine, right?

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:25.810
And he's like, well, what am
I going to do with all

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:27.930
my spare time now?

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:28.520
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Poor guy.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.200
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: But
seriously, it's like it's, you

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.440
don't need to stamp
a time clock.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.860
You know what your
responsibilities are.

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:35.350
You know what you need to do.

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:37.540
You know how much you need
to do to get it done.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:38.470
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Act
like a grown up.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:39.470
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Exactly.

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:40.440
OK.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.530
We have our next caller.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.140
Lance from Portland.

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:44.108
CALLER: Hi, guys.

00:20:44.108 --> 00:20:47.012
Just like that other caller, I
work under a tight deadline.

00:20:47.012 --> 00:20:49.432
I need people to work
faster and longer.

00:20:49.432 --> 00:20:51.852
I've even threatened to fire
folks if they can't get their

00:20:51.852 --> 00:20:52.820
performance up.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:54.756
What's wrong with
these people?

00:20:54.756 --> 00:20:56.208
Why aren't they scared?

00:20:56.208 --> 00:20:58.650
Why aren't they getting
more done?

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:00.330
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So he's
threatening to fire people

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.460
unless they get their
performance up.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:03.580
Stick.

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:04.865
Shake a giant stick.

00:21:04.865 --> 00:21:06.090
That doesn't work so well.

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:08.030
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Especially
not with engineering people.

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:09.210
Engineering is a
creative thing.

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:13.290
I think that it's not just
a matter of some rote

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:15.670
activities.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:19.230
I think managers really came
into prevalence during the

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:20.780
industrial revolution.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.290
You have your assembly line.

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:25.770
You have your workers who are
stuffing cans with meat.

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:27.820
And you know, you shake the
stick at them, you give them

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.120
the carrot, et cetera.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.460
You want to get things
going more quickly.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.080
There's not a lot of independent
thought there.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.162
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: But if I
shake a carrot or a stick at

00:21:34.162 --> 00:21:36.970
you, you're not going to be
smarter, necessarily.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:37.940
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Or think
more creatively.

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.300
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Think
more creatively now

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.550
or I'll fire you!

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:42.850
You need to nurture
people, right?

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:47.180
I mean, really sort of help them
to get their job done.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.170
CALLER: So what am
I supposed to do?

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:50.150
Coddle them?

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:53.580
Offer them raises and bonuses
to meet their deadline?

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:54.560
Kiss their asses?

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.030
Fluff their pillows?

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:57.010
You guys are useless.

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:59.460
[DIAL TONE]

00:21:59.460 --> 00:21:59.950
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Thank you.

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:03.340
Thank you for calling.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.830
Either way.

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.390
I think you need to give people
a reason to care.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:07.110
I mean, tell your--

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:09.250
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Well, so
there's this great guy named

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:11.910
Dan Pink who talks on the
internet and other places.

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.720
He talks about, all right, well,
here's how to actually

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.430
encourage people to
be productive in

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:17.330
the knowledge industry.

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:17.830
Right?

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:20.740
You should give them autonomy,
mastery, and purpose.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.400
I love these three things.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.640
Autonomy means, treat them
like a grown up.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.175
Let them do their job the way
they want to do it, what makes

00:22:27.175 --> 00:22:28.070
sense for them.

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:30.950
Give them some free rein
in making decisions.

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:32.200
And trust them.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.930
Mastery means give them a chance
to improve themselves

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:38.010
and learn new things so
they stay engaged

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:38.880
and they stay sharp.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.220
You don't want to take your
sharpest knife and grind it in

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:42.140
the sidewalk.

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:45.350
You want to let the knife
sharpen itself.

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:47.930
And finally purpose, meaning
you want to let the people

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:50.960
actually feel like they have a
stake in what they're doing.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.510
Give them a reason to care.

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:54.730
So it's really important
to them.

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:55.860
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: To summarize,
I think there's no

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.950
way that you can actually get
someone more motivated than

00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:58.950
they can motivate themselves.

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:01.240
So give them the tools that
they need to do that.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.790
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Intrinsic
versus extrinsic motivation.

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:03.890
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Right,
absolutely.

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:05.470
That's an excellent question.

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:05.680
OK.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.980
We have Todd from Lisle.

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:08.990
Go ahead, Todd.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.186
CALLER: I've got to say,
that last guy seemed

00:23:11.186 --> 00:23:12.894
like a total jerk!

00:23:12.894 --> 00:23:16.310
There's a guy on my team who
acts like that, too, almost

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:17.790
all the time!

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:20.582
How do you guys usually deal
with people like that?

00:23:20.582 --> 00:23:21.620
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: That's
a good question.

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:24.170
He's asking, how do we deal
with people who are jerks.

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:25.920
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, we see
this with people not only

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.810
in your team, but outside
of your team, as well.

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:28.900
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Which is
a good segue to the next

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:29.440
section, right?

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.550
Talking about working with
people closely who aren't

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:32.850
necessarily on your team.

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:33.140
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.570
Well I mean, you need to protect
your culture, right?

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:39.780
And the most important thing
that your team has is

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:40.900
attention and focus.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.100
And what you're doing, you're
here to write software.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.670
You're not here to get in
a giant yelling contest.

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:46.360
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Although it's hard.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.390
Because people will
push your buttons.

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:50.030
You'll want to have these
emotional reactions.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:52.776
If they're trolling you, or
they're just being mean in

00:23:52.776 --> 00:23:55.440
some way, you want to spend a
lot of energy fighting back,

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.790
or hurting them back, and it's
easy to get carried away.

00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:00.530
And then you suddenly realize
you've wasted your whole day,

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:02.480
you're emotionally drained,
you've not written any

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:02.910
software at all.

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:05.500
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: It's really
hard when someone verbally or

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.200
in an email or whatever
attacks you,

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.800
not to fight back.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.600
You want to give them that
little zinger that puts them

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.190
in their place and all, but
typically, it's not going to

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:12.620
affect them.

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:13.430
They're going to keep going.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:15.660
So there's an old
Usenet adage--

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:18.900
remember Usenet, around
about 700 years ago?

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.650
Don't feed the energy
creature, right?

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:23.470
And really, I think that's
really important.

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:24.850
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: We were on
an open source project for

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:28.010
many years, and a rather famous
person came to the

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:30.940
mailing list and said, oh,
this product sucks.

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:31.990
It's terrible.

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:33.040
What's wrong with you people?

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.040
He was basically there to give
a bug report, but the email

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.300
was full of just incredible
bile and insults.

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:41.760
It was ridiculous, right?

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.780
And I was so proud, because we
didn't actually respond.

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.400
Somebody else in the open source
project responded with

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.890
the most simple, formal
language, like, oh, looks like

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:50.890
you found a bug.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:51.330
Thanks.

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:52.760
Can you try doing
this instead?

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.710
We're going to look into it.

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:56.450
And of course, he responds back
with just more anger and

00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:57.850
bile, and [GROWL].

00:24:57.850 --> 00:24:59.520
And you know, every time
somebody else from our

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.400
community just responds very
calmly, as if there was

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.000
nothing wrong--

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.530
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We found
the bug and we fixed it.

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:05.570
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: But it's
funny, because the guy kept

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:07.380
looking like more and more
of an idiot the more he

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:10.300
responded, and the less we
responded to the bile.

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.090
But we did find the bug.

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:15.240
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: But if we'd
just tried to argue, we could

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.210
have easily gone off into a
giant argument with the

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:18.880
person, right?

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.200
All right.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.470
That's excellent.

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:22.960
We have Mark from Ann
Arbor on the line.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:23.450
CALLER: Hi.

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:25.900
I've heard you guys give
this speech before.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.820
And as far as I can tell, it's
just a recipe for elitism.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:33.413
You talk about building
consensus-based teams, but

00:25:33.413 --> 00:25:35.700
you're just looking for
a bunch of pushovers.

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:38.803
All you guys want to do is
screen out people who disagree

00:25:38.803 --> 00:25:41.240
with your team.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.700
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: He's saying
we're being elitists.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:44.260
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Well.

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:47.510
Maybe he should go away.

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:48.375
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, I
think it's an important

00:25:48.375 --> 00:25:50.080
distinction to make here.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.000
We're not talking about throwing
the people out, or

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.130
getting rid of the people.

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:57.300
We're talking about addressing
the behavior.

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:58.220
There's a huge difference.

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:01.500
I mean, you can actually wind
up alienating really good

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.400
people if you sort
of throw the baby

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.080
out with the bathwater.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.790
We had one guy who was working
with us who was really an

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:10.560
amazing engineer.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.600
But he pissed everybody off.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.490
He just constantly said things
that were insulting.

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:17.650
He'd go along, work, work, work,
boom, say something, and

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:19.570
people would be like,
what the heck?

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:21.820
And so one of us, I
think it was you--

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.720
You pulled him aside on chat
or something and said, you

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.380
know, hey, do you realize that
when you do this, you're

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.050
having this effect on the
rest of the team?

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:30.630
And he was shocked, wasn't he?

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:31.670
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: I did
think he was surprised.

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:34.070
But the point was, we didn't
say, get out of

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.900
here, you're a jerk.

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.430
We said, please behave
in a civil manner.

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:39.500
I don't think you realize that
you're not being civil.

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:39.780
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:42.250
And I don't think he quite
realized it, but he cut back

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:42.750
on the behavior.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:44.030
And things did smooth
out quite a bit.

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:46.440
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right And
so that's what say for people

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.990
who are moderating mailing
lists, any

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:49.130
kind of lists, right?

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:50.865
It's not about who's
in and who's out.

00:26:50.865 --> 00:26:54.440
It's about what kind of behavior
is tolerated by

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.220
anybody, whether they're
on the list or not.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.850
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: But on that
same note, you do also have to

00:26:57.850 --> 00:26:59.830
know when to flip
the Bozo bit.

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:01.620
You get some people who
just don't understand.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.422
We did have one guy who wasn't
actually writing code, but he

00:27:04.422 --> 00:27:06.800
was really enthusiastic, and
really friendly, and he would

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.750
answer other people's questions
all the time,

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:09.680
incorrectly.

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.045
He would also just sort of free
associate on the mailing

00:27:12.045 --> 00:27:13.930
list. Hey, did you ever think
about putting this in?

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:14.640
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It
was like his stream of

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.460
consciousness kept emailing
the list every hour.

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:18.580
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We should put
a list of Star Trek reruns

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:19.300
in the documentation.

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.700
You're like, what?

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.430
And we actually talked to him
a couple of times about it,

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:24.400
and he didn't quite get it.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.990
We finally sort of said, look,
you need to stop doing all

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:27.440
this stuff.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.070
And he really didn't
understand.

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:32.350
But he did agree to actually
stop posting about all this.

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:34.080
That was one of the harder
things, right?

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.090
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Well, I
think what that proves is that

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:38.570
there could be people who are
disrupting your team's

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:41.520
attention and focus who are not
trolls, who are the nicest

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.710
people in the world.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:46.920
One example is just people who
are perfectionists don't

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.640
realize they're being
perfectionists.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.920
And they can actually drain all
the attention and energy

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.680
by never letting anybody start
because the design doc is not

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.040
perfect yet.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.210
So that's an example.

00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:58.950
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: But to turn
all this around into a

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:01.210
different way of looking at it,
it's really healthy and

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:03.060
important to have a good
team ego, as opposed

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:04.150
to individual egos.

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:05.350
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: I know
that's the Apache Software

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:06.160
Foundation's--

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:06.410
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:07.810
Apache is about building
communities.

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:09.540
If anyone has ever looked
through a lot of the Apache

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:12.100
code, you rarely find
someone's name at

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.870
the top of a file.

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:15.650
This is a practice that
is very contentious.

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:18.730
It's almost as contentious
as vi versus Emacs.

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:19.870
How many people here use vi?

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:20.860
Anyone?

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:22.080
How about Emacs?

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.250
All right, fight!

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:24.500
No, I'm kidding.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:29.950
There was this one guy came to
our product who wrote a whole

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:30.760
date parser module.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:31.860
It was a pile of code.

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:32.390
It was actually great.

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:33.570
It was pretty well written.

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:35.270
When we went through and gave
him the code review.

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:37.250
We said look, you know, here's
our style guide.

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:38.110
You did great on
this and this.

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:40.220
But take your name out of
the top of the file.

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.040
We don't have anyone's names
in the source code.

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.470
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It's
just project policy.

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:44.680
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We have other
ways of acknowledging

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:45.320
people helped out.

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.250
And he's like, no, I wrote
this code, I'm

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:48.100
putting my name on it.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.630
And we went back and forth him
him, trying to explain, look,

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:52.320
this isn't about trying
to take away credit.

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.400
But I mean, where does
it stop, right?

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.360
I wrote three lines of code.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:57.400
Do I get my name in there?

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.020
You wrote ten lines of code,
but I rewrote them.

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:01.420
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Or what
if I delete some code?

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:03.670
Does that mean the
name comes out?

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:06.100
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: It's just a
lot of wasted energy, right?

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.830
There's other ways to
recognize people.

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:08.900
You do want to recognize
people.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:09.870
It's very important.

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:11.150
It's a way of increasing
intrinsic

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:12.980
motivation, I would argue.

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:13.980
But we wound up not
taking this guy's

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.320
code, and he went away.

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.710
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Which is sad.

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:18.200
But it's also one of those
cases where it was more

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:21.070
important to preserve the
culture than to accept this

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:23.100
one particular contribution.

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:24.060
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
Yeah, excellent.

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:25.150
All right.

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:29.246
We've got Norman
from Winnetka.

00:29:29.246 --> 00:29:31.230
CALLER: I've been a long time
listener, Click and Clack.

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:34.206
You guys do just an absolutely
amazing job.

00:29:34.206 --> 00:29:35.694
Long time fan.

00:29:35.694 --> 00:29:37.182
Anyway, I've got this
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:29:37.182 --> 00:29:37.678
cream.

00:29:37.678 --> 00:29:39.662
It's an '84.

00:29:39.662 --> 00:29:41.646
Yeah, so anyway, the
transmission makes

00:29:41.646 --> 00:29:43.630
this da, da, da.

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:45.862
I've tried to fill it with
sawdust, but I just don't know

00:29:45.862 --> 00:29:47.112
what to do about it.

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:53.190
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Have you
tried rebooting it?

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:54.876
That fixes a lot of problems.

00:29:54.876 --> 00:29:55.880
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Think
it's a wrong number.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:56.400
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:56.590
All right.

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:59.250
Well, let's go back
to working.

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:01.800
Let's move on to people who work
with your product, right,

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.480
as opposed to people
on your team.

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.160
Users.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.180
Yeah, take a couple
of calls from--

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.884
we have Carl from Kansas City.

00:30:07.884 --> 00:30:09.360
CALLER: I've been listening
forever.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.164
I'm on an open source project,
and it's been

00:30:11.164 --> 00:30:12.312
doing really well.

00:30:12.312 --> 00:30:15.264
And lately, a bunch of industry
analysts have been

00:30:15.264 --> 00:30:18.312
asking us for whitepapers,
and bugging us for

00:30:18.312 --> 00:30:19.776
interviews and things.

00:30:19.776 --> 00:30:24.168
Everything about our software is
up on the website, clearly.

00:30:24.168 --> 00:30:27.096
And the mailing list is archived
and everything.

00:30:27.096 --> 00:30:30.580
These analysts and reporters,
these guys just don't get it.

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:33.247
How do we get them to stop
bugging us and read the same

00:30:33.247 --> 00:30:34.945
docs as everybody else?

00:30:34.945 --> 00:30:37.380
Have you ever had to deal with
these kind of people?

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:38.720
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So the
question is about how to deal

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.050
with industry analysts.

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:42.150
Do they wear white coats?

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:43.330
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: They don't.

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:46.680
But they do expect you to do
a lot of work for them.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:50.050
So I was VP of public
relations for

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:51.230
Apache for a while.

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:53.290
And we would get analysts who
would show up and say hey, you

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:55.860
know, we're doing this
enterprise report on blah blah

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.900
blah software, can you get this,
this, this and this?

00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:59.320
Because they're used to going
to big companies and saying,

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.140
give us all this stuff.

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:01.710
And people go, yeah, right
away, here it is.

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:03.680
Can I get you a cup of
coffee with that?

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.130
Because they want them
to write good things.

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:06.980
And then engineers, thinking
very logically, think, well,

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:08.970
this jackass should go read
the documentation.

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:09.600
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Like everyone else.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.250
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: It's
all answered in the

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:11.230
mailing list somewhere.

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:12.490
Go search for it.

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:12.930
Right?

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:14.580
That doesn't fly so well.

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.300
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Well,
programmers don't like

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.970
anything to do with marketing,
I think.

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:19.760
In general, they distrust
marketers.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.760
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: How many
people here love marketing?

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.080
Other than the marketers?

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.520
No, I'm kidding.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:31.200
But the point is, is that I
think perception is important.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.780
I could say perception is
nine tenths of the law.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:35.550
You could have a great
piece of software.

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:38.120
If people don't know about it,
if you don't shine it up a

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:41.580
little bit, you're not going
to do as well as you could

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:41.970
have.

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:43.390
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: I think
also a lot of folks don't

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:45.200
realize that it's possible
to do marketing

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.030
without being slimy.

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:47.810
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: No!

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:49.470
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It's
possible, I mean, you can

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:51.010
underpromise and overdeliver.

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:52.110
Make that your policy.

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:53.960
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So if you've
got substance, it's OK

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:54.890
to do some shine.

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:58.320
I think where it comes into
problems is that people expect

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.640
that you just get a lot
of shine, right?

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.970
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: All
shine, no promise.

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:04.810
So what's the answer
to the question?

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:07.080
I think the answer is play
the game a little.

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:07.970
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Play
the game a little bit.

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:10.340
I don't think you have to
really, like, fall over to do

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:10.910
everything for them.

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:13.950
But you do need to, I think,
play a little bit along there.

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:14.770
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Don't
discount it completely.

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:16.110
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
Right, right.

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:19.070
So our next caller is Connor
from Galifrey.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:20.305
Go ahead, Connor.

00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:21.295
CALLER: My company
has the email

00:32:21.295 --> 00:32:22.780
addresses of all our customers.

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:25.750
We got those mainly so we could
send out license keys.

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:28.555
We promise not to spam our
users, but now some of our

00:32:28.555 --> 00:32:32.185
marketing guys are begging to
email the customers with--

00:32:32.185 --> 00:32:34.165
they call it the occasional
product update.

00:32:34.165 --> 00:32:35.896
I don't think it's worth pissing
our users off for a

00:32:35.896 --> 00:32:36.640
quick bump in sales.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:37.630
What's your take on this?

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:40.070
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So the
question is, is it worth

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.910
getting a bump in sales to
spam the users, I guess?

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:44.885
Sounds like spamming to me.

00:32:44.885 --> 00:32:45.116
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: No.

00:32:45.116 --> 00:32:45.270
Next question.

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:49.880
No, it's about trust, really.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.050
And it's interesting, because
we're in a different place

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:56.380
than we were 15 years
ago, thank God.

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:59.110
Nowadays, in the software world,
it's really easy to

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:00.310
switch and try other software.

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:02.480
People can use your
software easily.

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.310
They can just as easily
try someone else's.

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:06.630
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So having
a trust reputation, your

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:09.140
company's reputation, how much
people trust you, is really,

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.180
really important.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:11.530
And it's dangerous, right?

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:13.040
We always say trust is
like a bank account.

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.860
You can spend years building
up trust with your users.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.220
But one night in Vegas,
it's all gone.

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.665
You blow it all, you blow
all the trust at once.

00:33:20.665 --> 00:33:22.570
It's very scary.

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:25.410
And doing things like sending
spam, it's a slippery slope.

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:28.200
It's a way to blow your
trust right away.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.770
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well,
I have an example.

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:31.550
My grandfather managed
a Firestone tire

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.080
store for 35 years.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.870
How many people in this
room own a car?

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:36.710
Leave your hands up.

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:38.380
How many people own
a car and have a

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:41.400
mechanic that you trust?

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:41.990
Wow.

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:43.470
That's got to be nine
people with their

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:45.770
hands up in the room.

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:46.350
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Why is that?

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:47.760
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: That's
an example.

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:50.950
I think mechanics are typically
an industry where

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:51.990
people take advantage of you.

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:54.430
You go in with a flat tire, and
they're, oh, you need to,

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:57.130
your flux capacitor is a little
bit too slow, and

00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:00.395
you're going to do a complete
radiator flush, and fluids

00:34:00.395 --> 00:34:00.780
check, and don't forget--

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:01.860
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: They call
it mailboxing, right?

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:03.435
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Exactly,
yeah, sort of selling people

00:34:03.435 --> 00:34:04.080
other things.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.320
My grandfather, for 35 years,
he took over this store.

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.469
And when he took it over, it
lost more money than any other

00:34:09.469 --> 00:34:12.750
store in Louisiana, and within
three years, it was the number

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:15.540
one grossing store
in the state.

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:19.290
And that wasn't just because
they did great stuff.

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:21.590
It was because he didn't
try and rip people off.

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:24.020
95% of his business
was return.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.199
It came back.

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:26.719
It very quickly paid
for itself.

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:28.530
There's no real point
to doing it.

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:30.250
Short term benefits, but
in the long term, it's

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:30.949
going to kill you.

00:34:30.949 --> 00:34:31.550
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
But getting back to

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:33.409
the question, right?

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:36.350
I mean, clearly, this guy's
company, they want to connect

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:37.179
to their users.

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:39.440
There's other ways to do it
besides sending product

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.710
updates unsolicited.

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:43.010
I know it's possible.

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:44.380
You can have a relationship
with the users

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:46.719
that isn't just spam.

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:49.120
For example, you can talk
to them directly.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:49.600
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: No!

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.020
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
I know, it's crazy.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:51.719
You can listen to them.

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:53.040
Give them an outlet
to communicate.

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.420
For example, put up a
public bug tracker.

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:57.090
We've got social media
now, where you

00:34:57.090 --> 00:34:58.150
can communicate updates.

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:00.580
You can read what they're
saying back about you in

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:01.600
social media.

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.390
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: You
see this with a lot

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:03.370
of startups, actually.

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:05.080
A lot of really successful
startups that

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.590
have user-facing products.

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:09.170
They are in the trenches every
day, helping their users,

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:11.600
supporting them, answering their
questions, listening to

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:12.700
their feedback and implementing

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:13.280
features based on that.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.310
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: They
love to be heard.

00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:16.600
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: People
love to be heard.

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.860
I mean, I know that I like to
be heard when I'm using a

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:21.110
piece of software.

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:22.790
To answer the question,
is it OK to spam

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:23.680
customers like that?

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:26.190
I think you're going to get
a bump from it in sales.

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:27.870
It's going to be a short term
thing, and I think it will

00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:31.040
hurt you in the long term.

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:31.680
Let's get another call.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:33.766
We have Bill from
Santa Monica.

00:35:33.766 --> 00:35:35.254
CALLER: My company does
listen to users.

00:35:35.254 --> 00:35:37.734
They're always asking totally
obvious questions in our

00:35:37.734 --> 00:35:40.048
forums. Half the time, they're
unable to explain their

00:35:40.048 --> 00:35:43.690
problem, so it's almost
impossible to help them.

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:45.530
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So he's
saying he's having trouble

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:49.240
understanding users when
they do talk to him.

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:50.490
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: It's
a skill, right?

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:55.000
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: For
example, learning to talk to

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.950
non-techies is a skill.

00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:59.520
I feel like probably everybody
in this room talks to their

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.890
parents at some point, or
relative on the phone.

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:02.690
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Who does tech
support for your parents

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:02.810
on the phone?

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:03.510
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Tech support for

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:04.690
your family, right?

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:06.530
And you're on the phone, and
you're trying to understand

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:09.250
what the heck they're talking
about, because they're using

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:11.420
language you don't understand,
and vice versa.

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:14.420
And so it becomes this skill you
cultivate where you try to

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:17.550
read what they mean,
not what they say.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:20.040
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: You have
to translate intentions.

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.390
The most extreme example
I have of this, my

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:24.930
grandmother, OK?

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:26.640
My grandmother, I love
her to death.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.750
We're sitting down one day
talking, and she asked about

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:32.400
my grandfather, who died years
ago, asked about his computer.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.340
Is that computer still
worth anything?

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:36.850
And it's like a Mac
Classic, you know?

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:38.510
And I said, well,
no, not really.

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:39.510
She said, oh, OK.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:43.330
I only ever turn it on when I
have to sharpen a pencil.

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:45.360
And I'm like, wait.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.410
I know I'm going to regret
hunting this down, but I've

00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:48.270
got to figure this out.

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:52.200
So it turns out that the
computer is plugged into a

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:55.630
power strip, and there's also
a pencil sharpener plugged

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:56.760
into this power strip.

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.940
So every Saturday, she goes in
with her three pencils, turns

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.595
the computer push on, the little
Mac goes beep, and

00:37:02.595 --> 00:37:04.410
starts whirring up slowly.

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:05.920
She sharpens the pencil,
and then boom!

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.490
Kills it.

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:08.670
Once a week, every week.

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:11.150
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: For
a Mac, never efficient.

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:12.280
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: I assure
you, I liberated

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:13.150
the computer quickly.

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:13.860
It's safe.

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:14.750
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: You put
it out of its misery?

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:16.750
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: I put
it out of its misery.

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:19.550
But I mean, talk about,
like, holy cow.

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:20.580
What are they thinking, right?

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:22.860
And so I think it's really
important to make an effort.

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:23.930
And it's a learned skill.

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:25.930
You can actually
cultivate that.

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:28.200
And the people who do it, I
think, full time, should win

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:28.920
some sort of award.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:29.760
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Developer
relations people?

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.580
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Man, that's
some of the hardest work.

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:34.550
Not just developer relations,
like customer relations.

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:37.080
I think developers typically
understand more.

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:39.340
So OK.

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:40.080
That is it.

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:43.140
Thank you all for coming to this
live taping of our show.

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:45.620
We'll switch over to live Q&amp;A
in just a second, but that's

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:46.880
all we have today.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.350
Thank you.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:50.600
We have microphones, if
you have questions.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.220
If you do have a question,
please step up to the

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:59.426
microphone and ask it, so
we can all hear you.

00:37:59.426 --> 00:38:01.680
Or maybe no questions at all.

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.010
Anyone?

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:03.780
We scared everyone away?

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:04.880
Have we answered all your
questions already?

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.280
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Maybe
they don't want

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.020
to be on the air.

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:07.070
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: No?

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:08.860
This part isn't taped, I
don't believe, anyway.

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:10.190
So all right, first question.

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:11.940
You can go right ahead.

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:13.610
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:14.570
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
Whoa, no, wait.

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:15.460
Speak a little bit
more slowly.

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:16.710
Sorry about that.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:19.650
Go ahead.

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:20.380
It's not on?

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:21.820
It should be on.

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:22.290
Check?

00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:25.180
AUDIENCE: I don't think
so There it is.

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:29.590
So I'm starting a project right
now, and my business and

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:32.220
my IT are just talking.

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:33.520
I'm the developer.

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.905
How do I drive that discussion
so we can develop requirements

00:38:35.905 --> 00:38:37.965
and actually get this project
off the ground?

00:38:37.965 --> 00:38:39.380
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So business
and IT aren't

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:40.860
talking, you said?

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:41.980
AUDIENCE: That's right.

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:44.050
Business wants everything.

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:46.530
IT needs to limit that.

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:49.100
How do I get those two teams to
talk so that I don't have

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:52.020
to be in the middle?

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:54.130
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: That's
a really hard problem.

00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:56.350
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: I think we
need to know what they're

00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:59.100
arguing over to be able
to answer that better.

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:00.290
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, I mean,
I've seen this, before

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:01.850
where business, like, you know,
we need everything and

00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:02.810
we need today.

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:03.380
Right?

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:06.390
And tech, you're like, well, we
can only give you so much.

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:09.100
And there's a big disconnect
there.

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:11.580
So I think the hardest thing to
do is getting someone who

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:14.450
has actually the power in the
company to drive that

00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:15.160
conversation.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.020
You can't drive the conversation
if you're just

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:19.930
sort of an observer, or not
somebody who's actually

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:21.710
running one team or the other.

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:22.860
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Which is
a case where you need a

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:26.180
decision maker who can
bridge the gap.

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:29.300
I think some things can't be
entirely fixed through

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:30.470
discussion.

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:32.800
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: But if you
can't find help for that, I

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.500
would say that I don't see you
going anywhere soon, except

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:38.950
for the wrong way.

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:40.580
Thanks.

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:41.690
Next question?

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:42.140
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:45.610
A company I've been working for
lately, they'll put out

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:51.110
about a new final set of
requirements every few days.

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:53.050
And it's just super
frustrating.

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:55.580
So can you give any advice
about how to kind

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.875
of cope with that?

00:39:57.875 --> 00:39:59.000
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: The
question is about how to deal

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.060
with constantly changing
requirements.

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:04.900
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: I like
to deal with that

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.450
by organizing, right?

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:10.700
So as an engineering team, if
you've got a roadmap that goes

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:13.250
out for a year for your product,
which I know, it's

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:14.510
hard to really predict
anything past

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:15.220
three or four months.

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:16.940
But if you've got this roadmap,
and the team comes

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.040
back the next day, and
say, OK, we need you

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:18.960
to do all this stuff.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.190
You could sit down
and say, OK.

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:23.020
Look, we can add this, this, and
this, but all this other

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:24.310
stuff is going to have
to move back.

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:27.930
Because we can't hold
space and time.

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:29.870
So that's a really good
strategy, is to

00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:31.690
out-organize them.

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:33.830
And then when they come back,
you can just sort of very

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:34.960
plainly point out,
that's fine.

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.160
I'm glad to do this.

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.750
And then suddenly, they're
the bad guys.

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:38.420
They have to think of this.

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:39.740
Oh, well, I don't want you
to get rid of that!

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:41.780
Well, look, I've only
got six guys.

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:42.160
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:43.740
So I guess the difference there
is that you're not just

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:46.980
saying yes to everything,
or no.

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:49.680
You are making it extremely
clear what the tradeoffs are

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.700
every time with data.

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:53.910
Nothing scares people
like data.

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:54.910
Fantastic.

00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:56.250
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:56.720
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Should we take a

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:57.700
question from over here?

00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:58.070
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Over
here, please.

00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:00.180
AUDIENCE: I wanted to know what
your thoughts were on

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.470
continuous deployment.

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:03.795
The idea when you check in some
code, you're going to run

00:41:03.795 --> 00:41:06.440
some automated tests, with no
human intervention, just put

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:07.350
it live on your website.

00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:08.900
Who should use it and
who shouldn't?

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.005
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Oh, that
scares the crap out of me.

00:41:11.005 --> 00:41:11.960
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So the
queston is about, when is

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:13.050
continuous deployment
a good thing?

00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:14.780
I think it's fantastic.

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:15.640
We use it at Google.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:16.470
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Depends
on what it is.

00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:17.230
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Well, all right.

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:19.540
So what are the downsides of
using continuous deployment?

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:20.670
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: You could
blow yourself up.

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:22.900
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Well, you
could also spend a lot of time

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:24.090
getting it to work.

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:26.470
That's my personal experience,
is that it's a big time

00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:29.120
investment up front, but it
saves a huge amount of time in

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:29.750
the long term.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:33.720
So I would say it's an
investment of short versus

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:34.555
long term time.

00:41:34.555 --> 00:41:36.190
And are you willing to
make that investment.

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:38.900
I think it's appropriate for
everyone, if they're willing

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:39.670
to make that tradeoff.

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:43.410
They have the luxury of making
that initial investment.

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:46.050
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And another
way of doing that is to have

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:48.200
things go out into test servers
and then move on.

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.170
Or if you're running multiple
servers, you can check it out

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:51.560
on one, et cetera.

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.340
There's a lot of different
ways of doing that.

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:54.990
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Cool.

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:56.140
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
Over here, yes?

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:59.200
AUDIENCE: We have a new
developer on our team.

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.360
We're part of an extremely
large software project.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:04.030
And he kind of jumped in head
first and has been making a

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:07.270
lot of changes without, I think,
really understanding.

00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:09.110
And it's kind of introduced
a lot of bugs.

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:10.570
And I tried to point
this out to him.

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:14.250
And the problem is, he's almost
25 years older than me.

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:15.610
You know, I'm only 23.

00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:17.950
So he has kind of this attitude
of this is how I've

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:19.880
always done things, and who
are you to tell me that I

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:20.930
should or shouldn't do this?

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:24.040
So how can I approach him and
talk to him without it sort of

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.250
becoming a defensive--

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:29.130
because I have more experience
in the project, in the code,

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:30.660
while he may have
more experience

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:31.930
professionally, long term.

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:32.730
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: How many
people on the team?

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:33.010
Is it just you and him?

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:35.960
AUDIENCE: I would say
developers, five to ten.

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:39.203
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: This is a
case of cultural invasion in

00:42:39.203 --> 00:42:40.490
some way, right?

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:43.950
Does your team have a strong
culture of code review, or

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:44.890
this is how we do things?

00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:46.600
AUDIENCE: Not of code
review, but.

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.047
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: But is
it a culture of specific

00:42:48.047 --> 00:42:50.840
development practices that you
all adhere to, all ten of you?

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.080
AUDIENCE: We try to.

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:52.750
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Do
you have any of them

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:54.630
documented, by chance?

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:56.690
AUDIENCE: Unfortunately, it's
an extremely large software

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:58.530
project that's grown over
about ten years.

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:01.610
So there are people, he
understands this part really

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:04.470
well, and I understand
my part really well.

00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:07.380
So when he kind of comes in and
makes changes to my part

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:10.150
that I spent a long time working
on, and it introduces

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:12.590
problems, and when I try to
talk to him about it, he

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:14.540
doesn't really-- you know, I
guess I would say, doesn't

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:18.616
give me the respect of being
someone who's on the same

00:43:18.616 --> 00:43:21.047
level as him, even though I have
a lot longer experience

00:43:21.047 --> 00:43:22.830
in the actual, what
we're working on.

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:23.870
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: I think
anything more than anything,

00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:26.020
it sounds like a cultural
invasion.

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:27.350
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It's not
about disrespecting you.

00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:29.000
It just sounds like he's not
paying attention to the

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.280
culture overall.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:34.206
And so I would argue this is a
case where multiple people

00:43:34.206 --> 00:43:37.360
point this out to him, perhaps
a manager or someone, to say

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:40.080
look, it's not just this
one young guy who's

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.170
trying to get your way.

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:42.560
You're actually disrupting
the whole team.

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:44.480
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And it's
not just the job of the

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:45.780
manager of the team
to do that.

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:47.620
I would say it's the job
of the whole team.

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:50.320
When it's four or five people
who are telling him all this,

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:53.240
and he hears it from everyone,
it's one thing.

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:55.450
But also, again, I'd say
documentation is-- if you had

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:57.470
your culture, I'm not saying the
product, but your culture

00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.880
documented.

00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:58.260
Processes.

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:01.060
We do this, we write a design
doc, and then we get an

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:03.270
approval on that, and then
we move long, et cetera.

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:05.280
That, I would argue, is
pretty important.

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:07.520
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: But get
more people involved so it's

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:09.660
not just about you and him.

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:12.700
It's about him and the whole
team realizing that he's sort

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.100
of going against the
grain of everybody.

00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:17.005
Then it's not about personal
conflicts.

00:44:17.005 --> 00:44:21.340
It's about everybody agreeing
on what the process is.

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:22.470
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Next
question, please.

00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:25.280
AUDIENCE: So I read about this
developer that actually pulled

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:27.840
his app from the Android
market because he kept

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:31.380
noticing only the bad reviews
people gave him.

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:34.840
Even though supposedly the app
was great, and it worked great

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:35.900
on many phones.

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:41.230
But still, really bad reviews
kept creeping up to the top,

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:43.410
and so he just couldn't
take it.

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:44.350
So he took the--

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:45.490
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
Was it a bad app?

00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:48.260
AUDIENCE: No, it was supposedly
a really good app.

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:49.480
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Competitors
trolling?

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:52.940
AUDIENCE: So what are your
thoughts on that?

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:58.560
How can a team that is probably
emotionally tied to a

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:01.830
product they just made, and made
available for free, and

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:04.830
then, you know, you keep getting
these bad reviews?

00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:07.220
I'm asking because it might
happen to me if I put out a

00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:10.010
product for free and keep
getting bad reviews.

00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:10.830
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: I
think there's two

00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:11.660
parts to this answer.

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:12.630
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: You
are not your code?

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:13.100
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, yeah.

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:14.240
You're not your code.

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.800
I mean, you've got
to be ready for--

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.150
Ben and I worked on Subversion
years ago, right?

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:20.400
Sorry about that.

00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:24.920
We've gotten past-- and people
are like, you know--

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:26.850
we actually will joke because we
use Mercure, and I'm like,

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:28.290
oh, yeah, whatever
with Subversion.

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:30.610
Somebody's like, how can you
talk bad about your product?

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:33.970
And we're like, you've
got to learn how

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:35.490
let go and move along.

00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:37.580
So I would say, first of all,
you're not your code.

00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:41.620
But second of all, if they're
legitimate, you've really got

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:43.810
to look to see-- are there
legitimate complaints there?

00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:47.600
If it's just people trolling,
or griefing, or just people

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.670
complaining or whatever,
it's just noise.

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:52.150
I mean, if it really is a great
product, I think you'll

00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:56.170
get more good reviews than
you will bad reviews.

00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:57.990
But if there really are
legitimate bad reviews there,

00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:00.790
you've got to look for
constructive criticism.

00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:04.450
Constructive criticism is,
in my opinion, gold.

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:07.640
And that's why, actually, we
should move along to this.

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:11.580
That's why I'm a huge fan
of getting feedback.

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:14.520
So back to the SpeakerMeter
thing.

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:17.590
Getting constructive criticism
is a way for us to improve and

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:18.060
get better.

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:20.670
We gave us talk a couple of
weeks ago, and we asked

00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:21.800
people, you know, what
can we do better?

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.780
And I think we learned some
things, and I'm hoping that

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:25.210
we'll get some more feedback
today that we'll learn.

00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:25.610
So that's what I would--

00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:27.050
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: I was going
to say, the other wisdom

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:30.710
is, in terms of dealing with
trolls, or people who are just

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:32.410
criticizing for no reason--

00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:34.033
what was that saying,
the internet is

00:46:34.033 --> 00:46:35.410
full of crazy people?

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:37.510
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: The world is
full of crazy people, but

00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:41.430
the internet, it's like they
all live right next door.

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:42.110
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: You
just have to learn

00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:44.240
to ignore the noise.

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.860
That's just how the
internet is.

00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:47.277
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: The first
thing I recommend people who

00:46:47.277 --> 00:46:49.740
are working in open source is,
go buy a rhinoceros skin and

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.370
wear it for a while.

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:54.326
Thicken your skin as
much as you can.

00:46:54.326 --> 00:46:56.816
AUDIENCE: To go along the same
vein as the previous question

00:46:56.816 --> 00:47:01.840
with the younger developer and
the new older guy coming in--

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:04.076
I am the younger
guy coming in.

00:47:04.076 --> 00:47:06.974
And so to me, a lot of
management types are sort of

00:47:06.974 --> 00:47:08.782
gray beard tech guys.

00:47:08.782 --> 00:47:10.300
They grew up on Visual Basic--

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:11.550
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Hey, hey,
be careful there, buddy.

00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:16.570
AUDIENCE: And so to them,
I'm a maverick.

00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:17.672
To me, they're dinosaurs.

00:47:17.672 --> 00:47:21.310
And so there's a little bit of
head-butting with new tech.

00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:23.660
I want to do things,
do it live,

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:25.090
document it, send it out.

00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:27.450
They want to test it for
two weeks, see what

00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:29.000
happens, stuff like that.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.740
What do you guys recommend?

00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:31.850
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Sounds
like a culture conflict.

00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:33.470
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Again, get
another culture conflict.

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:34.630
Well, here is the biggest
question.

00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:36.326
Is there respect going
both ways?

00:47:36.326 --> 00:47:37.000
AUDIENCE: Absolutely,
I'd say definitely.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:37.420
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Absolutely.

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:40.290
Then I think this is a
resolvable issue, right?

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:42.330
If people have humility and
respect, and there's some

00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:44.420
mutual trust, then it sounds
like it's something

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:45.480
you can work out.

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:48.316
But again, it sounds like this
is a case where people need to

00:47:48.316 --> 00:47:51.820
sit down and talk about, well,
waht should our processes be?

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:53.790
And if you want to change the
culture, that's fine, but you

00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:57.420
should be able to have a
discussion about that, and not

00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:59.650
have a series of conflicts
over it.

00:47:59.650 --> 00:48:00.960
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: But
it's hard sometimes.

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:03.040
One of the interesting things
about documenting why you do

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:05.290
things, is if you can go in a
little bit of detail, in some

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:08.365
cases, you can show-- there's
often a lot of reason and

00:48:08.365 --> 00:48:11.160
wisdom behind some choices and
decisions that may seem not

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:13.340
obvious or archaic.

00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:14.650
But if you can dig in
and be like, oh,

00:48:14.650 --> 00:48:15.550
that's why we do that.

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:17.680
Or maybe it's because something
really bad happened

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:20.060
in the past here, we're guarding
it a little more

00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:21.490
carefully an trying
to avoid risk.

00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:21.990
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So
it sounds like you're

00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:24.550
recommending research of the
existing culture before

00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:25.800
deciding to overturn it.

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:26.850
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
Yes, exactly.

00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:28.390
And really try and understand.

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:30.130
I mean, that's one of the
biggest things to do when

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:31.640
you're having a disagreement
with somebody.

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:34.830
If you can really, really,
really strive to understand

00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:37.410
what their point of view is--

00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:39.710
especially if you're married--

00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:42.960
then it makes it a lot easier
to carry that conversation.

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:44.322
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: The more
you listen, the more you are

00:48:44.322 --> 00:48:45.210
listened to.

00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:46.345
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
Yeah, exactly.

00:48:46.345 --> 00:48:47.477
So thank you.

00:48:47.477 --> 00:48:49.660
AUDIENCE: Just to follow
up on that.

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:52.790
Unfortunately, it was a small
company, it's a startup.

00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:55.440
And so a lot of that apocryphal
wisdom about why we

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:57.730
don't reboot the server on
Wednesday morning, for

00:48:57.730 --> 00:48:59.570
example, it's just
not anywhere.

00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:02.352
So it comes to me, actually,
to document that stuff.

00:49:02.352 --> 00:49:05.360
So there's a good sort of
feedback, learning, getting it

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:08.110
all committed to digital
ink, so to speak.

00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:08.570
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, it
sounds like you got an

00:49:08.570 --> 00:49:10.800
opportunity to drive the bus a
bit there, so that's good.

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:11.670
AUDIENCE: Definitely, yes.

00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:12.760
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Excellent,
thank you.

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:13.370
Next question.

00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:15.750
AUDIENCE: You guys spoke about
some specific tools to define

00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:16.450
your culture, like

00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:18.270
documentation, the code itself.

00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:21.250
Are there any other tools that
you use on a regular basis to

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:24.160
kind of define your culture?

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:24.400
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Wikis.

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:27.440
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Wearing
lab coats.

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:31.750
I mean, there's a lot of
different stuff in culture.

00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:35.790
We focus a lot on the social
aspects of it, of interacting.

00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:39.160
I know some teams, it's like,
4:30 on Friday, and everybody

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:40.590
sits around and has
a couple of beers.

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:41.720
Right?

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:42.250
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Nerf guns.

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:43.542
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
Nerf guns, right?

00:49:43.542 --> 00:49:45.090
There's a team in Pittsburgh
at Google.

00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:47.430
They used to be right
next to a train.

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:48.670
It was so loud you couldn't
even think.

00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:50.570
When the train would go buy,
everybody would jump up and

00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:52.430
shoot each other Nerf
guns, right?

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:53.030
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Go back to work.

00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.930
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: That
was kind of cool.

00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:54.790
It was kind of fun.

00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:56.280
There's a lot of different
things you could do.

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:58.110
Like eating lunch together.

00:49:58.110 --> 00:50:00.560
I mean, Google's sort of known
for having free food.

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:03.030
There is an incredible benefit
by getting your team to eat

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:06.290
lunch together and not
necessarily talk about work.

00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:08.520
You suddenly realize that this
guy who I strongly disagree

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:12.700
with for programming issues
is a human, right?

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:13.280
He's married.

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:13.830
He's got kids.

00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:15.000
He's a nice guy.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.030
Wow, you know?

00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:16.560
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
It really helps.

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:18.540
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: It makes it
a lot easier for you to have

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:21.340
these hard discussions, and
accept constructive criticism,

00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:22.410
that sort of thing.

00:50:22.410 --> 00:50:22.800
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:23.960
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Thank you.

00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:24.660
Yes, please.

00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:25.990
AUDIENCE: Attention
on details.

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:28.330
I mean, how do you get people
to really focus

00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:29.395
attention on details?

00:50:29.395 --> 00:50:32.610
It's not just you give them a
visual spec, and they give you

00:50:32.610 --> 00:50:36.390
like very basic of what
you have given them.

00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:39.010
Such as round corners, drop
shadow type of things.

00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:40.010
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: You're
talking about attention to

00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:41.610
details in the software.

00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:44.660
How do we get developers to
pay attention to details.

00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:46.800
Are you having a particular
problem with certain

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:49.380
developers just being
sloppy, or--?

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:50.060
AUDIENCE: Not being sloppy.

00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:53.810
It's just like being
very basic.

00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:56.860
It's like, whatever
you give them--

00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:00.620
you give them a mock-up, and
then the product comes back

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:01.870
exactly as a mock-up.

00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:06.090
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Sounds
like people are simply not

00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:08.940
meeting job expectations
in that case, right?

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:09.990
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: There's a lot
of different things that

00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:11.810
could be wrong with
that, I think.

00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:15.450
It is tricky, but I think
communicating more about

00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:16.130
expectations--

00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:18.120
I mean, flat out.

00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:20.170
there's a lot of cases I know
where people had someone that

00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:22.670
worked with them, or worked for
them, who wasn't meeting

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:23.770
expectations.

00:51:23.770 --> 00:51:25.990
And they don't say anything,
because they don't want to

00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.770
rock the boat.

00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:28.930
And that's exactly when you
should be rocking the boat.

00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:30.930
When you're most afraid
to rock the boat.

00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:31.930
So it's like, boom.

00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:32.700
That's when you start
communicating.

00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:35.570
If you just flat out say, look,
this is what I expect of

00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:37.200
you, and this is what
I'm not getting--

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.683
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And here
are two or three examples of

00:51:38.683 --> 00:51:40.120
where I expected something--

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:40.830
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Two
exampels minimum.

00:51:40.830 --> 00:51:42.130
At least two.

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:43.070
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Give
them hard data.

00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:45.310
Say, I expected X, Y,
and Z, and you gave

00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:46.380
me this other thing.

00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:48.450
And you did it two
or three times.

00:51:48.450 --> 00:51:50.370
So we're going to
have to either--

00:51:50.370 --> 00:51:51.820
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: You can at
least be sure, in that case,

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:52.840
that they know it.

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:56.200
Because quite frankly, they
might not know it.

00:51:56.200 --> 00:52:00.260
So I would say communication
there is pretty important.

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:02.470
We can take two more
questions.

00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:03.470
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:09.165
A while ago, you talked about
the ethical issues of, for

00:52:09.165 --> 00:52:11.100
instance, spamming people
and whatnot.

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:15.230
And what would be the right
thing to do when the general

00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:19.140
culture of the place
seems to be skewed

00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:20.340
towards that direction?

00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:26.792
And you did mention that that
would cause financial damage

00:52:26.792 --> 00:52:28.970
in the long run, but I am
not the bean counter.

00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:32.120
I am just the engineer, and I
doubt that would be persuasive

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:34.510
from my part.

00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:36.520
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: That sounds
like a question of how

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:39.860
does one engineer change an
entire culture of a company.

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:41.570
That's a really hard problem.

00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:44.400
We get this question a lot,
actually, and our answer is

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.720
usually, find a new company.

00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:46.450
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, no.

00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:47.980
Wait, wait, wait.

00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:50.300
Our first answer is, is
that you can make

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:51.990
attempts at this, right?

00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:54.890
Try to change what you can,
and look into it, and make

00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:56.350
attempts to ask people
about it.

00:52:56.350 --> 00:52:57.570
Have you thought about
it this way?

00:52:57.570 --> 00:52:58.320
But yeah.

00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:02.460
If you try and are unsuccessful,
you can just sit

00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:03.520
there and stew about it.

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:04.420
You can learn to deal with it.

00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:06.660
Or you can get the heck out.

00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:08.370
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: I find,
also, reaching out to other

00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:10.980
people in the company who feel
the same way, you can start to

00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:12.520
sort of build a movement
within the company.

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:14.000
I mean, it's politics, right?

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.905
But you can actually form a
movement within your company

00:53:16.905 --> 00:53:20.140
so that there's a single voice
saying, we don't like this.

00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:21.540
We think we should
change this.

00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:23.210
And the louder you become,
the more the dialogue

00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:24.200
is likely to happen.

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.630
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: But do keep
in mind that companies aren't

00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:26.380
democracies.

00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:27.990
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: They're
not democracies.

00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:29.010
But you can still
have political

00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:29.800
movement within them.

00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:31.330
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
That's right.

00:53:31.330 --> 00:53:32.360
Alice's Restaurant.

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:33.860
Go ahead.

00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:36.835
AUDIENCE: I work on a team
where there's another guy

00:53:36.835 --> 00:53:40.016
who's a very capable developer,
but he often holds

00:53:40.016 --> 00:53:43.175
his cards real close to his
vest, doesn't share things

00:53:43.175 --> 00:53:45.270
with the rest of
the team often.

00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:49.620
And furthermore, my boss looks
upon him with great favor.

00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:52.865
Do you guys have any tips or
strategies that you might

00:53:52.865 --> 00:53:56.320
suggest for dealing with
both him and my boss?

00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:58.410
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Well,
what's wrong with him holding

00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:01.100
close to his chest, that he's
not sharing, or he's not--

00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:01.592
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:54:01.592 --> 00:54:04.544
That often times, he
won't engage other

00:54:04.544 --> 00:54:05.490
members of the team.

00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:13.684
Or often times, he'll maybe
get that super-special

00:54:13.684 --> 00:54:16.872
assignment or whatever before
others are considered, that

00:54:16.872 --> 00:54:17.742
sort of thing.

00:54:17.742 --> 00:54:18.740
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Interesting.

00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:20.570
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: That's
another hard problem.

00:54:20.570 --> 00:54:24.360
I mean, again, you can
give him data.

00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:27.730
Like with your boss in
particular, if we got more

00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:29.450
information, we could do more.

00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:31.470
But that tends to be one
of the things that's

00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:33.340
really hard to change.

00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:36.600
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: If you can
quantify the impact of him

00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:40.640
not collaborating with people,
then you'd have an argument to

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:42.870
make, saying, well, we should
get him to open up.

00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:45.110
That gives us an argument to the
manager, right, or other

00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:46.020
members of the team.

00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:47.190
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: But if the
manager and the lead both

00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:50.370
think this is the way we're
going to run things, you don't

00:54:50.370 --> 00:54:53.000
have much of a way
to change that.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.340
It's really hard, because
they're defining the culture

00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:58.450
top down, and you're just
sort of following along.

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:02.830
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Also, if
I were on the team, I would

00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:05.670
also try to figure out the
psychology of this person.

00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:07.190
Are they just insecure?

00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:10.680
Or are they egotistical?

00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:11.780
What's going on, right?

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:13.240
How do you get them open up?

00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:17.280
And there may be the social
route, social engineering, to

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.380
get in there and get them to
open up, figure out what's

00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:20.706
really going on.

00:55:20.706 --> 00:55:21.720
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:21.985
Thank you.

00:55:21.985 --> 00:55:22.610
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: All right.

00:55:22.610 --> 00:55:23.510
Thank you all for coming.

00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:24.360
We appreciate it.

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:27.140
We'll be around for a bit,
talking a little more.
