00:00:13.087 --> 00:00:16.400
There are three words
that explain why I am here.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.960
They are "Amy Krouse Rosenthal."

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.816
At the end of Amy's life,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.360
hyped up on morphine and home in hospice,

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.816
the "New York Times"
published an article she wrote

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.920
for the "Modern Love" column
on March 3, 2017.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.880
It was read worldwide
by over five million people.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.656
The piece was unbearably sad,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.415
ironically funny

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:46.000
and brutally honest.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.856
While it was certainly
about our life together,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.280
the focus of the piece was me.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.576
It was called, "You May
Want to Marry My Husband."

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.640
It was a creative play
on a personal ad for me.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.176
Amy quite literally left
an empty space for me to fill

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.000
with another love story.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.480
Amy was my wife for half my life.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.096
She was my partner in raising
three wonderful, now grown children,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.135
and really, she was my girl, you know?

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.080
We had so much in common.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.896
We loved the same art,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.536
the same documentaries, the same music.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.416
Music was a huge part
of our life together.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.280
And we shared the same values.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.576
We were in love,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.520
and our love grew stronger
up until her last day.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.056
Amy was a prolific author.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.616
In addition to two groundbreaking memoirs,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.040
she published over 30 children's books.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.856
Posthumously, the book she wrote
with our daughter Paris,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.496
called "Dear Girl,"

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.000
reached the number one position
on the "New York Times" bestseller list.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.160
She was a self-described tiny filmmaker.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.776
She was 5'1" and her films
were not that long.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.816
(Laughter)

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.240
Her films exemplified her natural ability
to gather people together.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.656
She was also a terrific public speaker,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.816
talking with children
and adults of all ages

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.040
all over the world.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.816
Now, my story of grief is only unique
in the sense of it being rather public.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.640
However, the grieving process itself
was not my story alone.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.400
Amy gave me permission to move forward,
and I'm so grateful for that.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.056
Now, just a little over a year
into my new life,

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.520
I've learned a few things.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.656
I'm here to share with you
part of the process of moving forward

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.720
through and with grief.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.656
But before I do that,
I think it would be important

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.736
to talk a little bit
about the end of life,

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.560
because it forms how I have been
emotionally since then.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.360
Death is such a taboo subject, right?

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.920
Amy ate her last meal on January 9, 2017.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.976
She somehow lived an additional two months

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.240
without solid food.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.616
Her doctors told us
we could do hospice at home

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.880
or in the hospital.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.936
They did not tell us that Amy
would shrink to half her body weight,

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.696
that she would never lay
with her husband again,

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.960
and that walking upstairs to our bedroom
would soon feel like running a marathon.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.736
Home hospice does have an aura of being
a beautiful environment to die in.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.576
How great that you don't have
the sounds of machines beeping

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.216
and going on and off all the time,

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.136
no disruptions for mandatory
drug administration,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.840
home with your family to die.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.696
We did our best to make those weeks
as meaningful as we could.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.736
We talked often about death.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.296
Everybody knows it's going
to happen to them, like, for sure,

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.640
but being able to talk openly
about it was liberating.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.280
We talked about subjects like parenting.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.840
I asked Amy how I could be the best parent
possible to our children in her absence.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.576
In those conversations,
she gave me confidence

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.136
by stressing what a great relationship
I had with each one of them,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.840
and that I can do it.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.136
I know there will be many times

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.136
where I wish she and I
can make decisions together.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.360
We were always so in sync.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.816
May I be so audacious as to suggest

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.616
that you have these conversations now,

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.255
when healthy.

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:34.280
Please don't wait.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.256
As part of our hospice experience,
we organized groups of visitors.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.400
How brave of Amy to receive them,
even as she began her physical decline.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.016
We had a Krouse night,

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.416
her parents and three siblings.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.776
Friends and family were next.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.560
Each told beautiful stories
of Amy and of us.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.480
Amy made an immense impact
on her loyal friends.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.880
But home hospice is not so beautiful
for the surviving family members.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.496
I want to get a little personal here
and tell you that to this date,

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.720
I have memories of those
final weeks that haunt me.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.840
I remember walking backwards
to the bathroom,

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.040
assisting Amy with each step.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.240
I felt so strong.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.176
I'm not such a big guy,

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.480
but my arms looked and felt so healthy
compared to Amy's frail body.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.960
And that body failed in our house.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.640
On March 13 of last year,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.880
my wife died of ovarian cancer in our bed.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.640
I carried her lifeless body

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.560
down our stairs,

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.720
through our dining room

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.280
and our living room

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.840
to a waiting gurney

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.640
to have her body cremated.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.240
I will never get that image
out of my head.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.336
If you know someone who has been
through the hospice experience,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.616
acknowledge that.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.256
Just say you heard this guy Jason

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.896
talk about how tough it must be
to have those memories

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.736
and that you're there
if they ever want to talk about it.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.776
They may not want to talk,

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.840
but it's nice to connect with someone
living each day with those lasting images.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.760
I know this sounds unbelievable,
but I've never been asked that question.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.800
Amy's essay caused me
to experience grief in a public way.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.680
Many of the readers who reached out to me
wrote beautiful words of reflection.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.896
The scope of Amy's impact
was deeper and richer

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.000
than even us and her family knew.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.216
Some of the responses I received helped me
with the intense grieving process

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.440
because of their humor,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.616
like this email I received
from a woman reader

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.120
who read the article, declaring,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.056
"I will marry you when you are ready --

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.656
(Laughter)

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.760
"provided you permanently stop drinking.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.480
No other conditions.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.000
I promise to outlive you.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.280
Thank you very much."

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.016
Now, I do like a good tequila,
but that really is not my issue.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.176
Yet how could I say no to that proposal?

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.256
(Laughter)

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.200
I laughed through the tears when I read
this note from a family friend:

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.896
"I remember Shabbat dinners at your home

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.120
and Amy teaching me
how to make cornbread croutons.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.560
Only Amy could find
creativity in croutons."

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.580
(Laughter)

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.216
On July 27, just a few months
after Amy's death,

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.856
my dad died of complications

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.320
related to a decades-long battle
with Parkinson's disease.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.960
I had to wonder: How much
can the human condition handle?

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.896
What makes us capable
of dealing with this intense loss

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.600
and yet carry on?

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.096
Was this a test?

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.760
Why my family and my amazing children?

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.640
Looking for answers, I regret to say,
is a lifelong mission,

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.416
but the key to my being able to persevere

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:20.016
is Amy's expressed and very public edict

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.840
that I must go on.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.920
Throughout this year,
I have done just that.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.776
I have attempted to step out
and seek the joy and the beauty

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.200
that I know this life
is capable of providing.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.560
But here's the reality:

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.056
those family gatherings,

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.536
attending weddings
and events honoring Amy,

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.576
as loving as they are,

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.200
have all been very difficult to endure.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.496
People say I'm amazing.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.216
"How do you handle yourself
that way during those times?"

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.760
They say, "You do it with such grace."

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.760
Well, guess what?

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.200
I really am sad a lot of the time.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.216
I often feel like I'm kind of a mess,

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.376
and I know these feelings
apply to other surviving spouses,

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.840
children, parents

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.200
and other family members.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.696
In Japanese Zen, there is a term "Shoji,"

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.320
which translates as "birth death."

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.696
There is no separation
between life and death

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.200
other than a thin line
that connects the two.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.856
Birth, or the joyous,
wonderful, vital parts of life,

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.296
and death, those things
we want to get rid of,

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.280
are said to be faced equally.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.856
In this new life that I find myself in,

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:46.000
I am doing my best to embrace this concept
as I move forward with grieving.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.976
In the early months
following Amy's death, though,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.696
I was sure that the feeling of despair
would be ever-present,

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.480
that it would be all-consuming.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.240
Soon I was fortunate
to receive some promising advice.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.856
Many members of the losing-a-spouse club

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.080
reached out to me.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.336
One friend in particular who had also
lost her life partner kept repeating,

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.560
"Jason, you will find joy."

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.776
I didn't even know
what she was talking about.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.360
How was that possible?

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.456
But because Amy gave me
very public permission

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.560
to also find happiness,

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.400
I now have experienced joy
from time to time.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.280
There it was, dancing the night away
at an LCD Soundsystem concert,

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.336
traveling with my brother and best friend
or with a college buddy on a boys' trip

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.680
to meet a group of great guys
I never met before.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:47.696
From observing that my deck had sun
beating down on it on a cold day,

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.976
stepping out in it, laying there,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.280
the warmth consuming my body.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:59.000
The joy comes from my three
stunning children.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.536
There was my son Justin,

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.176
texting me a picture of himself
with an older gentleman

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:10.136
with a massive, strong forearm
and the caption, "I just met Popeye,"

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.856
with a huge grin on his face.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.336
(Laughter)

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.896
There was his brother Miles,
walking to the train

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.440
for his first day of work
after graduating college,

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.496
who stopped and looked
back at me and asked,

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.760
"What am I forgetting?"

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.880
I assured him right away,
"You are 100 percent ready. You got this."

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.856
And my daughter Paris,

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.896
walking together
through Battersea Park in London,

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.736
the leaves piled high,

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.880
the sun glistening in the early morning
on our way to yoga.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.136
I would add that beauty
is also there to discover,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.576
and I mean beauty of the wabi-sabi variety

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.200
but beauty nonetheless.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.496
On the one hand, when I see something
in this category, I want to say,

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.936
"Amy, did you see that? Did you hear that?

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.800
It's too beautiful
for you not to share with me."

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.520
On the other hand,

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.896
I now experience these moments

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.560
in an entirely new way.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.336
There was the beauty I found in music,

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.896
like the moment in the newest
Manchester Orchestra album,

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.216
when the song "The Alien"

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.760
seamlessly transitions
into "The Sunshine,"

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.376
or the haunting beauty
of Luke Sital-Singh's "Killing Me,"

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.096
whose chorus reads,

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.160
"And it's killing me
that you're not here with me.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.760
I'm living happily,
but I'm feeling guilty."

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:40.096
There is beauty in the simple moments
that life has to offer,

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.496
a way of seeing that world
that was so much a part of Amy's DNA,

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.536
like on my morning commute,

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.776
looking at the sun
reflecting off of Lake Michigan,

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.296
or stopping and truly seeing
how the light shines

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.536
at different times of the day

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.200
in the house we built together;

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.336
even after a Chicago storm,
noticing the fresh buildup of snow

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.096
throughout the neighborhood;

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.456
or peeking into my daughter's room

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.720
as she's practicing the bass guitar.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.280
Listen, I want to make it clear
that I'm a very fortunate person.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.840
I have the most amazing family
that loves and supports me.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.240
I have the resources for personal growth
during my time of grief.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.480
But whether it's a divorce,

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.136
losing a job you worked so hard at

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.256
or having a family member die suddenly

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.880
or of a slow-moving and painful death,

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.856
I would like to offer you

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.080
what I was given:

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.960
a blank of sheet of paper.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.080
What will you do
with your intentional empty space,

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.920
with your fresh start?

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.096
Thank you.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:02.840
(Applause)
