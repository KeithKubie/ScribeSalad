and it's on a ranking system each person
 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.960
and it's on a ranking system each person
whom you approve of gets one vote and

the person with the most approval wins
 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.020
the person with the most approval wins
the election and we've shown that it

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030
the election and we've shown that it
 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.749
the election and we've shown that it
would have major consequences in a race

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759
would have major consequences in a race
 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.380
would have major consequences in a race
like the 2000 presidential election

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390
like the 2000 presidential election
 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.609
like the 2000 presidential election
presumably many native supporters would

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619
presumably many native supporters would
 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.730
presumably many native supporters would
have also voted for Gore to prevent

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740
have also voted for Gore to prevent
 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.760
have also voted for Gore to prevent
their worst choice Bush from winning so

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770
their worst choice Bush from winning so
 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.380
their worst choice Bush from winning so
they would have cast to approval votes

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390
they would have cast to approval votes
 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.569
they would have cast to approval votes
some would have bullet voted we say

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579
some would have bullet voted we say
 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.690
some would have bullet voted we say
voted exclusively for Nader and gore

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700
voted exclusively for Nader and gore
 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.370
voted exclusively for Nader and gore
would have of course his exclusive

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380
would have of course his exclusive
 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.450
would have of course his exclusive
supporters but it's almost it's quite

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460
supporters but it's almost it's quite
 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.650
supporters but it's almost it's quite
clear that a sufficient number of NATO

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660
clear that a sufficient number of NATO
 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.540
clear that a sufficient number of NATO
supporters would have also approved of

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550
supporters would have also approved of
 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.150
supporters would have also approved of
gore such that he almost surely would

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160
gore such that he almost surely would
 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
gore such that he almost surely would
have won the election in Florida and the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170
have won the election in Florida and the
 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.780
have won the election in Florida and the
presidential election so it would have

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790
presidential election so it would have
 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.460
presidential election so it would have
made obviously a difference in that

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470
made obviously a difference in that
 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.990
made obviously a difference in that
election and there are many other

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000
election and there are many other
 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.449
election and there are many other
examples with significant third or

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459
examples with significant third or
 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:22.730
examples with significant third or
fourth

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740
fourth
 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.100
fourth
party candidates in which the outcome

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110
party candidates in which the outcome
 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.830
party candidates in which the outcome
almost surely would have changed we

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840
almost surely would have changed we
 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.770
almost surely would have changed we
can't quite assert that it would change

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780
can't quite assert that it would change
 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.630
can't quite assert that it would change
in the end because when you change the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640
in the end because when you change the
 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.880
in the end because when you change the
rules and we're changing the rules by

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890
rules and we're changing the rules by
 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.070
rules and we're changing the rules by
allowing approval voting the nature of

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080
allowing approval voting the nature of
 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.590
allowing approval voting the nature of
the campaign would change and we can't

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600
the campaign would change and we can't
 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.140
the campaign would change and we can't
simply extrapolate from the present

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150
simply extrapolate from the present
 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.700
simply extrapolate from the present
campaign but I think there's good enough

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710
campaign but I think there's good enough
 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.950
campaign but I think there's good enough
information in the 2000 election to say

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960
information in the 2000 election to say
 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.620
information in the 2000 election to say
that under approval voting Gore almost

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630
that under approval voting Gore almost
 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.930
that under approval voting Gore almost
surely would have won

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940
surely would have won
 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.740
surely would have won
so besides giving the voter more

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750
so besides giving the voter more
 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.950
so besides giving the voter more
flexible options it tends to elect the

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960
flexible options it tends to elect the
 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.990
flexible options it tends to elect the
strongest candidate overall not the

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000
strongest candidate overall not the
 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.810
strongest candidate overall not the
strongest minority candidate and we have

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820
strongest minority candidate and we have
 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.160
strongest minority candidate and we have
examples where as significant candidates

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170
examples where as significant candidates
 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.970
examples where as significant candidates
on the left or the right a beat out a

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980
on the left or the right a beat out a
 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.760
on the left or the right a beat out a
centrist candidate a centrist is hit

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770
centrist candidate a centrist is hit
 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.860
centrist candidate a centrist is hit
from both sides so to speak by the left

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870
from both sides so to speak by the left
 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.870
from both sides so to speak by the left
and right candidates in a three

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880
and right candidates in a three
 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.690
and right candidates in a three
candidate race and comes in third let's

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700
candidate race and comes in third let's
 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.680
candidate race and comes in third let's
say so even if there's a runoff which is

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690
say so even if there's a runoff which is
 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.410
say so even if there's a runoff which is
sometimes proposed as a solution and

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420
sometimes proposed as a solution and
 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.960
sometimes proposed as a solution and
used as a solution to try to find the

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970
used as a solution to try to find the
 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.030
used as a solution to try to find the
strongest candidate the runoff would pit

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040
strongest candidate the runoff would pit
 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.820
strongest candidate the runoff would pit
the left candidate against the right

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830
the left candidate against the right
 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.610
the left candidate against the right
when it's pretty clear the centrist

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620
when it's pretty clear the centrist
 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.880
when it's pretty clear the centrist
candidate in a pairwise contest against

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890
candidate in a pairwise contest against
 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.410
candidate in a pairwise contest against
the left candidate would beat the left

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420
the left candidate would beat the left
 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.450
the left candidate would beat the left
candidate a pairwise contest against the

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460
candidate a pairwise contest against the
 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.710
candidate a pairwise contest against the
right candidate would beat the right

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720
right candidate would beat the right
 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.630
right candidate would beat the right
candidate so it could be to each of his

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640
candidate so it could be to each of his
 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.370
candidate so it could be to each of his
competitors in separate payer wise

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.710
competitors in separate payer wise
contests we actually have a name for

contests we actually have a name for
 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.260

that candidate in these multi candidate
 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.330
that candidate in these multi candidate
races he's the corner say candidate

after the maquis de condor say of late

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250
after the maquis de condor say of late
 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.220

18th century france who proposed this

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230
18th century france who proposed this
 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.160
18th century france who proposed this
kind of candidate and showed that one

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170
kind of candidate and showed that one
 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.730
kind of candidate and showed that one
always doesn't find such a candidate it

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740
always doesn't find such a candidate it
 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.440

good for democracy because the elections

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450
good for democracy because the elections
 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.770
good for democracy because the elections
essentially decided when one party

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.980
nominates an extremist against the
centrist of the other and I think if

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990
centrist of the other and I think if
 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.930

approval voting were used especially in
 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.719
approval voting were used especially in
primaries it would tend to surface the

primaries it would tend to surface the
 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.690
primaries it would tend to surface the
strongest candidate in a party and make

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700
strongest candidate in a party and make
 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.810
strongest candidate in a party and make
the contest much more competitive with

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820
the contest much more competitive with
 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.760
the contest much more competitive with

rather than extremists who usually gets

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229
rather than extremists who usually gets
 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:46.430
rather than extremists who usually gets
beaten in these kinds of contests so I

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440
beaten in these kinds of contests so I
 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.960

think not only does it help the

think not only does it help the
 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.360
think not only does it help the
individual it helps the social choice

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370
individual it helps the social choice
 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.760

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520
 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.860
no I actually think the opposite I think

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870
no I actually think the opposite I think

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520
voting ignoring let's say a first choice
 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.720
voting ignoring let's say a first choice
because he a Nader is out of the running

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:23.730
because he a Nader is out of the running
 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.550
because he a Nader is out of the running
and voting for a second choice or a

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560
and voting for a second choice or a
 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.190

third choice to prevent your worst
 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.230

strategic vote for the candidate who can
 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.910
strategic vote for the candidate who can
can Gore in the 2000 election so I think

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:43.920
can Gore in the 2000 election so I think
 

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.170

it actually minimizes a strategic voting

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180
it actually minimizes a strategic voting

it actually minimizes a strategic voting
the two arguments that have been made

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:50.790
the two arguments that have been made
 

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.020
the two arguments that have been made
against approval voting first that it

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030
against approval voting first that it
 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.550
against approval voting first that it
would tend to elect the lowest common

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560
would tend to elect the lowest common
 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.220
would tend to elect the lowest common
denominator the centrist candidate who

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:58.230
denominator the centrist candidate who
 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.200
denominator the centrist candidate who
tries to be everything to everybody

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.210
 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.660
but I think the candidate is the lowest

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:05.670
but I think the candidate is the lowest
 

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.060
but I think the candidate is the lowest
common denominator is generally going to

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:08.070
common denominator is generally going to
 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.420
common denominator is generally going to
be unappealing to most voters you try to

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:11.430
be unappealing to most voters you try to
 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.920
be unappealing to most voters you try to
be everything to everybody you're not

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:12.930
be everything to everybody you're not
 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.990
be everything to everybody you're not
going to be acceptable to very many

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000
going to be acceptable to very many
 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.230
going to be acceptable to very many
people and a good example of a candidate

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240
people and a good example of a candidate
 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.180
people and a good example of a candidate
who would win under approval voting

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:23.190
who would win under approval voting
 

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:27.230
who would win under approval voting
would be Ronald Reagan Ronald Reagan won

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240
would be Ronald Reagan Ronald Reagan won
 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.530
would be Ronald Reagan Ronald Reagan won
in landslides in 1980 in 1984 he was a

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:30.540
in landslides in 1980 in 1984 he was a
 

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.600
in landslides in 1980 in 1984 he was a
right orient candidate but he was

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:32.610
right orient candidate but he was
 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.880
right orient candidate but he was
appealing to a substantial majority in

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:34.890
appealing to a substantial majority in
 

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.100
appealing to a substantial majority in
each election

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.110
each election
 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.070
each election
nobody ever cues Reagan of being weak or

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080
nobody ever cues Reagan of being weak or
 

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.100
nobody ever cues Reagan of being weak or
pusillanimous he had strong convictions

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:43.110
pusillanimous he had strong convictions
 

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:44.960
pusillanimous he had strong convictions
and he would have won not only under

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:44.970
and he would have won not only under
 

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.850
and he would have won not only under
approval voting but virtually any other

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:46.860
approval voting but virtually any other
 

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.920
approval voting but virtually any other
system so I think that's the kind of

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:48.930
system so I think that's the kind of
 

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.990
system so I think that's the kind of
candidate who was generally appealing

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.000
candidate who was generally appealing
 

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.480
candidate who was generally appealing
maybe right of center or left of Santa

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:53.490

to elect the candidate inoffensive bland

00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:58.380
to elect the candidate inoffensive bland
 

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.860
to elect the candidate inoffensive bland
who has nothing to say so I think that's

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:00.870
who has nothing to say so I think that's
 

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.870
who has nothing to say so I think that's
my argument that it wouldn't have that

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:02.880
my argument that it wouldn't have that
 

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.990
my argument that it wouldn't have that
effect the other argument sometimes made

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000
effect the other argument sometimes made
 

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.560
effect the other argument sometimes made
about against approval voting is that it

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:09.570
about against approval voting is that it
 

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:11.380
about against approval voting is that it
would undermine the two-party system

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:11.390
would undermine the two-party system
 

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.580
would undermine the two-party system
well first of all I think there's

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:13.590
well first of all I think there's
 

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.469
well first of all I think there's
nothing sacrosanct about the two-party

00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:15.479
nothing sacrosanct about the two-party
 

00:08:15.479 --> 00:08:18.500
nothing sacrosanct about the two-party

democracies have multi-party systems

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:21.090
democracies have multi-party systems
 

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:23.180
democracies have multi-party systems
and in my opinion they're just as
