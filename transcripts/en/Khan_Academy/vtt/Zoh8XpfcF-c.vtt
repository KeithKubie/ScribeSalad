00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.153
- [Voiceover] Hello, grammarians.

00:00:01.153 --> 00:00:03.197
Let's talk about reflexive pronouns

00:00:03.197 --> 00:00:04.497
and just as a word of warning,

00:00:04.497 --> 00:00:06.795
this means I'm going to be
talking about myself a lot.

00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:08.294
What I mean is that, in English,

00:00:08.294 --> 00:00:09.721
we have this distinction between

00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:11.974
the personal pronoun, so for example, me,

00:00:11.974 --> 00:00:15.741
and its reflexive
pronoun, which is myself.

00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:20.472
And we use these pronouns
in very specific cases.

00:00:20.472 --> 00:00:21.633
So I'm gonna show you what all

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:23.874
of those reflexive pronouns look like

00:00:23.874 --> 00:00:26.196
contrasted with their
personal pronoun forms

00:00:26.196 --> 00:00:28.320
and then we're going to
talk about how we use them.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.038
So in the first person we say

00:00:30.038 --> 00:00:32.233
the personal pronoun is me,

00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:35.322
the reflexive pronoun is myself.

00:00:35.322 --> 00:00:37.702
The first person plural
personal pronoun is us

00:00:37.702 --> 00:00:40.685
and the reflexive form
of that is ourselves.

00:00:40.685 --> 00:00:42.171
Then in the second person,

00:00:42.171 --> 00:00:46.212
both plural and singular
personal pronoun is you

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:48.929
and then, in the reflexive
it can be either yourself

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:50.589
when you're addressing one person

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:53.747
or yourselves when the
"you" you are talking to

00:00:53.747 --> 00:00:55.407
consists of more than one person.

00:00:55.407 --> 00:00:58.297
The singular third person
pronouns look like this

00:00:58.297 --> 00:01:01.431
it, her, and him and
their reflective versions

00:01:01.431 --> 00:01:04.497
are as follows... itself,
herself, and himself.

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:07.632
Finally, the personal pronoun them

00:01:07.632 --> 00:01:10.987
becomes the reflexive pronoun, themselves.

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:13.890
Now, all of these are what we
would call object pronouns.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.748
They can all be the object of a verb.

00:01:15.748 --> 00:01:17.152
So they're never the do-ers,

00:01:17.152 --> 00:01:18.673
they're always the do-ees.

00:01:18.673 --> 00:01:20.971
With the exception of you or it,

00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:23.433
none of these pronouns can be

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:25.836
the subject of a sentence.

00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:27.055
In Standard American English,

00:01:27.055 --> 00:01:29.112
it is not grammatical to say

00:01:29.112 --> 00:01:30.886
"Me eat a cookie" for example.

00:01:30.886 --> 00:01:33.163
It's part of why Cookie
Monster sounds so funny.

00:01:34.103 --> 00:01:35.473
So then the question becomes,

00:01:35.473 --> 00:01:37.830
when do you use these?

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.478
So the place for these
object pronouns to go

00:01:39.478 --> 00:01:41.149
is in the back end of a sentence.

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.613
what we call the predicate,

00:01:42.613 --> 00:01:45.260
where the object of the verb lives.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.292
So, for example, "She poked me."

00:01:47.292 --> 00:01:49.637
She is the subject of the sentence

00:01:49.637 --> 00:01:53.492
and me is the object, is the
object of the verb poked.

00:01:53.492 --> 00:01:56.255
It is the do-ee, it is
the thing that something

00:01:56.255 --> 00:01:57.892
is done to not the do-er.

00:01:57.892 --> 00:02:00.980
So that's when you'd use
object pronouns, generally.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.255
But, when do you use reflexive pronouns?

00:02:04.455 --> 00:02:06.739
You use reflexive
pronouns when the subject

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:10.755
and the object of a
sentence are the same thing.

00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:12.793
Let me show you an example sentence.

00:02:13.762 --> 00:02:16.171
Janelle made herself breakfast.

00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:19.857
So in this sentence, herself and

00:02:19.857 --> 00:02:22.546
Janelle are the same person

00:02:23.956 --> 00:02:25.697
as opposed to the other
possibility which is

00:02:25.697 --> 00:02:27.824
Janelle making breakfast for someone else.

00:02:27.824 --> 00:02:29.985
Janelle made us breakfast,

00:02:29.985 --> 00:02:32.694
and in this case, this
usage is not reflective.

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:35.935
She's not doing a thing
for herself or to herself.

00:02:35.935 --> 00:02:38.754
She's making breakfast for other people.

00:02:38.754 --> 00:02:41.367
And so, you'd just use the regular

00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:42.933
personal object pronoun there.

00:02:42.933 --> 00:02:45.373
You can only use the reflexive pronoun

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:46.805
when the subject and the object

00:02:46.805 --> 00:02:49.000
of the sentence are the same thing.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.843
Janelle is the same thing as herself.

00:02:51.843 --> 00:02:53.620
Janelle is not the same thing as us,

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.148
so we would say us here and not ourselves.

00:02:57.148 --> 00:02:58.240
How about this one?

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.168
Roderick saw me in the mirror.

00:03:00.168 --> 00:03:02.060
Now I am not named Roderick.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.848
I am not the same thing as Roderick,

00:03:03.848 --> 00:03:06.066
and if I were writing a
sentence about myself,

00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:09.496
I would say, I saw myself in the mirror.

00:03:11.568 --> 00:03:14.924
Roderick and I, me, are
not the same person.

00:03:14.924 --> 00:03:18.128
I and myself are the same person.

00:03:18.128 --> 00:03:20.183
The same person as Roderick is Roderick.

00:03:20.183 --> 00:03:21.287
So if we were to say,

00:03:21.287 --> 00:03:22.843
Roderick saw Roderick in the mirror,

00:03:22.843 --> 00:03:24.085
we would render that as,

00:03:24.085 --> 00:03:27.398
Roderick saw himself

00:03:29.703 --> 00:03:33.001
because the subject
here and the object here

00:03:33.001 --> 00:03:34.443
are the same thing.

00:03:36.353 --> 00:03:37.928
So remember, you use reflexive pronouns

00:03:37.928 --> 00:03:39.610
when the subject and the object

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.427
of a sentence are the same thing.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.069
It's really easy to get
tripped up this way,

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.435
especially if there's a
compound object in the sentence.

00:03:48.435 --> 00:03:52.010
For example, you can
talk to Vidya or myself.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.473
I see this all the time,

00:03:53.473 --> 00:03:55.644
and in Standard American English

00:03:55.644 --> 00:03:57.247
this is not correct because you

00:03:57.247 --> 00:04:00.440
is not the same thing as me.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.960
And it's easy to get confused because

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.328
you're talking about two people here

00:04:04.328 --> 00:04:08.264
in this object and that's
a little befuddling.

00:04:08.264 --> 00:04:09.623
It kind of throws you off.

00:04:09.623 --> 00:04:11.167
And so there's a test you can do.

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:12.501
If you're unsure of whether or not

00:04:12.501 --> 00:04:14.104
it should be Vidya or myself or

00:04:14.104 --> 00:04:16.623
Vidya or me, which is what I would say,

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:19.701
how do you tell?

00:04:19.701 --> 00:04:21.464
Take the other person out of the object,

00:04:21.464 --> 00:04:23.125
just for a little bit.

00:04:23.125 --> 00:04:25.180
So would you say, you can talk to myself

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.804
or would you say, you can talk to me?

00:04:30.014 --> 00:04:31.449
Well, since we know you is not

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.098
the same thing as myself,

00:04:33.098 --> 00:04:35.234
and you can only use reflexive pronouns

00:04:35.234 --> 00:04:38.717
when the subject and the
object are the same thing,

00:04:38.717 --> 00:04:40.736
the answer is me.

00:04:40.736 --> 00:04:42.153
So then, we bring Vidya back,

00:04:42.153 --> 00:04:43.815
we bring the other part
of the object back,

00:04:43.815 --> 00:04:46.554
and it becomes, you can
talk to Vidya or me.

00:04:48.804 --> 00:04:50.838
So when in doubt, sub it out.

00:04:50.838 --> 00:04:52.823
Take the other part of the object

00:04:52.823 --> 00:04:55.144
and just pretend it's not there

00:04:55.144 --> 00:04:57.164
and just think about how the subject

00:04:57.164 --> 00:04:58.757
and the object connect.

00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:00.555
Chances are, you won't actually end up

00:05:00.555 --> 00:05:02.284
using a reflexive pronoun.

00:05:02.284 --> 00:05:05.333
Perform that little check
and you'll never go wrong.

00:05:06.465 --> 00:05:08.492
You can learn anything. David out.
