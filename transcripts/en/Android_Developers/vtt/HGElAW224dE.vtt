00:00:00.101 --> 00:00:02.726
IAN LAKE: So you're building an
app, you hit the Camera button,

00:00:02.726 --> 00:00:03.980
and it just crashed.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:04.980
JOANNA SMITH: Which app?

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:05.736
IAN LAKE: Doesn't
matter what app.

00:00:05.736 --> 00:00:07.230
It's completely hypothetical.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.938
JOANNA SMITH: But
hypothetically, my apps

00:00:08.938 --> 00:00:09.438
don't crash.

00:00:09.438 --> 00:00:10.562
IAN LAKE: You built an app.

00:00:10.562 --> 00:00:12.700
You hit the Camera button,
and it-- and it crashed.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.580
It's trying to be a
better app, but it

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.670
can't, not without your help.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.280
Why aren't you helping, Joanna?

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:18.590
JOANNA SMITH: Wait.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.020
What do you mean
I'm not helping?

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.740
I am a super helpful person.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.240
IAN LAKE: If you
were super helpful,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.870
we would've already talked
about adding runtime checks

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.110
to your Implicit Intents.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.950
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.804
JOANNA SMITH: Fun fact,
Implicit Intents--

00:00:32.804 --> 00:00:34.470
IAN LAKE: --like
opening the camera app.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.303
JOANNA SMITH: Right.

00:00:35.303 --> 00:00:37.220
Implicit Intents may not
work on every device.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.636
IAN LAKE: Well,
it's not that they

00:00:38.636 --> 00:00:39.850
won't work on every device.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.760
It's that on some devices, the
apps you need may not be there.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.007
For your plea of help.

00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:47.840
JOANNA SMITH: Right.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.120
And that would trigger an
ActivityNotFoundException,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.610
which is certainly not
good news for your app.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.080
IAN LAKE: That sounds
super serious, like,

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.450
kill your app serious.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.620
JOANNA SMITH: Right.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.050
It could cause
your app to crash,

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.240
and that would
generally happen when

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.580
the app is missing because
the user has uninstalled

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.060
or disabled the application.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.000
IAN LAKE: What?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.769
Uninstalled?

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.300
Disabled?

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.740
Like, my favorite applications?

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.862
JOANNA SMITH: Mm-hmm.

00:01:07.862 --> 00:01:09.320
Or it could be that
the user's what

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.880
we call a restricted profile
and doesn't have access

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.021
to all of the features.

00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:14.270
IAN LAKE: Restricted profiles?

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.150
Is that serious?

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.634
Like, do we need to get
someone to look at that or?

00:01:17.634 --> 00:01:20.050
JOANNA SMITH: Or it could be
that the device administrator

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.980
has restricted which
apps and features are

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.420
available to the users.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.280
IAN LAKE: So a
device administrator

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.530
could take away my camera app?

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.904
JOANNA SMITH:
Well, I mean, yeah.

00:01:28.904 --> 00:01:31.130
But keep in mind that
devices for work environments

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.600
or devices with
parental controls

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.966
may not need a
camera functionality.

00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:37.090
IAN LAKE: Ah, but we can
still take selfies, right?

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.260
JOANNA SMITH: Um.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.317
IAN LAKE: Oh, it crashed.

00:01:39.317 --> 00:01:40.150
JOANNA SMITH: Right.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.820
So to prevent runtime
exceptions and untimely crashes

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.850
is actually really
easy if you just

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.590
call ResolveActivity before
launching your Implicit Intent.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.820
IAN LAKE: ResolveActivity,
problem solved.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.360
We're done.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.740
JOANNA SMITH: Yeah, it really
is actually as simple as that.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.180
Because just
checking to make sure

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.821
you have something
to use before using

00:01:56.821 --> 00:01:58.820
it will make your whole
application more stable.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.570
IAN LAKE: Wow.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.807
That's great.

00:02:00.807 --> 00:02:02.390
Does that mean we
can take our selfie?

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.540
JOANNA SMITH: Uh.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.337
IAN LAKE: Selfie.

00:02:05.337 --> 00:02:05.836
Wow.

00:02:05.836 --> 00:02:06.240
That's good.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.620
JOANNA SMITH: Right.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.970
So use runtime checks to--

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:08.780
IAN LAKE: --build better apps.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.113
JOANNA SMITH: Build better apps.

00:02:10.113 --> 00:02:12.920
Thanks, Ian.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.470
