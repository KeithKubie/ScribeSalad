00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.119
- I started singing, and you should see

00:00:03.119 --> 00:00:06.005
the people who are running
the audition's faces.

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:10.040
One woman gasped, she held
her mouth, they could,

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.160
their faces, they could not
hide their disappointment

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.757
in how terrible I was.

00:00:14.757 --> 00:00:18.290
(upbeat rock music)

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.720
I am in studio, in L.A.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.590
Tom Thakkar is holding down the fort

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.360
in New York with Ian Fidance.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.193
- How is your butt hole?

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:27.840
But in a caring way.
- (laughs) Yas, queen.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.720
- Yeah, it's doing
great, thank you so much.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.960
- So good to hear.
- It feels good this morning.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.973
- Good.
- Feels good most mornings.

00:00:33.973 --> 00:00:35.880
I can't remember the last time

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.140
my butt hole didn't feel great.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.413
- I'm so jealous.
- But thanks for asking, Ian.

00:00:39.413 --> 00:00:40.439
- Yeah, I'm very jealous.

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:41.627
Good for you, yeah.
- Really?

00:00:41.627 --> 00:00:45.450
You know what, let me introduce our guest

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.899
for this hour of the show.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.430
(laughing)

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.430
I am so excited and proud
to introduce my friend,

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.090
my dance partner, I never
thought I would say those words.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.348
My dance partner, Gleb
Sevchenko, everyone.

00:01:02.348 --> 00:01:03.887
- Woo!
- Yeah!

00:01:03.887 --> 00:01:05.019
- This is Ian and Tom,

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.110
look at them.
- Hey guys, good morning.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.516
- How's it going, pal?
- What's up, Gleb?

00:01:07.516 --> 00:01:08.430
- Great.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.840
- Oh, goddamnit, guys.
- Whoa!

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.945
- [Nikki] We're really doing it,

00:01:11.945 --> 00:01:12.842
I don't know what's

00:01:12.842 --> 00:01:13.675
happening with this story.
- This camera's flying around.

00:01:13.675 --> 00:01:14.508
- We are doing it.
- Is there a drone

00:01:14.508 --> 00:01:16.638
flying around the studio?
- I know, right?

00:01:16.638 --> 00:01:18.030
- We're in it to win it.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.290
- Are we in it to win it--

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.517
- Yes, we are.
- Gleb?

00:01:20.517 --> 00:01:21.834
Okay--
- I can't wait.

00:01:21.834 --> 00:01:23.250
- Yeah, you're--
- Come on!

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.850
- You're hilarious, that's
not what you said when we were

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.642
on the press line yesterday--
- Oh shit, what did you say,

00:01:28.642 --> 00:01:29.897
Gleb?
- At Planet Hollywood

00:01:29.897 --> 00:01:30.761
in New York.
- Oh, Gleb,

00:01:30.761 --> 00:01:31.594
you son of a bitch.
- What'd you say?

00:01:31.594 --> 00:01:32.831
No, you know--

00:01:32.831 --> 00:01:34.338
- This is the gotcha show.
- I was like she's great,

00:01:34.338 --> 00:01:35.171
she's great. (laughs)

00:01:35.171 --> 00:01:36.280
- He just goes, she's--
- She looks like a dancer

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.886
when she don't move.
- Yeah. (laughs)

00:01:38.886 --> 00:01:41.119
- (laughs) She's so cute
when she's sleeping.

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.777
(laughter)

00:01:42.777 --> 00:01:47.400
- Yeah, that's exactly
the vibe that we have.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.270
It's yeah, I do better
when I'm just standing.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.041
I can really hit a pose, I
can really strike a pose.

00:01:54.041 --> 00:01:56.790
There are times when Gleb
will position my body

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.040
in the way that it's supposed to be,

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.597
and he's like, "See, this is it!

00:01:59.597 --> 00:02:00.510
"This is it!"

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.490
And I'll be like I feel like
my organs are shutting down

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.323
from this position.

00:02:05.323 --> 00:02:08.510
Like I will be so twisted and I'm like,

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.180
how am I supposed to find
that, he'll be like that line.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.460
Those lines are great.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.900
I'm like, that's not a line.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.493
I have scoliosis now from
what you're doing to me.

00:02:18.493 --> 00:02:21.709
It has been so much fun with this guy,

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.220
you watch this show,
Dancing with the Stars.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.210
Gleb has been on it,

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.519
what number season is
this for you as a pro?

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.367
- Nine.
- Wow.

00:02:29.367 --> 00:02:32.020
- Nine seasons, yeah.
- You've done nine seasons

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.560
as a pro?
- Don't hurt him.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.790
- But I've done it in different countries.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:36.970
- Different countries, yeah, I mean,

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.010
they told me yesterday
there were 52 countries

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.400
where they do Dancing with the Stars.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.758
- Wow.
- 52!

00:02:42.758 --> 00:02:44.910
- Yeah, that's wild.
- Isn't that insane?

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.075
So Gleb has done many
different versions worldwide

00:02:48.075 --> 00:02:50.300
but he's been on the American version

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.340
for how many seasons now, as a pro?

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.650
- Since season 16.
- Since season 16,

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.470
and now we're in season 27.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.037
So Gleb is--
- Yeah, well,

00:02:58.037 --> 00:02:59.560
I missed a couple of them, so.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.097
- Yeah, he was in and out,
he was traveling, and--

00:03:02.097 --> 00:03:04.130
- Total, it was like eight or nine.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.230
- Wow.
- Yeah, so you've worked with

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.140
eight or nine celebrities at this point,

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.930
stars, and trained them.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.090
I mean, you see it on the show,

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.930
and I never really watched
the show but I would always,

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.940
you hear sound bytes, you hear celebrities

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.550
talk about their experience on the show.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.954
And they always say like

00:03:19.954 --> 00:03:22.410
their partners and them become so close,

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.310
and it's so, you spend
so much time together,

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.720
you go yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.680
I mean, Gleb is now one of my best friends

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.098
because I dance with him everyday.

00:03:33.098 --> 00:03:35.079
It's such an intimate relationship,

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.730
I know that I'll know this
man for the rest of my life,

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.470
which is weird, I told him the other day

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.870
we're gonna be at each other's funerals.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.627
One of us is gonna go
to each other's funeral.

00:03:43.627 --> 00:03:45.550
Isn't that a weird
thing to say to someone?

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.451
But it's true for most of

00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:47.988
the people in your life.
- I'm gonna die with you.

00:03:47.988 --> 00:03:48.821
(laughter)

00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:49.914
- Yeah, or we'll

00:03:49.914 --> 00:03:50.747
die together, Gleb.
- Oh yeah, get people

00:03:50.747 --> 00:03:51.610
plots together.
- Yeah.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.999
- Oh yeah, that's great.

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:54.843
What's a great idea?

00:03:56.521 --> 00:03:57.580
God.
- Gleb, we have a contract

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.483
for you to sign, to agree to.

00:03:59.483 --> 00:04:01.313
(laughter)

00:04:01.313 --> 00:04:05.470
- But Gleb is someone that
I, when I did my research,

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.690
when I knew I was gonna do this show,

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.150
and I was looking at all the dancers,

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.270
I was like, who do I want?

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.060
And he was like my number one pick

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.610
and then I walked into
the room to meet him,

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.580
and I was so excited.
- No, it was awesome,

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.413
yeah, it was awesome.

00:04:17.413 --> 00:04:19.220
The first day when we met, I was like

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.980
oh my God, I'm gonna dance with this girl.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.890
And we did a little twirl, remember?

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.410
Like I turned you under
the arm, and you were like,

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.860
I was like, oh my God, I got so excited

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:29.940
until the first rehearsal.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.594
- Until. (laughs)
- And then it kind of--

00:04:31.594 --> 00:04:33.350
- Oh, Gleb.
- Damn, Gleb!

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.292
- [Nikki] No, that's a real thing, like.

00:04:35.292 --> 00:04:38.500
- No, but then now we're like 10 days in,

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.529
and now I'm actually excited
for this performance.

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:41.600
- I know, Gleb--
- I think we would kill it.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.403
- Gleb took a shift the other day,

00:04:45.887 --> 00:04:47.977
we've been through some big ups and downs.

00:04:47.977 --> 00:04:51.590
It did not start great, but
it was still early enough

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.380
that I wasn't getting totally discouraged.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.730
- So how do you feel now?

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.140
Tell me, like I wanna know.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.350
- Okay, so glad I practiced last night.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.680
'Cause I didn't wanna disappoint you today

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.197
because our last rehearsal,
you were a little bit,

00:05:04.197 --> 00:05:06.830
we just both get frustrated

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.632
that my body doesn't
do what my mind knows.

00:05:09.632 --> 00:05:11.882
(laughter)

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.870
What I've done over, like
I will do a dance move

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.120
that we will perfect, I'll
do it like 50 times, right?

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.650
Like he'll drill me so
that it's muscle memory.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.320
And then we turn on the music
and I completely forget it.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.147
And he had to leave the room the other day

00:05:29.147 --> 00:05:30.790
'cause he was so frustrated

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.190
and I was frustrated with myself.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.700
I just fall to the ground, I go no!

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.820
Because it's like we just did this.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.570
I mean, I have never been
on that side of things

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.114
where I'm teaching someone
something and they have it

00:05:42.114 --> 00:05:44.900
and they get it and
you're so proud of them

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.570
and then they lose it,
as if they never knew it.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.630
But it must be frustrating.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.170
- I mean, it's hard to move to the music.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.233
- It is.
- If you've never

00:05:54.233 --> 00:05:56.426
done it before, it's hard.
- I know.

00:05:56.426 --> 00:05:58.867
- But it's possible.
- Yeah.

00:05:58.867 --> 00:06:00.760
- And you're gonna be great.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.626
- I've already done things
that I didn't think I could do.

00:06:04.626 --> 00:06:08.650
I watched the video we
record ourselves at rehearsal

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.410
and then I watched it
back, and I was watching,

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:12.960
I was watching it in slow mo last night

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.310
and really going over it and
then practicing it a lot.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.723
Here's how I feel, Gleb, to be honest.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.870
I got in a wormhole yesterday,

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.540
Gleb and I were both on the same flight,

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.460
and he was sitting next to Vivica A. Fox,

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.340
I was sitting next to some guy,

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.653
who was like just some
guy, I don't even know.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.920
But and I got into a Dancing
with the Stars wormhole,

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.280
and I watched too many
videos, and I got in my head.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.610
- Oh no!
- And I watched

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.374
Zendaya too much, which you
were in one of her dances,

00:06:45.374 --> 00:06:48.430
the salsa with Zendaya.
- Yeah, that was the salsa.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.442
- If I danced the rest of my life,

00:06:51.442 --> 00:06:55.270
every day, trained like an Olympian,

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.900
I would never even be able to
do one-tenth of that dance.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.942
I mean, she was so perfect.

00:07:00.942 --> 00:07:04.010
I mean, and you were,
that was a fun dance,

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.843
right?
- It was fun, yeah.

00:07:04.843 --> 00:07:06.505
- That was so, it was so good,

00:07:06.505 --> 00:07:08.170
and that's the problem, is like

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.160
I can't be watching these other videos.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.770
I have to just like be
competing against myself,

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.070
I have to compare

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.075
myself to myself.
- Exactly, don't compare

00:07:15.075 --> 00:07:16.770
yourself to anybody, just
compare yourself to yourself.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.220
And try to be better
than you were yesterday.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.673
You know what I mean?
- Yeah, I don't know

00:07:20.673 --> 00:07:21.943
that I am better than I was yesterday.

00:07:21.943 --> 00:07:24.670
Like I think I--
- Well, if you look at the

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.120
first video we shot at the
beginning of rehearsals

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.670
when we just met, and when you look at

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:30.980
the video now from yesterday,

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.540
it's totally different thing.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:33.710
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.100
- You do see improvement?
- You're like, you are

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.410
a dancer, remember your homework?

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.240
You have to look in the
mirror every morning

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.070
and say to yourself, I am a dancer.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.603
- Yeah, Gleb gives me homework.

00:07:42.603 --> 00:07:43.897
- Yes, I do that every morning.

00:07:43.897 --> 00:07:46.890
- Gleb really had a powerful
moment with me the other day

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:51.360
where he's like, and it
was real, you were mad.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.200
And I liked it because the
other day, you snapped into,

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.350
we have a lot of fun, Gleb
is a really fun funny guy.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.730
And we joke a lot, and we
get a lot of work done,

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.852
but we have moments of like,

00:08:01.852 --> 00:08:03.160
when I mess up, we joke about it.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.680
But the other day, you were frustrated

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.410
and I could tell that you came
in with a different attitude

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.650
of like, I'm gonna work this bitch today.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:14.301
Like we were doing
cardio, we were sweating.

00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:18.478
And you had a moment
later on in the rehearsal,

00:08:18.478 --> 00:08:23.110
where you were like
you are a funny person,

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.369
but you are not a, he would like,

00:08:25.369 --> 00:08:27.627
he said the greatest quote, he was like,

00:08:27.627 --> 00:08:30.047
"You do jokes, but you are not a joke.

00:08:30.047 --> 00:08:32.547
"You're not a joke,
Nikki, you're not a joke.

00:08:32.547 --> 00:08:35.300
"You are a Victoria's Secret supermodel,"

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.220
which is secretly what I always wanna be,

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.290
so you really nailed it.

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:42.686
He was like you are like
on the runway, super sexy,

00:08:42.686 --> 00:08:47.686
you have to be sexy, and
I just never have felt,

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:52.510
this is a challenge for
me, is to be sexy and to,

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:56.210
I can act sexy, like I can
act it, but to actually be it

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:59.090
and believe it, is a
totally different thing.

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:03.230
So I'm really trying,
like when I do my makeup,

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:07.160
I put on my music and I just
dance around like a real slut.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.735
Like I just am trying to be,

00:09:08.735 --> 00:09:09.568
(laughter)

00:09:09.568 --> 00:09:10.620
I'm trying to just be a slut,

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.332
I'm trying to ooze
sexuality wherever I go.

00:09:13.332 --> 00:09:17.700
I want everyone wanting
to fuck me wherever I go

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.570
because that's like, I
need to get in that mindset

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.941
for this dance of being really powerful,

00:09:22.941 --> 00:09:27.490
really sexy, and not
goofy because it's so easy

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.710
for me to make a goofy face or make a

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:30.770
goofy movement.
- We could dance to

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.140
one of the Kanye's new song.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.200
- Kanye's, which one?

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.033
Oh yeah, that one.

00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:36.870
- You're such a dirty--
- Oh yeah, it's about

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.481
such a dirty slut.
- I love it, yeah. (laughs)

00:09:38.481 --> 00:09:41.103
- Yes, Gleb--
- Wait, it's a Kanye song?

00:09:41.103 --> 00:09:42.890
- Yeah, there's a,

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.300
what is it, Kanye and who?
- Kanye and,

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.300
what's his name?
- Oh, I don't know

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:47.550
if I've heard this.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:48.760
- Yeah, oh my God--
- Gleb just said it was

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.579
Kanye and Lil something.
- You should listen to it.

00:09:50.579 --> 00:09:51.696
(laughter)

00:09:51.696 --> 00:09:53.726
- Thanks for being specific.

00:09:53.726 --> 00:09:55.840
But yeah,

00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.580
it's so hard, and I still have to

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.520
learn another dance before

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.866
what?
- Lil Pump,

00:10:04.866 --> 00:10:05.699
it's next to Lil Pump.
- Who's Lil Pump?

00:10:05.699 --> 00:10:07.580
- Lil Pump.
- Who's making these

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.290
dances up?

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.268
- Gleb.
- Oh, I don't know this.

00:10:11.268 --> 00:10:12.413
- Gleb?

00:10:12.413 --> 00:10:14.820
- Gleb is, you don't understand

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.185
what these guys do.
- Gleb's making them up?

00:10:16.185 --> 00:10:18.500
- He choreographs the dances,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.915
he has to teach them to me,

00:10:19.915 --> 00:10:23.700
and literally it's really
hard to teach someone

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.450
who's never done a thing

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:26.970
when you're the best at it in the world.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.600
I mean, Gleb has been
dancing since he was seven,

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.430
he is one of the best
dancers in the world.

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:35.430
He is a world champion,
I mean it's just true.

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:36.630
You are, you're like a--

00:10:37.662 --> 00:10:39.371
- Well, I've never won
a world championship

00:10:39.371 --> 00:10:40.470
but yeah, I'm great.
- But you've gone to

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:41.891
world championships.
- I'm really awesome.

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:42.724
- You've gotten really close,

00:10:42.724 --> 00:10:43.557
and you would have won them

00:10:43.557 --> 00:10:45.140
had you been in the
right country to win them

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.800
because there's a lot of politics

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.400
going on in the world of dancing.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.990
Gleb literally is respected
as one of the best

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:52.629
dancers in the world, I know that.

00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:54.910
And on the show, he just,

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.610
he stands out, like even amongst everyone,

00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:58.900
no offense to the other dancers,

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.450
but your eye is drawn to
Gleb when he's dancing,

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:03.690
he just has a style that is very,

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.440
I don't even know anything
about dancing and I'm like

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.670
there's something special
going on with that guy.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:11.020
And but he, it's really times

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.550
that they choreograph it, he
comes up with the concept,

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:18.550
he has a whole creative vision
for it, and the other day,

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:20.946
it was so weird, we were doing the dance,

00:11:20.946 --> 00:11:23.250
and there's a part of
the dance where I step,

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:27.281
I see him and I'm like hey you, what's up?

00:11:27.281 --> 00:11:30.420
And then I kinda walk away
from him 'cause I'm like,

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.680
I'm done with you.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.260
And then I take two steps,
and then I go wait a second,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:37.402
I wanna go back to him.

00:11:37.402 --> 00:11:39.850
And he's telling me, he's like Nikki,

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:42.870
so the dance is, you walk
away and then you turn around

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.650
and you come back and you realize
no, I'm not done with him.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.452
And I'm like do you know my life?

00:11:47.452 --> 00:11:51.330
This dance, he's choreographed
a dance that is my love life,

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.140
of just like going away, coming back,

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.300
going away, coming back.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.289
- Did you just try to put on the

00:11:55.289 --> 00:11:56.500
Russian accent a little bit?

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.475
- Yes, I tried to put on a Russian accent.

00:11:58.475 --> 00:12:03.475
Gleb, yeah, I mean, you
have a Russian accent.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.740
I know you wanna lose it,
but it is very strong.

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.695
And it's good though, I don't
think you should lose it.

00:12:07.695 --> 00:12:08.770
- Yeah, I'm gonna keep it.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.019
I wanna be able to,

00:12:10.019 --> 00:12:10.852
(laughter)

00:12:10.852 --> 00:12:13.602
I wanna be able to keep
it but if I want to,

00:12:13.602 --> 00:12:15.720
just get rid of it so no one
knows that I'm from Russia.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.640
- Can you try to do the
most American accent

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.473
you can do?
- The most American

00:12:19.473 --> 00:12:21.450
accent, like you speak now.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.345
- Whoa.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:12:23.345 --> 00:12:24.919
Yeah, yeah.

00:12:24.919 --> 00:12:27.446
Say something, you say something.

00:12:27.446 --> 00:12:30.330
- Okay, Gleb, I can't dance.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.040
- Gleb, I can't dance.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.199
- [Nikki] That's pretty good.

00:12:33.199 --> 00:12:34.032
(laughter)

00:12:34.032 --> 00:12:34.865
That's pretty good.

00:12:34.865 --> 00:12:37.200
- It sounds like Tommy
from the Disaster Artist.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.490
(laughs)

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.524
- Yeah, it really does, kind of.

00:12:41.524 --> 00:12:46.463
But Gleb, your story
is really fascinating.

00:12:49.283 --> 00:12:51.670
You're a hot guy who a lot
of people can write off

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.443
as like oh, he's just like
a hot dancer, hot dude.

00:12:56.224 --> 00:12:57.700
I could write you off that way,

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.490
and I will continue to
write you off that way,

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:00.950
but I also do know the truth about you,

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:03.630
which is like you, what got into dancing?

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.633
I find your story kind of fascinating.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.346
You grew up in Moscow.
- My grandmother--

00:13:08.346 --> 00:13:09.179
- Right?
- My grandmother,

00:13:09.179 --> 00:13:10.759
so what happened, yeah,
I grew up in Moscow,

00:13:10.759 --> 00:13:13.700
I was seven years old,
I really liked a girl

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.610
in my class, we were in one class.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.837
And she joined dancing
and I asked my grandma to

00:13:18.837 --> 00:13:21.847
go and sign me up, which is I
just wanted to see her more.

00:13:21.847 --> 00:13:23.616
- The girl?
- The girl.

00:13:23.616 --> 00:13:26.463
And that's how I started and then,

00:13:27.665 --> 00:13:29.330
eventually I started dancing with her

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:30.430
and then she quit dancing

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:32.250
because her parents moved and then--

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.020
- But didn't you, you
were in this dance class,

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:37.060
and people who go to dance
classes to scout talent

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.780
stop by and you were just in this,

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:40.690
and they were like that guy has it.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.394
- Yeah, there was like a
local small competition

00:13:43.394 --> 00:13:48.394
where judges from the whole
town came in to judge.

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:53.030
And one judge came up
to my parents and said

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:56.849
this guy got talent, why don't you kind of

00:13:56.849 --> 00:13:59.996
push a little harder
and have private lessons

00:13:59.996 --> 00:14:01.970
and just more training?

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:03.780
That's what my parents did,
and that's how I got into it.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.480
And then I never stopped.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.452
- Yeah, and--

00:14:06.452 --> 00:14:08.075
- Where's the girl now?
- And at what,

00:14:08.075 --> 00:14:10.137
yeah, where is she now?

00:14:10.137 --> 00:14:12.960
- Yeah, no.
- No.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.740
- The girl was dance the entire time.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.292
(laughter)

00:14:17.292 --> 00:14:18.459
She was dance.

00:14:19.827 --> 00:14:22.060
- She was dance. (laughs)

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.176
So, where did you,

00:14:25.176 --> 00:14:27.710
so I like the turn in the story

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:29.870
where you were dancing in Russia

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:32.260
and then you got to a
place where you were great.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.314
I mean, how old, you were 14?

00:14:34.314 --> 00:14:38.210
- Yes, so what happened, I
was dancing, dancing, dancing.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:39.590
We won a lot of competitions,

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:43.910
I had, I don't know, 10,
12 different partners

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:45.480
every single, like every half year,

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.954
I don't know why I was changing partners.

00:14:46.954 --> 00:14:49.384
By the age of 14--
- Sounds like a sex life.

00:14:49.384 --> 00:14:50.517
- I knew I was good.

00:14:50.517 --> 00:14:51.495
(laughter)

00:14:51.495 --> 00:14:52.980
Yeah. (laughs)

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.343
By the age of 14, I knew
it was gonna be my career.

00:14:55.343 --> 00:14:58.810
- Yeah, wow, that's early.

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.340
- Yeah, but it was hard, like in Russia,

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:01.379
it's hard with everything,

00:15:01.379 --> 00:15:04.300
the mentality of the parents is that

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.230
if you do something, you
gotta be great at it.

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:09.190
Otherwise, there's no point
invest money and time into it.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:13.220
And if you don't do it right
now, and you don't deliver it,

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.230
they're not gonna do it anymore.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.640
That's what my parents'
mentality was like this,

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.540
and if we do it, it's not just a hobby,

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.500
it's 100% your career.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.190
And it's in everything, like
people play hockey or dancing

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:26.002
or soccer or anything else.

00:15:26.002 --> 00:15:28.960
So and they push, push, push,

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.980
till the point where they reach like

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.770
we have to pay for private lessons,

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:36.310
we have to afford dance clothes and shoes.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:37.490
Everything was really expensive,

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:39.810
it was brought from overseas

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:41.606
because nothing's been produced in Russia.

00:15:41.606 --> 00:15:44.783
At that time, it was
like, what, 25 years ago.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:50.390
And we were dancing, we
were on a good level,

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:52.120
but there was no way that I wanted to--

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.040
- How much dancing were you doing

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.040
when you would go to school,

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.830
and you would go right
to dancing afterwards?

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:57.663
- Right, exactly.
- Did you do

00:15:57.663 --> 00:15:58.990
three hours everyday after school?

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:00.610
- Like three, four.
- Wow.

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:01.840
- Yeah, three, four hours.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.710
Yeah, with a partner and whenever we can,

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:06.720
we go and travel to maybe
different towns to compete

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.570
and do all those local competitions.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:10.680
And we were at that point, we were like

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.530
top five in Russia, at
the Russian championship,

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:18.770
but at that point, I
understand there's no way,

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:21.210
even if I'll be the greatest dancer,

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:23.740
better than everybody else,
I'll be number one or two

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.600
to be able to go to the world championship

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.160
to represent the country.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.880
- So to represent Russia, you
would have to be one or two.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.470
- Yeah, top two couples
represent the country.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.230
- And to be in that position,

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:35.693
you would need to have a lot of money

00:16:35.693 --> 00:16:37.048
to get--
- Yeah, you have to have

00:16:37.048 --> 00:16:38.380
a lot of money--
- The best clothes, the best

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:39.890
training, the best travel,

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:41.200
everything.
- Exactly, exactly.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.630
- So you saw, you go, I wanna compete on

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:47.560
a world level and for me to do that,

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.620
I'd have to be two of the best,

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.484
which I probably am skill wise, but--

00:16:52.484 --> 00:16:55.310
- So my teacher, yeah, my
teacher came up to me and said,

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:58.050
listen, you gotta just change
the country of representation.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:59.550
You have to go somewhere else,

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:01.702
and just represent that
country to be able to go

00:17:01.702 --> 00:17:04.370
to the world championship
and you can win the world

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:06.280
championship and everybody's
gonna know about you.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.416
But you have to be one of second,

00:17:09.416 --> 00:17:11.167
first or second place.

00:17:11.167 --> 00:17:13.200
So I thought about it, and it was like,

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.040
where's the closest place on the map?

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:21.040
And I just like, Latvia,
Lithuania, Estonia, Finland,

00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:22.920
it's everything like all around Russia.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.570
It was just overnight train ride.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:30.050
So I just got a visa to Lithuania,

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:33.410
and I went to Lithuania 'cause
my teacher's wife lived there

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:36.030
and kind of like knew the whole scene.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:37.240
And I was just--
- Yeah, you really

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.320
go there to find a girl.
- To find a girl, yeah.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.420
- To find a partner.
- To find a partner.

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:43.897
- And you were how old?

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:46.486
- I was 15.
- So you were 15,

00:17:46.486 --> 00:17:49.165
and you took a train to Lithuania

00:17:49.165 --> 00:17:53.171
to go find, to go meet
a potential partner.

00:17:53.171 --> 00:17:54.930
And you get there, and what is that like?

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:55.790
Do you go on a date?

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:57.570
Do you just meet in the dance studio

00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:58.852
and then just start dancing?

00:17:58.852 --> 00:18:00.246
What's the--
- No, I remember I was in,

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:02.948
so I got there, I took a bus.

00:18:02.948 --> 00:18:05.420
I had the address, so I took a bus

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:08.917
to the place where that coach lived.

00:18:08.917 --> 00:18:12.350
And I was just sleeping in one room,

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:14.800
she put me in there for two nights.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.520
And then we just went to the dance studio

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.520
and she had a few girls
that I tried out with.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.450
And then there was a
competition the next day,

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.620
and I saw this girl, she
was really, really good.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.220
I was like I wanna dance with her.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.460
She goes there is no way you'll
be able to dance with her

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.293
'cause she, they're number one in here

00:18:30.293 --> 00:18:31.210
in Lithuania.
- She already has a partner.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:32.344
- She already has a partner.

00:18:32.344 --> 00:18:34.760
And I didn't dance with
her, so it was like I left.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.730
And then I told my dad
like, I need another $300

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:42.670
to go to Latvia 'cause there's
another girl waiting for me.

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:44.497
My dad like, "Are you crazy?

00:18:44.497 --> 00:18:45.427
"What are you doing?

00:18:45.427 --> 00:18:48.037
"You're 15 years old, you
better go and study and do

00:18:48.037 --> 00:18:50.395
"something that is eventually
gonna make you money."

00:18:50.395 --> 00:18:52.000
I was like, "No, I wanna dance."

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.590
So I went to Latvia, and
then I went to Estonia,

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.400
and then I went back to Lithuania.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.140
And I was just, I spent
probably like eight months

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.360
traveling around Europe

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.627
just trying out with all
these different girls.

00:19:02.627 --> 00:19:07.627
And then it was just, I lost all hope.

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.337
I was one day in Moscow, just
sitting there and be like,

00:19:10.337 --> 00:19:14.130
I don't know, I'm just
gonna continue dance here

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:15.370
and find another girl here.

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:19.350
And then I got a phone call
from parents of this girl

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:21.217
that I tried out from
Latvia and they were like,

00:19:21.217 --> 00:19:23.367
"Listen, I think it's gonna work.

00:19:23.367 --> 00:19:25.767
"You just gotta figure
out how you're gonna come

00:19:27.607 --> 00:19:29.070
"and live here, like how
are you gonna support."

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.930
I was like, "Don't worry
about it, I got this,"

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:34.143
which in my head, I was like
uh, I don't really feel like,

00:19:34.143 --> 00:19:34.976
there's no way.

00:19:34.976 --> 00:19:37.120
- Yes, that really gives me a lot of hope

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.820
when you go, we got this.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.340
You tell me we got this all the time,

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:41.797
and now I know what
you're really thinking,

00:19:41.797 --> 00:19:44.030
it's like we'll find a way.

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:46.610
You say we've got this to me so often

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:48.430
and now I know what that really means,

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.428
which is it's 14 year
old Gleb being like uh.

00:19:51.428 --> 00:19:53.988
- So to make a story short,

00:19:53.988 --> 00:19:56.100
I went there, start dancing with her,

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.973
won all the championships,
and then we went to Lithuania,

00:19:58.973 --> 00:20:00.330
that was a funny thing.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:03.000
It was an open Lithuanian
championship, we went there,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.510
and we won, we got first place,

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:06.170
and that girl who didn't
wanna dance with me,

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:07.618
the girl, she got second.

00:20:07.618 --> 00:20:09.666
- Yes, yes!
- Hell yeah, Gleb.

00:20:09.666 --> 00:20:12.094
- Got her ass.
- Now, Gleb--

00:20:12.094 --> 00:20:13.180
- You got Glebbed.
- When you were picking

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.920
a dance partner, does it
always come down to skill,

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:19.620
or when you're a 14 year old pubescent boy

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.010
who's like, is there any
part of you that's like

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:24.700
yeah, she's great, but
then there's this girl

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:27.000
that's a little less
great, but she's super hot?

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:27.950
I wanna dance with her.
- Yeah. (laughs)

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:29.525
- Does that play into it at all?

00:20:29.525 --> 00:20:31.180
'Cause honestly--
- A little bit.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.150
- When you dance with
someone, there's gonna be a,

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.278
you're gonna be, especially at that age,

00:20:36.278 --> 00:20:38.700
hormones are raging, you're gonna end up

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.620
hooking up with that person probably,

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.240
at that age, if you're both
single, young adolescent kids.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.500
- Well, the thing is, when
I danced with that girl,

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.950
we didn't hook up.
- Oh, wow.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:48.327
- She wasn't really hot,

00:20:48.327 --> 00:20:49.765
but she was a great dancer.

00:20:49.765 --> 00:20:50.710
- She was a great dancer, yeah.

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:51.800
- She wasn't hot.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.740
- You weren't attracted
to her, right, yeah.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.930
And then you won all--
- I could, but I just didn't.

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:58.020
- Yeah, yeah, you could.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:59.575
Oh, listen, Gleb,

00:20:59.575 --> 00:21:00.447
(laughter)

00:21:00.447 --> 00:21:01.432
we know you can.

00:21:01.432 --> 00:21:02.850
(laughter)

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:04.160
It was totally on the table,

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.640
so she was into you, but
you were not feeling it.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.560
Yeah, yeah, where is she now?

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.150
- She's in Latvia, we're
still kind of attached.

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:11.682
- Still deeply in love with you.

00:21:11.682 --> 00:21:12.868
- Okay, that's nice.

00:21:12.868 --> 00:21:17.868
So then, I wanna get to
when you came to America,

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:20.280
like how did you first get here?

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.510
And why were you coming here?

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.870
Oh, I wanna talk about where you got this,

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:26.538
so you were like down and out,

00:21:26.538 --> 00:21:29.190
you were out of money and then

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:33.031
an opportunity came into your
lap, which was your face.

00:21:33.031 --> 00:21:35.410
- Yeah, well, it was like,

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:36.250
thanks a lot, yeah,

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:39.570
so I danced with a girl and
then we danced for two years.

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:41.963
I fell in love, I fell in
love with another girl,

00:21:41.963 --> 00:21:43.610
I broke up with her--
- You were about to go to

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:45.820
world championships with one partner,

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.249
and then you fell in
love with another dancer,

00:21:48.249 --> 00:21:49.732
who was not as skilled.

00:21:49.732 --> 00:21:51.900
You switched partners right before

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.560
the world championship, right?
- Yes.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.750
- And you did not win.
- No.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:58.277
- Because your partner sucked.
- Yeah.

00:21:58.277 --> 00:21:59.777
- But she was super hot--
- She was super hot.

00:21:59.777 --> 00:22:01.520
- And you guys were banging, yeah.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.713
Okay, so then you lost
the world championships.

00:22:04.713 --> 00:22:06.130
- I lost everything.
- All this practice,

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:06.963
you lost everything.
- I pretty much lost

00:22:06.963 --> 00:22:08.600
everything, yeah, I came back to Moscow

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.177
and I said to my dad, I was like,

00:22:10.177 --> 00:22:11.247
"What am I supposed to do?"

00:22:11.247 --> 00:22:13.337
He was like, "Well, you really screwed up,

00:22:13.337 --> 00:22:15.052
"like you go and figure it out yourself."

00:22:15.052 --> 00:22:18.810
So I had no money, I had pretty
much like no place to live.

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:20.457
- How old were you at this point?

00:22:20.457 --> 00:22:23.427
- I was 19, 18, yeah, 19.

00:22:23.427 --> 00:22:26.850
Yeah, and I started working
at the fitness center,

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:28.115
doing some salsa classes.

00:22:28.115 --> 00:22:30.624
And this girl, again, another girl

00:22:30.624 --> 00:22:32.707
came up to me and she goes,

00:22:32.707 --> 00:22:34.380
"Listen, have you ever tried modeling?"

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.836
I was like, "Modeling, I
mean, sure, let's try it."

00:22:37.836 --> 00:22:39.958
So she took me to this model agency

00:22:39.958 --> 00:22:42.057
and it took off.

00:22:42.057 --> 00:22:45.640
I became like one of the top models,

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.558
I'd done a whole bunch
of different commercials.

00:22:47.558 --> 00:22:49.110
- In Russia, you were like--

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:50.660
- In Russia, I was like--

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.040
- The guy.
- Yeah.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.738
Like Gigi Hadid here,

00:22:53.738 --> 00:22:54.860
you know what I mean?
- Yes, in Russia.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.319
- Like in Russia, yeah.
- And then--

00:22:56.319 --> 00:23:00.830
- And then it was like it's too small,

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.275
I better go and explore,

00:23:02.275 --> 00:23:04.470
like I gotta go to America.
- Yeah, big in Russia,

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:06.480
but I wanna be big elsewhere.
- Exactly.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.580
- And you had bigger dreams,
and you wanted to dance still.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.540
I mean, did you think about modeling,

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.460
were you like oh, that's
just gonna be my career now?

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.894
Was there any part of you that said

00:23:13.894 --> 00:23:16.130
I'll leave dancing behind?

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:17.470
- No, dancing was always,

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:18.910
'cause it was like, I've
danced for so many years,

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:22.050
and dancing was always my
life, so I could easily

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:23.440
go and teach and make some money

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.360
that I can pursue some other career,

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.507
you know what I mean?

00:23:26.507 --> 00:23:27.340
That's what I wanted to do.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.173
- So modeling

00:23:28.173 --> 00:23:29.006
was your side gig.
- And that's what I did

00:23:29.006 --> 00:23:29.839
in America, yes.

00:23:29.839 --> 00:23:30.909
- So we're gonna get to
Gleb coming to America

00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:34.790
after the next break because he's famous

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:36.350
in Russia at this point as a model.

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:38.530
His face is everywhere,
he's in every print thing,

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:40.570
he's on commercials, you're
making lots of money.

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:42.450
And then you decide to go to America.

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:44.120
And things take a turn,

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.372
and we'll get to that when we get back.

00:23:46.372 --> 00:23:50.780
I'm in studio in Los Angeles
with my dance partner

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:52.810
on Dancing with the Stars, season 27,

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:55.757
which premieres September 24th, live.

00:23:55.757 --> 00:23:58.057
We're gonna be dancing live!

00:23:58.057 --> 00:23:59.849
- We're gonna be dancing live salsa.

00:23:59.849 --> 00:24:02.129
- What happens if I fall, Gleb?

00:24:02.129 --> 00:24:03.824
- Just own it,

00:24:03.824 --> 00:24:05.070
own that fall.
- The music keeps going and

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:06.600
then I stand up and I take-
- And that's it--

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.099
- It from wherever we were.
- It will be great TV.

00:24:08.099 --> 00:24:09.432
- Yeah, I know.

00:24:09.432 --> 00:24:11.316
I'm kind of hoping for a fall.

00:24:11.316 --> 00:24:12.617
(laughter)

00:24:12.617 --> 00:24:13.750
- It's gonna go viral.

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:15.470
- Yeah, I know.
- The epic fall.

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:17.850
- Oh my God, I was watching yesterday,

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:20.124
I said I got into a wormhole of watching

00:24:20.124 --> 00:24:24.210
Dancing with the Stars
stuff and like, yeah, fails.

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:25.500
And there haven't been that many,

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.970
there's been like one
girl who forgot her moves.

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:30.452
I forget who it was but what's been the,

00:24:30.452 --> 00:24:32.120
since you've been on the show,

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.020
what's been like the craziest thing

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.370
that's happened live in your experience?

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:39.120
- Craziest thing is
when someone has a cramp

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.307
and you can't really move.

00:24:40.307 --> 00:24:42.154
- Oh my God.
- Kirstie Alley,

00:24:42.154 --> 00:24:44.699
she had that with Max
when they did a rumba,

00:24:44.699 --> 00:24:47.630
and Max had a cramp on
his leg, and he could not,

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:49.600
like they were doing this, like a,

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.080
not a lift, but he was
dipping her somewhere,

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.150
and he had a cramp on the
leg, and he was like, oh!

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:55.360
Like starts shaking--
- Oh man.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.710
- And he had to raise the hand to like,

00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:59.620
they almost stopped the music

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.610
and he just kind of pushed
through, continue it.

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:04.693
But it was pretty bad.
- Wow.

00:25:04.693 --> 00:25:06.300
- But things like, for example,

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.290
you're doing a lift and
the lift doesn't work,

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:10.580
and you're like, she's about to fall,

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:11.567
and there's like oh my God,

00:25:11.567 --> 00:25:14.427
it's like when we did a
free style with Jenna,

00:25:14.427 --> 00:25:18.670
I was so sick, I was so
exhausted, I was just so tired.

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:21.550
And we had this lift where
she jumps on my shoulders

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:25.213
and I have to like catch her
and start running forward.

00:25:25.213 --> 00:25:28.300
So I start, like I don't
know what happened,

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.530
but I started running
forward, and I almost fell.

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.504
I thought I'm like falling--

00:25:33.504 --> 00:25:35.286
- 'Cause you were just sick.
- I'm just falling, yeah.

00:25:35.286 --> 00:25:38.130
Yeah, moments like that,
but everything else is fine.

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.020
- What's your favorite
part of the live show?

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:42.210
I mean, the dancing is where you probably

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:43.577
feel the best.
- It's just the excitement

00:25:43.577 --> 00:25:47.777
in the studio, like all these
people are watching you.

00:25:47.777 --> 00:25:50.030
And they're all so excited,

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:52.270
you just feel the energy.
- It's 1,000 people, right?

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:54.590
Isn't it a big, big crowd?

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:56.330
I mean, for a live television taping,

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:59.780
1,000 people is a huge crowd.

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:02.260
It looks a lot smaller than that on TV.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.000
And then not to mention
the 13 to 18 million people

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.710
who watch it every week--
- Exactly.

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:08.550
- Watching at home, and then voting,

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:10.336
which you have to vote for me and Gleb

00:26:10.336 --> 00:26:12.160
to keep us in the competition,

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:16.159
so please set your DVRs for
September 24th and 25th.

00:26:16.159 --> 00:26:19.063
We will be dancing, we
will need your votes.

00:26:19.063 --> 00:26:21.530
Team Gleb Glaze is what I'm calling us,

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:25.743
hashtag Gleb Glaze,
G-L-E-B, Glaze, G-L-A-Z-E.

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:32.358
I mean, yeah, I guess my biggest fear is

00:26:32.358 --> 00:26:35.910
just fucking up and then
realizing I fucked up

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:36.750
and then fucking up more.

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:39.070
And then it just spirals out of control.

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:40.050
- Well, you gotta put,

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:42.450
you gotta catch yourself,
even if you make a mistake,

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:45.271
you have to kinda go back
and keep it together.

00:26:45.271 --> 00:26:48.370
Don't let it, because they
don't know your steps,

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:49.600
they don't know your routine.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.351
It's only me and you who knows this.

00:26:51.351 --> 00:26:53.430
And even if you make a little mistake,

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:55.410
just keep going, keep pushing through,

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:58.210
and make sure you don't
show it on your face.

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:01.060
And just kind of like
fake it until you make it.

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:02.100
You know what I mean?

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.519
- Yes, what are you bad at, Gleb?

00:27:04.519 --> 00:27:06.446
- What I'm bad at?
- Yeah, what are you--

00:27:06.446 --> 00:27:07.725
- I can't sing.
- You can't sing.

00:27:07.725 --> 00:27:10.330
Would you ever do a
Singing with the Stars?

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:11.740
- Singing with the Stars, sure.

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:12.720
- You would?
- I would do it.

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.270
- Gleb, I have to say, recently,

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:18.380
I think two weeks ago,
won Farming with the Stars

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.000
in the UK.
- Yeah, Celebs on the Farm.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.040
- What?
- Celebs on the Farm,

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.030
it's called Celebs on the Farm,

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:23.854
and it's literally a farming show.

00:27:23.854 --> 00:27:28.360
Gleb is a bona fide celebrity in the UK.

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.764
He has a number two selling calendar.

00:27:31.764 --> 00:27:33.880
- Yes, number three.
- Number three selling

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:36.419
calendar right behind One Direction and?

00:27:36.419 --> 00:27:37.900
- David Beckham.
- And David Beckham.

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.380
- Wow.
- Gleb Savchenko

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:40.572
is number three.

00:27:40.572 --> 00:27:42.615
I can't wait to get this calendar--

00:27:42.615 --> 00:27:43.448
- Where're you in there, Ian?
- Are you gonna come up

00:27:43.448 --> 00:27:45.708
with a 2019?
- It's already out.

00:27:45.708 --> 00:27:47.000
It's on the way here.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.010
- Wait, it's on the way?
- Yeah.

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:49.463
- Here?
- Yes.

00:27:49.463 --> 00:27:50.296
- To the studio right now?

00:27:50.296 --> 00:27:51.129
- Not to the studio
right now, but. (laughs)

00:27:51.129 --> 00:27:52.320
- Will you give me one?
- Of course.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.583
- And Gleb also has a line of underwear.

00:27:54.583 --> 00:27:57.162
- What can't Gleb do?
- Which you said

00:27:57.162 --> 00:27:58.290
you were gonna give me 'cause
I ran out of underwear.

00:27:58.290 --> 00:27:59.800
I only brought so many.
- Today, today, today.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.315
- Will you seriously bring me some?

00:28:01.315 --> 00:28:02.960
- Yes, I always forget.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.803
- Every single pair is designed
based on a dance style.

00:28:06.803 --> 00:28:08.639
So I want the salsa kind.

00:28:08.639 --> 00:28:11.509
- Yeah, you got it.
- Okay, the chunky salsa kind.

00:28:11.509 --> 00:28:14.020
(laughter)

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:16.432
- Do you have a dougie kind?

00:28:16.432 --> 00:28:18.023
- I remember that dance.
- Oh yeah, the dougie.

00:28:18.023 --> 00:28:19.774
(laughs)

00:28:19.774 --> 00:28:22.868
Yeah, so Gleb, let's
go back to your story.

00:28:22.868 --> 00:28:26.160
You end up in America, how?

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.370
'Cause you had bigger aspirations.

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:30.550
You were modeling in Russia.
- So I was modeling in Russia.

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:32.730
- You were in music videos,
you were in print ads,

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:33.810
you were in commercials.
- Yeah, everywhere.

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:35.080
- You were everywhere.
- Everywhere.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.330
- You had the world at your fingertips,

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:37.610
you could have anything you want,

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:40.300
you were a single guy,
you were slaying it.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.080
- Oh my God, it was the best time ever.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.260
- Oh my God, was it the best?
- The best.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.000
- I mean, you were partying all the time,

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.970
drinking like a true Russian.
- Oh my God, yes.

00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:50.380
- You said that the other day,

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:51.860
we were talking about
hangovers and you were like,

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:55.310
oh, man, I was invincible
when I was that age.

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:58.660
- I could literally go for
two days without sleep,

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.520
wake up in the morning, go to work,

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:01.890
come back, repeat it again

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:04.590
and just do it like for three, four days.

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:08.050
Now if I have one or two drinks,
the next morning I'm like

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:09.692
oh my God, I can't wake up.

00:29:09.692 --> 00:29:13.743
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, so
you moved to America.

00:29:13.743 --> 00:29:15.833
- I moved to America, moved to Brooklyn.

00:29:15.833 --> 00:29:18.890
- You moved to Brooklyn.
- Yeah, to become like a

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:21.864
word famous model, male model.

00:29:21.864 --> 00:29:25.461
Yeah, and that was like nothing happened.

00:29:25.461 --> 00:29:28.650
I was just going from casting to casting,

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:29.603
audition to audition--
- Yeah, I got that market

00:29:29.603 --> 00:29:30.770
covered, baby.
- And it was just

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:31.680
nothing happened.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.710
So I was like I ran out of money,

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:36.437
I start teaching at local dance studio

00:29:36.437 --> 00:29:38.560
in New York in the city,

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.770
and I was just doing
it, and then I started

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:43.877
hosting this little Russian
TV program called Time Out

00:29:43.877 --> 00:29:47.090
for the Russian community
where we just take interviews

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:48.700
from all those different famous people

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.590
and checking out what's
happening in the city

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:52.140
to kind of let the Russian community

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:52.973
what's actually happening.

00:29:52.973 --> 00:29:55.809
'Cause you don't realize
that, but a lot of people who

00:29:55.809 --> 00:30:00.330
back in the day, moved
from Ukraine or Russia

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:02.050
to America and they moved to Brooklyn,

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:05.940
some of them, not even
been in the city ever.

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:10.334
So it's like their own world in Brooklyn,

00:30:10.334 --> 00:30:11.987
they live there, and nothing's happening.

00:30:11.987 --> 00:30:12.820
- Yeah, they don't go outside of

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:14.410
that area at all, yes.
- They don't go out, exactly.

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:16.906
So we were trying to go
around and just kind of like

00:30:16.906 --> 00:30:20.170
talk about and let them
know what's happening.

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:22.177
- So you hosted that show.

00:30:22.177 --> 00:30:24.910
- Hosted that show, nothing
happened, nothing happened,

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:28.570
and I went back to dancing,
I started competing again.

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:32.450
And I left, I left New York,

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:34.590
went back to Moscow and went to Hong Kong.

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:36.335
- Yeah.
- Got invited--

00:30:36.335 --> 00:30:37.168
- 'Cause there was money to be made

00:30:37.168 --> 00:30:38.400
in Hong Kong teaching, right?

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.850
- Exactly, teaching, start dancing.

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:41.810
- The Japanese wanna learn how to dance.

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:43.350
- Chinese.
- Chinese,

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:44.586
Hong Kong is in China.

00:30:44.586 --> 00:30:45.544
(laughter)

00:30:45.544 --> 00:30:48.271
Oh my God, literally just learned

00:30:48.271 --> 00:30:50.342
that Hong Kong is in China.

00:30:50.342 --> 00:30:53.342
(upbeat rock music)
