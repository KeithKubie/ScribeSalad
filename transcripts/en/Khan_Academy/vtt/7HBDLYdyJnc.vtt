00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.270
- [Instructor] Interpol's
Works of Art division

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.430
confirmed that my
great-grandmother's wedding ring

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.557
and the ring stolen from the
British Royal Treasury in 1918

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.410
are one in the same.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.890
All right, so this is interesting.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.940
They've underlined the word in.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.180
And this expression one in the same

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.870
is sometimes something that you might hear

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.290
but it's actually the
incorrect expression.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.810
The correct expression
is one and the same.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.230
One

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.800
and

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.780
the same.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.720
And it's just an expression people use,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.080
to kind of to be extra redundant,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.913
I guess you could say.

00:00:39.913 --> 00:00:41.790
'Cause to say that they are one

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.510
and to say that they are the same,

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.270
well you're saying the
same thing over and over

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.250
but it's kinda making it clear,

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.690
they are one and the same.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.930
This is an expression.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.220
This is the conventional expression

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.210
that you will hear people say.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.460
So this in should be and.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.240
And this one is a pretty hard one

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.300
because of how often these
two expressions are confused.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.320
One in the same,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.380
and one one and the same.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.050
People will hear someone
say one and the same

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.850
or hear them say it really quickly,

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:08.960
one and the same,

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.090
and then it sounds like
they said one in the same

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.370
and then that person will
repeat one in the same

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.660
and then a lot of other people think

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.060
that the expression is one in the same.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.010
But one in the same,

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.843
if you think about it,

00:01:18.843 --> 00:01:20.810
it just doesn't even make a lot of sense.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.500
It's like having one
thing in the same thing.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.710
So just remember that just
is a little bit strange.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.340
The correct expression
is one and the same.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.987
So we definitely don't wanna
leave it the way it is,

00:01:31.987 --> 00:01:32.820
one and the same.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.220
One of the same,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.790
well that's not the expression.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.920
And one over the same,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.643
that's not it for sure as well.
