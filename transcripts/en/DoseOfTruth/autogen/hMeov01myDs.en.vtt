mean all of a sudden you have an

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810
mean all of a sudden you have an
 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.810

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820
intimate relationship with new people
 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.940
intimate relationship with new people

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950
that is as close as any relationship
 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.710
that is as close as any relationship
that you've ever had you have the

that you've ever had you have the
opportunity to make that relationship as

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579
opportunity to make that relationship as
 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.850
opportunity to make that relationship as
pristine as you possibly can

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860
pristine as you possibly can
 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.530
pristine as you possibly can
I mean that can be a lot of catastrophe

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540
I mean that can be a lot of catastrophe
 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.270
I mean that can be a lot of catastrophe
involved in it but it's a great

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280
involved in it but it's a great
 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.069
involved in it but it's a great
opportunity and there's just nothing

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079
opportunity and there's just nothing
 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.780
opportunity and there's just nothing
wrong with having some additional people

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790
wrong with having some additional people
 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.200
wrong with having some additional people
that love you you know and so what you

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210
that love you you know and so what you
 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.630
that love you you know and so what you
do is you turn your attention to the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640
do is you turn your attention to the
 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.730
do is you turn your attention to the
issues of maturity and your tune your

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740
issues of maturity and your tune your
 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.980
issues of maturity and your tune your
attention away from the issues of being

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990
attention away from the issues of being
 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.920
attention away from the issues of being
a juvenile and you do that partly by

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930
a juvenile and you do that partly by
 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.719
a juvenile and you do that partly by
knowing that it's actually better to do

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729
knowing that it's actually better to do
 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.700
knowing that it's actually better to do
so you know there's nothing more absurd

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710
so you know there's nothing more absurd
 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.399
so you know there's nothing more absurd
