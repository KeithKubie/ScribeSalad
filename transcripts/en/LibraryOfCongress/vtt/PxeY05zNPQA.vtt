00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.990
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: We're
delighted to have you all here

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.740
for the first day of
Cultural Heritage and Data:

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.220
The Role of Research
Infrastructures.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.830
And it's my very great pleasure
to introduce John Van Oudenaren,

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.800
the director o Scholarly
and Educational Programs

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.390
and acting director of
the World Digital Library

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.550
to give the welcome to the library.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.850
&gt;&gt; John van Oudenaren:
Thank you Fenella.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.690
Thanks for inviting me here
and welcome to all of you.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.180
It's great to be here
with some old colleagues,

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.480
belongs to any colleagues,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.690
so my good friend Riccardo
Pozzo in particular.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.810
Good morning and welcome
to the Library of Congress

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.390
and the two-day International
Symposium on Cultural Heritage

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.000
and Data: The Role of
Research Infrastructures.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.820
Today's program will advance
our current understanding

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.910
of research infrastructures
focusing on current initiatives,

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.090
issues and challenges,
solutions, and the future landscape

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.630
of research infrastructures.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.480
Our international colleagues
in IPERION CH and that stands

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.500
for Integrated Platform

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.510 position:56%
for the European Research
Infrastructure on Cultural Heritage.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.780
I assume you all know that.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.080
But I read it out for my
benefit, if not for anyone else's.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.550
The consortium is focused on
taking up the challenge outlined

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.690
in the Horizon 2020
Work Program 2014-2015

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.130
for European Research
Infrastructures,

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.780
which calls for the establishment

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.050
of a unique European research
infrastructure for restoration

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.890
and conservation of
cultural heritage.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.130
Encompassed in this proposal
by the term heritage science,

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.880 position:56%
where heritage science is a
crosscutting domain embracing a wide

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.960
range of research disciplines
according to various aspects

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.290
of tangible and intangible
cultural heritage conservation,

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.410
interpretation and management.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.020 position:56%
This challenge of course
encompasses the building of stronger

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.830
and more effective collaborations
between the EU and US partners.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.040
Research infrastructures play
an increasingly important role

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.340
in the advancement of knowledge for
humanities and heritage science.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.510
They are a key instrument in
bringing together a wide diversity

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.060
of stakeholders and offer unique
research services to users

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.870 position:56%
from different countries, attracting
new researchers to humanities

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.310
and preservation science
and help to research--

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.340
and help to shape research
communities.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.650
Research infrastructures help to
create a new research environment

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.960
in which all researchers
whether working in the context

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.230
of their home institutions
or in national

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.660
or multinational scientific
initiatives have shared access

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.630
to unique or distributed
research facilities,

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.250
including data instruments
computing and communications,

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.540
regardless of their type
and location in the world.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.780
These initiatives are at the
center of the knowledge triangle

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.590
of research, education,
and innovation.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.660
They produce knowledge
through research,

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.160
diffuse it through education
and apply it through innovation.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.670
I trust you'll enjoy the
presentations outlining some

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.090
of the European Union and
US initiatives in this area.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.980
And we look forward to stimulating
further collaborative efforts

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.710
to make best use of resources
to encourage the standardization

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.200
of procedures and to ensure access
internationally to advance research

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.250 position:56%
for humanities and heritage science.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.510
Once again, welcome and
thank you for joining us.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.500
[ Applause ]

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.150
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: So I just wanted

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.460
to give a quick overview
of the next two days.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.020
These-- Today's presentations
are being filmed

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.480
so all speakers have been
given a release form.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.150
If you do not wish to have that put

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.820
up on the website,
then we will not do so.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.560
But we're hoping that you
will all agree to do that.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.880 position:56%
And as part of that filming, we
will-- whenever there are questions,

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.460
I will actually ask-- one of us
will be here speaking the question

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.870
so that the film crew can
actually hear [inaudible].

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.820
So there have been a
number of organizers

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.480
who have helped make this
event come to fruition.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.770
And so, we have Monique in
the front, Barbara, Odile,

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.120
Jong-on, Giulio and Stefano.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.020
Thanks to everyone who have helped
with bringing this together.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.080 position:56%
So we are really looking at engaging
in these transatlantic dialogue

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.830
to understand more about how we can
be effective in the communications

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.580 position:56%
and the collaborations that we bring
together in taking those forward

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.770 position:56%
because we really are working now in
a global infrastructure and we need

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.850
to make sure that anything that we
kept during the data we're working

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.460
with is interoperable between
all our different initiatives.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.540
These four main areas
that will be focused

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.640
on throughout the different
presentations, education

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.610
and training, innovative
instrumentation,

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.150 position:56%
advancing diagnostics and digital
heritage, and you'll see both panels

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.530
and presentations on
those various areas.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:51.000
I just want to note that we
had a similar meeting starting

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.790
to really engage and
thinking about working

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.040 position:56%
with our international colleagues in
December 2014, and this was looking

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.420
at Fostering the Transatlantic
Dialogue.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:06.940
And so, these presentations
were given here and we--

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.910
most people agree but we want to
get those up on our website as well

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.810
and by the link the
two events together.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.250
So as John mentioned,
IPERION CH has been--

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.970
this is the focus behind
this meeting today.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.730
And many of our colleagues
here who will be presenting

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.380
on the various initiatives,
we're delighted

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.560
to have those different projects
put forward because sometimes

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.930
in the states, we don't always get
to hear what's happening in Europe.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.910
We also have presentation
of-- presentations, I'm sorry,

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.770
representatives from a number of
other initiatives that we've talked

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.330
about in the past and I will just
go through these for your interest.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.710
ARIADNE which of course is
archeology database structure.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:55.050
CENDARI, looking at it from
the humanities perspective.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.640
DARIAH-EU, which is also the
Digital Research Infrastructure

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.860
for Arts and Humanities.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.230
There's another one, we learned
last time to get very good

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.110
with all our different acronyms.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.520 position:56%
PARTHENOS, which is one of the newer
ones which was kickstarted in July

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.030
of 2015 and some of us were
privileged to be there,

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.100
really looking at where
the gaps are between some

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.730
of the various initiatives and
starting to pull all that together.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.380
And E-RIHS, which I know
Luca will talk about,

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.690 position:56%
the European Research
Infrastructure for Heritage Science,

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.570
which is a new focus to really
try and combine what's happening

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.590
across Europe with the
intent and the hope

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.010
that once we get passed looking
at some of the legal implications,

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.360
taking that into a global
perspective as well.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.560
So a few things I just want to
focus on that you'll see coming

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.980
up throughout the various
presentations,

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.330
in terms of collaboration
and cooperation.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.440
So we really want to
talk more effectively

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.000
and think more effectively

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.140
about what is collaboration
in an effective way.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.440
And do specific types

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.740
of collaboration require
different approaches

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.130
and you may see this coming out
when we talk about education

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:08.460
versus digital, versus the
innovation and the diagnostics.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:12.120
Also, the many changes
just happened last night

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.230
in both New Zealand and Italy.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.740
How do we achieve sustained
collaboration,

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:24.490
a very constantly changing
economic and international climate

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.210
and keep things moving
forward particularly

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.860
because we often do not have
extensive funding for those.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:34.830
And the sustainability of
international collaborations.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.460 position:56%
In terms of research and networking,

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.200
IPERION talks about
the joint research

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.910
for faster scientific advancement
and integrating the activities

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:45.910
for a more structured community.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:49.380
And so, with those four areas,
we really are looking at teasing

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.950
out what collaborations
already exist

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:56.000
and how we can move those forward.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.300
[Inaudible] speaks of this thinking

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.480
about how we can link
together the stakeholders

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.800
and sharing unique
research services.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.480
Many of us are privileged to
have extensive laboratories,

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.220
but not all institutions
have those capabilities.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.010
And so, how we can make more
effective model to engage

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.680
with other institutions and
share our resources is something

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.990
that we really need to
think about as we go forward

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:18.930
with the sustained approach.

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:23.320
And thinking of these aspects,
both as the physical resources,

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.840
the network of expertise
and colleagues,

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.440 position:56%
which is a really critical component

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.870
that I think is really what
holds everything together

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.170
most effectively.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.190
And then, one thing I think is
becoming even more critical is the

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:38.770
interoperability of the data and
making sure that people can access

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:42.070
that effectively that
isn't an open environment

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:46.130
and that we can share it, you
know, in effective manner.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:49.130
So with sharing sustainability,
really thinking

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:52.420
about how do we make sure we got
these long-term collaborative

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.510
activities moving forward
across different cultures,

00:09:55.510 --> 00:10:00.080
both economic and diverse natures.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.240
This international sharing of
the resources and platforms

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.810
to actually initiate, engage
and allowed us to move forward.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:11.490
I do just want to mention this
came out of our last meeting here

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.900
where it was very interesting
in fact where we started to look

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:19.570
at the differences between European
and United States approaches.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.930
And one of the things we
realize in fact that, you know,

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.640
these are centralized
public funding model

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.410
versus a private model
here in the states.

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:33.430 position:56%
And also we don't have the privilege
of having a Ministry of Culture

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.900
or similar in the United States.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.960
And the need for us to really start
to think about as a collaboration

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.730 position:56%
and a coalition of institutions here
in the states of how we can form

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:48.730
and engage grouping that allows us
to show a strength and united body

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:51.940
in terms of moving forward
to cultural heritage.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.900
So, I just wanted to finish there.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:00.940
Leave that to open up the meeting
and turn over to our first speaker

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:05.520
of the day, Dr. Riccardo Pozzo,
who's a director of Social Sciences

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.000
and Humanities, Cultural
Heritage Department

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.510
of the National Research
Council of Italy.

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.500
[ Applause ]

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.590 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Riccardo Pozzo: And good morning.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:21.720
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.980
I was already here and some
of you I already spoke.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.960
So, I'm trying not to repeat
myself and just keep you update

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.420
in what has been happening.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:34.770
Last time I spoke to you
it was about 10 months ago.

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:38.790
But first, on behalf of
the Italian co-chairs

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:43.920
of the joint Italy-US Committee
on Culture and Natural Heritage,

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:48.850
may I extend my deepest thank to
Fenella France and the Library

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:52.540
of Congress who organize
this and to her colleagues,

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:57.060
three of our co-chairs, American
co-chairs, namely Barbara Berrie,

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.940
Odile Madden and Jong-un Hahm.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.240
Thank you very much.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.060
It's a big pleasure to be here.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:10.490
Now, you have all read the news
with it and it's not funny.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:16.080
But anyway, I wanted to stay to
[inaudible] unflinching commitment.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.930
The unflinching committee
of the Italian government

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:23.290
to sustaining what we are doing.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.590
It's very important.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:27.040
Fenella was saying,
there is no Minister

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.070
of Culture in the United States.

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:32.000
We have a Minister
of Culture in Italy.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.310
And more for that,
we have a minister

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:42.030
of culture whose budget
covers 0.4 of the GDP, 0.4,

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:46.490
imagine 0.4 of the US
GDP what that would be.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:47.970
In our case, it's 0.4.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:49.570
It's actually less than that.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.660
We got some cuts, it's about 0.3.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.410
But still it's a lot of money.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.560
And why do we have that?

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.150
Because we have this
enormous responsibility,

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:04.270
0.3 of the GDP goes
towards conservation,

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:08.370
protection, use of monuments.

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:12.850
That's defining our country.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:16.090
Greece has similar
figures obviously.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:21.110
But we are-- in the G8, we
are industrialized country.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:26.510
We are very innovative
and we have that.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:30.790
So that Fenalla France was writing
in her presentation science,

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.140
technology and Innovation.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.570
Let me rephrase it.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:40.780
Science, Technology,
Engineering and Mathematics STEM,

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:45.630
but we are actually going for
STEAM, Science, Technology,

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:49.090
Engineering, Arts and Mathematics.

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:54.250
That's a form we are
working on a little, STEAM.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.060
Now as regards as the updates.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:02.880
We had the ravishing
moment in March of 2016

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:09.010
when ESFRI accepted
the Italian CH project,

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:12.050
the Italian CH infrastructure.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:19.370
As in this project, which
means about-- they change name.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:22.350
We updated, upgraded the name.

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:28.930
Now the name is E-R-I-H-S, E-RIHS,
pronounce it the way you want.

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.010
New York or not New York.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:36.230
And the European Research
Infrastructure Heritage Signs.

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:37.530
That's it.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:38.980
It's the reality.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.500
And we're talking about
sustainability.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:46.370
So, in order to become
what is supposed to become,

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:53.530
E-RIHS has five years
counting now, 2016, 2021.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:58.430
In 2021, E-RIHS would
be full fledged.

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.830
It will become a European
Research Infrastructure Consortium

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:05.010
and will start counting
years from there.

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:09.490
So, we have five years
working together very hard.

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:15.380
We will be established in 2021
and finally to see how ESFRI

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.480 position:56%
and the European Union will consider

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.520
that infrastructure
has reached its peak

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:25.640
and there's nothing more innovative
to say, which means that sooner

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:31.640
or later, the European Union will
start reconsidering financing a

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.280
mature infrastructure.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.090
And the infrastructure
will go on of its own legs.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:40.550
That's the way we face
sustainability right now.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:45.560
Five years preparation, a long
time as a mature infrastructure

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.840
and fans see what happens.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:55.680
I'm quite aware of this
because I represent Italy

00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:00.080
in all six European Research
Infrastructure for Social

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.640
and Cultural Innovation,
that's the way we're called,

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:09.560 position:56%
with this research infrastructures
deal with matters of social sciences

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:14.290 position:56%
and humanities or if you want social
innovation and culture innovation.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:18.780
Six in numbers right now, five
landmarks and one project.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.940
The project I mentioned
already, that's E-RIHS.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:27.610 position:56%
The landmarks are DARIAH, H, DARIAH,
Digital Research Infrastructure

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:32.710
of Arts and Humanities, CLARIN,
Common Language Resources,

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:37.990
that's for linguistics,
[inaudible] for social sciences,

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:45.590
the European Social Survey, CESSDA
which is public records and SHARE

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:49.830
for retirement, aging population.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:55.140 position:56%
Particularly SHARE is the one-- the
oldest one, the one that people say,

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.130
all right, all right, are you done?

00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:59.430
You're mature.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:04.000
You have nothing more to look.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.690
In ways of making yourself
better, so SHARE is an example

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:14.490
of a research infrastructure, which
is not going to be financed anymore

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:18.930
in the next work programs.

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:24.110
And we have to find and-- but
still, this is a situation

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:30.480
in which we are not yet--
it's a long time to go.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.400
But let me see again
a better scenarios.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:41.100
2020 would be the end of Horizon
2020, 2021 would be the start

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:46.090
of FP9, Frame Program number nine.

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:51.270
So, we are currently looking at a
result of the midterm evaluation

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:55.530
of Horizon 2020, which
is more favorable

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:56.830
for research infrastructures.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:03.080
There is no words of
them being reconsidered.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:07.740
But still we have to make
sure about the work program

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:12.230
after work program we are in.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:19.300
And-- So the best thing is
to look for business models.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:25.320
And, you know, I congratulate
very much and look a bit certain

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:30.650
for his looking forward and
having considerate from the start

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:32.970
that E-RIHS, and let's
call it E-RIHS,

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:34.970
since now IPERION CH [inaudible].

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:38.080
So, I thought it's
a name as a project

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.510
that is currently sponsoring us.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:47.020
But E-RIHS, E-RIHS
has a global impact.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.810
So, it was the first
[inaudible] was the first--

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:56.430
he was the first to have
contacts with US scholars since he

00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:02.080
in Washington, Los Angeles and
we've opened it up to China.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.870
Chinese Economy, Culture,
and Heritage is a candidate

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:10.670
to becoming associate and
we have to look around.

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:14.520
So the global impact is there.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.700 position:56%
And we have to look at business
models that make it possible to work

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:25.670
on access units and see
that at the end of the year,

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:31.310
the fiscal distribution corresponds
to what we had planned it for.

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:32.970
Let me conclude.

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:42.090
We have a reference to the European
Union South Africa Joint Research

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:44.700
Agreement that was signed

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:50.240
in Cape Town two months ago
exactly, on October 4th.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:55.960
And that is quite interesting
because the Minister for Science

00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:00.120
and Technology and Innovation,
Madame Naledi Pandor,

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:04.430
who's really a woman to whom I
personally have a lot of respect.

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:14.100 position:56%
She had engineered the agreement on
the basis of South Africans interest

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.130
in a very new research
infrastructure

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:18.940
of which perhaps you
might have heard,

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:23.390 position:56%
which is called the Square Kilometre
Array was going to be built

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:27.890
in the desert of Kalahari.

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:33.630
And that's the gift of South Africa
for joining the European Union

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:37.810
on this great endeavor of
research infrastructures.

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.400
But when we signed the agreement,

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:45.130
we were there representing
all research infrastructures

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:47.330
currently active.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:53.710
And it was clear that South Africa
too has an interest in the profits

00:20:53.710 --> 00:21:00.360
in research gains that all
European infrastructures provide.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.720
And particularly, the social

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.370
and cultural innovation
infrastructures,

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.150
we found sensible years.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:18.350
More of that, we found the urgent
needs because if you take the issue

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:22.610
of migrants, which is
determining so much politics

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:26.760
and economics right now in Europe,
where in South Africa is it's just

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.690
as the same as we had,
only southward.

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:34.890
We have-- We welcome
migrants northbound.

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:37.320
We welcome migrants southbound.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:42.970
So the idea is International
Corporation

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:46.970
of researches European Union.

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:52.100
We've [inaudible] can be a
great profit in a holistic way.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:59.250
It's important that we come up with
our perspective and that we come

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:02.950
up we-- sorry, we Europeans.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:04.280
We Europeans come up
with perspective,

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.050
which is distinctly European.

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:10.860
And what makes us currently
distinctly European is

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:14.720
interdisciplinarity,
multilingualism,

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.130
and the fact that whatever you do,

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:21.660
it's always a consortium
of plus 12 states.

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:26.220
This is a model that
we are proud of.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.520
It has worked well.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.960
It will work again, better.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:34.120
And we are very thankful for
you, for your attentive years.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.920
Thank you.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:40.500
[ Applause ]

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.310
&gt;&gt; Fenella France:
Thank you Riccardo.

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:50.800
And now it gives me great pleasure
to introduce Mary Kavanagh,

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.570
who is the minister counselor
for Research and Innovation

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:57.000
in the delegation of the European
Union to the United States.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.940
Thank you so much for being here.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.340
&gt;&gt; Mary Kavanagh: Good
morning everybody.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:05.640
And thank you Fenella.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.470
Thank you to the organizers
for inviting me

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:09.190
to speak here this morning.

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:10.940
I have to say it's a
great honor to speak

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:12.980
at the Library of Congress
of course.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.090
So thank you all very much.

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:19.530
Now, I know that you're all
specialists in cultural heritage.

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:21.330
I can put straight up.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:25.410
I'm not specialist at all
but I'm a great appreciator

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:27.530
of cultural heritage.

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:29.880
And the reason that I'm invite--

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:34.260
was invited to speak this
morning was not to speak

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.920
about cultural heritage per se

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.770
because of course,
I'm not an expert.

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:43.330
But to speak to you about how
the European Union funds research

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:48.650
in cultural heritage and what
opportunities may exist there

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:53.620
between-- for transatlantic
cooperation.

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:58.040
So most of my presentation
will focus on Horizon 2020,

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:05.400 position:56%
which is the European framework
program for research and innovation.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:09.000
It covers the years
from 2014 to 2020,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.360
which is why it's called
Horizon 2020.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.980
And I will talk about
that in a moment.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.260
But first, I just like to
mention a few other ways

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:25.320
in which the European Union
provides funding for support

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:29.060
of cultural heritage in Europe.

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.010
And firstly, it's important

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:34.330
to mention a program
called Creative Europe.

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:39.620
Now Creative Europe is a program
that is much broader than research

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:46.570
and it funds things in Europe such
as the European City of Culture.

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:53.060
It funds things like the Heritage
Days, where cities are encouraged

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:59.460
to open up buildings and
open up places to the public

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.740
that maybe they normally
don't have access to.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:08.450 position:56%
It also funds prizes for work on
cultural heritage throughout Europe.

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:10.630
So that's Creative Europe.

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:15.260
It has a budget for the cultural
part of the Creative Europe program

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:18.850
of about 422 million euros.

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:24.980
The second area where work on
cultural heritage is funded is

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.360
through our education
program and particularly

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.630
through the Erasmus Plus Programme.

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:34.390
And that is a program of--
that covers many areas.

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:41.440
But one particular area of interest
is it funds collaborative projects

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:46.270
for training between higher
education institutions.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:48.470
These higher education
institutions can be in Europe

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:52.670
and they can also involve
partners from outside of Europe.

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:57.480
And that's really boosting
skills and education

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.060
to make people more
employable in whatever area.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:04.100
But this also includes
cultural-- the cultural area.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:09.320
And then a third area where
Europe provides a lot of funding

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:13.490
for our support and preservation
of European culture and heritage is

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:15.880
through what we call
the Cohesion Funds.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:20.930
And the Cohesion Funds because you
know Europe has 28 member states.

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:29.250
And there is a great deal of-- that
a lot of difference in the incomes,

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:33.040
in the wealth of these
different areas around Europe.

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:38.300 position:56%
Some of the areas of Europe that
perhaps are the least wealthy have--

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.940
in some cases, got some of the
most interesting cultural heritage.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:46.190
So the Cohesion Funds are
funds which are provided

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:48.200
to the European member states.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.290
And the member states
themselves indicate how they want

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:54.970
to spend them, so they say,
for example, we want to just--

00:26:54.970 --> 00:27:00.130
we would like to use
Cohesion funds specifically

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:05.120
for preserving an archeological
site for example.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:11.070
Or they may want to build, what
we call it, interpretive centers

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:14.100
to help maybe bring
more tourism to an area

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:20.640
and without damaging the actual
heritage itself provide a center

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:24.470
for our people to learn more
about the-- about that culture--

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:26.980
the cultural heritage
in that particular area.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:30.340
So these are-- I just want to just
give you a kind of broad brush idea

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:34.380
of different ways in which the
European Union funds cultural

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:35.680
heritage in different ways.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:39.520
But what I'll talk mainly
about is research policy,

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:44.380
and how research policy
funds cultural heritage--

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:47.030 position:56%
supports cultural heritage research.

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:55.210
Now Professor Pozzo mentioned
already the way in which many

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:57.820
of the research infrastructures
which are funded

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:01.600
through Horizon 2020, which
is our research program.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.370 position:56%
And so I won't focus on that because
I know that throughout the next day

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:07.950
or so and next of couple of
days, you would hear a lot more

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:11.790
about the specific projects like
CLARIN and DALIAH and IPERION.

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:14.420
So I wan to say I'm not going
to try to squeeze them all

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:17.160
in to a short message now.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:23.110
But those research infrastructures,
the European Union funds the stage

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:29.410
of [inaudible] of development of
these research infrastructures,

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:32.290
but as Sir Pozzo rightly said,

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:34.640
the European Union
research funds are not going

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.960
to fund these research
infrastructures forever

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.230
into the future, because
there are new ones coming

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:42.440
in line all the time.

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.740
So therefore, what the European
Union does want is the conceptions

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:47.490
and the development phase.

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:51.980
So, let me talk about some of
the other opportunities and let--

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:55.150
but let me first introduce a little
bit the program Horizon 2020.

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:57.180
I guess any of you who are
here from Europe but I know

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.480
that there was several European--

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:04.880
I heard several European
accents in the audience.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.950
So you probably are already very
familiar with that but hopefully,

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:09.250
even you who are familiar

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:12.320
with Horizon 2020 will
learn something new today.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:16.670
So let's see page down.

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:18.210
What is Horizon 2020?

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:23.670
Horizon 2020 is the European
Union's framework program

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:26.480 position:56%
for funding research and innovation.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:31.150
It is and always on upon--
it's upon European program.

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:34.020
So Horizon 2020 is one aspect,

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.450
one dimension of research
funding in Europe.

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:40.100
Because of course every member
state has its own research funding,

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:41.630
has its own department of--

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:45.010
departments of science
and technology.

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:50.320
But in addition to the individual
member state research programs,

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.280
we have Horizon 20202.

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:57.570
And Horizon 2020 has a
number of objectives.

00:29:57.570 --> 00:30:01.970
The objectives are to develop
excellent science in Europe

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:06.440
to support-- and to
support European industry

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:08.090
and industrial competitiveness.

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:14.840
And of course, to strengthen the
European Union's global position

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:18.040
in research and innovation
in the technology.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:22.150
And most importantly, Horizon
2020 is open to the world.

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:25.070
So researchers from anywhere
in the world can participate

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:27.010
in Horizon 2020 projects.

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:30.410
And I will describe how
in the coming slides.

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:37.770
Oh, and I should mention
that the financial envelope

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:42.320
of Horizon 2020 is about 77
billion euros over seven years,

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:46.630
which is present approximately
$80 billion.

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:52.650
So as I said, there are three
main priorities excellent science,

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:56.170
industrial leadership,
and societal challenges.

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:59.190
And what's interesting is under
for example, the excellent science

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:02.310
which I'll talk about, there
are a lot of opportunities

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:09.500
for individual researchers
in any area of science.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.010 position:56%
From physics to arts, to humanities,

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:15.940
to economic science,
all kinds of science.

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.590
Under the societal
challenges, which I will explain

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:20.590
in a little bit more detail also,

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:23.190
there are also many
opportunities specifically

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:28.070
for cultural heritage research
and innovation, and indeed also

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:30.420
under the industrial
leadership element,

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.720
which I will also talk
about briefly.

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:39.370
Yeah, I will talk about the
European Research Council

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:42.590
and the Marie Curie
actions a little bit later.

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:48.640
But let me start here with
the leadership in industrial

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.430
and enabling technologies.

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:54.690 position:56%
Now, you might say to yourself, what
has that got to do with research

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:56.950
in the humanities, at least
I did, maybe you wouldn't

00:31:56.950 --> 00:32:01.620 position:56%
because you know much more than I do
about research on cultural heritage.

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:05.910
But this aspect of
Horizon 2020 leadership

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:10.500
and industrial technologies
covers technologies such as ICT,

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.050
nanotechnologies, materials,
biotechnology,

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:15.890
manufacturing, and space.

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:19.400
And as an example there, there's--

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:25.540
Horizon 2020 by the way would
publish calls for proposals.

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:29.900
So therefore, research
proposals have to come

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:31.910
in following these
calls from proposals.

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:35.170
But for example in the
materials research section,

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:43.010
in the 2017 work program, there
is a section on new materials

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:47.830
for preserving and
protecting cultural heritage.

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:51.570
So therefore, what's important
to realize is particularly

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:55.070
with Horizon 2020, not if
you're looking for opportunities

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:58.800
in Horizon 2020, not to
look only for, you know,

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.210
for a section that's
called cultural heritage.

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:04.420 position:56%
But it's-- very often it's
mainstreamed through different parts

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:07.450
of the Horizon 2020 program.

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:10.030
That's one example.

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:15.580
Likewise in ICT under the
European digital agenda,

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:19.120
there are opportunities far-- as
was mentioned actually earlier

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:26.290 position:56%
by Fenella of working on how to
make for example data interoperable,

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:29.370
how to make data accessible
internationally.

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:32.410
And this can be-- equally
it can be the--

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:37.250
in the context of cultural heritage
just as it could be in the context

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:41.090
of any other type of research.

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:45.550
So if we take a look at some the
societal challenges that are funded

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:47.710
by Horizon 2020 and just
as a small reminder,

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:51.720
you remember that there
were these three circles.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.800
So you have societal challenges,
you have industrial leadership,

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:58.530
and you have research excellence.

00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:02.710
We just talked about the
leadership opportunities.

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:05.280
Now we look at the
societal challenges.

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:10.100
Most of the cultural
heritage research is funded

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:14.600
under what we call societal
challenge six, which is inclusive

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.570
and reflective societies.

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:19.260
Now inclusive and reflective
societies

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:32.050 position:56%
in Horizon 2020 is a followup of
similar research program that we had

00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:36.320
because prior to Horizon
2020, which starts in 2013--

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:41.730
in 2014, we also had
another research program.

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:43.890 position:56%
It was called Framework Programme 7.

00:34:43.890 --> 00:34:46.730
And under Framework Programme
7, I just have to [inaudible]

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:51.150
so that I can indicate
the correct amount.

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:56.980 position:56%
Under Framework Programme 7, we also
funded cultural heritage research

00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:59.830
to the tune of 180 million euros.

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:04.640
So therefore, that was under
the previous framework program.

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:08.500
So this Framework Programme Horizon
2020, we can also expect although

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.980
of course it's only started.

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:15.730
It's only two years done, so we
have quite a ways to go to 2020.

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:18.980
But we can expect that
funding for research

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:21.040
on cultural heritage
will be at least

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:26.450 position:56%
of the same dimension depending on
the projects that come in of course.

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:29.220
But some of the types of
projects, of research project

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.230
that are included for
example under inclusive

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:35.450
and reflective societies
are for example projects

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:42.050
such as religious diversity in
Europe or how young people engage

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:47.260
with culture-- oops, sorry.

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:51.410
Another interesting
one which is actually

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:55.670
in the 2017 work program
is cultural heritage

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:58.630
of European coastal
and maritime zones.

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:01.370
So therefore, it's really
quite a broad panoply

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:06.110
of topics that are-- that come up.

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:10.450
So I say, the 2017 work
program has a number

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:15.080
of specific culture heritage
research opportunities.

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:19.820
But it's not only inclusive
on reflective societies,

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:25.160
the six cultural-- the
six societal challenge,

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:26.810
where opportunities exist.

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:29.080
Opportunities also exist as I said

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.890
because it's mainstreamed
to a certain extent.

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:37.240
In other areas, for example under
keen and efficient energy, there--

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:43.050
in 2017 call, there is a
call for research on how

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:46.080
to renovate historic buildings

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:53.280
to upgrade them energetically
for example.

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:56.420
Under climate action resource
efficiency and raw materials,

00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:02.120
there is a call for
proposals, how natural--

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:08.330
how to build resilience in cultural
heritage against natural disasters?

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:12.450
So therefore again, I'm-- I
repeat myself but when looking

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:14.860
at Horizon 2020 don't
go only at the--

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:17.290
under the obvious heading
which would be inclusive

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:20.880
and reflective societies where
there is a lot of research

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:24.220
and opportunities for cultural
heritage research but also

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:27.010
under other areas because
under other areas also you will

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:29.310
find opportunities.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:35.230
And then I want to-- sorry,
maybe just before I come

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:40.140
on that, I should indicate.

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:42.960
These projects under
these societal challenges,

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.610
they're always collaborative
research project.

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:49.920
So they almost always must have
at least three European partners

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.470
from three different
European countries.

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:56.700
They can however include partners

00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:00.330
from any other part
of the world also.

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:03.180
Generally if these partners
come from developing countries,

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:09.570
such as Africa and we do actually
quite a lot of work with Africa

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:12.760
or some of the less
developed countries,

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:16.000
for example in Latin America.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.240
If the projects include
partners from those countries,

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:23.420
the European Union will fund fully
the participation of those partners

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:26.050
if the project is selected.

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:27.750
For countries such
as the United States,

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:29.710
which is an industrialized country,

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:32.820
the European Union generally
does not fund the participation

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.560
of the American partner.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:38.870
The American partner is expected to
bring their own funds to the table.

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:40.910
But what's the advantage
for the American partner?

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:44.130
Well, the advantage of course for
the American partner is the access

00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:47.200
to all of the work that is being
done by the other partners,

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:54.550
and it's the access to that
network, access to the new results

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:57.690
that are being produced
but also being part

00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:00.010
of the new results that
are being produced.

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:01.310
So it's really an opportunity

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:03.880
for international cooperation
at a very high level.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.830
So therefore that's why we say
Horizon 2020 is open to the world

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:12.440
and we really encourage and
like to have American partners.

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:16.310
So any Europeans in the
audience who are thinking

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:21.090
of preparing Horizon 2020 projects
to submit, please do remember

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:25.560 position:56%
that American partners are extremely
welcome and any Americans who are

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:28.990
in the audience who have good ideas
for research projects and would

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:32.740
like to internationalize them,
then please don't hesitate to speak

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:35.580
with some European partners
and look at the opportunities

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:39.510
that Horizon 2020 might
be able to provide to you.

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:44.900
Another aspect I would like to
mention regarding Horizon 2020

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:46.500
that you may or may not be familiar

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:51.380
with are the European
Research Council grants.

00:39:51.380 --> 00:40:00.140
And the European Research
Council grants are relatively new

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:03.420
in European research funding terms.

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.290
Actually 2017 will be
the 10th anniversary

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:08.140
of the European Research Council.

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:11.690
And since the European
Research Council was set up,

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:19.860
it has been funding individual
investigators at a very,

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:26.960
very high level with very
prestigious, very generous grants.

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.810
Any researcher from anywhere
in the world can apply

00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:32.910 position:56%
for European Research Council grant.

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:42.140
One of the stipulations however
is that that person must spend

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:44.430
at least 50% of their
time in Europe.

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:46.970
Because the idea of the European
Research Council grants is

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:50.460
that people will set
up a lab in Europe.

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.740
Now, I'll be very brief on this
because I could talk about it

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.060
for half a day because it's one

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:56.330
of my favorite topics,
but I'll be very brief.

00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:59.270 position:56%
There are three main types of grant.

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:02.780
There are grant for-- they're
called Starting Grants.

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:05.090
Most of the money goes
to starting grants.

00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:07.410
And these are for individuals
who are ready to set

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:14.830
up their own research
lab for the first time.

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.930
The researcher who applies must
nevertheless be able to demonstrate

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:24.010
that they have really
the capacity and the--

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:28.480
really show the potential
to make a difference

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.010
in their chosen area of research.

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:34.850 position:56%
And what's very important is that
the area of research can be any area

00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:39.810
of research including of course
humanities, cultural heritage

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:44.750
and the arts, as well as
physics or brain science.

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:46.950
It can be anything.

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:49.190
Then we have a-- there's
a second type of grant

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:50.900
which is called the
Consolidator Grant.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:53.580
The consolidator grants
are for people who are

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:58.880
at a more advanced stage in their
research career and they have a--

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:04.740
Well, they want to consolidate.

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:07.920
They probably already
have a small lab perhaps.

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:12.530
They have already a number
of serious publications.

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:15.950
And they have between 7 and
12 years after their PhD.

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:19.600
And then finally, we
have the Advanced Grants,

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:24.370
which are far much more senior
researchers who want to come

00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:28.970
and spend some time in-- who want
to develop a research program

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:31.910
in Europe, set up a lab
or a research group.

00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:34.710
It doesn't have to be a lab, of
course it can be a research group.

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:37.890
And there also, you can see
that it's very generous.

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:40.590
And you can see that they're very
generous grants for individuals.

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:43.450
And the idea is that they
set up a research group.

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:47.240
Now, I said they have to spend at
least 50% of their time in Europe,

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:50.460
generally the starting grants will
spend most of their time in Europe.

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:53.240
If you're going to set up your
own lab for the first time,

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.010
you're not only going
their part time.

00:42:55.010 --> 00:43:01.140
But it's very interesting for a
consolidator or in advanced grant

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:05.370
to know that you don't have to
spend all of your time in Europe.

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:09.140
So therefore, if you have a
position here at a university

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:13.610
and that university allows you
to, you can go and, you know,

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:16.580
open a new lab or set up
a new group in Europe.

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:18.790
And in particular, the
advanced grants you only need

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:22.070
to just spend 30% of
your time in Europe.

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:23.680
What's also interesting
I would like to say

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:27.860
about this European Research
Council grants is that of course,

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:30.680
once you set up your research
group or once the person

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:35.290
who was selected sets up their
research group, they can have--

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:38.180
they can staff their
group with researchers

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:40.010
from anywhere in the world.

00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:42.450
So this is also an
interesting opportunity.

00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:44.140
They have to publish
all of those posts.

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:45.790
Well, they publish
most of those posts

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:47.880
and those posts are all advertised.

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:52.760
So a person who is interested
in coming to Europe to work

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:57.680
in cultural heritage could
for example apply for a grant,

00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:01.700
which is very prestigious
if you are selected.

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:05.910
But there's also the option to
look at posts that are published

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:09.090
in the research groups of people
who have already gotten a grant.

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:10.390
So therefore all you
have to do is apply

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:12.450
for a job rather than
apply for a grant.

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:14.290
So this is also an option.

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:16.530
And I would specifically
like to mention that all

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:23.530
of the European Research Council
grantees also have the possibility

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:30.570
to host a temporary, on a temporary
basis from maybe three months

00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:33.950
to nine moths, an NSF-founded
career grantee.

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:36.200
Because there's a special
implementing arrangement

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:38.090
between the National
Science Foundation

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:42.130
and the European Research
Council, which allows--

00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:47.890
so the NSF continues to support
the US researcher and the--

00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:51.000
and pay their travel to Europe.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.780
And the European Research
Council grantee--

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:58.550
investigator supports them
while they're in Europe.

00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:03.230
So you know, give some daily
allowance, so to speak.

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:05.470
So I just wanted to talk
there about the opportunities

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:09.260
that the European Research
Council offers.

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:13.490
There's also another
opportunity for individuals,

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:15.290
which is the Marie
Curie Fellowships.

00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:23.310
The Marie Curie Fellowships we tend
to say are more on-- more upstream.

00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:26.380 position:56%
So therefore, they tend to be people
who are just going to do a postdoc.

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:29.040
If you are applying for a Marie
Curie Fellowship, you wouldn't be

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:31.970
at the same stage as if you
were applying for an ERC grant.

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:37.700
But a Marie Curie Fellowship,
again, very well paid.

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:39.930
It's a job.

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:42.550
It's not just a grant.

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:46.230
And these fellowships are
interesting and I don't have a lot

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:48.220
of time, so I won't spend
a lot of time on it.

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:51.230
But the Marie Curie Fellowships
are very interesting firstly

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:56.830
because anybody in the
United States can apply

00:45:56.830 --> 00:46:01.020
for a Marie Curie Fellowship
to go and work in Europe.

00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:04.000
So, if for example, you hear
in the next couple of days

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.140
about some wonderful projects
that would be able to host you

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:12.840
as an American, you can apply for
the Marie Curie Fellowship to come

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:17.430
to Europe for two years, and
you would get paid for that.

00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:20.670
Also you get traveling allowance,
you get language training.

00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:22.990
So it's very, very--
they're very nice.

00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:25.200
It's a very nice scheme.

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:28.910
Also very interestingly, it
works in the opposite direction.

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:31.370
So if there's a European who
is interested to come to work

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:35.100
in the United States in perhaps
one of your groups for a while,

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:38.740
they have the opportunity to apply
for a Marie Curie Fellowship also

00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:40.320
to go to the United States.

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.860
Well, they can go anywhere in
the world, but since I'm here

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:44.730
in America, I'm going to
talk about the opportunity

00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:46.120
to come to the United States.

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:48.850 position:56%
So therefore this is also
something that's interesting for you

00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:52.640 position:56%
to be aware of, if for example you
have a European who is saying, "God,

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:55.290
I really like to come
but I don't know how I"--

00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:57.660
you don't maybe have
the funding for them.

00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:59.060
It's really interesting
because basically

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:03.390
for the American side,
it's a free postdoc.

00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:06.740
For the European side,
what's very interesting is

00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:09.410
that the European postdoc who
gets the opportunity to come

00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:12.720
to America must return to
Europe for at least one year.

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.780
So therefore, Europe
benefits also from what

00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:16.890
that person learns
in the United States.

00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:19.690
So it's really a win-win situation.

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:26.900
Well, I think I touched
on this a little bit.

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:30.300
Why would American researchers
be interested to participate

00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:32.350
in Horizon 2020 project,

00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:34.390
particularly in the
collaborative research projects?

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:38.280 position:56%
Obviously, there's the access to
expertise, equipment and facilities,

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.720
economies of scale and
scope when you're dealing

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:44.860
with very large projects,
increased research quality,

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:50.150 position:56%
greater impact efficiency and speed,
developing networks and alliances

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:54.640
which of course we all know in
science is very, very important.

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:57.850
Career development opportunities
such as those of the ERC

00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:00.120
and Marie Curie, which
I just mentioned to you.

00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:03.000
And eventually business and
commercialization opportunities

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:08.450
because if you work together and
develop a new means, for example,

00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:12.130
of preserving some particular
type of cultural heritage,

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:14.300
well maybe it's something
that can be sold to museums

00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:16.920
around the world, for example.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.970
So I think I've gone through
the participation possibilities

00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:26.810
as ERC grantees, as
Marie Curie Fellowships,

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:28.550
collaborative research projects.

00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:33.790
And I also mentioned that
for US partners generally,

00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:36.780
funding is not available,

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:42.010
but nevertheless there
are a lot of advantages.

00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:44.920
Oops, I also briefly touched
on the rules for participation.

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:47.940
There have to be at least
three European parties

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:49.710 position:56%
in a collaborative research project.

00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:51.420
In the collaborative
research project.

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:56.120
Of course, for the Marie Curie
Fellowships, all you need in order

00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:57.990
to apply for Marie Curie
Fellowship is you need

00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:01.520
to have a really good project
idea and a host institution,

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:04.500
whether you're going to Europe
or going to the United States.

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:07.390
And of course, these are
all very competitive.

00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:09.860
But nevertheless, as
we say in Ireland,

00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:11.160
if you're not in, you can't in.

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:15.210 position:56%
So therefore you have to, you know,
put your research projects together.

00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:19.010
And likewise with the European
Research Council, again,

00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:24.250
those grants are aimed at
individuals, individuals out of--

00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:31.280
who are really the-- on the
cutting edge of the research

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:33.940
in their area, whatever it is.

00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:38.100 position:56%
And those research project also what
you need is a brilliant research

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:43.570
idea evidence that you're
able to carry it out

00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:46.650
and a host institution
that's willing to host you.

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:52.680
I think I can honestly say that
for anybody interested in coming

00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:56.550
in to Europe for-- within ERC
grant or a Marie Curie Fellowship,

00:49:56.550 --> 00:50:00.660
I think most European institutes
would be very happy to host,

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:04.190
obviously if it's within
their research program.

00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:08.350
But also because these
grants are prestigious

00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:10.760
for the European hosting
institution also.

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:14.940
And of course they get overheads,
so that's also interesting.

00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:20.500
So, of course, the
evaluation criteria are

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:25.870 position:56%
for collaborative research projects,
excellence, impact and the quality

00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:28.840
and efficiency of the action.

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:35.120
For the European Research Council
grants, there's only one criterion

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:38.110
and that's research excellence.

00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:39.690
But for the collaborative
research grants,

00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:44.060
there were three standard
award criteria.

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:51.720 position:56%
So, I'll finish on this, which is
an advert for the participant portal

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:54.140
where you be able to find a
lot more detail on everything

00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:56.990
that I briefly touched
on this morning.

00:50:56.990 --> 00:51:02.200
The topics that are open for
research proposals at the moment,

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:04.220
documents explaining
how to apply the rules

00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:07.950
for participation an
online manual and how

00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:10.940 position:56%
to submit a proposal electronically.

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:13.840
There's one other thing that I
would like to mention, however,

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:18.710
which is that all of these
project proposals that we get

00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:20.590
at the European level
and we get a lot.

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:22.200
You can imagine thousands
every year.

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:25.030
It's like any funding agency here.

00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:28.090
They all have to be evaluated.

00:51:28.090 --> 00:51:33.410 position:56%
And the European Union is always
very interested in having evaluators

00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:38.580
from across the world to insure
an international standards

00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:41.310
to the research that we're
funding but also to, you know,

00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:45.350
have an outsider's view on the type
of research that we're funding.

00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:48.680
So, also on the participant's
portal, you will find a link

00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:50.630
to how to become an evaluator.

00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:54.150
And we always encourage
people who might be interested

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:56.380
to consider becoming an evaluator.

00:51:56.380 --> 00:52:00.580
The evaluators for Horizon
2020 projects are paid

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:02.440
for the collaborative
research projects,

00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:07.940
so therefore there's a-- it's paid.

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:10.670
The first stage of the
evaluation is remote,

00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:13.340
so therefore you would simply
receive the projects electronically

00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:14.760
at home to evaluate.

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:20.490
On the second part is a
panel discussion in Brussels

00:52:20.490 --> 00:52:24.730
to rank the successful proposals.

00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:26.970
So, therefore, I just
to say to encourage you

00:52:26.970 --> 00:52:29.290
to consider becoming
an evaluator also.

00:52:29.290 --> 00:52:35.070
It's also a very good way to learn
what makes a successful project.

00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:37.870
So, with all of that, I would
like to thank you very much

00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:41.090
for your attention and encourage
you to consider Horizon 2020

00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:44.620
when you're looking at your
next research projects.

00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:46.510
Thank you very much.

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:51.950
[ Applause ]

00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:54.570
&gt;&gt; Giulio Busulini: So I will
replace Fenella just very briefly.

00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:57.830 position:56%
I'm Giulio Busulini, one of the
science attaché at Embassy of Italy.

00:52:57.830 --> 00:53:00.600
So this session is
open to questions.

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:04.140
And if there are anyone is
willing to raise their hands,

00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:06.970
we can maybe pick up
a question from him.

00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:09.110
We're using this microphone.

00:53:09.110 --> 00:53:11.370
In the meantime, I have
a question for Mary.

00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:14.580
I mean, I really appreciate
your spectrum overview

00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:16.320
about the Horizon 2020.

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:22.050
Can you maybe explain more details
in relation to the collaboration

00:53:22.050 --> 00:53:26.740
between Italy-- sorry,
between US and Europe?

00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:29.180
What have been signed
between [inaudible] State

00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:31.580
and the European Commission in the
last few months, because I think

00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:34.300
that is something that
really opened the opportunity

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:38.520
to leverage both funding on
both sides of the Atlantic.

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:41.220
So if you can just say a few
words, we really appreciate it.

00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:42.520
Thank you.

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:43.820
&gt;&gt; Mary Kavanagh: OK.

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:46.120
Thank you, thank you
for raising that.

00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:53.510
An American entity or an American
institution can participate

00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:58.840
in Horizon 2020 in a collaborative
project in a number of ways.

00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:03.300
The most common way is to
become a full participant,

00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:08.380
that is to be in the project
proposal from the very beginning,

00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:11.610
have the proposal selected and
to sign the grant agreement,

00:54:11.610 --> 00:54:15.380
even if you're not getting funding.

00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:18.320
So, it always sounds funny that
you've signed the grant agreement

00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:19.720
without getting any funding.

00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:22.380
But the grant agreement
is, I suppose, only a term

00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:23.990
but it's the contract that we have

00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:26.930
that the research we're
funding will be carried out.

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:31.060 position:56%
So this is the most basic way and
the most common way of participating

00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:35.110
in Horizon 2020 project for
an American institution.

00:54:35.110 --> 00:54:39.310
And there's also a
possibility to participate

00:54:39.310 --> 00:54:42.020
as what we call a third party.

00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:47.440
Sometimes an institution-- an
American institution for example,

00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:51.900
will carry out a particular
discreet piece of work for one

00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:53.970
of the European partners.

00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:56.130
And this can be funded or unfunded.

00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:58.490
So in a way, it's a little
bit like a subcontract

00:54:58.490 --> 00:55:03.020
that an American partner will
get but strongly linked to one

00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:04.480
of the European partners.

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:08.010
So that European-- so then the
American partner does not have

00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:10.560
to sign the grant agreement
because it's the European partner

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:16.390
who signs the grant agreement
and so as well, we're outsourcing

00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:19.620
that piece of work to
an American partner

00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:22.830
but we are responsible
that the work is done.

00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:27.520
Now, those were the two options
up until recently because, well,

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:29.410
those were the two
options that existed.

00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:34.410
But there was a problem
because some US institutions,

00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:39.460
particularly federal research
institutions like NOAA for example,

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:43.510
but also some universities,
had a problem.

00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:45.770
They had a problem with signing
the grant agreement and they said,

00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:47.490
listen, we really want to
collaborate with Europe.

00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:51.090
We see all of the advantages, but
we cannot sign the grant agreement

00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:54.220
because the grant agreement is--

00:55:55.530 --> 00:55:57.620
because we're not receiving
any funding.

00:55:57.620 --> 00:56:01.710
The grant agreement is too heavy
a document for us to sign as to.

00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:05.610
It commits us to too
many legal commitments.

00:56:05.610 --> 00:56:07.910
This is only in some cases.

00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:11.480
Many university sign without
any problem because they don't--

00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:13.310
they just don't have that problem.

00:56:13.310 --> 00:56:18.460
So therefore, in order
to relieve that problem,

00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:21.400
the United States Department
of State

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:26.150
and the European Commission
worked on finding a solution.

00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:29.040
And the work to find the
solution took a long time.

00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:33.320
The solution itself is
supremely simple and elegant,

00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:37.110
and it simply means that
the European project

00:56:37.110 --> 00:56:41.560
and the American partner
can simply--

00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:43.620
once the European has
the European funding

00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:45.870
and once the American
has the American funding,

00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:48.260
they can collaborate together
without anybody having

00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:50.330
to sign anybody else's
grant agreement.

00:56:50.330 --> 00:56:54.350
So therefore, what it basically
means is that the European project,

00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:58.250
Horizon 2020, even if it knows
from the beginning that it's going

00:56:58.250 --> 00:57:01.720
to have-- that is going to work
together with an American partner,

00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:06.130
doesn't even have to
mention the American entity

00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:08.510
in the research proposal.

00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:12.930
The American partner likewise,
you know, request its own funding

00:57:12.930 --> 00:57:15.350
from its own national
funding mechanism.

00:57:15.350 --> 00:57:16.790
And only at the end,
they come together

00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:20.720
and they decide themselves the
extent of their collaboration

00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:24.390
and they decide amongst themselves
the extent of the sharing

00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:27.260
of resources, the sharing
of knowledge.

00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:30.740
And this was considered to be the
easiest because those who want

00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:33.580
to collaborate very deeply
can collaborate very deeply.

00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:37.390
It's entirely up to
the funded projects.

00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:42.190
And those who want only a
lighter form of cooperation maybe

00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:45.050
within occasional workshop together
or something can do it that way.

00:57:45.050 --> 00:57:46.350
But it's entirely up to them.

00:57:46.350 --> 00:57:49.850
So therefore, it leaves a lot of
liberty to the research projects.

00:57:49.850 --> 00:57:54.400
And it relieves a US partner of
having to sign a grant agreement

00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:58.410
if their university
regulations are--

00:57:58.410 --> 00:58:00.830
federal regulations don't allow it.

00:58:00.830 --> 00:58:02.130
So, thank you.

00:58:02.130 --> 00:58:04.730
That's basically in a nutshell
what the new implementing

00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:06.030
arrangement does.

00:58:06.030 --> 00:58:07.330
&gt;&gt; Giulio Busulini: In my opinion,

00:58:07.330 --> 00:58:09.280
and just to leave the floor
also, Fenella just came back.

00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:12.440
To strategize a little bit better
from the funding perspective

00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:16.500
so that we are able define together
new fund scheme that allowed

00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:19.180
to have not any barriers from
the consortium agreement,

00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:22.840
on the grant agreement
that kind of impediment

00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:26.270
and facilitate the research
dialogue in a more proactive way.

00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:29.760
So, that is the thing that the
goal of the discussion today.

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:33.810
We try to identify how we can
leverage our European scheme

00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:36.250
in a more proactive
way with the US, one,

00:58:36.250 --> 00:58:38.950
and see how we can use
also the opportunity

00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:42.970
of the research infrastructure
commitment that we have on Europe

00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:46.550
in a more interest and
proactive in the next future.

00:58:46.550 --> 00:58:49.140
So I leave the floor to
Fenella who just came back.

00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:50.520
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: Can
you please join with me

00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:52.510
in thanking our speakers.

00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:58.810
[ Applause ]

00:58:58.810 --> 00:59:03.390
So we're going to move forward now
and moving now to sort of looking

00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:07.530
at the landscape of heritage
science in the US and Europe.

00:59:07.530 --> 00:59:11.540
And I think it's very interesting
for us, particularly here in the US

00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:14.370
because there is so many
wonderful initiatives.

00:59:14.370 --> 00:59:17.730
And as you've heard from Mary
and Riccardo, just the difference

00:59:17.730 --> 00:59:19.310
in the way projects are funded

00:59:19.310 --> 00:59:22.470
and the collaboration is
a very different focus.

00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:25.440
So, I'd like to introduce
Monique Bossi,

00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:27.510
who is the Italian
National Contact Point

00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:29.550
for research infrastructures
for APRE.

00:59:29.550 --> 00:59:32.430
And so I'm going to ask
you to come forward.

00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:36.270
And we also have Luca Pezzati on
my left, who you've already heard,

00:59:36.270 --> 00:59:40.630
who is the coordinator of IPERION
CH, the National Research Council

00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:44.770
of Italy and Odile Madden from
Research Scientist and head

00:59:44.770 --> 00:59:46.070
of modern materials research

00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:48.950
at the Smithsonian Institution
Conservation Institute.

00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:54.000
And between them, they will be
talking about differences and foci

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.320
on particular projects
and initiatives

00:59:56.320 --> 01:00:00.040
in both the US and America.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.390
&gt;&gt; Monique Bossi: OK.

01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:02.690
Thank you.

01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:04.560
Thank you Fenella.

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:09.300
OK. So I think we are all
very pleased to be here today.

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:13.420
For us, it's a big
privilege and we are happy

01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:16.090
to share with you this session.

01:00:16.090 --> 01:00:20.560
We are now moving from a
general let's say introduction

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:24.540
that any way we deem necessary
to set the frame a little bit

01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:26.300
of the aim of the discussion today.

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:29.980
And as I said, we are moving
towards a more concrete part

01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:31.320
of the discussion.

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:35.280
And in particular, we will now
try to landscape what's going

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:39.520
on in Europe and in the
US with specific respect

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:43.640
of research infrastructures in
the science heritage domain--

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:47.530
in the heritage science
domain, sorry.

01:00:47.530 --> 01:00:54.170
So just one word about what we
mean by research infrastructures.

01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:56.640
Research infrastructures
under the frame

01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.560 position:56%
of the discussion today is continued
to be any type of facility,

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:04.850
any type of support, any
type of piece of equipment

01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:08.250
that can help any type of
researchers for whatever field

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:10.280
to perform their activity.

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:12.680
They can be single sided,
they can be distributed,

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:17.270
they can be physical, virtual,
whatever type of support as far

01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:23.340 position:56%
as it is accessible from researchers
from outside the institution, so--

01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:26.790
that owns the facility of course.

01:01:26.790 --> 01:01:29.520
So as you can see, when
it's a broad spectrum

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:33.360
of possibilities we are
varying some examples today.

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:38.700
We will have an insight
of which type

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:41.910
of infrastructures are
available now in Europe.

01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:45.490
And as we said, because the
program is open to the world,

01:01:45.490 --> 01:01:49.610
all these facilities are open to
US researchers that might need

01:01:49.610 --> 01:01:52.120
to access them to perform
their research

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:55.760
and continue their activity.

01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:00.980
So the session actually structure
on four different interventions.

01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:03.990 position:56%
So we were having first Luca Pezzati

01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:06.400
from the National Council
of Research.

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:11.360
He will present what has been done
so far and the path that we have--

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:16.200
that we went through so
far in the specific field

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:19.070
of research infrastructure
for the cultural heritage.

01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:23.740
And also will picture a
little bit where we're going.

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.910
Some have been already
said by Professor Pozzo.

01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:27.850
But we would have now
some more detailed

01:02:27.850 --> 01:02:31.910
and practical information
on the way forward.

01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:34.910
And then Odile will
picture as well this--

01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:40.980 position:56%
I mean, will try to picture the same
frame for what's going on in the US.

01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:45.560
That's the basic aim of the agenda,
the basic concept of the agenda,

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:51.020
to have always a comparison between
the European and the US landscape

01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:54.980
or opportunities so that at the
end of these two days symposium,

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:59.910 position:56%
we can really have clear picture and
ideas of which are the possibilities

01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:04.590
and opportunities for both
part of the ocean to cooperate

01:03:04.590 --> 01:03:10.850 position:56%
and to go farther in the scientific
and innovational-related activities.

01:03:10.850 --> 01:03:15.240
After, we would have a short
break and after that, we come back

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:17.530
and we have these two
second presentations

01:03:17.530 --> 01:03:22.110
and in particular Mr. Jan
van't Hof from the Netherlands

01:03:22.110 --> 01:03:23.460
from the Minister of Health

01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:27.850
in Netherlands will continue
presenting another initiative,

01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:29.150
which is the joint program

01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:32.030
in initiative funded
by European Commission.

01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:35.740
And then there is a change in
their agenda as you can see,

01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:39.530
Elizabeth Tran cannot
be here with us today.

01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:44.000
But Ms. Jong-on Hahm, we
thank her, accepted to replace

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.240
and she will give a little
bit of insight of what's going

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:52.960
on for the transatlantic platform
for social science and humanities.

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:56.110
Well, thank you Jong-on
for your ability.

01:03:56.110 --> 01:04:00.990
I think we can start as we are
a little bit behind schedule.

01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:05.060
So thank you Luca for
your presentation.

01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:08.100
&gt;&gt; Luca Pezzati: Thank you Monique.

01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:10.450
And which is the microphone?

01:04:10.450 --> 01:04:16.240
This one? And thank you Riccardo
for having a quick landscaping

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:20.420
of the social and cultural
innovation domain

01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:24.410
in the ESFRI roadmap in Europe.

01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:28.210
So it seems that I am
left with the details.

01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:33.720
Details, details.

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:40.970
We had these very long
initiative stepping back

01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:43.110
from Framework Program 5.

01:04:43.110 --> 01:04:46.820
So we are speaking of 15
years ago, more than 15.

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:50.810 position:56%
When we started the collaboration to
European level in cultural heritage,

01:04:50.810 --> 01:04:54.550
this is the stream of projects
that have been financed

01:04:54.550 --> 01:04:58.030
by the European Commission,
trying to integrate

01:04:58.030 --> 01:05:00.960
in European research infrastructure
for cultural heritage.

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:05.870
The last one in this stream of
project is the project IPERION CH,

01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:13.230
which organized jointly with the
American institution involved

01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:16.620
that they have today here.

01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:21.480
But we didn't stop with
the IPERION CH project.

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:26.100
So I need to show you
what happened after it.

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:31.770
IPERION CH project was an
improvement, the third improvement

01:05:31.770 --> 01:05:36.840
to this community and
included an American partner.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:40.530
We have the pleasure of having here
is the [inaudible] Conservation

01:05:40.530 --> 01:05:44.480
Institute in the partnership
that's covering 13 states,

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:50.120
12 states in Europe
and one here at the US.

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:53.110
The project is an integrating
activity

01:05:53.110 --> 01:05:55.850
that is the technical
name in Europe.

01:05:55.850 --> 01:06:00.740
The grant is 8 million and we
are now approaching the midterm.

01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:04.980
The midterm meeting will
be [inaudible] in May.

01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:10.040
So we still have two and a
half years of this initiative.

01:06:11.370 --> 01:06:14.590
And the initiative is quite
big because we have a lot

01:06:14.590 --> 01:06:20.740
of research groups involved now
in this research infrastructure.

01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:24.870
Monique is playing the-- well,
this, the concept more or less

01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:26.790
of research infrastructure
in Europe.

01:06:26.790 --> 01:06:31.450
I will try to explain what
this project is doing actually.

01:06:31.450 --> 01:06:38.620
Because the main activities of
the project providing services

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:40.670
as a research infrastructure.

01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:42.990
And I will show you the services.

01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:50.240
Then the idea underneath the
proposal of IPERION CH was to try

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:54.520
to structure something
more long term, let's say,

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:59.290
because as you may know, projects
are short term by nature and also

01:06:59.290 --> 01:07:03.860
in this case, we have
initiatives that can last three

01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:07.020
to five years, no more than that.

01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:09.760
So the idea was to try to start

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:14.350
to kick off a permanent
research infrastructure dealing

01:07:14.350 --> 01:07:17.100
with cultural heritage in Europe,

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:23.970
thus trying to help the
scientific community using it.

01:07:23.970 --> 01:07:28.930
And this started considering
conservation or restoration,

01:07:28.930 --> 01:07:32.300
so strictly speaking cultural
heritage issues in Europe.

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:36.290
But very soon we realize
that the horizon

01:07:36.290 --> 01:07:39.910
of this should have
been more inclusive.

01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:42.620
And so we finally decided to apply

01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:45.560
for a research infrastructure
covering the needs

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:51.920
of the wider community of
heritage science, whatever it is.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:55.840
By the way, the main activities
of an integrating project,

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:59.800
integrating activity
are of three natures.

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:05.260
The first is providing services and
we call that transnational access.

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:09.620
So the infrastructure is
providing services to research.

01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:14.000
The second activity is
upgrading these services

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.380
by doing joint research altogether.

01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:24.990
The third, but not the least
important activity is insuring a

01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:30.300
continuous of networking between
the European facilities providing

01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:31.600
the services.

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:34.770
This is very important
because under the networking,

01:08:34.770 --> 01:08:37.030
you do a lot of things.

01:08:37.030 --> 01:08:39.240
You do the policies
of the infrastructure.

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:40.610
You do the training.

01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:41.910
You do a lot.

01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:43.780
You do-- you organize event,

01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:46.190
international events,
European events.

01:08:46.190 --> 01:08:48.290
So the budget is limited
but the activity

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:50.130
of networking is very important

01:08:50.130 --> 01:08:54.070
because it covers the
assistance that the future needs.

01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:58.990
About the services, the IPERION CH
infrastructure is providing three

01:08:58.990 --> 01:09:02.480
kind of services to research.

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:06.330
The first is having
mobile instruments going

01:09:06.330 --> 01:09:11.890
where the artworks are and
having analytics of diagnostics

01:09:11.890 --> 01:09:15.880
of several impossible kinds
of physical, chemical.

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:21.290
And this is called mobile
laboratory, so MOLAB.

01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:29.650
Then we provide services linked to
access to non-mobile laboratories.

01:09:29.650 --> 01:09:31.500
In the case of IPERION CH,

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:36.810
we only covers access
to landscape facilities.

01:09:36.810 --> 01:09:41.950
It's a [inaudible] room and two
accelerator in the mutual source.

01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:47.950
It is specialized in cultural
heritage applications.

01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:52.870
Then we provide access to archives.

01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:55.500
I use to call them
nondigital archives.

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:58.000
But actually archives are archives

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.040
and they are nondigital
by definition.

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:03.820
We are immersed in this digital
world, so we need to specify

01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:05.530
that these archives are nondigital.

01:10:05.530 --> 01:10:11.860
Archives where scientific documents
are including actually pieces

01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:16.230
of artworks, if you consider
cross-sections for instance

01:10:16.230 --> 01:10:21.710
or you can have samples
of pigments, samples of--

01:10:21.710 --> 01:10:27.210
so real physical object, as well
as non-digitized documentation.

01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:33.540
So currently, we are also
providing travel and accommodation

01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:37.300
for researchers who apply
for going to archives.

01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:45.890
In IPERION, we realized very
keen international interest

01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:51.340
in the initiative and that
is what produced our proposal

01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:56.970
as European infrastructure
with global scope.

01:10:56.970 --> 01:11:01.910
One of the first interests that
we collected, very important,

01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:05.590
is the interest of the
intergovernmental organization,

01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:12.280 position:56%
ICCROM, with who we are
cooperating strictly in these years.

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:17.160
And then here is the landscape,
is what is currently going

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:19.620
on in infrastructure at ESFRI level

01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:22.440
in the social and cultural
innovation.

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:25.130
It explains graphically
what Riccardo was saying.

01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:27.520
We have a cluster of
project PARTHENOS.

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:32.050
We have two ERIC already defined,
two consortia, DARIAH and CLARIN.

01:11:32.050 --> 01:11:33.680
We have one single project.

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:37.930
It's the only one currently in the
roadmap and there it will remain

01:11:37.930 --> 01:11:44.980
until the mid of 2018 with the
next upgrade of the roadmap itself.

01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:50.910
And I have to point out that the
E-RIHS project was the cooperation

01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:54.200
resulting from the cooperation
collaboration of the IPERION CH

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:58.960
who got the initiative of
proposing the E-RIHS but also

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:02.070
with the digital archeology
infrastructure, ARIADNE,

01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:05.010
who agreed to run together with us

01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:07.950
and other national
communities in Europe.

01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:12.450
And so it happened that in
March 2016, so we are speaking

01:12:12.450 --> 01:12:17.210
of nine months ago,
the E-RIHS was included

01:12:17.210 --> 01:12:22.790
in the new strategic roadmap of
research infrastructures in Europe.

01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:25.990
And this is the actual
roadmap already discussed.

01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:32.010
This is very important because
it has became not anymore an

01:12:32.010 --> 01:12:35.790
integrating activity but
actually a strategic project

01:12:35.790 --> 01:12:38.530
of the European Union.

01:12:38.530 --> 01:12:42.640
I don't want to discuss because
we don't have enough time,

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:44.800
what is heritage science.

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:48.670
Heritage science concept
is open to discussion.

01:12:48.670 --> 01:12:53.840
Very briefly and my mind
is making signs together.

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:56.740
So not anymore science
for conservation,

01:12:56.740 --> 01:13:00.020
not anymore users our museums.

01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:03.110
No, we are all there
together to do science

01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:04.660
for the heritage preservation.

01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:09.780
That is my concept in general
lines, where general lines.

01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:13.470 position:56%
And so we define this
infrastructure with the specific aim

01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:16.110
to support the heritage
science community.

01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:20.870
And I must say that probably the
infrastructure will be first.

01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:23.680
And then the heritage
science community,

01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:28.050
because we are still discussing
in several countries about how

01:13:28.050 --> 01:13:34.380 position:56%
to define the real borders, the real
extension of what we have in mind.

01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:37.770
And we need to know that because
we need to organize the services

01:13:37.770 --> 01:13:40.620
of the big infrastructure covering
the needs of heritage science.

01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:44.560
So some exercise of analysis
and strategic planning

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:47.150
and the discussion is open.

01:13:47.150 --> 01:13:51.140
What is important this is the most
interdisciplinary infrastructure

01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:52.480
in Europe.

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:55.440
And we have in the
disciplinary in the provision

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:59.680
of services and in the user groups.

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:05.630
What we will need to do
is two difficult things,

01:14:05.630 --> 01:14:08.210
but we need to do them both.

01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:11.300
Otherwise, the infrastructure
will not work.

01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:14.360
We will meet to define
a common approach

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:18.400
to diagnostic methodologies,
analytics.

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:21.320
Otherwise, we will not
have consistent data.

01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:23.290
And so we will not help research.

01:14:23.290 --> 01:14:25.950
We will continue supporting
the fragmentation

01:14:25.950 --> 01:14:28.160
of research in cultural heritage.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:31.660
So we first need to
establish a common approach.

01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:36.760 position:56%
So first in the creation of
practices, best practices in methods

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:39.970
but also in the use of this data.

01:14:39.970 --> 01:14:45.130 position:56%
So we need to define a common data
infrastructure for heritage science.

01:14:45.130 --> 01:14:51.030
I don't know what of these two
things to do is the most difficult.

01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:54.150
But I only know that
we need to do both,

01:14:54.150 --> 01:15:00.300
because my motto is not digital
common data, no infrastructure

01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:05.890
at all due to the complexity
of the scientific landscape

01:15:05.890 --> 01:15:10.900
of institutions involve,
multidisciplinary and all things.

01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:15.350
We actually will need
common platform.

01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:19.640
We will need to the
common data infrastructure.

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:22.670
Otherwise our languages--
we like [inaudible].

01:15:22.670 --> 01:15:26.940
Everybody will speak their own
languages and we will never to get

01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:30.530
to something integrated when
it comes to heritage science.

01:15:30.530 --> 01:15:31.990
So what happened after IPERION?

01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:34.600
What happened after IPERION
is that we propose E-RIHS

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:40.970
and E-RIHS has been supported
initially by 12 European countries

01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:46.210 position:56%
up to the time of submitting the
E-RIHS proposals, so June last year.

01:15:46.210 --> 01:15:50.820
The countries were 16 plus two
ERICs involved, DARIAH ERIC

01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:52.940
and CLARIN ERIC involved.

01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:58.060
And then now we have more
interest at political level for--

01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:01.040
from three more countries
that entered this--

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:08.240
the E-RIHS initiative, that
Austria, Romania and Sweden.

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:14.060
We have also contacts at
scientific level including here

01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:19.980
with several countries ruled the
strongest in non-European network

01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:24.830 position:56%
that we have in this moment is the
Brazilian one, is already structured

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:27.050
in private association

01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:30.840
of laboratories supporting
E-RIHS in Brazil.

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:33.270
What is going to happen?

01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:37.230
This is just a map, a
physical map of this.

01:16:37.230 --> 01:16:39.440
The structure that
we have in mind is--

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:43.850
have a strong central hub and
strong national hubs helping

01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:45.630
to coordinate the services

01:16:45.630 --> 01:16:50.840
of the infrastructure
everywhere it will be established.

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:57.080 position:56%
We added one service platform to
the three already served by IPERION.

01:16:57.080 --> 01:17:02.300
And this service platform will be
DIGILAB and we think that we need

01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:08.050
to have a common platform either
for scientific data sets and tools

01:17:08.050 --> 01:17:13.270
for research as one of the
future services of the E-RIHS.

01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:19.860
So for these two years, we will
continue running the services

01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:21.680
of the IPERION platforms.

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:24.460
And we will try to
establish the fourth one

01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:28.000
that for the moment
is only planning.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:35.730
So these are more or less
examples of just photographs.

01:17:37.230 --> 01:17:43.310
Before I finish and I have seven
minutes, but I can use less.

01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:48.230
I have to say about the
global dimension of E-RIHS

01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:49.570
because it's very important.

01:17:49.570 --> 01:17:52.620
And I think it's important
here, the US,

01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:55.170
for the discussion
that we will have.

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:59.160
I was in Venice six days ago
and I met with the ESFRI chair

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:02.640
that now is an Italian guy.

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.120
So that's not news.

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:08.220
Also the old chair of ESFRI was an
Italian guy, it was Carlo Rizzuto.

01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:12.540
Then we have an English guy for
a couple of years, Womersley.

01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:16.760
And now again, we have Giorgio
Rossi from the University of Milan,

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:18.710
which is the ESFRI chair.

01:18:18.710 --> 01:18:21.810
And I had a discussion with
Giorgio about what will happen

01:18:21.810 --> 01:18:24.820
at global level with E-RIHS.

01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:27.110
There are very nice news.

01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:31.380
The first news is that in
March there will be the G7

01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:34.010
of science in Italy.

01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:37.260
And in May, there will be the GSO,

01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:43.760
Group of Senior Official meeting
including the G7 and plus 5.

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:47.680
So the full group of
senior officials dealing

01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:52.330
with global school
research infrastructures.

01:18:52.330 --> 01:18:57.980
And Giorgio will be the
next president of the GSO.

01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:04.280
So it will be both enforced
as ESFRI chair from mid-2017

01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:06.650
and president of the GSO.

01:19:06.650 --> 01:19:12.490
E-RIHS is one of the infrastructure
proposed shortlisted for the list

01:19:12.490 --> 01:19:17.020
of global impact infrastructure
in the GSO list.

01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:20.930
And what are the GSO's
officials-- what are doing now.

01:19:20.930 --> 01:19:26.180 position:56%
They are collecting as presumed of
interest from the countries involved

01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:29.880
within the GSO that are simply 13.

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.080
But the US is there.

01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:36.310
They are collecting expression of
interest to come to the final list

01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:39.730
of global research
infrastructure to be supported.

01:19:39.730 --> 01:19:42.030
It kind of a planetary
ESFRI roadmap.

01:19:42.030 --> 01:19:44.140
It's a political matter.

01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:48.300
No money implied at least
for the first stage.

01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:52.330
So what is my message that
could be very interesting

01:19:52.330 --> 01:19:58.460
to close these two days of
discussion with a lector

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:03.190
from the American institution
interested in E-RIHS

01:20:03.190 --> 01:20:07.620
to your American delegates
in the GSO.

01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:08.940
They are two.

01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:11.490
Now, I have the names
but I don't know

01:20:11.490 --> 01:20:17.180 position:56%
if the two will be the same much for
obvious reason that you can guess.

01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:21.180
Anyway, you will know who these
two will be before the meeting

01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:25.420
in Italy will happen
because it will be very nice

01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:34.670
to have the American expression of
interest for E-RIHS to be included

01:20:34.670 --> 01:20:36.660
in the list of global
infrastructure.

01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:40.640
So I think that after
two days of discussion,

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:44.300
if we can get to a short
letter of that kind,

01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:48.690
it could be very nice closing for
this initiative that we have here.

01:20:48.690 --> 01:20:52.150
Of course, the same is I see a
lot of European colleagues here.

01:20:52.150 --> 01:20:57.650
The same holds also for France,
for all the European countries

01:20:57.650 --> 01:21:01.310
which have representatives
in the G7.

01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:04.530
Or for the let's say not at all--

01:21:04.530 --> 01:21:07.250
not yet, non-European
countries in the G7.

01:21:07.250 --> 01:21:08.910
I see Joseph, he's there.

01:21:08.910 --> 01:21:13.120
So, we will-- by the way G7,
you know, it covers still UK.

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:18.330
The position of UK would
be very, very important.

01:21:18.330 --> 01:21:22.060
So, if you simply-- even me, I
can provide you with the names

01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:26.040 position:56%
of the GSO contacts in your country.

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:28.540
It will be very, very
important if next year,

01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:33.060
E-RIHS collect several
expression of interest from the--

01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:38.960
this very small group of people
so that we can continue the road

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.380 position:56%
to globalization in a certain sense.

01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:45.090
ICCROM is very interested
in supporting us,

01:21:45.090 --> 01:21:49.230
and the idea that we have is while
we establish E-RIHS in Europe

01:21:49.230 --> 01:21:52.600
in these five years that
Riccardo cited this morning.

01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:57.820
At the same time, we work to
establish RIHS at global level.

01:21:57.820 --> 01:22:02.330
So at global level in
heritage science infrastructure

01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:07.380
in which we will need help
because establishing a global,

01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:09.860
legal figure is not very easy

01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:12.550
in international research
infrastructure.

01:22:12.550 --> 01:22:15.800
So we need to decide
a lot of things.

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:19.690
We need to see if there is
a real commitment and from

01:22:19.690 --> 01:22:27.010
which countries this could be
issued towards this achievement

01:22:27.010 --> 01:22:31.450
that of course will greatly help
the two points in the mission

01:22:31.450 --> 01:22:33.040
that I was presenting before.

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:40.740 position:56%
Because if we are capable of
organizing of reaching harmonization

01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:44.620
in methodologies, its
European level, it's one thing.

01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:48.780
If we can see to have a
harmonization of diagnostics

01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:51.440
and on the use of digital
at the global level,

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:54.670
these will be much,
much more interesting.

01:22:54.670 --> 01:22:59.930
So with this, I save the one
minute probably and I can leave you

01:22:59.930 --> 01:23:02.510
and thank you for your attention.

01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:05.260
[ Applause ]

01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:10.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Monique Rossi: So now we continue
with our landscaping exercise.

01:23:10.230 --> 01:23:13.920
And we have the pleasure to
have here Mr. Jan van't Hof,

01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:17.010
from the Dutch Minister of Culture.

01:23:17.010 --> 01:23:21.390
And he is presenting now another
initiative that has been funded

01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:25.060
by the European Commission, which
is called The Joint Programming

01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:30.400
Initiative for Cultural Heritage.

01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:33.530
So, and here we would have the
possibility to see another type

01:23:33.530 --> 01:23:36.430
of approach from the
European Commission side,

01:23:36.430 --> 01:23:41.610
which is not funding activities,
but funding, funding activities.

01:23:41.610 --> 01:23:44.460
So it's a different scope
but it's very well placed

01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:47.030
in the frame of our
discussion today.

01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:49.380
So. Mr. Jan van't Hof, please.

01:23:54.410 --> 01:23:56.710
&gt;&gt; Jan van't Hof: Thank
you very much.

01:24:02.170 --> 01:24:06.740
So thank you very much
for the introduction.

01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:10.330
Am I to be heard by
everybody or should I-- yes?

01:24:10.330 --> 01:24:13.020
So I don't have to adjust it.

01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:16.540
So in-- like it was said, my
name is Jan van't Hof and I'm

01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:19.640
from the Dutch Cultural
Heritage Agency

01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:21.890
and a part of the Ministry Culture.

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:25.100
And like a former speaker
said, while there are introvert

01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:31.600 position:56%
and extrovert people around and
well [inaudible] whether you find me

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:35.540
after this presentation
introvert or an extrovert person

01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:43.140
and I will be glad to hear
your remarks during the break.

01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:47.920
So, since I know some of
you, but not at all of you,

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:50.890
I thought I might give a very
short introduction about myself.

01:24:50.890 --> 01:24:54.990
So I also trained at Leiden
University as an art historian,

01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:57.420
and at the moment I'm
head of department

01:24:57.420 --> 01:25:00.700
at their Cultural Heritage Agency.

01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:04.130
And I'm board member of
various European initiatives

01:25:04.130 --> 01:25:08.410
like the JPI, IPERION
and also E-RIHS.

01:25:08.410 --> 01:25:13.450 position:56%
And my specialties are not in
chemistry or [inaudible] but really,

01:25:13.450 --> 01:25:20.830
art historian, sort of studies
like the art of collecting,

01:25:20.830 --> 01:25:22.130
the art of natural stone,

01:25:22.130 --> 01:25:26.990
and all kinds of conservation
and heritage issues.

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:34.980
So, about our agency, like I said
we are a part of the Ministry

01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:40.750 position:56%
of Education of Science and Culture.

01:25:40.750 --> 01:25:45.360
And we have some facilities
in Amsterdam

01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:48.000 position:56%
and our main premises in Amersfoort.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.410
But we have laboratories in both,

01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:59.910
350 fte's so we are
middle-sized agency.

01:25:59.910 --> 01:26:01.700
And we have a lot of
various functions.

01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:09.360 position:56%
So we give grants, we lease
buildings, we do research, and well,

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:15.510
among us are several
university professors

01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:19.410
like Klaas Jan van den Berg,
who is present at the moment.

01:26:19.410 --> 01:26:23.240
And we also-- and I will want to
conclude at the end of next version

01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:25.670
of my presentation which
will be on the internet.

01:26:25.670 --> 01:26:31.560
We also maintain a unique
collection of reference materials,

01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:37.350
which is especially interesting
of course for the data approach.

01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:40.400
We are having today.

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:44.100
We are also partner in
the Netherlands Institute

01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:49.210
for Conservation Art and
Science, also known as NICAS,

01:26:49.210 --> 01:26:52.080 position:56%
which is chaired by the Rijksmuseum.

01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:55.760
And I would also like to state

01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:59.250
and if you were today the Dutch
government recently has adapted a

01:26:59.250 --> 01:27:02.860
very specific attention
to open science.

01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:08.800
So whereas up until now,
also regard is important.

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:12.980
As from this year on open
science will be paramount

01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:19.180
for all research being funded
by the Dutch government.

01:27:20.670 --> 01:27:28.110
Just a very quick insight into
Dutch heritage since I'm talking

01:27:28.110 --> 01:27:31.630
about the JPI, but also
as a Dutch representative,

01:27:31.630 --> 01:27:37.690
so I will have some
pictures of on the left,

01:27:37.690 --> 01:27:41.240
[inaudible] outside
laboratory for water current

01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:48.440
and the top picture is the
Royal Barge built in 1815.

01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:53.490
And on the right hand side is
the Great Synagogue in Amsterdam,

01:27:53.490 --> 01:27:58.370
still in use and still
only lit by candles.

01:27:58.370 --> 01:28:03.580
And we also have of course world
heritage site in the Netherlands

01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:09.470 position:56%
and the center-- the center
picture is a famous modern movement,

01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:14.660
factory in Rotterdam but on
the right and left hand side,

01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:22.120
you see world heritage sites,
hope-- which we hope will be listed

01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:24.190
and they are at the
moment and they--

01:28:24.190 --> 01:28:28.460
I have taken pictures
of both these sites

01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:31.830
because they are not
specifically Dutch sites,

01:28:31.830 --> 01:28:33.460
but because they are
sites which are--

01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:37.230
which will be nominated together
with for instance Belgium

01:28:37.230 --> 01:28:38.580
or for instance with Germany.

01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:42.690
So we are looking cooperation
not only within research,

01:28:42.690 --> 01:28:47.100
but also all kinds
of other initiatives.

01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:52.150
Now this is what you came for,
the joint program initiative.

01:28:52.150 --> 01:28:53.930
And I want to say something
about it.

01:28:53.930 --> 01:28:57.380
That we were established in 2010.

01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:02.220
And I had a very short
dark with the lady

01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:05.940
from [inaudible] commission
during the break,

01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:09.020
we are of course very
glad we were supported

01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:12.530
by the European Commission.

01:29:12.530 --> 01:29:16.500
But I would also like to stress,
we are not a European institution.

01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:18.860
We are an institution
of member states.

01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:22.030
So we are-- go funding from
the European Commission,

01:29:22.030 --> 01:29:26.380
but we are member state driven
so there are seven member states

01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:30.500
within European, who
constitute the board.

01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:34.350
And there are eight associated
countries, from which one,

01:29:34.350 --> 01:29:37.800
Israel is from outside of Europe.

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:41.240 position:56%
And we have of course the various
sets of board, the government board,

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:46.080
executive board, scientific
committee, and then advisory board.

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:50.910
And the second part of the
slide you see, so like I said,

01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:53.960
we were run by member states.

01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:58.750
If we launch calls, we
[inaudible] inform ourselves,

01:29:58.750 --> 01:30:02.430
some calls have a top-up
from the European Commission,

01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:07.330
so under Horizon 2020 or the
following framework programs,

01:30:07.330 --> 01:30:11.920
we get additional funding
from Brussels

01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:16.060
and we are essentially
a research program.

01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:20.340
So we, of course, do care for
advocacy of cultural heritage

01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:27.100
and all the things that
surround research, but mainly,

01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:30.460
we are a research program.

01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:39.140
We are not the only joint
program initiative alive.

01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:40.850
There are 10.

01:30:40.850 --> 01:30:47.650
And there are about-- so
for instance, oceans, water,

01:30:47.650 --> 01:30:53.230
neurodegenerative diseases,
so that's always a mouthful.

01:30:53.230 --> 01:31:01.550
And I have a brochure about what we
are as a set of programs with me.

01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:07.170
So again, during the break, I'll
be happy to share it with you.

01:31:07.170 --> 01:31:12.590
Well, under-- on the slide you
see the team which is working

01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:18.940
on a joint program,
programming initiative.

01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:21.190
Photographed during a
meeting in the Hague

01:31:21.190 --> 01:31:26.150 position:56%
and central is our secretary general
for culture education and science.

01:31:26.150 --> 01:31:34.820
So it is really-- so being
fostered the top level people

01:31:34.820 --> 01:31:37.630
at our ministry.

01:31:37.630 --> 01:31:44.710
I mentioned the member state and
associated countries involved

01:31:44.710 --> 01:31:49.950
and on the left hand side you
see a small map indicating

01:31:49.950 --> 01:31:56.660
which countries are involved
and the faded blue ones are in,

01:31:56.660 --> 01:32:00.850
and the darker blue ones
are observing states.

01:32:00.850 --> 01:32:05.450
So let's give you the pictures
and so almost all of Europe is in

01:32:05.450 --> 01:32:09.720
and of course, we are
striving to get the ones

01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:12.700
who are not fully in also onboard.

01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:17.850
We have-- When we look
at France [inaudible],

01:32:17.850 --> 01:32:22.050
we have a slightly different
approach because we do look

01:32:22.050 --> 01:32:25.210
at all kinds of heritage and
not only the tangible heritage,

01:32:25.210 --> 01:32:28.120
although with the focus on
conservation and restoration

01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:35.730
of monuments or museums, but we
look into all kinds of heritage.

01:32:35.730 --> 01:32:40.920
And so this material,
immaterial and digital heritage.

01:32:44.330 --> 01:32:49.570 position:56%
So like I said, the aim of the joint
program initiative is to foster

01:32:49.570 --> 01:32:53.220 position:56%
and to empower research and for this

01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:59.310
of course we have--
we made some effort.

01:32:59.310 --> 01:33:05.550
And the first one is what do
we want to research in the end.

01:33:05.550 --> 01:33:09.550
And it is in our strategic
research agenda,

01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:15.860
which is also to be
seen on the internet.

01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:20.290
And we have launched several
calls for proposals until now.

01:33:20.290 --> 01:33:24.600
And we have also joint
activities amongst partners.

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:29.740
Because it is fine to do funded
research, but there is a lot

01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:37.230
of knowledge already
present among the partners.

01:33:37.230 --> 01:33:42.710
And why shouldn't we share
that knowledge too and only aim

01:33:42.710 --> 01:33:45.530
at extending knowledge
via new research.

01:33:45.530 --> 01:33:46.860
So via the joint activities,

01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:51.970
we tried to share the
existing knowledge.

01:33:51.970 --> 01:33:56.640
Two calls were launched
nevertheless in 2012 and 2014,

01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:00.070
and we will launch three
next-- sorry , four new goals--

01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:06.510
calls over the next three
years and in the final version

01:34:06.510 --> 01:34:13.160
of my PowerPoint, I will show
the entity exact phrasing

01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:17.730 position:56%
of the upcoming goals, which will be
on digital heritage on conservation

01:34:17.730 --> 01:34:21.300
and restoration on
heritage and perception

01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:24.380
and on changing environments.

01:34:24.380 --> 01:34:32.360
Now just a few more words about
strategic research agenda.

01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:35.900
So we are not only research drive,

01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:40.140
but we are also very much
content driven as a consortium.

01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:43.770
Like I said, member
states do take part,

01:34:43.770 --> 01:34:47.980
but of course several
institutions like ministries

01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:53.660
or funding agencies
constitute the board of the JPI

01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:57.610
to have a very direct contact

01:34:57.610 --> 01:35:01.070
with all the partners
and all the countries.

01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:07.030
The agenda is composed of
four priority areas reflect--

01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:13.280
so developing a reflective society,
connecting people with heritage,

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:20.850
creating knowledge and safeguarding
the cultural heritage resource.

01:35:20.850 --> 01:35:27.700
The agenda was not put
together by the board itself,

01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:33.020
but we consultated [phonetic]
all member states involved

01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:36.980
and what they did was established
a national consultation panel.

01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:39.740
And this proved to be very
interesting opportunity

01:35:39.740 --> 01:35:44.860
within countries to really
set culture heritage research

01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:50.510
on the agenda as something which
is a joint effort within a country

01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:53.170
Because like you saw
in the Netherlands,

01:35:53.170 --> 01:35:57.750
cultural heritage was
established in say about 1870

01:35:57.750 --> 01:36:02.040
as a specific responsibility
of the government.

01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:05.380
But then while there were
some persons and they dealt

01:36:05.380 --> 01:36:07.760
with archeology and
they dealt with archives

01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:15.150
and so the whole world heritage
was present within some people.

01:36:15.150 --> 01:36:21.160
But in 150 years, you have--
the whole field was scattered

01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:24.960
and this national consultation
panel gave us the opportunity

01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:31.300
to bring all those people together
in-- physically in one room.

01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:34.950
And of course, not all of them
but the major representatives

01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:37.310
for the first time in 150 years.

01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:40.720
And this really gave [inaudible]
Netherlands to say, well,

01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:44.060
cultural heritage is
not a scattered field.

01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:45.590
We are in contact.

01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:49.470
We are really working
together on agenda.

01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:52.610
And I think this might
be interesting also.

01:36:52.610 --> 01:36:57.250
Well for instance, in the USA
looking from Europe or looking

01:36:57.250 --> 01:37:00.440
from myself, I always look
at the USA as one country,

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:06.310
but of course like was stated,
in effect is 50 states, and well,

01:37:06.310 --> 01:37:10.500
so perhaps your approach
of bringing people together

01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:11.800
and you might already do.

01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:15.290
So pardon me if I'm not--

01:37:15.290 --> 01:37:19.920
if I am being rude or having
two large [inaudible].

01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:23.040
But it really helps to bring
people together so well we have

01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:25.950
to make one agenda and we
bring all people together

01:37:25.950 --> 01:37:28.410
and it was really stimulating.

01:37:31.690 --> 01:37:33.890
Now the upcoming activities

01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:37.320
like I said were four new
calls for the next years.

01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:41.060 position:56%
We also have to revise our strategic
research agenda because it's

01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:42.860
about five years old now

01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:51.310 position:56%
and although we included a foresight
planning chapter, you see there--

01:37:51.310 --> 01:37:56.390 position:56%
whereas conservation and restoration
are still very important issues,

01:37:56.390 --> 01:38:01.200
you also see the ethical side
of how you look at heritage,

01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:04.960
and how you look at heritage
professionals is getting more

01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:07.660 position:56%
and more impact over the last years.

01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:09.600
And also because of
course in Europe,

01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:13.090
we have had an economic
crisis and we've seem

01:38:13.090 --> 01:38:15.830
to pull ourselves together.

01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:18.410
But within Europe, you also have--

01:38:18.410 --> 01:38:24.020
well, I'm not so strange
with 500 million inhabitants

01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:28.460
but you have very [inaudible]
currents at the moment,

01:38:28.460 --> 01:38:37.370 position:56%
which will need us to reconsider
not only why we do research but also

01:38:37.370 --> 01:38:39.130
in what frame do we do research

01:38:39.130 --> 01:38:41.500
and who do we actually
do the research for.

01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:45.480
So who are for instance
the end-users.

01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:47.920
And we are also at the JPI looking

01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:53.640
at enlarging the partnership
possibly also outside Europe

01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:57.670
and we have set up
a special taskforce

01:38:57.670 --> 01:39:03.170
which Luca knows very
well, Luca Pezzati to for--

01:39:03.170 --> 01:39:07.710
to strengthen the bones between the
joint program branding initiative

01:39:07.710 --> 01:39:13.510
on one side and the
E-RIHS on the other side.

01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:18.900
And anybody who is doing which
work of art you are looking at,

01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:26.150
at the moment at the right
end, it's called [inaudible].

01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:31.150
So how does JPI fit into
the landscape of data

01:39:31.150 --> 01:39:33.240
and research infrastructures.

01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:40.250 position:56%
And for those longing for the next
speaker, this will be my last slide.

01:39:40.250 --> 01:39:42.310
And so on the left hand side,

01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:43.970
of course you see the
joint program initiative.

01:39:43.970 --> 01:39:48.030
On the right hand side,
you see the E-RIHS.

01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:49.740
It is kind of a jigsaw.

01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:56.580
So of course you'll meet each other
on the content, quality systems

01:39:56.580 --> 01:40:01.410
for instance, but basically
the joint program initiative is

01:40:01.410 --> 01:40:05.890
about programming, about financing
and has European outreach,

01:40:05.890 --> 01:40:09.030
and it includes all kinds
of cultural heritage.

01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:17.400 position:56%
Whereas at the moment, E-RIHS, which
is just getting started, we must--

01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:22.170
so we will have our
kickoff meeting next year,

01:40:22.170 --> 01:40:27.850
will be more of a hands-on program.

01:40:29.010 --> 01:40:31.940
It will focus on infrastructure,
so it is--

01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:35.070
so it complements the joint
program initiative on that side

01:40:35.070 --> 01:40:39.130
because we are mainly
ministries and funders,

01:40:39.130 --> 01:40:40.770
whereas that E-RIHS
will be, of course,

01:40:40.770 --> 01:40:43.280
more on the institutional side.

01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:48.270
And of course, E-RIHS
aims at a global outreach.

01:40:48.270 --> 01:40:51.570 position:56%
At the moment, the European
research infrastructure is European,

01:40:51.570 --> 01:40:55.010
but the global outreach
was already mentioned

01:40:55.010 --> 01:41:01.360
and the focus will be mainly on
the material cultural heritage.

01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:04.390 position:56%
So I think we complement each other.

01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:07.630
We have already found each other
and the next years will be--

01:41:07.630 --> 01:41:12.060
well, we will be working
of really joining forces.

01:41:12.060 --> 01:41:13.860
Thank you very much.

01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:17.500
[ Applause ]

01:41:21.630 --> 01:41:22.930
&gt;&gt; Monique Bossi: Thank you Jan.

01:41:22.930 --> 01:41:26.990
We move now to the last, not
presentation but intervention.

01:41:26.990 --> 01:41:30.200 position:56%
As I said earlier on, unfortunately,

01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:35.360
Elizabeth Tran couldn't
be here today.

01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:40.560
So we thank Jong-on Hahm to
take over our intervention.

01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:44.740
Jong-on Hahm is from the
George Washington University.

01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:50.820
As a background, she has
also PhD in neurosciences.

01:41:50.820 --> 01:41:53.360
So, we have now another
type of background.

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:58.060
We had chemistry, we had
material science, art historian

01:41:58.060 --> 01:41:59.840
and now we have neuroscience.

01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:02.160
So a very interesting panel.

01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:03.510
Thank you for this.

01:42:03.510 --> 01:42:08.370 position:56%
And in George Washington University,
she is focusing on global investment

01:42:08.370 --> 01:42:10.360
in science, technology
and engineering and math,

01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:16.120 position:56%
sort of famous STEM that were
mentioned during the opening speech.

01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:21.780
And today, she will present
briefly the European platform,

01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:25.700
the transatlantic platform for
social science and humanities.

01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:29.600
So another European
initiative that try to group

01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:34.150
and to pull together different
countries and initiative.

01:42:34.150 --> 01:42:35.450
Thank you.

01:42:35.450 --> 01:42:36.750
&gt;&gt; Jong-on Hahm: Thank you.

01:42:36.750 --> 01:42:41.940
So first, I'll just like-- what is
an interloping neuroscientist doing

01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:44.410
at a cultural heritage
science meeting?

01:42:44.410 --> 01:42:48.660
I just wanted to say,
Elizabeth couldn't be here

01:42:48.660 --> 01:42:49.960
because she became ill.

01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:52.370
Elizabeth Tran and I were
both program directors

01:42:52.370 --> 01:42:54.330
at the National Science Foundation.

01:42:54.330 --> 01:42:56.290
So when I was at the
National Science Foundation,

01:42:56.290 --> 01:42:58.150
I was in the international
office and part

01:42:58.150 --> 01:43:02.370
of my portfolio was the
country desk for Italy

01:43:02.370 --> 01:43:04.870
and also the European Union.

01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:09.590 position:56%
It is how the state department joint
committee meeting in organizing

01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:12.070
that was the first cultural
heritage working group

01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:14.630
at the GCM, was the US-Italy one.

01:43:14.630 --> 01:43:22.320
So, I'm not going to step in for
Elizabeth, but to give a little--

01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:28.030
the transatlantic partnership
challenge most likely came,

01:43:28.030 --> 01:43:30.330
giving you a perspective
from a funder's perspective.

01:43:30.330 --> 01:43:32.900
We had a great perspective
from Odile.

01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:36.930
She's a researcher, you
know, people in the--

01:43:36.930 --> 01:43:43.180
doing the work, but trying to fund
the work as Riccardo said earlier,

01:43:44.250 --> 01:43:47.620
budgets always seem to
be shrinking constantly.

01:43:47.620 --> 01:43:49.690
There are always cuts.

01:43:49.690 --> 01:43:52.890
We always have to deal
with do more with less.

01:43:52.890 --> 01:43:55.550
And even when they don't shrink,

01:43:55.550 --> 01:44:00.150
because of costs going
up, you can't do as much.

01:44:00.150 --> 01:44:06.680
We used to joke at NSF, the
NSF's budget was supposed

01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:10.720
to have been doubled at least three
times in the past two decades,

01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:13.500
according to authorization
legislation.

01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:14.800
It hasn't.

01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:16.100
It's been flat.

01:44:16.100 --> 01:44:20.670
So, our joke was, flat
is the new doubling

01:44:20.670 --> 01:44:25.140
because at least there's not a cut.

01:44:25.140 --> 01:44:31.320
So, as a funder, you want to
make sure that you're leveraging

01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:33.360
in getting the most
bang for the buck

01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:35.610
because this is all public dollars.

01:44:35.610 --> 01:44:39.180
All return on investment
is great and so--

01:44:39.180 --> 01:44:43.280
and there's a lot of work as you
know, having been probably asked

01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:48.000
to review, you know,
proposals or papers.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.740
So if we could some of the--
streamline some of the same things

01:44:51.740 --> 01:44:54.470
that people are doing because
people are working together,

01:44:54.470 --> 01:45:01.060 position:56%
science is global, you're
publishing in the same journals, so,

01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:07.080
these efforts and I think there
will be more of them, to have not--

01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:09.670
maybe not quite joint
programming initiative,

01:45:09.670 --> 01:45:16.800
but parallel working together
with collaborative connection.

01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:22.950
So that the science moves forward
without every single scientist

01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:27.700
and researcher being forced
to understand the same minutia

01:45:27.700 --> 01:45:30.050
of every single funding agency.

01:45:30.050 --> 01:45:38.280
And so, let me get-- so
transatlantic partnership,

01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:44.890 position:56%
the one I know about most is digging
into data because it was a project

01:45:44.890 --> 01:45:48.560
that was launched I believe at
NSF in the social, behavioral,

01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:50.760
and economic sciences directorate.

01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:55.570
This is essentially to allow
US researchers to collaborate

01:45:55.570 --> 01:45:59.180
with their, at the time,
it was European partners,

01:45:59.180 --> 01:46:04.150
without so much the
funding barriers.

01:46:04.150 --> 01:46:15.350
And what TAP has done, if you look
into the partnership, there are--

01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:19.010
the agency partners are
from all over Europe.

01:46:19.010 --> 01:46:20.310
Let me see.

01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:24.400
Let me pull this up on
my little-- just working.

01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:26.270
So of course you see
Academy of Finland,

01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:31.740 position:56%
Arts and Humanities Research Council
of UK, CONACYT of Chile and CONACYT

01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:42.200 position:56%
of Mexico, DFG Germany, ESRC,
Portugal, CNR France, the French CNR

01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:44.880
and of course, the
European Commission

01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:52.890
to make it hopefully easier
for researchers, for--

01:46:54.590 --> 01:47:00.090
to not have everyone doing the
same thing at the same time.

01:47:00.090 --> 01:47:01.940
So kind of a perpetual motion

01:47:01.940 --> 01:47:11.530
where everybody is running their
own little wheel and to put the--

01:47:11.530 --> 01:47:18.910
to leverage the capacity because
if any research field could--

01:47:18.910 --> 01:47:22.940
deserves to leverage the
capacity that they have,

01:47:22.940 --> 01:47:28.680
since the capacity is so scattered
and is so uneven across the world,

01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:31.040
it should be the cultural
heritage sciences.

01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:34.270
So I'm going to stop and I think
Elizabeth said she would try

01:47:34.270 --> 01:47:37.690
to come tomorrow, perhaps
you could ask her questions

01:47:37.690 --> 01:47:43.390 position:56%
and then we would have more time for
questions for the other panelists.

01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:44.690
Thank you.

01:47:44.690 --> 01:47:45.990
&gt;&gt; Monique Bossi: Thank
you, Jong-on.

01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:47.990
[ Applause ]

01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:57.850
OK. I think we can open the
floor also with Luca and Odile.

01:47:57.850 --> 01:48:01.790
&gt;&gt; Antonio Sgamellotti:
Luca was mentioning the G7.

01:48:01.790 --> 01:48:07.500
Next year, we are going to have
the political summit in May

01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:12.690
in [inaudible], but before there
will be the G7 for science,

01:48:12.690 --> 01:48:17.440
the 23 and 24 that the [inaudible].

01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:24.740
Three statements will be discussed
and approved by the G7 and then

01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:29.200
to the political artist of the G7.

01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:37.820
The first one is cultural heritage,
a building resilience to disasters.

01:48:37.820 --> 01:48:44.980
This is an important topic and
guest countries will decide

01:48:44.980 --> 01:48:50.990
that will be the first statement
to present to the G7 for science.

01:48:50.990 --> 01:48:57.790 position:56%
The other two are very important,
aging society, a new economic roles.

01:48:57.790 --> 01:48:59.830
We have already prepared.

01:48:59.830 --> 01:49:07.150
I am responsible with my colleague
of the University of Geneva,

01:49:07.150 --> 01:49:09.940
Giovanni to prepare the statements.

01:49:09.940 --> 01:49:13.700
The statement is all ready,
but it has to be discussed

01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:20.300
by the G7 academies before
deliver it to the public.

01:49:20.300 --> 01:49:26.860
It will follow the document that
we already approved in Rome .

01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:34.550
The 11 to 13 of October, there was
a conference in Rome in occasion

01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:41.000
of the 50 anniversary of the
Florence Club and the title

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:51.930 position:56%
of the conference was Florence
1966-2016 Resilience of City of Arts

01:49:51.930 --> 01:49:55.810
to Natural Disaster,
the Role of Academies.

01:49:55.810 --> 01:50:02.330
And at the end of the meeting,
we approved the charter of Rome

01:50:02.330 --> 01:50:06.750
on the resilience of art
city to natural disasters.

01:50:06.750 --> 01:50:12.110
It was approved by all the
Academy of Science of the world,

01:50:12.110 --> 01:50:21.910 position:56%
more than 116 academy approved it
and is already available in the web.

01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:25.130
If you type IAP.

01:50:25.130 --> 01:50:31.730
This is the acronym of the network
of all the Academy of Science,

01:50:31.730 --> 01:50:36.370
IAP and then charter of
Rome, you will get the PDF

01:50:36.370 --> 01:50:40.560
of the document of
the charter of Rome.

01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:42.050
Thank you.

01:50:42.050 --> 01:50:43.350
&gt;&gt; Monique Bossi: Thank you,

01:50:43.350 --> 01:50:45.800
Professor Sgamelloti
for this addition.

01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:51.280
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: I will
repeat the question which was

01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:56.440 position:56%
for the European representatives to
talk about their approach as opposed

01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:59.720
to the American approach and
various [inaudible] as well.

01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:03.980
&gt;&gt; Luca Pezzati: My opinion
is there is a top-down process

01:51:03.980 --> 01:51:10.050
and it is more the JPI consortium
and bottom-up scientific process.

01:51:10.050 --> 01:51:12.950
And this is more the
IPERION E-RIHS so we'll

01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:15.720
from the top-down, you know.

01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:17.020
&gt;&gt; Jan van't Hof: Well,

01:51:17.020 --> 01:51:21.100
I won't exactly say the
JPI is only a top-down,

01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:23.530
but it is member state-driven.

01:51:23.530 --> 01:51:26.710
So it is different than
an institution-driven

01:51:26.710 --> 01:51:32.320
and what helped us was
making an agenda together.

01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:35.610
So then, you'd have to-- you
get to talk about the content

01:51:35.610 --> 01:51:39.460
and then you find you have
the same interest, you are--

01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:43.720
you have the same fascination.

01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:49.050
So that really helps within the
countries but also, within Europe.

01:51:49.050 --> 01:51:55.570
When you want to put together
financial resources, it's--

01:51:55.570 --> 01:51:58.920
it also helps because then
you really have the exposure

01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:06.410
in your own country, say, that
country is giving so much money,

01:52:06.410 --> 01:52:09.990
they're giving their money, so then
you can-- your own country say,

01:52:09.990 --> 01:52:14.860 position:56%
well, look at other member states
are doing, we shouldn't left behind.

01:52:14.860 --> 01:52:18.760
So that also helps
in a vice versa way.

01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:26.650 position:56%
So you want to be part of it but you
are-- you also want to-- if you--

01:52:26.650 --> 01:52:30.060
if you are in, you
should really join too.

01:52:30.060 --> 01:52:37.900
On the other hand, really pulling
financial resources is always

01:52:37.900 --> 01:52:45.140
difficult because you have various
ways of really sharing the money.

01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:48.530
And at the moment that they still
an issue on money being pulled,

01:52:48.530 --> 01:52:58.920
but it also mainly comes back
into national researchers grounds.

01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:01.450
&gt;&gt; What's their agenda?

01:53:01.450 --> 01:53:04.310
&gt;&gt; Jan van't Hof: Agenda is a
very good starting point both

01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:07.650
on the European level
and at national level.

01:53:07.650 --> 01:53:09.030
&gt;&gt; Luca Pezzati: About what--

01:53:09.030 --> 01:53:12.140
Before answering about want
Antonio was saying that the day

01:53:12.140 --> 01:53:13.810
after tomorrow, we'll
be in Brussels.

01:53:13.810 --> 01:53:17.470
The event organized by the
commission cultural heritage,

01:53:17.470 --> 01:53:21.180
disaster resilience in climate
change, the contribution

01:53:21.180 --> 01:53:23.090 position:56%
of European research and innovation.

01:53:23.090 --> 01:53:26.920
And in the afternoon, Hilde
De Clercq will speak--

01:53:26.920 --> 01:53:29.000
will present the E-RIHS
infrastructure

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.790
of these events in Brussels.

01:53:31.790 --> 01:53:36.800
About what we were saying, I am
a firm sustainer of the concept

01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:39.540
that with money, everything
is easier.

01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:44.550
So if you found money for research,
you can coordinate research,

01:53:44.550 --> 01:53:48.530
you can defragment research,
you can involve researchers

01:53:48.530 --> 01:53:50.460
and research organization.

01:53:50.460 --> 01:53:53.740
This firm belief is also
supported by my career.

01:53:53.740 --> 01:53:58.600
I started putting together
money from grants in 1998.

01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:00.290
I was a very young scientist.

01:54:00.290 --> 01:54:04.430
And it was-- That's the date of my
first external financed project,

01:54:04.430 --> 01:54:09.340
and then continue and established
the research group in the Institute

01:54:09.340 --> 01:54:12.790
of Optics just by finding
money for having them work.

01:54:12.790 --> 01:54:15.850
So simply these and
it is very fortunate

01:54:15.850 --> 01:54:19.180
that we have Brussels
Horizon project and all

01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:22.610
of the framework project because
it is something that, in a sense,

01:54:22.610 --> 01:54:26.830
is forcing European
researchers to cooperate.

01:54:26.830 --> 01:54:28.150
And the difference is obvious.

01:54:28.150 --> 01:54:31.700
Here, the United States
is a much older federation

01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:33.550
of states than the European one.

01:54:33.550 --> 01:54:37.170
So in Europe, there has been, in
these 20 years, the necessity,

01:54:37.170 --> 01:54:40.960
political necessity of
putting on the table tools

01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:44.890
for having real collaboration
between European researchers

01:54:44.890 --> 01:54:49.020
that also have the problem of not
speaking the same language even

01:54:49.020 --> 01:54:52.190
if there's not exactly one
English throughout the US.

01:54:52.190 --> 01:54:54.740
It was my understanding.

01:54:54.740 --> 01:54:56.990
But we have a guardian,
we are Finnish,

01:54:56.990 --> 01:55:01.980
we have a bit of difficulties with
several truly different languages,

01:55:01.980 --> 01:55:06.120
and it is why CLARIN is one of the
research infrastructures in Europe.

01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:12.130
So, about these, the real person
to whom addressed this question,

01:55:12.130 --> 01:55:16.060
how do you have the people
cooperating is not me.

01:55:16.060 --> 01:55:22.150
Because I entered in a very
well-established environment

01:55:22.150 --> 01:55:23.790
of cooperation.

01:55:23.790 --> 01:55:27.120
The real person to ask this
question is Bruno Brunetti,

01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:31.960
who started the process and
the Framework Programme 5

01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:36.340
and he built the European
family of cultural heritage.

01:55:36.340 --> 01:55:39.700
When I stepped into the
process, this was five years ago,

01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:42.130
and everything was well advanced.

01:55:42.130 --> 01:55:49.420
So my job has been simply to
sell these and to find new ways

01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:52.970
of exploiting this very nice
situation of cooperation

01:55:52.970 --> 01:55:59.320
that I found already
existing in Europe.

01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:00.620
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: OK.

01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:03.970
&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know
to be provocative.

01:56:03.970 --> 01:56:11.330 position:56%
But just as-- and we heard that we--
we all know that we are in a moment

01:56:11.330 --> 01:56:15.930
where we have a lot of budgeting
constraints, and the key point

01:56:15.930 --> 01:56:22.020 position:56%
for cultural aid, it used to make
the decision maker aware of the fact

01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:27.420
that cultural heritage is something
that deserves the attention

01:56:27.420 --> 01:56:29.880
from the financing committee.

01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:33.040
If this is the case,
I see any of the--

01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:35.730
I'm a little bit confused
of this really

01:56:35.730 --> 01:56:39.690
between this joint programming
initiatives and E-RIHS

01:56:39.690 --> 01:56:42.840
because they both rely
on at member state level,

01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:47.380
in the sense that the
future Italian not--

01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:49.390
and the joint programming
initiative,

01:56:49.390 --> 01:56:53.030
the Italian joint programming
initiative, they both have

01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:56.170
to finance their activities,
is that true?

01:56:56.170 --> 01:56:57.490
What does it mean?

01:56:57.490 --> 01:57:03.030
That it will arrive at a point
where a decision has been made,

01:57:03.030 --> 01:57:08.040 position:56%
has to be taken on whether to
finance what one or-- and the other.

01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:11.940
Even though there are
difference between them,

01:57:11.940 --> 01:57:15.890
the joint programming initiative
as Jan was saying is dealing

01:57:15.890 --> 01:57:21.890
with general heritage, the
E-RIHS just being with material--

01:57:21.890 --> 01:57:23.820
with the materiality of heritage.

01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:27.400
But regardless the fact
of what is dealing what,

01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:31.150
as a matter of fact [inaudible]
that we will arrive at a point

01:57:31.150 --> 01:57:35.300
that the member states has to,
you know, to put money on that

01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:42.180
and beyond, how do you see this
probably a small battle within--

01:57:42.180 --> 01:57:44.840
well, it-- probably, it
will not be a battle.

01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:49.100
But there is also a decision
maker, a decision-making process

01:57:49.100 --> 01:57:54.020
that I don't understand how
will be-- how will be tackled.

01:57:54.020 --> 01:57:55.320
&gt;&gt; Fenella France:
And just for the--

01:57:55.320 --> 01:57:56.670
&gt;&gt; Is it clear what I'm asking?

01:57:56.670 --> 01:57:59.400
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: So
for the filming here,

01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:04.890
to shrink it a little bit,
how big can the bottle be

01:58:04.890 --> 01:58:10.810
and how do you engage with the
management and the member states

01:58:10.810 --> 01:58:15.070
to make a decision about what
should be funded and I am assuming,

01:58:15.070 --> 01:58:17.180
how do we prioritize that funding?

01:58:17.180 --> 01:58:19.050
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:58:19.050 --> 01:58:21.150
&gt;&gt; Jan van't Hof: Well,
just to start the answer

01:58:21.150 --> 01:58:24.400
and Luca will follow I suppose.

01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:30.400
Some, say 10 years ago, the field

01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:34.060
of cultural heritage was much
more [inaudible] at the moment

01:58:34.060 --> 01:58:36.810
and also had not a focal point.

01:58:36.810 --> 01:58:43.540 position:56%
And what we see now and that is,
that for instance that European year

01:58:43.540 --> 01:58:49.120
of cultural heritage in 2018 will
really emphasize the importance

01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:51.020
of cultural heritage in Europe.

01:58:51.020 --> 01:58:56.980
So what we are seeing now
is that generally speaking,

01:58:59.950 --> 01:59:04.790 position:56%
the political interest in cultural
heritage in Europe is really growing

01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:11.470
and will, we hope, dominate in
European cultural heritage 2018.

01:59:11.470 --> 01:59:15.150
So we are at the moment
not in a bad time

01:59:15.150 --> 01:59:18.410
to have several initiatives
on cultural heritage.

01:59:18.410 --> 01:59:24.760
It is our task, I firmly
believe that we will--

01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:31.250 position:56%
we explained to the decision makers,
we are not in a battle ourselves

01:59:31.250 --> 01:59:38.110 position:56%
but we are willing trying to
cooperate and to share our resources

01:59:38.110 --> 01:59:43.460
and what's the interest of the
decision makers is that in the end,

01:59:43.460 --> 01:59:53.280
if we have a firm collaboration, we
can at least say to decision makers

01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:57.190
if you want to call something--
sorry, if you want to call someone

01:59:57.190 --> 02:00:02.910
about cultural heritage issues,
there is this good working--

02:00:02.910 --> 02:00:09.330
well, so what I say, bipolar, well,

02:00:09.330 --> 02:00:16.650
not institution, but
bipolar approach.

02:00:16.650 --> 02:00:18.870
&gt;&gt; Luca Pezzati: But the answer
is almost complete in the sense

02:00:18.870 --> 02:00:20.680
that that's not competition at all.

02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:23.180
It's just a synergy between the
joint programming initiative

02:00:23.180 --> 02:00:28.690
and the infrastructure because we
are doing totally different jobs.

02:00:28.690 --> 02:00:31.840
So, the joint programming
initiatives are political container

02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:34.220
developing a strategy
research agenda

02:00:34.220 --> 02:00:36.770
and they already developed it,

02:00:36.770 --> 02:00:40.790
involving the cultural heritage
research throughout Europe,

02:00:40.790 --> 02:00:46.280
and then the concern is to form a
research initiative across Europe

02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:49.440
with what is available
at European level.

02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:52.370
Why? The infrastructure
produces services,

02:00:52.370 --> 02:00:54.700 position:56%
so it's funded for another activity.

02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:56.700
It's servicing research.

02:00:56.700 --> 02:01:01.270 position:56%
There's been a nice debate in Venice
last week, how much we need to spend

02:01:01.270 --> 02:01:05.620
in research infrastructure in
order for research to be efficient?

02:01:05.620 --> 02:01:10.590
Currently in Europe, the
percentage is around 15 to 20%

02:01:10.590 --> 02:01:14.340 position:56%
of resources going directly to
research infrastructure and the bulk

02:01:14.340 --> 02:01:16.800
of it going to finance research.

02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:18.480
These are the figures.

02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:22.470
What is more difficult for
us is not the competition

02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:26.590
with the joint research initiative
that in the beginning may be

02:01:26.590 --> 02:01:31.550
for some problems understanding
things was there,

02:01:31.550 --> 02:01:35.370
in ministries across Europe, but
now the situation is very clear.

02:01:35.370 --> 02:01:36.770
We are an [inaudible] project

02:01:36.770 --> 02:01:39.620
and the joint programming
initiative is a JPI.

02:01:39.620 --> 02:01:43.740 position:56%
So it's very clear the rules even in
the face of politicians not having

02:01:43.740 --> 02:01:48.150
to do daily with cultural
heritage or heritage science.

02:01:48.150 --> 02:01:52.130
The real trouble is totally
different and I had confirmation

02:01:52.130 --> 02:01:54.730
of it in the most recent
meeting that I had

02:01:54.730 --> 02:01:58.010
in Vienna towards an
interministerial meeting in Austria

02:01:58.010 --> 02:02:01.150
because also in Austria, they
have the ministry of culture

02:02:01.150 --> 02:02:03.330
so there was representative
of ministry of culture,

02:02:03.330 --> 02:02:07.940
ministry of education and ministry
of research and the delegates

02:02:07.940 --> 02:02:12.620
of the ministry of research
had difficulty understanding

02:02:12.620 --> 02:02:20.670 position:56%
which is the role of E-RIHS aspect
project comparison with DALIAH ERIC,

02:02:20.670 --> 02:02:25.150
CLARIN ERIC so what's already
there into the ESFRI roadmap.

02:02:25.150 --> 02:02:29.710
That is the real problem for the
moment, that I don't understand

02:02:29.710 --> 02:02:34.290
because they are outside our field
and I cannot say they are stupid.

02:02:34.290 --> 02:02:38.080
They simply don't understand
which are the different roles

02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:41.290
of research infrastructures in
Europe and that is understandable

02:02:41.290 --> 02:02:45.790
and that is where the risk is
because we are the last in the line

02:02:45.790 --> 02:02:49.650
of ESFRI project that now we
made money from member states.

02:02:49.650 --> 02:02:52.760
So we need to explain
that and not the duality

02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:54.660
with the joint programming
initiative.

02:02:54.660 --> 02:02:56.050
That it's already a synergy.

02:02:56.050 --> 02:03:00.000
We already have a table and we
have a joint interface group

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:03.380
where we discussed of the role
of research infrastructures.

02:03:03.380 --> 02:03:06.000
&gt;&gt; Jan van't Hof: And we also
have some personal unions, so.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:07.410
&gt;&gt; Luca Pezzati: Yup.

02:03:07.410 --> 02:03:11.880
&gt;&gt; I don't think that is so
clear because in [inaudible]

02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:18.570
at least my impression is that they

02:03:20.210 --> 02:03:24.430
so is improved cultural
heritage initiatives.

02:03:24.430 --> 02:03:29.620
This is [inaudible] because
the institution in trying

02:03:29.620 --> 02:03:34.680
to gather them, if not we could
do with money to [inaudible]

02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:42.430
so we must be stressed that we have
two completely different vendors,

02:03:42.430 --> 02:03:45.130 position:56%
runs [inaudible] cultural
heritage, the other is through focus

02:03:45.130 --> 02:03:46.430
on research, [inaudible].

02:03:46.430 --> 02:03:47.730
&gt;&gt; Luca Pezzati: No, that's
not yet done here because--

02:03:47.730 --> 02:03:49.230
[ Inaudible Remark ]

02:03:49.230 --> 02:03:54.060
So initially, there's find
the support for E-RIHS is

02:03:54.060 --> 02:03:58.110
within the national research plan
for research infrastructures.

02:03:58.110 --> 02:04:03.050
So it completely separate from the
support of Italy to the initiatives

02:04:03.050 --> 02:04:04.920 position:56%
of the joint programming initiative.

02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:06.530
We need to know what will happen

02:04:06.530 --> 02:04:09.850
with the Framework
Programme 9 approaching

02:04:09.850 --> 02:04:14.230
because there are several problems,
because the first problem is

02:04:14.230 --> 02:04:20.310
that we don't know the UK position
so if the UK is not paying for FP9,

02:04:20.310 --> 02:04:23.180
the budget will be
totally different.

02:04:23.180 --> 02:04:26.240
It will not have UK
participant, applicants

02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:29.050
and that may be a good
point considering

02:04:29.050 --> 02:04:30.620
that they are winning everything.

02:04:30.620 --> 02:04:31.920
&gt;&gt; Monique Bossi: But
this is already--

02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:33.710
&gt;&gt; Luca Pezzati: But the
world would be different.

02:04:33.710 --> 02:04:35.370
The attitude of [inaudible]
is different

02:04:35.370 --> 02:04:38.010
from the attitude of the previous--

02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:39.310
&gt;&gt; Monique Bossi: Commissioner.

02:04:39.310 --> 02:04:40.610
&gt;&gt; Luca Pezzati: -- commissioner.

02:04:40.610 --> 02:04:43.240
So we don't even know the focus
on research infrastructure,

02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:45.450
how will be, our structure
will be, so there is--

02:04:45.450 --> 02:04:48.400
&gt;&gt; Monique Bossi: Just at the
beginning of the discussion.

02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:51.670
&gt;&gt; Luca Pezzati: But maybe Monique
can say something on this point.

02:04:51.670 --> 02:04:53.460
&gt;&gt; Monique Bossi: On FP9, no.

02:04:53.460 --> 02:04:55.600
It's a little bit premature.

02:04:55.600 --> 02:04:56.900
&gt;&gt; Luca Pezzati: I'll
give you Monique.

02:04:56.900 --> 02:04:58.200
&gt;&gt; Monique Bossi: No, no.

02:04:58.200 --> 02:05:00.780
Whatever I would say it would
be really, I mean, premature.

02:05:00.780 --> 02:05:05.790
But what I can say is that I
think we have reached the end

02:05:05.790 --> 02:05:08.530
of this morning session.

02:05:08.530 --> 02:05:16.280
It's already-- yes, 12, so I invite
you for an hour break so we try

02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:21.240
to convene back at 10
past 2, 10 past 1, sorry.

02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:25.480
And Fenella, anything
you want to talk.

02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:27.490
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: So,
please if you can all join me

02:05:27.490 --> 02:05:30.510
in thanking the panel
for the presentations.

02:05:30.510 --> 02:05:34.440
[ Applause ]

02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:38.090
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
