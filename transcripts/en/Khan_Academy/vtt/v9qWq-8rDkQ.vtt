00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.797
- I'm Paul Clifton, I'm 30 years old.

00:00:02.797 --> 00:00:05.614
I am a sixth grade Teacher Leader,

00:00:05.614 --> 00:00:08.616
and my salary is about $60,000.

00:00:08.616 --> 00:00:11.349
I'm a new Teacher Leader, and so I get to

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.624
coach other teachers,
fellow math teachers,

00:00:14.624 --> 00:00:16.340
and work on a team.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.386
And we get to observe teachers teach,

00:00:17.386 --> 00:00:20.454
co-teach with them, and
get into other classrooms

00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:22.536
instead of just working in my own.

00:00:22.536 --> 00:00:25.078
A lot of times at McGlone
we collaborate so much

00:00:25.078 --> 00:00:28.326
and it's a great opportunity
to be a part of that.

00:00:28.326 --> 00:00:30.204
I'm a ELS teacher.

00:00:30.204 --> 00:00:32.371
So that means that in a classroom

00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:34.711
I use Spanish and English to teach.

00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:36.615
A lot of times, I'll trans language,

00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:38.065
which is, I'll go back and forth,

00:00:38.065 --> 00:00:39.825
between English and Spanish.

00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:42.141
Just to help everyone understand.

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:44.474
We have a lot of language
learners at our school,

00:00:44.474 --> 00:00:46.226
so it's so many students
that have the potential

00:00:46.226 --> 00:00:48.958
to be bilingual and biliterate,

00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:52.138
so it's so important that
we're using both languages,

00:00:52.138 --> 00:00:56.019
And helping them understand
that Spanish has just as much

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.628
value and validity as English.

00:00:58.628 --> 00:01:01.281
Even though I went through
the teaching college,

00:01:01.281 --> 00:01:02.123
and everything like that,

00:01:02.123 --> 00:01:03.200
took all the courses.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.535
Like that first day, I was still,

00:01:06.535 --> 00:01:09.774
I was still super nervous and

00:01:09.774 --> 00:01:11.852
I can't say I was fully prepared.

00:01:11.852 --> 00:01:14.717
You know, it's still progressing every day

00:01:14.717 --> 00:01:17.684
and I don't think that it's
possible to be fully prepared,

00:01:17.684 --> 00:01:18.786
to become a teacher.

00:01:18.786 --> 00:01:22.826
I remember that first
day, I had this huge,

00:01:22.826 --> 00:01:26.743
just like, nervous feeling
and scared and fear.

00:01:29.042 --> 00:01:31.716
Those are always the best
times for you to grow.

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:33.472
Being able to get through, kind of like,

00:01:33.472 --> 00:01:36.463
not even that first
day, but the first week.

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:39.547
After that it was like, ah man, okay.

00:01:39.547 --> 00:01:40.744
This is what I'm supposed to be doing.

00:01:40.744 --> 00:01:43.988
Employers and principals are
looking for people who are

00:01:43.988 --> 00:01:48.323
really reflective and
really on their practice and

00:01:48.323 --> 00:01:53.323
have their growth mindset, to
continue to grow and progress.

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.693
We have such a big emphasis
in our school around coaching,

00:01:58.693 --> 00:02:02.233
and that progress you make as a teacher.

00:02:02.233 --> 00:02:03.683
Definitely in the interview,

00:02:03.683 --> 00:02:05.850
that's one of the main
questions that is asked.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.651
Do we feel comfortable being videotaped?

00:02:08.651 --> 00:02:11.342
Do we feel comfortable with,
in the moment coaching?

00:02:11.342 --> 00:02:14.046
A lot of times your're
going to be asked to,

00:02:14.046 --> 00:02:18.252
teach a lesson and then a few
minutes after you teach it,

00:02:18.252 --> 00:02:21.927
reflect on that lesson and pick
out things that you did well

00:02:21.927 --> 00:02:24.520
and what you could improve on.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.212
So definitely,

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:28.461
principals are looking
for people that reflect

00:02:28.461 --> 00:02:31.464
on their practice and are willing to grow.

00:02:31.464 --> 00:02:36.464
I feel like being a black male
teacher in the elementary,

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.150
going into, becoming
an elementary teacher,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.983
is really,

00:02:42.858 --> 00:02:44.422
gave me an advantage in finding a job.

00:02:44.422 --> 00:02:46.657
And being bilingual, so there was a lot

00:02:46.657 --> 00:02:49.915
that I brought to the table, naturally,

00:02:49.915 --> 00:02:51.710
that helped me find a job.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.957
But I do recognize that it
can be tough for teachers.

00:02:55.957 --> 00:02:58.758
Especially if you're not a
math or a science teacher.

00:02:58.758 --> 00:03:02.548
To find a job and maintain
it and know that it's so

00:03:02.548 --> 00:03:04.214
important for kids.

00:03:04.214 --> 00:03:05.860
Especially now-a-days,

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.325
where they have access
to so much technology.

00:03:09.325 --> 00:03:13.783
Did they, did they have
experiences with black males,

00:03:13.783 --> 00:03:16.883
who are positive, that are in schools,

00:03:16.883 --> 00:03:21.699
that are serving kids and
that are teaching with love.

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:23.434
I feel like without that,

00:03:23.434 --> 00:03:25.832
it's tough or it can be really tough

00:03:25.832 --> 00:03:29.173
for kids to see themselves being more than

00:03:29.173 --> 00:03:32.923
what is shown to them
on TV or through music.

00:03:34.144 --> 00:03:35.876
The amount of drive that you have to have

00:03:35.876 --> 00:03:37.359
to become a teacher,

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.588
you would be successful
at anything, right?

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:44.513
Definitely having that
passion for teaching,

00:03:44.513 --> 00:03:46.881
it's not east, it's really difficult.

00:03:46.881 --> 00:03:48.754
You have to teach on the fly,

00:03:48.754 --> 00:03:51.633
you have to think and change
your instruction as you go.

00:03:51.633 --> 00:03:53.016
You have to be humble every day,

00:03:53.016 --> 00:03:54.773
because what your teaching isn't working,

00:03:54.773 --> 00:03:58.106
so you have to change it up in some way.
