00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.390
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Good
morning, everyone.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.230
I think we're about
ready to get started.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.490
Welcome to the second
day of our roundtables

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.740
for the Copyright Office's
study on section 1201.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.190
Before we begin, I just would like
to go over a few logistical items.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.480
Apologies to those of you
who heard this yesterday.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.170
But first of all, my
name is Kevin Amer.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.670
I'm a Senior Counsel
in the Office of Policy

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.690
and International Affairs
here at the Copyright Office.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.490
The roundtable sessions will be
moderated by us here at the table.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.070
We will pose questions to begin the
discussion on particular topics.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.110
As most of you know, we ask
that to indicate that you'd

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.250
like to be called on, if you
could please turn your name

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.560
placard vertically.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.400
Just given the number of
panelists and topics, we ask that,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.660
if possible, you could try
to confine your comments

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.030
to about two to three minutes.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.210
We apologize in advance if we
have to cut you off, but you know,

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.010
we appreciate your
understanding on that.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.200
We also ask that you please
obviously focus your comments

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.060
on the specific topics that were
raised in the notice of inquiry

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.700 position:56%
and that are asked in our questions.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.720
And finally, just at
the end of your comment,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.410
if you could please turn
off your microphone,

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.950
because that avoids interference
with the sound recording.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.200
Our final session of the day is
an audience participation session.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.400
And time permitting, additional
comments from the participants.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.770
For the audience, there
will be a sign-up sheet.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.130 position:56%
And again, we ask that comments made

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.070
in that session be
limited to two minutes.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.390 position:56%
In addition, as you can see, today's
event is being video recorded

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.990
by the Library of Congress.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.940
Participants, we provided you
with a video release form.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.350
If you haven't yet signed it,
please do so and return it

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.070
to any one of us here at the table.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.520
For audience members
participating in the last session,

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.930
if you do decide to participate,
you will be giving us permission

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.440
to include your questions or
comments in any future webcasts

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.790
and broadcasts of this event.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.510
In addition, as you can see,

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.090
we do have a court reporter
transcribing the proceedings.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.690
Finally, we just would like to note

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.940
that we may seek additional written
comments in response to issues

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.930
that may come up during
the roundtables.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.070
If we do so, we will issue a
formal Federal Register notice

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.750
as previously.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.180
At this time, I would just like
to ask everyone in the audience

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.900
to please turn off
or mute any devices

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.540
that might interfere
with the recording.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.280 position:56%
Does anyone have any questions about
logistics before we get started?

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.580
OK, great.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.550
Before we begin, I'd just

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.770
like to invite my office
colleagues to introduce themselves.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.070
&gt;&gt; Andrew Moore: Andrew Moore,

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.600

&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Regan Smith,

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.130
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: And
so, before we begin,

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.030
I'd like to invite the panelists
to just go around quickly

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.360 position:56%
and state your name and affiliation.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.660
&gt;&gt; Allan Adler: Allan Adler.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.650
I'm with the Association

&gt;&gt; June Besek: June Besek.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.520

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.150
&gt;&gt; Brandon Butler: Brandon Butler.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.730
I'm the Director of

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.610 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Seth Greenstein: Seth Greenstein,

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.580
from the Law Firm of
Constantine Cannon.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.760
I'm here today as the aftermarket
replacement part for Aaron Lowe,

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.100
of the Auto Care Association.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.260
&gt;&gt; Keith Kupferschmid:
Keith Kupferschmid,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.250
CEO of the Copyright Alliance.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.080
&gt;&gt; James Love: Jamie Love,
Knowledge Ecology International.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.060
&gt;&gt; David M. Perry: David Perry,
from the law firm Blank Rome

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.780
in Philadelphia, on
behalf of Dorman Products,

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.430
which is an aftermarket
auto parts company.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.750
&gt;&gt; Ben Sheffner: Ben
Sheffner, Vice President,

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.110
Legal Affairs at the Motion
Picture Association of America.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.180
&gt;&gt; Robert S. Schwartz: Robert
Schwartz, Constantine Cannon.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.470
I'm counsel to Consumer
Technology Association.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.290
&gt;&gt; Bruce Turnbull: Bruce Turnbull,

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.870
counsel to the DVD Copy
Control Association,

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.530
and the Advanced Access Content
System Licensing Administrator LLC.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.830
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Great.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.130
Thank you.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.690 position:56%
So this panel, as you know, involves
the anti-trafficking provisions

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.490
of section 1201.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.130
And to kick things off, I'm
going to turn it over to Regan

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.680
with a few introductory remarks.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.420
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Yeah.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.030
So the anti-trafficking provisions
of section 1201 are not part

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.830
of the triennial rulemaking,
as I think you know.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.720
But they are generally provisions
upon both access controls

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.750
and section 1201(b), which
applies to copy controls.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.910
In many of the comments we
received, we heard arguments

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.840
that the intended beneficiaries
of exemptions to the provision

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.850 position:56%
on circumvention are difficult for
the intended beneficiaries to engage

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.060
in without assistance
from third parties.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.830
And the most recent rulemaking, the
Register of copy Rights recommended

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.420
to the Librarian some of the
difficulties that have arisen

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.950
with anti-trafficking provision.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.240
She stated, "Congress may wish
to consider clarifications

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.790 position:56%
to section 1201 to ensure that the
beneficiaries of exemptions are able

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.090
to take full advantage of them,

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.640
even if they need assistance
from third parties.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.490
While the anti-trafficking
provisions can curtail bad actors

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.090
seeking to profit from
circumvention by others,

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.940
they also constrain the ability
that allows third parties

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.630
to offer assistance
to exempted users."

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:21.020
So as the first question to kickoff
I think rather broadly is how

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.250
effective are the participants
feeling that the provisions are--

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.400
the anti-trafficking
provisions have been

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.770
at encouraging the innovative
digital distribution to models

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.000
and deterring infringements.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.650
Mr. Turnbull.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:41.160
&gt;&gt; Bruce Turnbull: In both the DVD
and Blu-ray case and now hopefully

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.120
in the Ultra-HD Blu-ray
case, the availability

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.850
of the content protection systems,

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.840
the technological protection
measure, CSS and AACS

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:57.080
and now AACS-2 were essential to
the development of those markets.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:02.640 position:56%
And the anti-trafficking provisions
have been essential to the integrity

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.250
of the licensing of
those technologies.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:11.790
Both DVD CCA and AACS
have taken advantage

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:17.440
of the anti-trafficking provisions
in court cases against entities

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.550
that are distributing, trafficking
in circumvention products.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:28.850
They are absolutely essential to
the business of both of my clients

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.490 position:56%
and to the development of the market

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:35.650
where consumers have
enjoyed tremendous new ways

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:40.150
of enjoying the content
in the digital era.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.450
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:42.750
Mr. Adler?

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.480
&gt;&gt; Allan Adler: For the publishing
industry that the importance

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.630
of the anti-trafficking
provision can be overstated.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:54.570
The fact of the matter is again,
we're dealing with a situation

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:58.150
where we're talking
about circumvention

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.820 position:56%
of technological protection measures

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.800
that don't involve all the
complications of dealing

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.140
with software that has a separate
functionality besides the fact

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:14.250
that it is serving as a gate
essentially for authentication

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.470
of who has access to works.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:20.110
So if you think about
the way the explosion

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:24.180
in online subscription
services for journals, e-books,

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:28.370
variety of other content have
taken place, it's all taken place

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:33.690 position:56%
because of the ability to have that
kind of arrangement where authorized

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:37.660
and authenticated access is
done by passwords generally.

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:42.080 position:56%
And those passwords can't be
circumvented, at least to the extent

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:47.070
that there's not wide availability
of the kinds of tools or devices

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:50.130
or services that would proliferate

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.260
and basically threaten
that type of model.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.190
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Can you
elaborate for a second on the role

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.380
of the law there in
encouraging these models

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.060
and protecting the password
as opposed to just the fact

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.630
that there is a password on it?

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.460
Are there-- Do you have to take and
undertake enforcement activities

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.540
or do you think it is just
a broader deterrent effect?

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.090
&gt;&gt; Allan Adler: Again,
as I said yesterday,

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:15.410
I don't think the law
had the expectation

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:18.710
where Congress enacted it, that
it was going to really be able

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:22.400
to prevent or even
deter hackers as such.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.540
What it was designed to do, as
most laws are, is to make sure

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.260
that law-abiding people
remain law-abiding.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.880
And so, the notion that you
could have some kind of locks

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.690
that you're permitted to use,
you're not required to use them

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:38.110
but you're permitted to use them
without having legal protections

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:42.130
against people constantly
trying and succeeding ultimately

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:45.120
in circumventing those
locks would mean

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.460
that locks themselves would
be ultimately ineffectual.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:53.290 position:56%
So the law is very important as a
general matter not because it deters

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:56.270
or prevents the hackers who
are determined to engage

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.810
in illegal activity but it
generally means that people

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:03.270
who are law-abiding citizens
will respect the business model

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.340
and will participate use

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.850
of that business model
understanding why they need

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:12.590
to have their authorizations
authenticated.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:13.890
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:16.400
I think Mr. Kupferschmid is next.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.700
&gt;&gt; Keith Kupferschmid: Yeah.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.000
Thank you.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.120
It's pretty clear I think that
consumers in the United States,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.340
as well as, you know, large
and small copyright owners,

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.780
have benefited from this sort
of explosion of innovation

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:32.110
and this explosion of
innovation that we see is due,

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:36.440
at least in part, because of the
protection provided in section 1201

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.380 position:56%
and the anti-trafficking provisions.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.230
Those anti-trafficking
provisions have been a very,

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.300
very important part of 1201
since the very beginning.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.820
It's our belief that they shouldn't
be cut back on at this point.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:52.110
I mean, as Allan mentioned,
you know, the purpose,

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.280
the ultimate purpose is to keep
sort of this hacking software

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.380
out of the mainstream and limit
its availability to the fringes,

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.370
you know, so you can't
just walk into Best Buy,

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.520
for instance, and get a copy.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.100
But there are other--
many other benefits.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.440
It prevents tracking in
circumvention technologies.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.650
By doing that, it reduces
the attractiveness

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.480
of commercial business
models that are based

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.280
on enabling access
to infringing works.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:26.630
Being able to target trafficking
is also important because actions

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.170
of distributors that
circumvent that--

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:31.470
Sorry, distributors

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.560
of the circumvention
technologies is comparatively--

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.030
I repeat, comparatively
easy to detect

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:40.200
and targeting them is the most
efficient and effective way

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.950
to actually enforce 1201.

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:47.480
And then, it also helps prevent
the sort of capital formation

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:52.050
around the black box business
dedicated to circumvention of sales

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:58.180 position:56%
of circumvention devices and prevent
sort of this arms race, if you will,

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.860
where, you know, a
technology is cracked

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.860
and the black boxes are out there.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.420
And so, you have to
create a new technology.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.390
And it just-- And I think
that's the benefit of everyone.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:11.290
And just lastly, just to
repeat is what Allan said,

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:16.580
it ultimately keeps
consumers honest, if you will,

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.840
preventing circumvention tools
from being conveniently available

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.950
at Best Buy, Amazon,
Newegg and things like that.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.520
That's the underlying
purpose and I think--

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.390
And I think a lot of people
agree with me that it has served

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.850
that purpose and served
that purpose well and is

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:35.590
in large part responsible for
the tremendous boom in innovation

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:38.030
that we have today and
these new business models

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:41.940
that consumers have
access to movies and music

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.810
and all sorts of copyrighted works.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:47.110
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:48.410
Mr. Love, would you agree
with that characterization?

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:50.720
Do you have a different take?

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:56.160
If you can turn your
microphone on and speak into it?

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.460
&gt;&gt; James Love: No.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:58.760
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Oh, OK.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.060
Well, you had your placard up.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.360 position:56%
So I didn't know if you had
another thought you wanted to share.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.660
&gt;&gt; James Love: Yeah.

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:03.960
I do, yes.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:10.020
I mean, there's a wide range of
areas where the public interest

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.260
in having companies
protect their works

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.460
through technical measures
are appropriate.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.120
But I think as the evidence
in this proceeding has shown,

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.720
and in other proceedings has
shown, there's a whole set of areas

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:24.240
where it doesn't work out well.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.860
It has perhaps like an
anti-competitive effect

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.670 position:56%
or it defeats people from being able

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:33.210
to use lawful exceptions
and things like that.

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:36.830
So I think that the task for this
group going forward is to figure

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:42.560
out how do you address the fact
that the law covers a lot of stuff

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.970
and not everything is
exactly the same in terms

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:46.270
of the way things play out.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:52.620
To us, part of it's what
obligations do you put on people.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.770
Part of the answer is what
obligations do you put on people

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.520
that provide-- that
expect legal protections

00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.820
from the technical measures.

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.860
In other words, is there-- can
you just do anything and expect

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:06.580
to be protected with a full weight
of, you know, all the laws coming

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.880 position:56%
down on your head if you violate
anything, no matter what the context

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.750
or the circumstances is, or do you
have any obligation to address some

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.250
of the other issues
that may come up,

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.830
that many which are
raised in the proceeding.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:20.270
So part of it's that, and part of
it is do you have the same rules

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:21.760
for every sector of the economy.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.240
Is it the same thing for movies as
it is for auto parts, for example,

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.960
which will be discussed here?

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.700
Is it the same thing
for textbooks as it is

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.080
for computer games and things?

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.880
And I think it's a mistake
to have a unitary system

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.380
where everything is
kind of thrown together.

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:40.470
So I think part of the way forward
is to recognize that not all uses

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.400
of goods present the same problems.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.360
Part of the solution is to--

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:50.280
is to realize that there should
be some affirmative obligations

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.250
on people that expect legal
protection in the state to,

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:56.070
you know, help enforce their
technical protection measures

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.100 position:56%
to address public interest in areas.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:04.450
And I think the other area is it
may be that there's more of a realm

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:08.160
for a category of people
that are authorized

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.610
to use circumvention devices
under certain contexts.

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:14.890
For example, in the
area for blind people,

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:16.190
it's great that blind
people have the,

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.420
you know, the right to circumvent.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.730
But I mean, it's not something
that all blind people can do

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:27.910
without depending on someone
to provide a service for them.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:30.040
Same thing I'm sure is for
people that want to, you know,

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.810
fix their own cars or
something like that.

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:35.660
Not everybody can do
these things on their own.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:40.560
But it may be that you-- in some
areas, you may feel like you want

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.640
to have some-- not completely
open the door all the way,

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:47.120
but you may want to have some
some sense that the people

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.250
that are authorized
to provide services

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.270
like that are somehow
more accountable

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:54.670
and following some more
circumspect things.

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:57.110
And so I think just in
terms of opening things,

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.330
that's what I wanted to say.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:00.630
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: OK.

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:01.930
Thank you.

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:03.230
So that-- That raised a lot of
issues, some of which we'll unpack

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.250
as we go throughout the discussion.

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:08.770
But one follow-up question for you,
before I let Ms. Besek speak is,

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.730
you know, yesterday
on our first panel,

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:14.380
as well as the Copyright Office's
study on embedded software devices,

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.440
which was the panel two--
the roundtables two days ago,

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.190
we talked about whether there was
a way to sort of divide the line

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:23.770
between software and embedded
devices, perhaps not related

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:25.860
to the distribution
of expressive content

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.540
such as a garage door opener,

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:33.220
a car versus the consumption
of books, movies, music.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.530
Is that-- It sounds like you think
some line on that may be relevant

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:38.040
to the anti-trafficking laws?

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.480 position:56%
Would that-- Would you support--
Are you suggesting statutory reform?

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.780
&gt;&gt; James Love: Well,

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.480
I think statutory reform
should always be considered.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:49.010
And we would support
statutory reform.

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:52.050
But whether you do it within
the discretion you have,

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:54.170
it's a rulemaking, or whether you
do it through statutory reform,

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:57.110
I think these distinctions
should be followed.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:00.270
I also think you can make
distinctions between content

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:05.120
such as entertainment products,
such as movies or computer games

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:09.660
from material that's used
in an educational context.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.060
It just is another illustration

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:15.550
of an additional distinction
you can make.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:16.850
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:18.150
Ms. Besek?

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:19.850
Excuse me?

00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:24.610
&gt;&gt; June Besek: It didn't
go all the way.

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:29.330
So I guess I'm not as
certain as Mr. Love is

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:33.630
about how you can make these
discriminations between content,

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:39.280
because I think that educators and
librarians would say that movies

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.340
and other kinds of works
are very relevant--

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:43.700
you know, music and
things like that.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.740
So I think one of the difficulties

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.190
that we all face is
how to draw lines.

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:53.150 position:56%
For example, I am sympathetic to the
notion that technological protection

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:56.640
that protects functional works
might be in a different category.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:03.350
However, how do you distinguish
between computer software

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:09.170
that runs a particular function,
car, whatever and the fact

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:12.740
that there still may be a
lot of protectable expression

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.090
in that computer program.

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:15.950
We have to make distinctions
somehow.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:19.110
The other point I wanted
to make originally was

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:23.550
that there were a number
of comments to the effect

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.970
that the system isn't
working anyway.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.260
So why should people be concerned

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.050
about anti-trafficking
exceptions or other exemptions.

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:33.850
And I would say that it's-- a lot

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:36.530
of this isn't a black
or white, an either/or.

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:41.470
You can't argue that a
system isn't effective just

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.050
because some people can bypass.

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:46.660
There's always been some
degree of infringement.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.120
There always will be.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.180
The real goal is to
reduce it to the level

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.230
where you still have
a viable market.

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.090
So that-- I think that goes back
to Keith's comment about, you know,

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:57.680
you don't want it just
available at Best Buy.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.040
Well, you don't want
it just available--

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.060
I was thinking of Walmart,
actually Keith, but the same idea.

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.360
And so, it's really important
that that material not be--

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.560
you know, the circumvention means
not be so generally available.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.270 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: So you would agree
to keep it out of Walmart, Best Buy,

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:15.910
sort of the easy access to
the law-abiding citizens

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:18.570
and the hackers can find
things in the dark corners

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:21.180
and that's not proof
that it's not working?

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.480
&gt;&gt; June Besek: Right.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.870
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Just to
sort of follow up on that,

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:29.260
and I think this picks up on
something that Mr. Love said,

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:34.790
we had a lot of comments drawing
the distinction between devices--

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:36.310
circumvention devices and services.

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:40.350
And there was a lot of concern
expressed about the need

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:47.660
for beneficiaries of exemptions
to use or just seek assistance

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.350
from third parties in
order for the exemptions

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:51.670
to have any practical effect.

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:58.070
I wonder just from your experience,
to what extent is that a concern?

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:01.150
Have you seen that out
in the marketplace?

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:05.570
And if so, to what extent should
the law recognize that sort

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:11.090
of distinction and what would you
suggest could be done about it?

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:13.420
I believe Mr. Adler was next.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.400
If you'll-- I know you
may have had a comment

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.310
about the previous question, but
feel free to address this as well.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:19.610
&gt;&gt; Allan Adler: Yeah.

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:21.180 position:56%
I think that the real problem here--

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:24.830
it's not so much distinguishing
between levels of protection

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:26.740
for different types of works.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:30.150
I mean, the issue of dealing
with embedded software

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:34.740
in consumer products and the
functionality issue with respect

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:39.640
to driving those products,
again, should not become the tail

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:43.730
that wags the anti-circumvention
dog because the issue

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:46.260 position:56%
for anti-circumvention was primarily

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:50.210
about protecting access
to expressive works.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:54.950
And the problem with that is, in
response to what Jamie suggested,

00:20:54.950 --> 00:21:00.670 position:56%
is simply that there's no way to
allow for the dissemination of tools

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:05.750
that only enable the exercise
of exemptions or other kinds

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:08.030
of authorized circumventions.

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:11.360
Let me give you an analogy when we
talk about third-party assistance.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:15.410
In most jurisdictions, if you want
to go into business as a locksmith

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:19.320 position:56%
or if you want to seek employment as
a locksmith, you have to be bonded.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.700
You have to be certified.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.200
You have to be licensed.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.990
And the tools that you're able

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:27.430
to acquire are very carefully
regulated and tracked.

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:31.810
And those are mechanical tools,
very distinctive types of tools.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:34.960
What we're talking about in the
online world, when we're talking

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:39.770 position:56%
about circumventing various types of
technological protection measures,

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:43.230
we're primarily talking about
software acting on software

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:47.200
or we're talking about things
like random number generators

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.160
that are going to try to find the
proper password or the combination

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:56.850 position:56%
for the authentication key that
allows somebody to access the works.

00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:00.660
And it's clear that those
types of things are going

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:03.890
to have many legitimate uses
as well as they're going

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:07.460
to have these types
of illegitimate uses.

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:10.710
And it seems that it's going to
be extremely difficult to be able

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:15.510
to identify them, to be able to
regulate them, to be able to ensure

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:18.450
that the people who would
be authorized to use them

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:24.660
to perform circumventions are
in fact also properly regulated.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:27.130
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:28.810
Mr. Greenstein?

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:30.570
&gt;&gt; Seth Greenstein: Thank you.

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:33.170
So there are a few issues
here I'd like to address

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:34.470
from the past few questions.

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:38.430
So I appreciated Mr. Adler trying
to draw the distinction between,

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:42.170
you know, access to expressive
works versus trying to get access

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:46.390
to the functional aspects of the
work or the aspects of a software

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:49.320
that control function and
have no other purpose.

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.220
And I think that really is
a line that is easy to draw.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:55.740
I mean, where the software
interoperates with the part,

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:58.250
controls the part and is
really part of the part.

00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:59.690
It's inseparable from the part.

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:01.980
I think what we're talking about,

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:05.890
the ability to circumvent a
technological protection measure

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:09.200
to get access to the
work is really all

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:13.320
about repairing the functionality,
augmenting the functionality,

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:16.580
customizing the functionality
and not anything having to do

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:18.690 position:56%
with the expressiveness of the work.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.940
Some of these software, in fact,
may not be copyrightable at all.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.760
There's one case in
the Ford versus Autel,

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.210
where the court basically found
this is not copyrightable--

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:31.490 position:56%
the elements that you're trying to
get access to are not copyrightable.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:33.420 position:56%
And the same was true in the Lexmark

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:34.890
versus Static Control
Components case,

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:38.240
where they found the software
was not protectable by copyright.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.350
So that's one issue.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:45.140
Looking at the real object of
protection here, the real object

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:48.800
of protection is not
the expressive nature

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.430
of the software, the software code.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:53.530
The real object of protection
is the functionality provided

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:56.340
and stopping others from
repairing that functionality,

00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:02.790
stopping competition in the
repair of consumer products.

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:06.760
And that being the case, I mean,
it's really an interesting question

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:11.990
as to whether section 1201(a)
actually applies or (a)(1)

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:18.200
or (a)(2) really applies because
the consumer owns the work--

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:22.310
I mean, owns the product
and has the right of access

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:24.640
to all the functionality
provided by the product.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.450
So is there really
an issue with access?

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:31.350
The consumer has authorized access
to the functionality provided

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:34.010
by the software and that is the
only purpose of the software.

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:38.160 position:56%
So I would say a good argument could
be made that there's no 1201(a)(1)

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:43.720
or (a)(2) issue to begin with and
the same would be true for (b).

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.880
Lastly, I do want to address one
of the points that you raised

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:50.410
with respect to the differences
between devices and services.

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:53.310
I think you cannot
make that distinction,

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:55.850
particularly for the
auto repair industry,

00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:59.350
simply because not every mom
and pop shop-- repair shop--

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:03.430
is going to have the ability
to develop the software

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:07.870 position:56%
that circumvents, that is able to
then repair the software in the car.

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:12.720
But everyone should be able
to use a tool that is provided

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.110
by someone else, developed
by somebody else that enables

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:18.230
that repair, which is why I think
you cannot really make the divide

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:19.880
based on devices versus services.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:23.270
So I think the divide really
has to be between protection

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:27.690
of functionality versus
protection of expression.

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:28.990
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:31.400
I wanted to ask a question that
sort of ties what you've said

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.120
to what Mr. Adler just said.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:37.610
Mr. Adler mentioned that it would
be difficult to limit any exemption

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:40.540
to assistance for permitted
exemption.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:44.050
And you're saying there's
sometimes trouble taking advantage

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:46.940
of the exemption on behalf
of the intended beneficiary.

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:51.260
So my question is to what extent
have the intended beneficiaries

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:54.710
of the Office's exemptions
relied on tools or services

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:57.660
that would be subject to the
anti-trafficking provision?

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.740
So I guess, you know,
getting something maybe

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:01.200 position:56%
in a way they're not supposed to be.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.130
And on the flipside, how much are
they prevented from being able

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:06.210
to make use of the exemptions?

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:08.710
So, Mr. Schwartz?

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:12.270
&gt;&gt; Robert S. Schwartz: Well,
you've started off by observing

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:20.020
that anti-trafficking really
isn't implicated in 1201(a)(1).

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:24.060
And I think that kind
of answers the question.

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:29.070
I'd like to quote somebody, and
it was in our comments, a quote:

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:31.950
"In our view, manufacturers,
consumers, retailers

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:34.950
and servicers should
not be prevented

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:38.340
from correcting an
interoperability problem resulting

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:41.720
from a protection measure causing
one or more devices in a home

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.610
or in a business to
fail to interoperate

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:46.290
with other technologies."

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:50.910 position:56%
And that was Chairman Bliley of the
House Commerce Committee at the time

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:55.480
on August 8th, 1998 in
his floor statement.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.670 position:56%
I think he would have included autos

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:00.750
if one would have envisioned
the importance

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:06.020
of functional software at the time.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:11.360
So I think the answer is simply
leave trafficking to the courts,

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.450
where it belongs, and where I
know Mr. Turnbull has been very

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:17.780
interested in those things.

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:24.510 position:56%
When it comes to the question of the
Office's role and the NTIA's role

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:27.820
in exemptions, I think
honestly the NTIA had it right

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.500
and the Office didn't.

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:34.800
There should be a presumption,
at the very least,

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:39.950
that somebody is entitled
to service,

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:44.220
however the service is provided,
whether strictly as a service

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:47.410
or taking advantage-- or the
servicer taking advantage

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:51.530
of a device-- when it comes
to the exemption process.

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:54.550
And I would say that when the
question is interoperability

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:57.800
and functionality, that the
presumption should be conclusive.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:04.120
I'm not here to talk about
the expressive end of that.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:07.150
CTA may have a range
of views on that.

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:12.670
But CTA was extremely concerned
with the outcome of the proceeding

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:18.900
with respect to autos and also with
the reference to the Unlocking Act.

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:22.150
I mean, again, to refer
to what everybody knows

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:25.350
about the tools being
widely available to people,

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:28.950
when the Office processed
the previous exemption

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:31.970
and the Congress considered the
Unlocking Act, everybody knew

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:38.500 position:56%
that unlocking a cell phone required
some type of expert assistance.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.560
And it didn't seem to
trouble the Office in the past

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.400
when it granted the exemption.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.460
The Congress acknowledged
that in legislative debate.

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:50.570
I don't think anybody contemplated
that the fact that Congress said,

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:53.280
oh yeah, you're entitled to
expert assistance in the context

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.500
of cell phones, meant you couldn't
have it when it came to autos.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.380
I've used up much of my time.

00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:59.730
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Can I--
just to follow up--

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:05.290
Just to clarify, so when
you talk about a presumption

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:09.270
that third party assistance
should be allowed to make use

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:11.690
of an exemption, is that your
understanding of current law

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:15.060
or is that a change that
you would like to see?

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:20.470
And is there any relevance to the
fact that in the Unlocking Act,

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:23.850
Congress expressly provided
for third party assistance?

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:28.180
Does that speak to what current
law may or may not provide?

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.930
&gt;&gt; Robert S. Schwartz: The
answers are both and no.

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:35.610
The-- I think the CTA's
comments argued

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:38.360
by quoting this legislative
history and others

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:45.640 position:56%
that there was no intention for an
exemption for third party assistance

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.560
to be unavailable in
the exemption context,

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:52.620
so long as it didn't
affect the legal environment

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.680
with respect to trafficking.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:59.700
If-- CTA would be in favor of
clarifying the law in this regard,

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.740
and so advised the House
Judiciary Committee.

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:10.100
And as one, who on behalf of a
cell phone reseller was, you know,

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.270
involved as a stakeholder
in legislative discussions,

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:16.590
I don't think anybody had in
mind that this would be decided

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:21.020
by the Copyright Office or
the Register as a reason to--

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:24.540
the first time the subject
came up at all, to say, oh no,

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:27.290
you're not entitled to
third party assistance.

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:28.590
Thank you.

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:29.890
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Mr.
Sheffner, do you have a view

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:31.190
on Mr. Schwartz's interpretation?

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:32.490
&gt;&gt; Ben Sheffner: Sure.

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:33.790
I'll get to that in a second.

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:35.090
Let me just back up for a second.

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:38.060
First of all, I just
want to attach myself to

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:41.990
and endorse the previous comments
of Mr. Turnbull and Mr. Adler

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:44.480
and Mr. Kupferschmid
about the importance

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:48.690
of the anti-trafficking
provisions to the success

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:53.500
of the motion picture industry,
various business models

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:57.710
over the last 15 years, from
DVDs and Blu-rays to all

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:04.040
of the explosion now of 115 legal
online services here in the US,

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.870
over 400 worldwide, virtually all

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:10.830
of which incorporate technological
protection measures of course

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:13.380
with the backstop of section 1201,

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:14.680
both the anti-circumvention
provisions

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:17.900 position:56%
and the anti-trafficking provisions.

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.910
But getting to your question
from a minute ago specifically

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:26.290
about whether the prohibitions
on trafficking

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:29.740
in anti-circumvention devices

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:36.600
and services have impeded people's
ability to exercise the exemptions

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:39.620
that they've been granted
through the triennial rulemaking,

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.480
and I think the answer is no.

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.080
I think if you go and look back

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:47.580
at the record established during
those six rulemakings now,

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:51.250
as well as the record developed
through these proceedings here,

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:54.070
you don't have people coming
forward and saying, you know what,

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:57.390
the Copyright Office
told me it's OK to do x,

00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:59.500
y and z under this exemption.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.370
However, I'm not able to do it

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:03.970
because of the anti-trafficking
provisions.

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:05.270
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Can I--

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:06.570
&gt;&gt; Ben Sheffner: At least
in the audiovisual sector,

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:07.870
which I was concerned about.

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:09.170
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Yeah, I was
going to ask you is that,

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:10.470
do you have an opinion
about the auto industry

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.440
or would you just treat that
as, you know, not in your--

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.290
&gt;&gt; Ben Sheffner: I'm
going to stay focused

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:17.990
for the moment on our own industry.

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:23.030
You know, as Mr. Adler and
Mr. Kupferschmid alluded to,

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:28.350
we know that there are
anti-circumvention--

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:33.220
There is anti-circumvention
software available out there.

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:38.530
It's not importantly on the shelf
at Best Buy, et cetera, et cetera.

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:40.590
And we think that's an
important distinction.

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:44.670
If it were on the shelf at Best Buy
or you could go to Amazon or Newegg

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:48.140
and click it, it would essentially
send a message to the public that,

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:50.490
hey, it's OK as a general matter

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:54.340
to use anti-circumvention
software, which it's not.

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:59.450 position:56%
Again, we acknowledge that there is
nonetheless such software out there.

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:03.820
And again, I don't think there is
evidence established by the record

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:07.370
of either the triennial rulemakings
or in this proceeding that shows

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:10.280 position:56%
that those people who have been sort

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:14.610
of granted exemptions
are nonetheless not able

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:18.530
to take advantage of those
exemptions due to the prohibition

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:21.950
on trafficking and circumvention
of devices and services.

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:23.250
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:25.170
Mr. Butler, you've represented
people who have, you know,

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:26.470
petitioned for an exemption.

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:27.770
Do you have a viewpoint on that?

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:29.070
&gt;&gt; Brandon Butler: Yes, absolutely.

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:31.790
So, I got a few things to say.

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:37.830
So one is a key reason that none
of the folks that I've worked

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:41.290
with in the past and now
have been terribly deterred

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:42.820
yet by anti-trafficking is

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:44.720
that we're free-riding
on the pirates, right?

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.110
I mean, we just-- Handbrake
is there.

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:50.730
It's easy to find and so if you
want to rip a DVD, it's easy to do

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:54.390
because luckily the things we
want to rip are also things

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:55.900
that pirates want to rip, right?

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:58.560
And so, we get to-- I
mean that it's just--

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.190
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: You don't need
it to be at Best Buy to find it.

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:01.960
&gt;&gt; Brandon Butler: You don't
need it to be at Best Buy, right.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:03.940
It's easily-- You just Google it.

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:06.280
And so-- Sorry Google.

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:09.210
So-- I'll be quoted on that.

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:10.510
I'm sorry.

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:17.020
But the problem I think that I
see going forward is that we are--

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:19.310
It's been like a-- University
of Virginia, for example,

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:22.550
we're really interested
and investing heavily

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:26.370
in digital preservation and we're
building special collections

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:27.670
of digital archives.

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:30.890
So we have Salman Rushdie's laptop
and everything that was on it.

00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:33.930
Some of that stuff is
in proprietary formats.

00:34:33.930 --> 00:34:38.130
I foresee that as DRM
ages, it will--

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:41.410 position:56%
more and more different formats will
become obsolete and we'll be asking

00:34:41.410 --> 00:34:45.900
for exemptions to crack things that
no one cares about but us, right?

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:49.390
And so, the pirates are
not going to make emulators

00:34:49.390 --> 00:34:54.220
for obscure 1980s, you
know, DRM software.

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:57.310
And so, what are we going
to do in that context?

00:34:57.310 --> 00:35:00.380
I think we have to be a little
bit forward-thinking about that.

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:04.180
And even if, right, we build
some internal expertise, and so,

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:07.180
some archivist is-- We have
very talented archivists

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:08.490
who could build that tool.

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:10.790
Can they share it across consortia?

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:12.910
That's generally the
way these things work.

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:16.460
So that's one worry that I have, is
we've been free-riding on pirates

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.170
because we've only asked for DVDs.

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:21.430
But in the future, what will we
do when we're asking for more

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:24.120
and more obscure formats?

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.580
And then, another thing-- Well,

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:28.350
did you have a follow-up
question about that?

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:29.650
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Yeah,
I guess-- Sorry.

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:32.060
If you're suggesting that, you
know, you develop an archivist

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:35.070
who can create this tool and then
shares it with another archivist,

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:38.330
that that would implicate
1201(b) and trafficking

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:40.180
in a technology product or service?

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:43.060
I mean, is that what you're
saying the-- you have a fear?

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:44.990
&gt;&gt; Brandon Butler: That's
what I would fear, right,

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:46.890
and there would be some
uncertainty about that.

00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:51.750 position:56%
Or that, you know, a very-- Another
way that libraries frequently work--

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:54.350
universities, you know,
there are of course many,

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:58.290
many vendors who are experts who
are external to the university

00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:01.060
who develop specialized
products and services only

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:03.300
for libraries, only
for universities.

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:06.980 position:56%
And it may be that they might
develop the better tool than we did.

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:09.540
And an exemption might
empower them to do that.

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:11.280
So that would certainly be, right--

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.430
I mean, and so maybe the archivists
working inside could make it

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:15.980
and maybe they could share it.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:19.500
But certainly, you know, a
specialized vendor couldn't say,

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:24.050
hey, we've got a way to
facilitate digital preservation.

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:25.350
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Right.

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:27.330
But so if the exemption
process were to extend to sort

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:30.450
of encouraging this market for
circumvention tools, I mean,

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:33.430
would that lead into some of the
other concerns we opened up and,

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:35.560
you know, to encourage
your vendors to market

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.580
and sell these tools it seems

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:39.920
that might implicate
what others have said.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.220
&gt;&gt; Brandon Butler:
Well, I think not.

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.950
I think there's security
built into the--

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:45.870
in fact, built into the whole
reason that we would be coming

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.990
to the table, which is
that no one else cares.

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:52.590
And so, Best Buy would
not want to buy, you know,

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:57.910
Windows 98 proprietary
file format emulators.

00:36:57.910 --> 00:37:00.600
And so, there's just no--
The consumers don't care.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.220
I think no one at this
table would actually care.

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:04.580
They wouldn't be harmed.

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:06.720
And so, as is often the case,

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.760
it would sort of only be the
conscientious folks who are trying

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:14.050
to do their jobs who would
be deterred in that context.

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:17.010
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Ms. Besek,
did you want to respond?

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:18.630
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:20.340
Sorry, the microphone.

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:21.650
&gt;&gt; June Besek: There
was an earlier comment

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:25.440
about whether the Copyright Office
has the power to do certain things

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.770
under regulations or
whether it would have

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:30.350
to be an amendment to the law.

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:35.540
And I don't think you can
really argue that things

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:37.340
like permitting anti-trafficking

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:42.140
or circumvention services are
currently embraced within the law.

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:48.800 position:56%
I mean, there are specific places
where it's permitted in section 1201

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.590
and elsewhere-- You
know, encryption research

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:58.130
and I think reverse engineering
where there's-- is that--

00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:00.220
Yeah, for interoperability.

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:03.480
You know, I think there
are-- and law enforcement.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:07.820
But I think that in general, the
way the statute is structured,

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:11.790
there really is no good argument
that you can do that now.

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:14.240
That's not to say that the
law couldn't be amended

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.670
and we're talking here about
whether that's a good idea or not.

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:20.460
But I don't think it can just be
done right now through regulation.

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:21.760
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.530
Mr. Perry, you've had your
placard up for a while.

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:25.830
&gt;&gt; David M. Perry:
Well, not surprisingly,

00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:30.810
I guess I would echo a lot of
what Mr. Greenstein was saying.

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:34.860
Even this discussion so far
today I think illustrates

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:38.620
that not all software is created
equal, that maybe the expressive

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:43.060
versus the functionality
divide is something

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:44.850
that really needs to be focused on.

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:52.680
And maybe it's easier when
you're in the automotive realm.

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:58.460
Maybe that's an easier case
because everybody-- Not everybody.

00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:01.060
I think a lot of people
can appreciate that a lot

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:05.020
of the software that's in
your car is not expressive.

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:06.320
It's functional.

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:07.620
It's literally under the hood.

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:11.110 position:56%
And in fact, it's all over your car.

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:14.850
It's hidden to everybody.

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:21.710 position:56%
And you know, whether there will be
litigation to bear out that software

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:26.670
that now serves what was once a
purely electromechanical function

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:30.610
does not enjoy protection
at all-- that may happen.

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:35.080
It may happen in litigation,
which of course is very costly.

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:40.030
We-- You know, our client, an
aftermarket auto parts company,

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:43.980
a large company in that
space, was watching, you know,

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:47.160
with a lot of interest how the
exemption was going to come out--

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.130
if it was going to come out
and how it would be worded.

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:53.420
And so, you know, I think it's
worth noting that if you look

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:59.490
at the proposed class 21exemption
and you compare it with how it came

00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:04.220
out in the end, you know, the
proposed class included wording,

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:07.040
you know, by or on behalf
of the lawful owner.

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:09.270
We were very interested
in that wording.

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:13.830
Our client does a lot of
work on behalf of owners.

00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:16.830
Virtually no one in this
room probably could fix most

00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:19.460
of their car by themselves anymore.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:23.420
And if you look at the
final class exemption,

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:25.860 position:56%
it now says by the authorized owner.

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:29.930 position:56%
So our client and many others in
the aftermarket space I think looked

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:36.770
at that and said we still don't
have the clarity that we need

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:41.370
to do what we do, which is hundreds
of billions of dollars industry.

00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:46.400
And I think everybody-- Everyone
who has a car, if they haven't gone

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.660
to your local mechanic yet and
been told that there's something

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:52.270
that they just simply can't
fix because of the complexity

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:54.620
in the software, that's
going to happen

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:56.840
and it's increasingly occurring.

00:40:56.840 --> 00:41:02.850
And so, as Mr. Greenstein said,
you know, there is a competitive--

00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:07.630
or anti-competitive aspect to
this that has to be addressed.

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:14.800
And you know, there needs to
be a way that the aftermarket--

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:19.180
whether it's automotive or
others-- can deal with software.

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:21.280
And I know that's sort of
embedded software which was dealt

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:24.110
with separately-- but you know,
the expressive and the functional,

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:25.920
that's a pretty important line.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.900
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: To that
point-- Sorry.

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:32.050
I mean, are there any, sort
of, lessons in that respect

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:35.110
that we can draw from
the Unlocking Act?

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:41.970
I mean, has there been an
increase in sort of, you know,

00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:45.990
services that content owners might
find objectionable as a result

00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:50.740
of the third party
assistance being provided for?

00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:59.060
Please

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:01.360
&gt;&gt; Robert S. Schwartz: No.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:07.730 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Anyone else want to--
Well, Mr. Love can respond to that

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:10.890
or to the previous question.

00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:16.120
&gt;&gt; James Love: Allan
Adler brought up the issue

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.460
of regulation of locksmiths.

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:20.970 position:56%
I think that's something that
people probably should take a harder

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:22.270
look at.

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:26.320
If-- I don't think locksmiths
are really regulated everywhere.

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:29.360
But I think that in some
states, they definitely are.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:32.360 position:56%
And I think the idea that you'd have
people that have access to tools

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:33.900
that are not generally
available and that

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:36.260
in some cases they're
posting bonds--

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:38.790
you know, or the authorities
are aware of who they are.

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:40.540
They have certain responsibilities
and that--

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:45.020
and that they're reputable
citizens is sort of a--

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:46.930
makes a lot of sense in
that particular area.

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:50.510
And it may make sense in this
area in terms of the things.

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:52.110
I mean, you could imagine
a situation

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:56.510
where libraries develop
their own standards for sort

00:42:56.510 --> 00:43:01.070
of a self-regulatory-type
proposal where they could sort

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:05.580
of imagine practices that
were reasonable and limited

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:09.530
to the purposes to which
they're authorized to use works

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:14.970
under exceptions and where that
could-- That could flourish.

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:17.310
I think the problem is
you have this lobbying

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:24.110
from the motion picture industry,
the database industry, you know,

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:29.070
a few sectors of the economy, maybe
people with operating software

00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:31.440
that were commercial products,
mass market type products

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:35.600
for DRM protection and, you know,
back in 1996 and things like that.

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:39.250
And then, you have these laws that
just sweep everything into it.

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:44.470
And I think that what would have
been better is if sectors that felt

00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:47.260
that they deserved to
have the state intervene

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:51.070
and make things illegal would
themselves make the case

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:53.880
that motion pictures deserve
some kind of protection

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:58.190
or it may be other types of works
do as opposed to just starting

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:00.630
with the assumption that
everyone automatically,

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:03.080
no matter what the context
is, basically gets it.

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.180
So I think you should
have to make that case

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:06.480
that the state should
have to intervene.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:09.460
And in terms of the cost of
some of these systems in terms

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:13.390
of managing the cost
of differentiation,

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:17.130
I think it would be reasonable
that the people seeking the state

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:22.490
to provide the legal protection
could pay money to have--

00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:26.150
to share some of the cost of
administering these systems,

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:30.910
which are extensive, and that the
people that are seeking to operate

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:33.960
as providing services, they could
also bear some of the cost as well.

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:37.250
I mean, that could be kind
of an approach you might look

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:38.550
in some of the other areas.

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:43.080
The other thing I'd like to call
attention to is that EFF submitted

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:50.380
on April 21st, 2016 in the-- the
Food and Drug Administration,

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:52.880
they submitted comments
on management

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:56.370 position:56%
of cybersecurity in medical devices.

00:44:56.370 --> 00:45:01.850
And they described I think are
quite important some of the growth

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:05.210
of security interests and problems
that you have in medical devices

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:08.970
that are implanted in your body,
which could kill you, that--

00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:11.930
you know, where these issues
of DMCA protection come up.

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:15.730
It's just an example of how
far out-- You're going to have,

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:18.300
as other panelists have talked
about, in refrigerators and,

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:22.240
you know, operating your lights,
your-- everything about your home,

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:26.030
it's increasingly becoming-- You
know, we're enveloped in a system

00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:27.620
of artificial intelligence,

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:29.470
of people doing everything
you can possibly imagine,

00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:32.890
automatically driving
cars, managing your--

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:38.140
I spent $825 yesterday on getting a
pollution control device in my car.

00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:39.560
It's probably an aftermarket part.

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:40.860
I have to check.

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:46.810
I think that you've got this--
You've got this sort of bad model

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:51.480
for regulating much more than what
people anticipated 20 years ago.

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:53.320
And I think that you
just have to sort of--

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:57.190
You have to sort of get back
and take a different approach.

00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:59.210
You should have to prove
that you get the benefits

00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:02.340
of the technical protection from
the government, not just assume

00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:04.620
that it's there and then
you have to work backwards.

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:05.920
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:07.840
I think Mr. Turnbull is next.

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:10.570
&gt;&gt; Bruce Turnbull: I want
to make a couple of points.

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:14.820
One, while we have no
opinion on the sort of things

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:18.920
that are clearly distinct-- I
mean, the auto parts sector--

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:23.900
the concern that we do have is in
drawing the line between functional

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:27.800
and expressive, you could
unintentionally sort

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.140
of go too far the other
way, if you will.

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:36.300
And that is that in a DVD
player or a Blu-ray player,

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:41.360
what plays the content
is a computer program.

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:45.570
And so-- And it is subject
to certain requirements

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:48.930
under our licensing agreements
that require that it be robust

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:51.540
against attack in and of itself.

00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:55.710
What AACS and DVD CCA
provide are specifications

00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:58.370
for how those individual
programs would be developed.

00:46:58.370 --> 00:47:03.120
And so, if you-- If you simply
draw the line and say, well,

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:08.090
the content itself, the
expressive work that's encrypted

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:11.240
on the Blu-ray is protected
but the computer program

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:15.530
that plays it is not, that has the
effect of defeating our system.

00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:18.880
And we would-- we would be
very concerned about that.

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:22.450
And so, I think in drawing whatever
lines anybody is going to draw,

00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:26.980
that I think needs to be
very carefully preserved,

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:33.940
that the functionality that
actually enables the playback

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:38.340
of the expressive content
needs to be protected as well.

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:45.500
The other point I wanted to make
is that something that both DVD CCA

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:52.060 position:56%
and AACS LA have offered and has
never been taken up on is for people

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:55.430
who are interested
in various exemptions

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:58.580
or various functionalities
that are the subject

00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:03.240
of exemption requests periodically
ought to come talk to us about ways

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:06.930
in which this could be done
voluntarily and through tools

00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:12.250
that we could cooperatively develop
and could be licensed and agreed

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:15.900
to by the technology providers.

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:21.650
And you know, we've periodically
made efforts to do some on our own.

00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:25.480
But we would certainly be
open to cooperative efforts.

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:27.950
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Are you suggesting
you could license some sort

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:29.460
of a tool that would allow--

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:32.990
that would otherwise be
implicated by 1201(b)?

00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:34.290
&gt;&gt; Bruce Turnbull: Yes.

00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:38.930 position:56%
Well, not-- You would not-- I mean,
it wouldn't be implicated by 1201(b)

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:40.230
because it would be licensed.

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:46.080
So-- but for example, a number
of the exemptions have had to do

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:50.670
with short for-- you know,
clips, short portions of films

00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:52.850
that are on DVD or Blu-ray.

00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:58.190
There could be a tool that could
be developed that would enable

00:48:58.190 --> 00:49:02.860
that specifically and wouldn't
have people using tools that are--

00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:06.620
that are copying the entire movie.

00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:09.970
And there are various kinds of
ways that that could be done.

00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:12.030
And you know, I'm not saying
that it would be easy or simple.

00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:16.750
But there are ways that I think
that working together those kinds

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:18.150
of things could be developed.

00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:22.290 position:56%
And then, they could be presented
as part of an exemption if that was,

00:49:22.290 --> 00:49:23.800
you know, important aspect of it.

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.410 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Making it harder for
Mr. Butler to get Handbrake maybe.

00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:27.710
&gt;&gt; Bruce Turnbull: Yes, yeah.

00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:29.010
Yeah.

00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:30.310
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: OK.

00:49:30.310 --> 00:49:31.610
I want to steer the
conversation a little bit back

00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:32.910
to Kevin's earlier question,

00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:35.390
which was what can we learn
from the Unlocking Act.

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:38.750
And I notice Mr. Perry said
the proposed class 21 was

00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:42.710 position:56%
for an exemption for the auto
industry, auto repair for actions by

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:44.010
or on behalf of an owner.

00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:47.260
The Unlocking Act, that language
said that circumvention in the case

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:50.650
of unlocking cell phones may be
initiated by the owner of any

00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:54.420
such device or by another person
at the direction of the owner.

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:57.760
So I'm wondering, you know,
we can both think big in terms

00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:59.320
of perhaps there's actions

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:02.160
that would require some
sort of statutory reform.

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.710
But what are people's opinions

00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:09.460
on whether the triennial rulemaking
process should extend to language

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:11.400
such as status or risk,
is there a benefit?

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:12.700
Mr. Adler?

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:14.000
&gt;&gt; Allan Adler: Yeah.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.300
I think we should be very careful--

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:17.770
We need to be very
careful about generalizing

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:22.080
or extrapolating broadly
from what Congress was doing

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:23.960
with respect to that legislation.

00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:29.280
And the reason is, is because
the legislation was passed only

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:33.160
after Congress had satisfied
itself that by permitting

00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:34.680
such third party assistance,

00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:38.470
they were not threatening
anyone's copyrighted works.

00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:40.580
Representative of that,
this is a statement

00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:42.770
from the House Judiciary
Committee report.

00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:44.070
It says, "Circumvention

00:50:44.070 --> 00:50:47.780
for unlocking does not compromise
the security of the information

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:52.640
on the phone and it does not expose
any copyrighted works present

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:55.470
on the phone to increased
risk of infringement.

00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:58.050
Legalization of circumvention
that has

00:50:58.050 --> 00:51:01.800
such harmful effects is not
the intent of this legislation

00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:06.320
and it would not be
authorized by its provisions."

00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:09.500
The Senate Judiciary Committee
said the same thing in its report.

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:10.800
So--

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.100
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Can I just--

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:13.400
&gt;&gt; Allan Adler: -- they
set a pretty high bar

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.850
by determining before they acted

00:51:14.850 --> 00:51:18.190
that what they were
authorizing was not in fact going

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:21.680
to threaten infringement
of any copyrighted work.

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:22.980
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Can I just ask,

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:26.440
so what sort of evidence would
be useful or relevant to making

00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:27.890
that sort of determination?

00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:33.500
I mean, would we look to sort
of the prevalence of claims

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:38.280
that are targeting services
rather than devices?

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:44.560
I mean, in sort of evaluating
whether permitting third party

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:48.320
assistance would threaten
a particular market, what--

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:49.890
&gt;&gt; Allan Adler: I mean, over
time, we would be looking

00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:51.290
at those kinds of claims.

00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:56.460
We would see ultimately whether
or not there would be instances

00:51:56.460 --> 00:52:00.280
where allegations of
infringement resulting

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:03.130
from circumvention
could be traced back

00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:05.860
to what had been authorized
by the legislation.

00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:09.620 position:56%
I think what Congress did in this
instance and what anybody would have

00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:14.970
to do in being a proponent of
such third party assistance is

00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:19.500
to actually think through in
fact what is being circumvented

00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:23.840
and what are the consequences
of that specific circumvention.

00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:25.450
That's what Congress did.

00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:27.920
And it was precisely
because it determined

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:33.060
that that authorized circumvention,
done even by third parties,

00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:37.960
would not allow them to expose any
copyrighted works to infringement,

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:41.300
was the reason that Congress felt
comfortable authorizing that.

00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:42.600
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: So would
that be an argument

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:46.900
for allowing the Copyright Office
to make a similar assessment

00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:48.700
within the rulemaking or--

00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:50.000
&gt;&gt; Allan Adler: No,
quite the contrary.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.070
I think that this is a task that
only Congress should be permitted

00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:57.630
to do because it is so
significant in terms

00:52:57.630 --> 00:52:59.490
of its potential implications.

00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:03.160
And I think it's not something
that can simply be delegated

00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:05.420
to either the Register
or the Librarian.

00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:07.380
And if I may just add one
other thought in response

00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:09.520
to what my friend Brandon
said before, I mean,

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:14.530
we're very sympathetic to the whole
notion about libraries, archives,

00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:18.560 position:56%
academic institutions wanting to
preserve the works that are produced

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:21.750
by the people in my
industry and others.

00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:24.530
But there is another avenue
for them to pursue that.

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:26.710
As the Copyright Office well knows,

00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:29.940
a few years ago there was a
very comprehensive study done

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:32.660
of section 108 of the Copyright Act

00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:36.940
which specifically would have
allowed for addressing questions

00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:40.670
about digital preservation,
including preservation of works

00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:43.560
that only exist in digital form.

00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:47.980
And we have been interested
in seeing that study pursued,

00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:49.390
because we're not looking

00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:52.610
to essentially leave
these institutions locked

00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:55.720
into 20th century technology
capabilities

00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:57.540
with respect to preservation.

00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:01.000
But there again, you'd be
talking about first the question

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.260
of preservation and then
secondly, preservation to what end.

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:10.400
Simply the end of access to
those works ultimately being what

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:14.090 position:56%
preservation is about, you would
have to be able to determine whether

00:54:14.090 --> 00:54:17.230
in fact being able to
circumvent in order

00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:21.940
to preserve those works is simply
going to allow access by scholars

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:24.600
and students, faculty,
others who are using them

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:29.130
for legitimate purposes or would
the access policies subsequently

00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:32.150
threaten infringement in a way
that might question whether

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:36.640
or not circumvention needed to
be more tightly [inaudible].

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:37.940
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:39.240
Mr. Butler?

00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.780
&gt;&gt; Brandon Butler: Oh, boy.

00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:48.190
Yeah, so I wanted to-- I'll resist
responding to Allan for a minute.

00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:52.810
I wanted to come back to something
else briefly, which is another sort

00:54:52.810 --> 00:54:57.970
of risk in the question
of whether the beneficiary

00:54:57.970 --> 00:55:01.050 position:56%
of an exemption is going to actually
get the benefit of the exemption.

00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:04.280
That's I think a relatively
new risk is the question

00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:09.340
of whether the Office will
itself or will ask the proponents

00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:14.040
of an exemption to very
narrowly tailor that exemption

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:19.070
so that it steers far clear of
any connection to trafficking,

00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:21.660
because I think there are--

00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:26.400
there are activities that we would
say are clearly not trafficking.

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:29.580
So, you know, again,
internal assistance, right?

00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:36.740
So if an AV librarian is asked by
a faculty member to, you know, to--

00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:39.760
how to make a clip-- I'm
entitled to make a clip.

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:41.060
How do I do it?

00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:42.360
What do I use?

00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:44.780
That's something that we think
is not third party assistance.

00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:46.080
It's not trafficking.

00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.380
It's all internal.

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:51.880
If a documentary filmmaker has
an AV staff person on the staff

00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:56.940
of that film, but-- and the wording
of the exemptions in the past--

00:55:56.940 --> 00:56:00.550
in the 2010 and in
the 2012 iterations

00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:05.470
of the education exception
was nicely crafted I think.

00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:08.570
Actually and this is I think
probably on me and my students.

00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:11.350
We diverged from that
crafting for reasons

00:56:11.350 --> 00:56:12.970
that are lost now to
the mists of time.

00:56:12.970 --> 00:56:16.620
But there was a nice crafting that
said sort of the person engaging

00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:21.070
in the circumvention would be
allowed to circumvent for purposes

00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:24.740
of allowing educational uses
by faculty and students.

00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:28.800
So that distinction between the
person and the faculty made plenty

00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:31.600
of room in the plain
text for a librarian.

00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:34.700
But that got tightened up this
time around and that may be on us.

00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:38.730
But I want to make sure that that
is not something that is an outcome

00:56:38.730 --> 00:56:41.710
of this concern about
trafficking, where it gets so tight

00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:47.580 position:56%
that you can't have the AV person
on your staff help you work on this.

00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:49.420
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Mr. Greenstein,
did you want to follow

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:54.090 position:56%
up on this discussion as to whether,
you know, activities on behalf

00:56:54.090 --> 00:56:56.540
of an owner authorized
by should be something

00:56:56.540 --> 00:57:00.020
that the Office could consider,
and particularly Mr. Adler's point

00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:04.720
that it may be better considered
by Congress but also that Congress,

00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:06.170
in doing the Unlocking Act,

00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:08.830
was looking at whether
it was implicating access

00:57:08.830 --> 00:57:11.570
to copyrighted works?

00:57:11.570 --> 00:57:13.160
&gt;&gt; Seth Greenstein: Yes, thank you.

00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:16.090
So the legislative history

00:57:16.090 --> 00:57:19.330
that Allan was reciting
basically has a principle

00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:22.130
that is equally applicable to the
situation that we're talking about.

00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:24.200
The reasoning is exactly the same.

00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:29.770
Allowing circumvention by an
entity on behalf of the owner

00:57:29.770 --> 00:57:34.580 position:56%
of an automobile does not create any
risk of exercise of anything other

00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:35.880
than what's in the exemption.

00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:40.240
It does not put at risk the
integrity of access controls

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:43.070
or copy controls over
other types of software.

00:57:43.070 --> 00:57:44.370
It is really integral

00:57:44.370 --> 00:57:47.220
to the particular exemption
that's being granted.

00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:49.770
So similar to the rationale
of, well, we don't--

00:57:49.770 --> 00:57:52.050
You know, we want to make sure that
when you unlock the cell phone,

00:57:52.050 --> 00:57:54.450
you're not unlocking all of
the apps on the cell phone

00:57:54.450 --> 00:57:56.560 position:56%
or other types of copyrighted works.

00:57:56.560 --> 00:58:01.900
It's exactly the same because the
functionality aspect of what was

00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:05.830 position:56%
at issue in the Unlocking Act is the
same kind of functionality concern

00:58:05.830 --> 00:58:09.660
at issue with respect
to automobiles.

00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:12.990
Similarly, Mr. Adler tried
to draw the distinction

00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:15.050
between services and devices.

00:58:15.050 --> 00:58:17.570
And at least in the automotive
context, I don't think you can draw

00:58:17.570 --> 00:58:20.100
that distinction because
there is no way that Click

00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:26.250
and Clack can provide
circumvention service for Toyota,

00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:28.840
Volvo, Ford, GM, et cetera.

00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:31.710
There is just no way that
they can hire a hacking expert

00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:34.660
who understands the ins and
outs and intricacies of all

00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:36.200
of that different software.

00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:40.490
For some models, up to 70
or more software modules

00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:43.040
in a particular automobile
and different for each

00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:44.340
and every model of automobile.

00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:46.220
There is no way that they
can do that themselves.

00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:48.250
They need to rely on others

00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:50.430
who can create the tools
that make that possible.

00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:52.260
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: So you're saying
there needs to be a market

00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:57.220
for software for circumvention in
the aftermarket or auto repair?

00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:59.750
&gt;&gt; Seth Greenstein: Yes, and
I'm intrigued by the suggestion

00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:01.650
that there might be
some kind of, you know,

00:59:01.650 --> 00:59:05.000
authorization for locksmiths
or something along those lines.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:06.690
I'm not sure that I agree with it.

00:59:06.690 --> 00:59:09.900
But I'm at least intrigued
by the direction of that.

00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:11.200
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Well, which
way does that cut though?

00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:12.870
I mean, if we're, you know--

00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:17.790
If you can't separate services
from devices, is there a concern

00:59:17.790 --> 00:59:24.340
that allowing services could
incentivize the growth of a market,

00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:27.570
you know-- incentivize
the development of tools

00:59:27.570 --> 00:59:32.420
which I think some would be
concerned couldn't be limited

00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:39.090
in their use to things
covered by an exemption?

00:59:39.090 --> 00:59:40.600
&gt;&gt; Seth Greenstein: I don't
think that concern exists

00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:42.890
for the particular market
that we're concerned with,

00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:46.180
the automotive market, because
the nature of the software is

00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:50.920 position:56%
so particularized and particularized
to each and every model of car,

00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:53.600
that I don't think you
have a generalized concern

00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:56.040
of a one-size-breaks-all.

00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:59.330
You know, this is really a
situation where a specific tool has

00:59:59.330 --> 01:00:02.250
to be provided for a specific piece
of software, for a particular part

01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:05.700
and function of a particular
model of automobile.

01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:07.650
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: So I want
to ask one more follow-up

01:00:07.650 --> 01:00:10.300
about the auto industry
and open it up and then get

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:12.900
to Mr. Kupferschmid,
who has been patient.

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:15.530 position:56%
But you know, during the rulemaking,
we heard a lot about the memorandums

01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:16.830
of understanding and sort

01:00:16.830 --> 01:00:18.560
of voluntary initiatives
and partnerships.

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:23.300
And Mr. Turnbull just suggested in
audiovisual that, you know, his--

01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:26.170
who he represents is open
to voluntary initiatives.

01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:29.940
Is there some way to facilitate
cooperation with the aftermarket,

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:35.120
that short of, you
know, upending 1201(b)?

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:37.920 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Seth Greenstein: I have very
strong doubts that that is possible,

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:40.100
which is why even despite
the existence--

01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:43.240 position:56%
Look, if the memorandum of
understanding had solved this issue,

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.930
Auto Care Association would not be
here on behalf of its 3000 members.

01:00:46.930 --> 01:00:49.200
It does not address
all of the issues.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:52.190 position:56%
And the circumvention aspects, well,

01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:56.400
the anti-circumvention tools are
becoming more and more intricate

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.250
and particularized
each and every day

01:00:58.250 --> 01:01:02.000
and often have absolutely nothing
to do with the copyrighted work.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.260
For example, this particular
software that's put

01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:08.020
in automobiles can be tied

01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:10.800
to the vehicle identification
number of that vehicle.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.060
And that's purely for
anticompetitive purposes.

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:16.110
It has nothing to do with the
copyrighted work or the expression

01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:17.590
or even the functionality.

01:01:17.590 --> 01:01:19.440
It's purely to protect the market.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:23.020
But yet, there's no way to provide
circumvention for that aspect

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:25.540
of the car or the software alone

01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:28.380
without addressing the other
aspects of circumvention.

01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:29.680
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.450
Mr. Perry, did you want to
chime in on that question?

01:01:31.450 --> 01:01:32.750
&gt;&gt; David Perry: Right.

01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:34.960
Well, if, I mean, if you're
playing devil's advocate,

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:41.690
I don't think our client or Mr.
Greenstein's constituents want sort

01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:47.070
of wild abandonment in the world
of the aftermarket for automobiles.

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:52.600
Nobody wants a safety, you know,
a safety hazard and trafficking

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:55.100
of any kind of software

01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:57.870
or anti-circumvention
device that's going

01:01:57.870 --> 01:02:02.540
to make it unsafe for any of us.

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:06.090
But to-- You know, if
there's a suggestion--

01:02:06.090 --> 01:02:09.190
if you're on the side of the
automobile manufacturers,

01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:11.820
if there's a suggestion
that, well, it's already--

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:15.180
it's available, you just have to
come to us and we'll license it

01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:20.710
to you, I think that
suggestion is kind of deceptive.

01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:24.230
It's not practical.

01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:29.520
You know, the after-- I think
the benefits of allowing,

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:32.680
at least in this industry, the
aftermarket to do what they have

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:37.980
to do far outweigh the
parade of horribles

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:42.530
that could be attributed to it.

01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:46.200 position:56%
And you know, I think I agree with
what Mr. Greenstein is saying about,

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:49.930
you know, VIN-specific software
means a very real issue.

01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:53.650
I mean, if you are in
the bay, in your garage,

01:02:53.650 --> 01:02:59.520
and you find that the software, you
know, for one Ford F-150 or GM is,

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:01.280
you know, for this car and
then there is a different one

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:05.680
for that car, it makes it-- from
a practical standpoint, copyright

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:13.560 position:56%
and DRM has now impacted your
ability to do what 25 years ago used

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:16.440
to be done on a regular basis.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.740
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:19.040
Mr. Kupferschmid?

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:20.340
&gt;&gt; Keith Kupferschmid: Thank you.

01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:21.640
I hope you'll give me
a little bit of leeway.

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:22.940
A lot of questions have passed
since I put my card up here.

01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:24.240
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Yeah, you can
take it back a little bit.

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.880
&gt;&gt; Keith Kupferschmid: Trying
to keep this all on track.

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:29.780 position:56%
So I think kind of going in
reverse order here, I have to admit,

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:34.020
I don't know that much
about the auto industry.

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:39.290
And I do know there's this
sort of MOU we've been talking

01:03:39.290 --> 01:03:40.590
about and voluntary agreement.

01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:41.970
I don't know how that came about.

01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:45.970
I hear from you all that
it doesn't do the job.

01:03:45.970 --> 01:03:47.970
But frankly, that's-- excuse me--

01:03:47.970 --> 01:03:51.630
one of the beauties of voluntary
agreements is you can hopefully go

01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:53.480
back to the parties that
you were able to bring

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:57.010
to the table the first time and
say, hey, this isn't working.

01:03:57.010 --> 01:04:01.430
Can we come up with some mutually
agreeable solutions and update it?

01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:03.740
I mean, that's a lot
easier to do than sort

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:06.600
of running to Congress, I think.

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:12.890
Our concern, as I think
Kevin mentioned a while ago,

01:04:12.890 --> 01:04:17.770 position:56%
is of course once you've got these
anti-trafficking tools are available

01:04:17.770 --> 01:04:21.930
in the marketplace, even if they're
for ostensibly lawful purposes,

01:04:21.930 --> 01:04:27.250
they will inevitably become useful
for-- or used for unlawful purposes

01:04:27.250 --> 01:04:28.780
and make them impossible to police.

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:31.630
Now, we've heard, that at least
in the auto industry, no, no, no,

01:04:31.630 --> 01:04:33.610
that's sort of very specific.

01:04:33.610 --> 01:04:36.350
But then we've also heard, wait
a minute, you can't divide--

01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:40.160
do this dividing line
between devices and services.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:44.500
They want the dividing line between
functional and expressive, OK?

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:47.560
And that becomes a
concern because, you know,

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:49.300
where do you draw that line, right?

01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:51.830
Is Adobe Photoshop
functional or expressive?

01:04:51.830 --> 01:04:53.530
What about TurboTax?

01:04:53.530 --> 01:04:56.350
What about iWatch, or the
software on your iWatch?

01:04:56.350 --> 01:05:00.630
I mean, at the heart of it,
all software is functional,

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:04.070
at least to a degree, or at
least I would hope it would be.

01:05:04.070 --> 01:05:08.630
And so, sort of drawing that
line, I think it's interesting

01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:10.670
and telling that, you
know, I participated

01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:14.620
in the embedded software
roundtable on Wednesday.

01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:16.640
And we kind of separated
these two issues.

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:20.520
But it's clear they should not have
been separated because it was sort

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:24.360
of taboo to talk about 1201
on Wednesday and now it's--

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:28.320
We're talking probably more
about embedded software today

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:32.800
than we are specifically 1201 or
the anti-trafficking provisions.

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:36.170
Ultimately, I think we have
to be really, really careful

01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:38.430
about where we draw the
lines, how we draw the lines.

01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:39.920
I made this point on Wednesday.

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:42.880
It could lead to a lot of
inadvertent consequences.

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:47.030
And in this particular instance,
you know, things seem to be,

01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:50.200
like I said, working quite well.

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:52.180
I know that's not true
across the board.

01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:54.730
But we have to be careful
not to throw the baby

01:05:54.730 --> 01:05:56.410
out with the bathwater here.

01:05:56.410 --> 01:05:59.000
I think in terms of the auto
industry, maybe other industries,

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.800
voluntary agreements and working
sort of outside of Congress is,

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:08.770 position:56%
sort of, probably a better approach,
a better way to go about trying

01:06:08.770 --> 01:06:12.850
to solve this problem
that we're hearing today.

01:06:12.850 --> 01:06:14.150
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:17.340
Mr. Sheffner, and I think, again,
if you feel like we're talking

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:20.450
about 1201 and if that implicates
embedded software, feel free.

01:06:20.450 --> 01:06:22.760
We heard about the swear
jar from Wednesday.

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:27.380
But you can answer the question if
it specifically implicates 1201.

01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:28.680
&gt;&gt; Ben Sheffner: All right.

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:30.090
I'll try to be brief because Mr.
Kupferschmid actually just made

01:06:30.090 --> 01:06:32.790
several of the points
that I intended to.

01:06:32.790 --> 01:06:35.550
But I'd go back, I think,
two or three questions ago

01:06:35.550 --> 01:06:41.480
about whether the Copyright
Office itself is authorized

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:45.610
under the statute to create
exceptions to the prohibitions

01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:47.130
on trafficking

01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:50.100
and anti-circumvention
devices and services.

01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:51.850
And as June Besek said
a few minutes ago,

01:06:51.850 --> 01:06:53.300
I think the answer is clearly no.

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:56.690
And I believe that the Copyright
Office itself has acknowledged

01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:58.970
that in previous rulemakings.

01:06:58.970 --> 01:07:03.960
And I actually don't even think
anybody here today has suggested

01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:07.280
that the Copyright Office on its
own, under the current statute,

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:09.300
can create those exemptions.

01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:11.100
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: And so, to be
clear, you're taking the language

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:13.260
of the Unlocking Act, for example,

01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:16.670
you think would necessarily--
requires Congress?

01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:17.970
&gt;&gt; Ben Sheffner: Yeah.

01:07:17.970 --> 01:07:21.100
I mean, I think that's further-- I
think it was done that way in part

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:22.430
because of an acknowledgement

01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:26.170
that the current statute does
not permit the Copyright Office

01:07:26.170 --> 01:07:27.470
to do that on its own.

01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:30.270
And again, I don't believe
anybody here has argued

01:07:30.270 --> 01:07:36.590
that the Copyright Office
can create exemptions

01:07:36.590 --> 01:07:38.440
to the prohibitions on trafficking.

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:40.280
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: And do
you agree with Mr. Adler

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.580
that the Copyright Office--

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:43.010
there should not be a reform

01:07:43.010 --> 01:07:46.420
so that the Copyright Office could
make the determination whether

01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:49.320
service on behalf of an owner
might implicate copyrighted works?

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:52.480
I mean, and I'm thinking, you
know, perhaps providing a way,

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:54.270
whether there could be
an evidentiary basis

01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:57.670
so the Office could, for example,
draw a line between circumventions

01:07:57.670 --> 01:08:01.120
for motion pictures
versus auto repair.

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:02.900
&gt;&gt; Ben Sheffner: We would
agree with Mr. Adler

01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:06.890
that the time is not right
to open up the statute.

01:08:06.890 --> 01:08:13.010
I mean, I think, look, there are
legitimate policy arguments here,

01:08:13.010 --> 01:08:16.390
you know, especially by
the auto repair people.

01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:19.550
I mean, I would point out-- We
haven't heard from the other side

01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:21.390
on that issue, at least
at this forum.

01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:24.050
So I don't think you
should necessarily take

01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:27.400
as gospel everything you've heard
on that without hearing-- Yeah.

01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:28.700
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: No, I mean--

01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:30.000
And obviously we're also
looking at written comments.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.300
&gt;&gt; Ben Sheffner: Absolutely.

01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:35.610
But yes, as Mr. Adler said,
this is a major policy change

01:08:35.610 --> 01:08:38.370
that I think I would
require an act of Congress.

01:08:38.370 --> 01:08:41.680
Then of course, once you open
up the act, we're not just going

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:43.570
to be talking about
this one specific issue.

01:08:43.570 --> 01:08:46.170
I mean there's-- lots of people
have lots of different concerns,

01:08:46.170 --> 01:08:49.040
things they would like to change,
not just about section 1201,

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:52.700
but of course other
aspects of the DMCA thing.

01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:55.560
It's impossible to
confine it to that.

01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:59.020
And then, just to quickly
wrap up, I think you asked one

01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:03.220
or two questions ago about,
well, what are the risks

01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:07.390 position:56%
if we do permit exemptions for the--

01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:10.410
exemptions to the anti-trafficking
provisions.

01:09:10.410 --> 01:09:12.820
I think we've touched
on some of them before.

01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:18.380
But again, look, the basic problem
is that even if you acknowledge

01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:22.780
that there might be legitimate
reasons or that there are people

01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:26.350
who have been granted exemptions
to engage in circumvention

01:09:26.350 --> 01:09:29.610
and need a device or a
service or a piece of software

01:09:29.610 --> 01:09:33.220
to do what they want to do,
the problem is that those--

01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:35.820
especially as to devices
or pieces of software,

01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:38.340
obviously can't differentiate
between the legitimate

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:41.280
and the illegitimate uses, at
least as to motion pictures.

01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:44.290
I mean, once you put it on
the shelf at Walmart, yes,

01:09:44.290 --> 01:09:48.280
you might have people-- you
know, Mr. Butler may be able and,

01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:51.140
you know, his colleagues would
use it for legitimate purposes

01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:52.900
under the, you know,
under the exemptions

01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:54.200
that they've been granted.

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:57.230
But probably the vast majority
of consumers would think, hey,

01:09:57.230 --> 01:09:58.600
here's a piece of software.

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:01.980
It says that I can rip
DVDs and Blu-ray players.

01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:03.280
That sounds kind of nifty.

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:04.580
I should be able to do that.

01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:08.480 position:56%
And it actually sort of-- It
confuses consumers and misleads them

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:12.310
into thinking that it's a
legitimate activity where it's not.

01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:15.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: I just wonder though,
you know, where does that leave us

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:21.090
and is there any sort of
proposal that you would suggest?

01:10:21.090 --> 01:10:25.830
I mean, just sort of anecdotally
at least, it would seem plausible

01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:33.230
to conclude that there, you
know, is a material set of people

01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:37.020
who are beneficiaries of exemptions
who, just as a practical matter,

01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:41.820
don't have the technical
capability to circumvent.

01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:44.770
So I just wonder are we stuck just

01:10:44.770 --> 01:10:47.330
without any sort of
possible solution?

01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:51.320 position:56%
I mean, I think one thing that we've
suggested is, well, what, you know--

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:53.590
could we be granted
authority to at least consider

01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:55.330
that as part of the rulemaking?

01:10:55.330 --> 01:10:58.550
&gt;&gt; Ben Sheffner: Well, I would
say at least as to motion pictures

01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:01.560
and the exemptions that have been
granted as to audiovisual works,

01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:02.860
I actually don't think
there's a problem.

01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:05.840
I mean, I think Mr. Butler
acknowledged them, you know,

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:08.060
a few minutes ago, and I
wrote down what he said.

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:12.790 position:56%
He said, with quote, "We haven't
been terribly deterred from engaging

01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:16.750 position:56%
in the activity which is
authorized by the exemptions that he

01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:18.140
and his colleagues
have been granted."

01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:19.440
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Yeah,
but-- And is he talking

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.710
about prohibited activity or--

01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:24.390
&gt;&gt; Ben Sheffner: Well, I'm not
saying that he's been engaged.

01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:25.690
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Well, right.

01:11:25.690 --> 01:11:27.130
&gt;&gt; Ben Sheffner: Or
that-- And I don't think--

01:11:27.130 --> 01:11:28.730
and frankly, by going--
by going off--

01:11:28.730 --> 01:11:30.340
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: But I mean, I
think that's the argument, right?

01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:32.780
I mean, that you're
just sort of, you know,

01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:35.960 position:56%
encouraging people to break the law.

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.610
&gt;&gt; Ben Sheffner: Well,
I don't believe

01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:41.350
that I've accused Mr.
Butler of breaking the law.

01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:45.260
What I've acknowledged is the
practical reality that he is able

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:49.690
to go and find tools to do
what he's been authorized to do

01:11:49.690 --> 01:11:52.630
by the Copyright Office
and that the other--

01:11:52.630 --> 01:11:55.010
the other option, which
is to say, OK,

01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:56.700
well he's been granted
the exemption,

01:11:56.700 --> 01:12:00.760 position:56%
therefore there should be, you
know, a lawful market in trafficking

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:04.330
and anti-circumvention
devices, has worse results,

01:12:04.330 --> 01:12:08.660
has worse consequences,
that look at--

01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:11.940
that I will say that the
situation today isn't perfect.

01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:15.950
But the alternative of permitting,
you know, a legitimate market

01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:19.990
in circumvention devices or
software would be much worse.

01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:21.850
And it would just mainstream
that activity

01:12:21.850 --> 01:12:26.760
and in a sense swallow the rule
against circumvention itself.

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.060
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: OK.

01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:29.360
Thank you.

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.660
Mr. Schwartz?

01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:31.960
&gt;&gt; Robert S. Schwartz: Well,
just as a rhetorical question,

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:35.320
I know you're here to ask
questions, but if everybody agrees

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:37.120
that the Copyright Office

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:42.510
and Register Librarian do not
have the power to grant exemptions

01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:47.020
with respect to trafficking,
then why worry about giving

01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:52.230
that appearance in the course of
legitimately acting on a petition

01:12:52.230 --> 01:12:55.980
for exemption that is before you?

01:12:55.980 --> 01:13:03.290
To get to this point, as you did in
the case of autos, you already need

01:13:03.290 --> 01:13:06.570
to conclude that this
is a lawful activity

01:13:06.570 --> 01:13:09.520
that is being petitioned for.

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:14.950
So why is it necessary,
again rhetorically--

01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:20.170
is it necessary to look down the
page to (a)(2) and (b)(1) and say,

01:13:20.170 --> 01:13:25.480
oh my gosh, if we grant
this petition in the terms

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:30.960
for which it's been petitioned for,
so as to-- however you phrase it--

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:36.840
allow some expert assistance in
the form of a service or, you know,

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:43.770 position:56%
somebody's aftermarket product or
software, no court is going to say--

01:13:43.770 --> 01:13:49.480
because they can read the law too--
that, oh my gosh, we're not going

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:56.130 position:56%
to allow this case against a
trafficker to proceed under the DMCA

01:13:56.130 --> 01:14:00.000
because the Copyright
Office granted an exemption

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.850
to a user who had a lawful right.

01:14:02.850 --> 01:14:08.610
I mean, respectfully, I don't agree
that the law should be interpreted

01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:13.190
to take that power away
from the Copyright Office.

01:14:13.190 --> 01:14:18.590
The NTIA didn't think so
in its recommendations.

01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:22.000
At least our reading of
the legislative history,

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.800
when you read all of the
legislative history at the time

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:29.360
that this was presented to the
Congress in terms of black boxes

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:34.670
and for one purpose and not wanting
to interfere with interoperability

01:14:34.670 --> 01:14:40.820
or the legitimate activities
of retailers and servicers.

01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:46.400
So again, back to your question
of what evidence is necessary,

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:49.540
once you've concluded that
the activity is lawful

01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:52.090
and you've concluded that
it doesn't involve copying

01:14:52.090 --> 01:14:57.240
of expressive content, if you still
need to look for any evidence,

01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:00.420
if you're worried about
trafficking, then look to those

01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:04.120
who oppose the exemption
to provide such evidence.

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:07.610
Otherwise, there should be a
presumption under the power

01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:12.620
that you already have that it
includes the right to expert help,

01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:16.620
just as it was silently
assumed in the case of phones,

01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:19.110
or else nobody would have
ever gotten the benefit

01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:20.690
of those exemptions.

01:15:20.690 --> 01:15:23.470
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:26.530
&gt;&gt; Andrew Moore: So turning--
Sorry, turning away a little bit

01:15:26.530 --> 01:15:27.870
from the rulemaking process,

01:15:27.870 --> 01:15:35.280
the Unlocking Technology Act is
proposing to amend 1201 (a)(2)

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:40.660
to tie trafficking to-- rather
than to circumvention specifically,

01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:43.080
but to facilitating
infringement by circumvention.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:47.890
I was wondering if I could get your
thoughts on that as an alternative.

01:15:47.890 --> 01:15:53.540
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Just-- I know
there were a couple of cards up.

01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:56.490
If you all wanted to respond
to previous questions,

01:15:56.490 --> 01:16:00.720
I think feel free to do so, while
others can think about a response

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:03.530
to the proposed legislation.

01:16:03.530 --> 01:16:05.770
So, Mr. Butler?

01:16:05.770 --> 01:16:07.070
&gt;&gt; Brandon Butler: Sure.

01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:12.010 position:56%
So just to sort of revise and extend
my remarks from a minute ago, the--

01:16:12.010 --> 01:16:17.040 position:56%
while Handbrake seems to work fairly
well, a problem that we've seen--

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.720
and a general problem that we've
seen in all of these panels

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:22.610
from beneficiaries is we
don't know what we don't know

01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:27.530
about how much better these things
could be, how harmed we are,

01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:31.720 position:56%
what we can and can't do because
our behaviors are shaped by the law.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:33.640
So we have Handbrake.

01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:35.400
Handbrake does what Handbrake does.

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:36.830
That seems to be great.

01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:42.820 position:56%
We don't know what someone would do
if Mr. Turnbull were to license them

01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:45.490
and they were to take full
advantage or if they were

01:16:45.490 --> 01:16:47.330
to get the benefit of an exemption.

01:16:47.330 --> 01:16:49.190
We don't know what the
market would do in terms

01:16:49.190 --> 01:16:50.750
of generating better tools.

01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:55.260
We also-- We just got an exemption
for Blu-ray, and Blu-ray is harder.

01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:59.190
And I'm actually looking forward
in a perverse way, looking for a,

01:16:59.190 --> 01:17:01.590
you know, I'm curious
what will happen.

01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:03.370
Will people really get to use it?

01:17:03.370 --> 01:17:04.670
Because it is harder.

01:17:04.670 --> 01:17:05.970
It takes longer.

01:17:05.970 --> 01:17:07.270
It's a big file.

01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:08.570
There are sort of two or three
different software processes

01:17:08.570 --> 01:17:09.870
involved in the ripping.

01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:12.630
So how will that work
as easily as DVD.

01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:16.040
And then, of course, in the
future what's going to happen?

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:18.280
And none of this stuff is going
to be on the shelf at Walmart.

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:20.760
And so, if that's what we're
worried about, let's, you know,

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:23.680
open the floodgates for
the specialized users

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:26.670
because they're not-- You know,
mechanics don't shop at Walmart

01:17:26.670 --> 01:17:29.190
for the products that
they need to rip cars.

01:17:29.190 --> 01:17:31.320
We don't shop at Walmart for
the products that we need.

01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:33.850
You know, the digital
preservation librarian

01:17:33.850 --> 01:17:37.860
at UVA has this huge bizarre
computer tower thing that has all

01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:39.180
of these obsolete drives in it.

01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:40.660
It's a specialized tool.

01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:42.880
That's the kind of stuff that
we buy and we shop from people

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:44.180
who sell that kind of stuff.

01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:45.480
And it's not Walmart.

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:46.820
So that might be helpful.

01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:48.120
Maybe there's some consensus here.

01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:50.210
If we can keep it out of
Walmart, it's all good.

01:17:50.210 --> 01:17:51.510
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Ms. Besek?

01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:57.220
&gt;&gt; June Besek: I just want
to make a couple of points.

01:17:57.220 --> 01:18:00.390
One is on the power of
the Copyright Office

01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:05.140
to allow circumvention
services or tools.

01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:09.730
You know, I heard the quote
from legislative history.

01:18:09.730 --> 01:18:12.550
But first of all, that was
a statement on the floor.

01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:16.200
So I think we have to take
that as that individual's view.

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:18.860
And secondly, legislative
history one only resorts

01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:20.350
to if the statute isn't clear.

01:18:20.350 --> 01:18:22.780
And I think in this case,
the statute is fairly clear.

01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:25.050
So that's obviously the
first place you go to,

01:18:25.050 --> 01:18:26.730
to understand the statute.

01:18:26.730 --> 01:18:30.980
The other point I want to
make is about the functional

01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:33.650
versus expressive approach.

01:18:33.650 --> 01:18:35.630
I've been in copyright
now for 30 years

01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:38.000
and I really never thought
I'd spend as much time talking

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.790
about automobile repair
as we have today.

01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:43.900
And I find it a little
disconcerting.

01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:49.000
And I am-- I really would not want
decisions about automobile repair

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.190
and replacement parts to
drive-- no pun intended--

01:18:53.190 --> 01:18:56.310
the decisions about circumvention,

01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:59.530
circumvention devices,
circumvention services.

01:18:59.530 --> 01:19:03.710
And if that means ultimately
there has to be some distinction

01:19:03.710 --> 01:19:07.780
between software that governs
functional works and then,

01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:09.880 position:56%
on the other hand, expressive works.

01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:13.830 position:56%
And on that expressive works side, I
would add anything that has to deal

01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:16.600
with any kind of playback device.

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:18.530
Then maybe that's the
route we have to go on.

01:19:18.530 --> 01:19:22.720
But if-- you know, I'm concerned
that, you know, there is a lot

01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:27.180
of understandable concern
on the part of the public

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:28.480
about not being able

01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:31.820
to get replacement parts
for functional devices.

01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:39.050
And if that is going to affect
the rules that govern, you know,

01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:44.300
books on e-book readers and movies
and all those kinds of things,

01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:46.630
then I think that we have to
jettison some of those things

01:19:46.630 --> 01:19:47.930
or treat them separately.

01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:52.780
Because I don't think
that ultimately

01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:56.300
that copyright interests are
going to win the hearts and minds

01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:59.030
of the American people on this.

01:19:59.030 --> 01:20:01.220
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:05.130
So we have a couple of placards up.

01:20:05.130 --> 01:20:07.330
If you care to respond
to the question

01:20:07.330 --> 01:20:13.010
about the Unlocking Act,
we would welcome that.

01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:14.310
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:17.270
Yes, the proposed Unlocking--

01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:18.970
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: The
Unlocking Technology Act.

01:20:18.970 --> 01:20:20.670
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: -- Technology
Act that's been proposed.

01:20:20.670 --> 01:20:24.010
Mr. Love, did you have--

01:20:24.010 --> 01:20:25.410
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:20:25.410 --> 01:20:26.710
&gt;&gt; Andrew Moore: Yeah, sorry.

01:20:26.710 --> 01:20:34.700
The Unlocking Technology Act that
was proposed ties circumvention

01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:40.500
in 1201 (a)(2) to facilitating
infringement by circumvention.

01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:47.320
So I was wondering what
your opinions were on that.

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:54.570
&gt;&gt; James Love: I would agree with
Professor Besek's comment about,

01:20:54.570 --> 01:20:56.060
you know, not worried about the--

01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:59.780
about, you know, like the
automobile industry sort

01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:01.080
of driving the copyright thing.

01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:04.130 position:56%
You could also turn that on its head
and you could sort of say, you know,

01:21:04.130 --> 01:21:06.440
the rest of the economy maybe
doesn't want the motion picture

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:10.220
industry and, you know,
the book industry

01:21:10.220 --> 01:21:12.840
to drive the rest of
the economy either.

01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:15.940
I think that the marriage
between these two things is--

01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:19.720
I would agree it is problematic.

01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:21.550
I go back to the idea on the act.

01:21:21.550 --> 01:21:27.170
I think it'd be good if you imagine
at least two tiers of approaches,

01:21:27.170 --> 01:21:31.720 position:56%
one for areas where you think maybe
the whole regime is kind of intended

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:35.780
for in the first instance and
where people feel comfortable

01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:38.010
that they're kind of working
towards solutions in that area.

01:21:38.010 --> 01:21:42.360 position:56%
And then, a second area where kind
of the collateral damage of the DMC,

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:46.180
you know, where automobile
sector, medical devices,

01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:49.580
garage door openers, inkjet
cartridges, all that sort of stuff.

01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:53.540
And then-- and that you
begin again the process

01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:56.150
of not treating everything
exactly the same.

01:21:56.150 --> 01:21:58.630
In Europe-- By the way, in that
licensing issue that was brought

01:21:58.630 --> 01:22:02.010
up before-- in Europe,
there's an obligation in the--

01:22:02.010 --> 01:22:07.920
for copyright owners
to take measures

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:10.530
that make exceptions
available to people.

01:22:10.530 --> 01:22:14.580
It isn't really clear what happens
if they don't take those measures.

01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:17.280
But it's sort of-- You know, there
is an affirmative obligation.

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:20.000 position:56%
I don't think there's any obligation
like that in the US system

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.300
and I think that's a mistake.

01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:25.570
If you really want the automobile
manufacturers to license people

01:22:25.570 --> 01:22:27.840
to compete against them
and sell cheaper parts

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:30.440
than the automobile manufacturer
wants to charge themselves

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:32.040
and they have no obligation
to do so,

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:35.240
I don't see why they
would want to do that.

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:41.070
And so, this idea that people
within a sector should have

01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:45.490 position:56%
to have an affirmative obligation to
license the technology or the tools

01:22:45.490 --> 01:22:48.510
or whatever like that to address
something is a first step,

01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:51.650
but also puts an obligation on
people that are seeking to traffic

01:22:51.650 --> 01:22:53.460
in devices and things
like that to pursue

01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:55.360
that opportunity before they resort

01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:58.200
to their own do-it-yourself
kind of remedies as well.

01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:01.830
That may be kind of a
compromise where you have a step

01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:04.480
where the people that are
affected the most by it have--

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:07.980
you know, have to be approached,
work out the basic details,

01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:10.340
understand kind of what the
parameters and the debate are.

01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:13.720
And then if that fails, you know,
then you can sort of imagine kind

01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:18.050
of things moving on to like a
different set of obligations.

01:23:18.050 --> 01:23:20.930
I just want to mention
also in the licensing

01:23:20.930 --> 01:23:24.990
that in President Obama's
books on Kindle,

01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:29.610
text-to-speech is turned
off on almost all of them.

01:23:29.610 --> 01:23:32.770
And this is after like
massive protest in front

01:23:32.770 --> 01:23:35.970
of the Authors Guild and tons
of letters to the president

01:23:35.970 --> 01:23:41.650 position:56%
of the United States from blind
people, a fairly high profile thing.

01:23:41.650 --> 01:23:44.820
And if you go on Amazon
right now and check

01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:46.610
on President Obama's Kindle things,

01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:48.710
you will see that text-to-speech
is turned off.

01:23:48.710 --> 01:23:51.400
So this is essentially
a licensing scenario,

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:53.380 position:56%
it's a technical protection measure.

01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:55.310
This is either a switch
that's either turned

01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:58.270
on or turned off by Amazon.

01:23:58.270 --> 01:24:03.720
Random House famously turns
it off as a default position.

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:09.140 position:56%
And it just goes to the frustration
people have when say just call us up

01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:10.440
and we'll fix the problem.

01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:12.400
That doesn't really often work.

01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:13.980 position:56%
And I think people have to recognize

01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:17.070
that that's not a very
satisfying thing for consumers,

01:24:17.070 --> 01:24:18.910
just sort of say that
the people will fix it,

01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:22.300
particularly when you have
devices where things have moved on,

01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:24.800
there's a lot of cost
in fixing the problem.

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:26.930
Interoperability interfaces
have changed.

01:24:26.930 --> 01:24:29.230
People talk about having
refrigerators with blue screens

01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:31.840
of death because the
software no longer works.

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:35.130
I think you have to recognize that
people just don't follow through

01:24:35.130 --> 01:24:37.000
and fix a lot of these problems.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.300
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:39.600
So we have just a couple
of minutes left.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:41.280
So I think this is going to
be the last call for comments,

01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:42.820
and if we can try to
keep them brief.

01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:46.730
But I think since your comments,
Mr. Love, involved Random House

01:24:46.730 --> 01:24:48.540
and publishing, we'll
call on Mr. Adler next.

01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:49.840
Thank you.

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:52.880
&gt;&gt; Allan Adler: I just wanted to
address the previous question,

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:55.600
if I could quickly respond
to Jamie, on the issue--

01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:57.640
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: I think-- speak a
little closer on the microphone?

01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:58.940
&gt;&gt; Allan Adler: Yeah.

01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:02.060
On the issue of an
infringement nexus with access,

01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:04.580
we already discussed that in
the first panel yesterday.

01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:07.020
So I won't repeat the
comments I've made,

01:25:07.020 --> 01:25:09.230
just simply refer you back to them.

01:25:09.230 --> 01:25:13.280
But I would also point out that
with respect to (a)(2) and (b),

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:18.190
what Congress did was 14 years
before Congress enacted this

01:25:18.190 --> 01:25:20.360
statute, Sony decision

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:22.950
by the Supreme Court had
addressed the question of whether

01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:25.710
or not articles in
commerce that could be used

01:25:25.710 --> 01:25:28.610
to infringe could be prohibited.

01:25:28.610 --> 01:25:33.470 position:56%
And the Court articulated a standard
that talked about not wanting

01:25:33.470 --> 01:25:37.270
to see prohibition
affecting articles that were--

01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:39.590
could be used to infringe
but were capable

01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:41.940
of substantial non-infringing uses.

01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:45.200
And most people spent the next
14 years and probably the time

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:48.200
since then figuring out
exactly what that meant.

01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:52.440
So what Congress did here in the
anti-trafficking provisions was

01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:56.270
to try to be more specific
about what the criteria were.

01:25:56.270 --> 01:25:58.910
And it's unquestioned
that that criteria is

01:25:58.910 --> 01:26:01.740
in fact linked to infringing works.

01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:04.870
So I don't think there's any
need for new legislation on that.

01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:08.360
And just quickly with respect to
Jamie's comments about whether

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:11.930
or not text-to-screen
translation software

01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:15.320
or the read-aloud functionality
in e-books is turned off,

01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:17.900
that turns out to be more a matter

01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:21.930
of individual competitive
preference among publishers

01:26:21.930 --> 01:26:23.290
and typically is a function

01:26:23.290 --> 01:26:28.460
of the way publishers negotiate
agreements with authors.

01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:31.220
Usually it's if there
is an audiobook

01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:35.080
that is also being authorized
for publication by the author,

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:39.670
they do not want the e-book to
have the read-aloud functionality

01:26:39.670 --> 01:26:43.060
because they tend to think it
competes with the audiobook.

01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:46.000
But again, that tends to be
more of a contractual issue

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.530
between the author
and the publisher.

01:26:47.530 --> 01:26:52.230
It is not something that is
done-- just as a matter of course

01:26:52.230 --> 01:26:54.580
or particularly because of concern

01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:58.190
about violations specifically
of a copyright right.

01:26:58.190 --> 01:26:59.490
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:26:59.490 --> 01:27:00.790
Mr. Kupferschmid?

01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:02.090
&gt;&gt; Keith Kupferschmid: Yeah.

01:27:02.090 --> 01:27:03.390
I just-- I'll be very, very brief.

01:27:03.390 --> 01:27:05.230
I just wanted to address
comments that Mr. Love made,

01:27:05.230 --> 01:27:07.470
not only just recently,
but throughout that sort

01:27:07.470 --> 01:27:11.280
of this law is being
driven or is especially

01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:15.370
for the motion picture studios
or the book publishing industry

01:27:15.370 --> 01:27:16.880
or the record labels
or anybody like that.

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:20.880
I can tell you that, you know, we
represent over 15,000, you know,

01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:25.150
sort of small businesses and
individual creators in this space.

01:27:25.150 --> 01:27:30.570
And they're very much supportive
of the anti-trafficking provisions.

01:27:30.570 --> 01:27:34.410
Specifically, do they sue
or do they enforce the law?

01:27:34.410 --> 01:27:35.780
No, they don't have
the capability of that.

01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:38.110
They don't even oftentimes
don't have the capability

01:27:38.110 --> 01:27:40.580
to actually bring infringement
cases either.

01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:43.840
And matter of fact, that's exactly
why they like this provision

01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:45.540
in the law because
otherwise they would be

01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:47.540
in this arms race just
like everyone else.

01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:50.340
And that's an arms race that the
individual creator is absolutely

01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:52.190
going to lose.

01:27:52.190 --> 01:27:53.490
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:27:53.490 --> 01:27:54.790
Mr. Turnbull?

01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:56.090
&gt;&gt; Bruce Turnbull: Just
very quickly, first,

01:27:56.090 --> 01:27:58.350
I wanted to associate myself
with what Mr. Adler said

01:27:58.350 --> 01:28:00.200
about the Unlocking Technology Act.

01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:01.500
I won't repeat it.

01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:03.130
But I agree with that.

01:28:03.130 --> 01:28:06.810
Secondly, with regard to the
language, going back a while

01:28:06.810 --> 01:28:12.960
in the discussion, that was in the
prior librarian-related exemptions,

01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:18.000
the DVD CCA had agreed and accepted
that language and would again

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.050
and think that that
would be within the scope

01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:24.200
of the Copyright Office's
authority and would be appropriate

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:26.770
in those kinds of exemptions.

01:28:26.770 --> 01:28:29.950
And similarly, the
Copyright Office has in--

01:28:29.950 --> 01:28:32.660
or the Librarian, in the
exemptions that have been granted,

01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:35.540
conditioned certain of
the exemptions on the use

01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:39.370
of certain kinds of
screen capture software.

01:28:39.370 --> 01:28:43.810
Either as a prerequisite to
circumventing or in a couple

01:28:43.810 --> 01:28:49.930
of cases specifically as the method
for allowing circumvention and so,

01:28:49.930 --> 01:28:54.510
I think there's precedent for
that kind of thing at least

01:28:54.510 --> 01:29:00.300 position:56%
in very specific cases where there's
been an adequate record developed

01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:01.600
and that sort of thing.

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:04.140
And in terms of the
sort of voluntary tool

01:29:04.140 --> 01:29:06.640
that I was talking about, it
would be in that kind of vein

01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:09.200
that we would envision
it being used,

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:10.540
as something that would be brought

01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:12.830
to the Copyright Office
cooperatively

01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:15.960
but would then be part
of an exemption.

01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:17.260
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: OK, thank you.

01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:19.560
So Mr. Greenstein, next,
you know, last call,

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:22.280
and I was in the next panel
is about permanent exemptions.

01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:25.050
And I thought maybe I could also
invite you to comment on whether

01:29:25.050 --> 01:29:29.240 position:56%
in your particular situation for the
auto industry, that might be sort

01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:32.890
of another work around
rather if changing 1201(b).

01:29:32.890 --> 01:29:34.430
&gt;&gt; Seth Greenstein: OK.

01:29:34.430 --> 01:29:35.740
Thank you.

01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:38.260
So first, with respect to
the Unlocking Technology Act,

01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:40.680
it probably would solve the
problems of our industry.

01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:43.120
But I think it's a much broader
solution than is necessary.

01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:47.850
And in that respect, I note
Professor Besek, you know,

01:29:47.850 --> 01:29:50.680
talked about how, you know, this
is really kind of a separate issue.

01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:53.070
Well, that's why we
sought an exemption,

01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:56.710
because it really is something
that is an individual need

01:29:56.710 --> 01:29:59.060
and I think best addressed
in that way.

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:02.080
And from that perspective,
I think, you know,

01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:05.470
permanent exemptions
are a positive solution.

01:30:05.470 --> 01:30:08.280
But merely adopting
the current solution

01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:12.410
as a permanent exemption is
not going to solve the problems

01:30:12.410 --> 01:30:15.650
of the aftermarket
automobile repair industry.

01:30:15.650 --> 01:30:16.950
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:30:16.950 --> 01:30:18.520
And Mr. Schwartz, I think
you have the last word.

01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:19.820
&gt;&gt; Robert S. Schwartz:
Yeah, just finally,

01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:23.030
I didn't mean to not comment on
the Unlocking Technology Act.

01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:25.400
I believe CTA has supported that.

01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:30.190
Of course, you know, as in the case
with any legislative consideration,

01:30:30.190 --> 01:30:33.480
we'd want to look at what's
being proposed, you know,

01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:38.370
exactly now in the most up-to-date
formulation after discussion.

01:30:38.370 --> 01:30:41.590 position:56%
But I think CTA is in support of it.

01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:42.890
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:30:42.890 --> 01:30:44.960 position:56%
Well, that will conclude this panel.

01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:46.950
We are supposed to start at 10:45.

01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:49.420
So that cuts the break
short by about 10 minutes.

01:30:49.420 --> 01:30:51.730
I think we should be on track
to just start that on time.

01:30:51.730 --> 01:30:53.030
Thank you.

01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:56.890
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
