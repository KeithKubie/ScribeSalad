PIERS MORGAN: With
other countries now

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.420
steaming past America, what
is the number one thing

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.544
you want to see whoever wins
the next election do about this?

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:12.960
SALMAN KHAN: I
think there's going

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.359
to be a broad push to making
classrooms more human.

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:18.025
And when you have 42
people or 30 people

00:00:18.025 --> 00:00:21.930
or even 20 people in a room
and it's all about a lecture,

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.950
no matter how good you
get that ratio down,

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.600
it's still a passive experience.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.850
It's what we all went through.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.500
You're looking at a clock,
waiting for the period to end.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.990
And so what we're
talking about is

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.260
technology not to replace what's
happening in the classroom,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.330
but to make the
classroom better.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.000
If lectures can happen
at a student's own pace,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.800
if a lot of the problem
solving can happen,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.508
can we use the class
time for interaction

00:00:39.508 --> 00:00:42.200
between the peers, interaction
between the teacher?

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.410
So even if you have the
unfortunate situation

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.200
of 42 students, at least let
them interact with each other.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.562
And let them teach each other.

00:00:48.562 --> 00:00:50.770
Let them have more opportunities
to actually interact

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:51.810
with the teacher.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.150
PIERS MORGAN: But
is the right move

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.940
forward for kids to be
doing as much work at home

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.930
as they do at
school, and doing it

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.950
on computers, which is their
natural habitat, anyway?

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:03.620
SALMAN KHAN: No.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.370
I think actually one
of the big problems--

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.320
and I talk a lot
about this-- is we

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.270
have this culture
of homework that

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.240
creates this illusion of rigor.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.460
Oh, we're not good enough?

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.100
The Estonians are beating
us at factoring polynomials?

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.210
More homework.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.690
And all the studies
actually point to, well,

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.140
the single biggest
determinants of student success

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.370
are dinner with their
parents and sleeping.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.810
And homework, if
it's too much of it,

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.240
directly goes against
both of those things.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.340
And so we've been working
with a lot of schools.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.840
What we're seeing
is if you actually

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.484
allow more engagement
in the classroom,

00:01:35.484 --> 00:01:37.400
you allow students to
learn at their own pace,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.430
they actually learn
much, much more.
