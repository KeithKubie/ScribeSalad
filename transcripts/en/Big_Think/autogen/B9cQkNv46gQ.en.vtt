00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.640
The Better Angels was conceived in black and
white from the very beginning.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.349
It was just the way that I felt Lincoln existed.

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.410
Lincoln lives in black and white and I didn’t
want to see him in color.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.810
The reason why we thought it was appropriate
wasn’t purely for aesthetic reasons but

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:27.800
also to remove the romance of frontier life,
you know, what we imagine with the coonskin

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.570
caps and the muskets, the Lincoln log cabin.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.440
It could lean towards Disneyland or something
like that.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.620
And so we were after austerity and starkness
like you would have in a Bresson picture or

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.920
a Carl Dreyer picture.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.039
And because especially and the frontier life
plus Lincoln on top of that, there’s a lot

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:56.530
of sentimentality that you could lead into
or, you know, just the tropes of just the

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.539
Americana patriotic story.

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:05.610
So yeah, we wanted a bit more integrity to
the film than the cliché’s that could have

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.800
happened.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.080
We wanted the film to be a sensory experience.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.030
It wasn’t just to be a Wikipedia article
about the facts and information of Lincoln’s

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.030
life.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:23.600
We wanted people to walk beside him, labor
with him, cry and laugh with him and black

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.390
and white abstracts everything to turn it
into icons.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.960
With color the image is much busier.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.420
There’s much more to take in.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.410
There’s more specificity to it.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:42.790
Black and white immediately abstracts things
and makes symbols out of it so that man or

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.030
woman suddenly isn’t as specific.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.630
They suddenly can turn more almost into the
image on the bathroom sign, you know, it’s

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.010
man and woman as a whole.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.450
It gives you a generality in the best way.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.560
In addition to the abstraction black and white
provides the production design.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.410
You know it helped them immensely because,
especially with the limited budget we were

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.640
dealing with.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.990
Immediately when you see black and white you
feel like you’ve been transported into the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.990
past.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.939
And so, you know, 20 percent of the art department’s
team was accomplished purely by muting the

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:13.540
color.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.969
Not to say that their job was then easy after
that but it definitely gave them a leg up

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.420
I feel and they would agree.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.700
You know, the first thing if you say you’re
going to shoot black and white is everybody

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.319
is worried for you.

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.769
Black and white has a stigma that’s attached
to it.

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:37.870
People view it as a disadvantage in that you’re
limiting your audience, your financial prospects

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.480
and categorizing your picture as something
that it may not be.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.641
You know if you shoot black and white people
immediately think art or they immediately

00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:46.950
think serious.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.819
And so if someone is to consider black and
white for their project I guess I would say

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.730
the heads up that I would offer is that they
need to be prepared to fight for it and lobby

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:58.730
for that.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.459
Unless they’re just surrounded by a fantastic
group that’s immediately encouraging and

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.569
doesn’t feel that there’s any risk.

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.329
Schindler’s list I think made like 400 million
dollars or something.

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.409
And so if the story’s there, the performances
are there it will connect people.

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.940
And connections are not in color or in black
and white.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.750
They’re invisible but just as real.
