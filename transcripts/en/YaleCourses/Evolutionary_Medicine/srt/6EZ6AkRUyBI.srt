1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,460
We're now going to all have a series
of lectures on how pathogens evolve.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,050
The first lecture we'll deal with
pathogen causing very islands.

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,210
The second with how the Microbiota are
managed and the distinction between

4
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:16,710
symbiotes and pathogens.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,200
The third with how pathogens have
evolved to evade and suppress the immune

6
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:23,034
system.

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,570
The fourth deals with an
extremely important problem,

8
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:32,571
the rapid evolution of
antibiotic resistance and
the fifth concerns therapies

9
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:36,570
that can mitigate the consequences
of that kind of evolution.

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,750
Pathogens have their own agendas,

11
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,500
they respond flexibly in rapidly
to anything that we do to them.

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,310
And you can think of them as being
primarily interested in their own

13
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:51,930
reproductive success and not really being
at all interested in what happens to

14
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:53,730
you,
either good or bad.

15
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,960
So let's first discuss
pathogen caused very ones.

16
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,430
And the key idea here is the tradeoff
between virulence and transmission.

17
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,920
Another is the distinction between
vertical and horizontal transmission.

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,930
And the third is the distinction
between single and multiple infections.

19
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,590
Each one of these contrasts affects
intrinsic pathogen virulence.

20
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,700
Now virulence is caused both by direct
pathogen effects and by host responses

21
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,360
we've just seen in the last
set of lectures how many
diseases there are that are

22
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:38,310
associated with the immune response.

23
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,040
Virulence is always an interaction
between pathogen and host,

24
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,570
and in these lectures we are analyzing
the portion of damage done to the host

25
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,600
that is caused by properties that are
intrinsic to the pathogen rather than by

26
00:01:57,601 --> 00:01:58,620
the host response.

27
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,580
The first idea here is that there is a
trade off between the virulence of the

28
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:09,430
pathogen and the probability
that it will be transmitted.

29
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:15,330
And the example that brought that idea
to the forefront is Myxoma virus in

30
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:17,404
rabbits.

31
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,120
So the Myxoma virus is a
member of the pox virus family.

32
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,460
It's transmitted by mosquitoes or fleas,
ticks and Mites.

33
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,320
So it's an arbovirus.
It causes tumors,

34
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,610
but not immediate death in
cottontail rabbits in the Americas,

35
00:02:36,611 --> 00:02:40,780
but in European rabbits, the genus
or rectal as it causes myxomatosis,

36
00:02:40,781 --> 00:02:45,220
which is an acute disease that
initially has a 100% mortality rate.

37
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,600
Now it is European rabbits who
were brought into Australia.

38
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:57,350
Myxomatosis was introduced to Australia
to control their devastating outbreak.

39
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,960
There were no natural predators of
European rabbits and they were essentially

40
00:03:02,961 --> 00:03:05,510
grazing the countryside
right down to the dirt.

41
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,440
Both the pathogen and
the host then evolved.

42
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,420
The pathogen evolve less virulence and
better resistance evolved in the host.

43
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,980
Virulence did decline,
so virulence did go down,

44
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,590
but myxoma remained quite very lengthy.

45
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,060
Infected rabbits at the end
still only survive for 20 days.

46
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,320
So this is how virulent strains changed.

47
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,180
They identified five grades of
virulence by case fatality rates.

48
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:42,181
So real and great one had more than 99%
case fatality rate down through Vereal.

49
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:43,781
That's great.

50
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:48,781
Five which had less than 50% the mean
survival time was less than 13 days for

51
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:54,550
various grade one and quite long,

52
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:57,910
quite a bit longer than 50 days
for Vereal inch grade five.

53
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,230
These rows indicate time periods between
1950 and 1981 what you can see is that

54
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:11,041
initially 100% of the strains
of Myxoma virus were great.

55
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:15,160
One.
They lost very once,

56
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,220
but they essentially evolved into
virulence grade three here in the middle,

57
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,050
which still has a case fatality
rate of between about 50 and 70%.

58
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,500
So the way this works is that
if the rabbit dies quickly,

59
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,790
there's very little opportunity for fleas
and other biting insects that transmit

60
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:43,680
the disease. The less virulent
forms that can then out compete,

61
00:04:43,681 --> 00:04:47,190
the more virulent forms because
they have superior transmission.

62
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,580
Okay.

63
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,910
However, they do worse while
doing worse in a single host,

64
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,120
they are doing better in
the population as a whole.

65
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:58,910
Okay.

66
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,710
No. The hosts also evolved
genetic resistance and they
do have adaptive immunity.

67
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:05,840
Okay.

68
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,730
So the take home point from the Myxoma
virus in Australia is that there's often

69
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:15,230
a trade off between Varian once and
transmission from the pathogens point of

70
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,420
view.
This trade off is a major problem.

71
00:05:17,421 --> 00:05:21,740
If the pathogen is only living in
this host, if it also has other hosts,

72
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,540
then that's not so much of a problem.

73
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,280
If this problem is not solved
a host specific pathogen,

74
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,200
we'll go locally extinct because it
will essentially kill all of its hosts

75
00:05:33,201 --> 00:05:34,910
before it can transmit out of them,

76
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,540
which is what happened in
the initial eval epidemics.

77
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:41,710
Yeah.

78
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:45,940
The second major issue with very Lynch's
vertical versus horizontal versus

79
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:50,230
vector transmission.
Strictly vertical transmission,

80
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:52,630
which is a transmission
from parent to offspring,

81
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:59,330
selects for low virulence and
eventually for commensalism this.

82
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,760
In other words,
this is pathogen transmission,

83
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:06,050
which is mimicking the transmission
of genes from parents to offspring.

84
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,470
Strictly horizontal transmission.

85
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,810
That is no transmission
from parent to offspring,

86
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:16,811
but all transmission between individuals
who are of the same age class and not

87
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:22,070
necessarily related.
It selects for Highbury ones

88
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,990
selection for virulence with vector
transmission depends on the impact of

89
00:06:27,991 --> 00:06:30,450
virulence on the efficacy of the vector.

90
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,960
So in vector borne diseases,

91
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,620
the genome of the pathogen has to be
able to deal with both the host and with

92
00:06:40,381 --> 00:06:44,220
the vector that gets it to the host and
they can often have different kinds of

93
00:06:44,221 --> 00:06:45,054
immune systems.

94
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:52,290
Waterborne horizontally transmitted
diseases, uh, have major impact.

95
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:57,030
So here are a few of the major
health problems. On the planet,

96
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,270
typhoid fever, cholera,
amoebic, dysentery,

97
00:07:00,271 --> 00:07:03,540
rotavirus and Basler dysentery.

98
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,760
The annual deaths that are being caused
by these diseases continue at high

99
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,594
levels,

100
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,860
so we're seeing in some
more than a million,

101
00:07:13,861 --> 00:07:17,460
about a million and a half deaths
annually from waterborne diseases.

102
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,051
Now,

103
00:07:19,051 --> 00:07:24,051
this is why the clean water
that's provided by a modern
sewage system has such a

104
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:26,700
huge impact on human survival.

105
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,673
Yeah.

106
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:35,270
Another major determinant of the intrinsic
virulence of pathogens is thought to

107
00:07:37,351 --> 00:07:40,020
be weather infection
is single or multiple,

108
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,680
just the host infected just by one strain
of pathogen or by multiple strains.

109
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:48,240
And first we have effects that
are mediated by host mortality,

110
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,060
so multiple infection will select
for increased intrinsic virulence.

111
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,770
If the impact of the parasites on the
host is through the mortality of the host.

112
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:04,380
Then competition among strains for
representation and trends in transmission

113
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,710
modifies the virulence
transmission trade off.

114
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:13,020
Because to be transmitted, the pathogen
has to dominate the competition,

115
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,170
but in doing so,
it damages the host.

116
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:22,310
So virulence is going to increase because
the competing pathogens or is a pro is

117
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,600
a byproduct of their
competition damaging the host.

118
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,200
They can't avoid doing so because if one
of them doesn't do what the other one

119
00:08:36,331 --> 00:08:39,260
will.
However,

120
00:08:39,261 --> 00:08:43,460
if the effects are mediated by host growth
or host condition rather than by the

121
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:47,030
death of the host,
if they have sub lethal effects,

122
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,730
and if those effects feedback to the
parasites to reduce their rate of

123
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:55,220
development. So we're
slowly, slowly growing.

124
00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:00,290
Host or a host in poor condition is one
in which the parasites cannot develop as

125
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:01,224
rapidly.

126
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,580
Then multiplicity of infection
generally leads to lower variance.

127
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,700
So this is a complex one

128
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,541
to summarize.

129
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:17,541
Virulence intrinsic to pathogens increases
when anything affects the virulence

130
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:19,260
transmission tradeoff.

131
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,100
Anything shifts transmission
from vertical to horizontal.

132
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,870
Anything increases the
frequency of multiple infections
that have more impact on

133
00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:30,090
mortality than on growth.

134
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,750
So virulence is a characteristic of
pathogens that can evolve in response to

135
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:37,230
these sorts of conditions.
