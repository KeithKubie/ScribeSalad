00:00:00.302 --> 00:00:01.760
Let's think a little
bit about what

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.530
it means to multiply fractions.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.920
Say I want to multiply
1/2 times 1/4.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.390
Well, one way to
think about this

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.840
is we could view
this as 1/2 of a 1/4.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.240
And what do I mean there?

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.100
Well let me take a whole,
let me take a whole here,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.770
and let me divide
it into fourths.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.300
So let me divide
it into fourths,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.040
so I'll divided into
4 equal sections.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.130
And so 1/4 would be 1 of
these 4 equal sections.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.510
But we want to take 1/2 of that.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.230
So how do we take half of that?

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.530
Well, we could divide this
into 2 equal sections,

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.340
and then just take 1 of them.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.890
So divide it into
2 equal sections,

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.360
and then take 1 of them.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.570
So we're taking this pink area,
this whole pink area is 1/4,

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.890
and now we're going
to take 1/2 of it.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.520
We're now going
to take 1/2 of it.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.220
So that's this yellow
square right over here.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.800
But what fraction of the whole
does this yellow represent?

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.976
Well, it now represents 1
out of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

00:01:09.976 --> 00:01:11.800
8 equal sections.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.510
So this right over here, this
represents 1/8 of the whole.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.420
And so we see conceptually
that 1/2 times 1/4,

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.080
it completely makes sense,
that 1/2 of 1/4 should be 1/8.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.670
And it hopefully makes
sense that you get this 8

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.970
by multiplying
the 2 times the 4.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.850
You started with
4 equal sections,

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.170
but then you divided each
of those 4 equal sections

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.760
into 2 equal sections.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.310
So then you have 8
total equal sections

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.305
that you split your whole into.

00:01:42.305 --> 00:01:43.930
Let's do another
example, but now let's

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.010
multiply two
fractions that don't

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.350
have 1's in the numerator.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:58.770
So let's multiply, let's
multiply 2/3 times 4/5.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.580
And I encourage you
now to pause the video

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.740
and do something very
similar to what I just did.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.980
Try to represent 4/5
of a whole and then try

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.200
to represent 2/3 of that
4/5 and see what fraction

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.730
of the whole you actually have.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.927
So pause now.

00:02:14.927 --> 00:02:16.010
So let's think about this.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.320
Let's represent 4/5.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.320
So if I have a
whole like this, let

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.610
me try to divide it
into 5 equal sections.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.570
5 equal sections, so let's say
that is 1 equal section, that

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.157
is 2 equal sections, that is
3, 4, and 5-- I can do a better

00:02:33.157 --> 00:02:33.740
job than this.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.002
This is always the hard part.

00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:36.960
I'm trying my best to
make them look, at least,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.229
like equal sections--
2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:43.520
I think you get the point here.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.840
I'm trying to make
them equal sections.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.770
And we want 4/5.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.630
So we want 4 of these
5 equal sections.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.170
So this would be 1 of the 5
equal sections, 2 of them,

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.550
3 of them, and then 4 of them.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.010
So that right over there is 4/5.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.740
Now we can view this
as 2/3 of the 4/5.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.040
So how can we think about that?

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.830
Well, we could take this section
and divide it into thirds.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.500
So let's do that.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.820
Divide it into thirds.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.270
So we're going divide it
into 3 equal sections.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.120
So that's 1/3, and then 2/3.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.870
So we took each of
the 5 equal sections,

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.760
and we divided them
into 3 equal sections.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.280
Now what's going to
be 2/3 of the 4/5?

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.020
Well, that's going to be
this part right over here.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.900
So let me make this clear.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.800
This is 1/3 of the 4/5.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.620
And then this would
be 2/3 of the 4/5.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.280
So this right over here, would
be 2/3 of the 4/5, or 2/3 times

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.260
4/5.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.020
But what fraction of the
whole does that represent?

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.770
Well, how many total, how many
total equal sections do we now

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:56.750
have?

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:04.696
Well, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,

00:04:04.696 --> 00:04:05.540
15.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.190
So we have 15 equal sections.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.400
I'm using a new color.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.470
We have 15 equal sections,
and that make sense.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.030
We started with
5 equal sections,

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.529
but then we divided each of
those into 3 equal sections.

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:20.370
So now we have 5 times
3 total equal sections.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.500
And then how many of
those are now colored in?

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.263
Well, we see it's 2 times 4.

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:29.370
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.390
How many of them are in the
2/3 of the 4/5, I should say.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.380
And there's 8 of them, 8
of the 15 equals sections.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.740
And so there you have it.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.050
It should hopefully
now make visual sense,

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.390
or it makes conceptual
sense, that 2/3 times 4/5--

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.440
you can obviously compute
it by just multiplying

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.320
the numerators, 2 times 4 is 8.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.660
And then multiplying the
denominators, 3 times 5 is 15--

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.808
but hopefully this now makes
conceptual sense as 2/3 of 4/5.
