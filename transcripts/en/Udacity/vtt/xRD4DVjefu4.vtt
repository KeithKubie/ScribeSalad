00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Before we move on, let's do one more thought experiment.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
What if instead of moving at a constant velocity,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the train was moving at a constant acceleration?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So, every second it's increasing by the same speed as the previous second.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What would the trajectory of the apple be then?

00:00:14.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Select the most appropriate trajectory.
