00:00:06.792 --> 00:00:10.501
What rights do people have,
and where do they come from?

00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:14.310
Who gets to make decisions for others
and on what authority?

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.209
And how can we organize society
to meet people's needs?

00:00:19.209 --> 00:00:21.868
These questions challenged
an entire nation

00:00:21.868 --> 00:00:25.019
during the upheaval
of the French Revolution.

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.409
By the end of the 18th century,

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:31.441
Europe had undergone a profound
intellectual and cultural shift

00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:33.800
known as the Enlightenment.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.409
Philosophers and artists promoted
reason and human freedom

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:40.070
over tradition and religion.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.830
The rise of a middle class
and printed materials

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.209
encouraged political awareness,

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:48.749
and the American Revolution had turned
a former English colony

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:51.450
into an independent republic.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.259
Yet France, one of the largest and richest
countries in Europe

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:59.969
was still governed by an ancient regime
of three rigid social classes

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.052
called Estates.

00:01:02.052 --> 00:01:06.769
The monarch King Louis XVI
based his authority on divine right

00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:11.040
and granted special privileges
to the First and Second Estates,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.781
the Catholic clergy, and the nobles.

00:01:13.781 --> 00:01:17.021
The Third Estate, middle class merchants
and craftsmen,

00:01:17.021 --> 00:01:21.390
as well as over 20 million peasants,
had far less power

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.461
and they were the only ones
who paid taxes,

00:01:24.461 --> 00:01:28.632
not just to the king,
but to the other Estates as well.

00:01:28.632 --> 00:01:30.013
In bad harvest years,

00:01:30.013 --> 00:01:33.370
taxation could leave peasants
with almost nothing

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.190
while the king and nobles lived lavishly
on their extracted wealth.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.272
But as France sank into debt due to
its support of the American Revolution

00:01:43.272 --> 00:01:45.680
and its long-running war with England,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.542
change was needed.

00:01:47.542 --> 00:01:50.767
King Louis appointed
finance minister Jacques Necker,

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:52.381
who pushed for tax reforms

00:01:52.381 --> 00:01:57.432
and won public support by openly
publishing the government's finances.

00:01:57.432 --> 00:02:00.713
But the king's advisors
strongly opposed these initiatives.

00:02:00.713 --> 00:02:05.132
Desperate for a solution, the king called
a meeting of the Estates-General,

00:02:05.132 --> 00:02:07.902
an assembly of representatives
from the Three Estates,

00:02:07.902 --> 00:02:12.091
for the first time in 175 years.

00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:16.583
Although the Third Estate represented
98% of the French population,

00:02:16.583 --> 00:02:20.102
its vote was equal to each
of the other Estates.

00:02:20.102 --> 00:02:25.462
And unsurprisingly, both of the upper
classes favored keeping their privileges.

00:02:25.462 --> 00:02:28.021
Realizing they couldn't
get fair representation,

00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:29.913
the Third Estate broke off,

00:02:29.913 --> 00:02:32.003
declared themselves
the National Assembly,

00:02:32.003 --> 00:02:37.503
and pledged to draft a new constitution
with or without the other Estates.

00:02:37.503 --> 00:02:39.972
King Louis ordered the First
and Second Estates

00:02:39.972 --> 00:02:41.782
to meet with the National Assembly,

00:02:41.782 --> 00:02:45.912
but he also dismissed Necker,
his popular finance minister.

00:02:45.912 --> 00:02:48.833
In response, thousands
of outraged Parisians

00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:53.183
joined with sympathetic soldiers
to storm the Bastille prison,

00:02:53.183 --> 00:02:57.447
a symbol of royal power
and a large storehouse of weapons.

00:02:57.447 --> 00:03:00.103
The Revolution had begun.

00:03:00.103 --> 00:03:02.385
As rebellion spread
throughout the country,

00:03:02.385 --> 00:03:04.724
the feudal system was abolished.

00:03:04.724 --> 00:03:07.994
The Assembly's Declaration
of the Rights of Man and Citizen

00:03:07.994 --> 00:03:10.614
proclaimed a radical idea for the time --

00:03:10.614 --> 00:03:15.675
that individual rights and freedoms
were fundamental to human nature

00:03:15.675 --> 00:03:19.494
and government existed
only to protect them.

00:03:19.494 --> 00:03:22.775
Their privileges gone,
many nobles fled abroad,

00:03:22.775 --> 00:03:26.864
begging foreign rulers to invade France
and restore order.

00:03:26.864 --> 00:03:30.694
And while Louis remained as the figurehead
of the constitutional monarchy,

00:03:30.694 --> 00:03:32.984
he feared for his future.

00:03:32.984 --> 00:03:37.135
In 1791, he tried to flee the country
but was caught.

00:03:37.135 --> 00:03:41.126
The attempted escape shattered
people's faith in the king.

00:03:41.126 --> 00:03:45.405
The royal family was arrested
and the king charged with treason.

00:03:45.405 --> 00:03:46.561
After a trial,

00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:49.889
the once-revered king
was publicly beheaded,

00:03:49.921 --> 00:03:53.389
signaling the end of one thousand
years of monarchy

00:03:53.421 --> 00:03:59.131
and finalizing the September 21st
declaration of the first French republic,

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:02.921
governed by the motto
"liberté, égalité, fraternité."

00:04:03.414 --> 00:04:04.614
Nine months later,

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.174
Queen Marie Antoinette,

00:04:06.188 --> 00:04:09.121
a foreigner long-mocked
as "Madame Déficit"

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:11.219
for her extravagant reputation,

00:04:11.352 --> 00:04:12.906
was executed as well.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.578
But the Revolution would not end there.

00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:19.180
Some leaders, not content
with just changing the government,

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:22.719
sought to completely transform
French society --

00:04:22.756 --> 00:04:24.732
its religion,
its street names,

00:04:24.769 --> 00:04:26.216
even its calendar.

00:04:26.216 --> 00:04:28.086
As multiple factions formed,

00:04:28.086 --> 00:04:32.539
the extremist Jacobins
lead by Maximilien Robespierre

00:04:32.578 --> 00:04:34.586
launched a Reign of Terror

00:04:34.586 --> 00:04:36.633
to suppress the slightest dissent,

00:04:36.658 --> 00:04:39.086
executing over 20,000 people

00:04:39.086 --> 00:04:41.509
before the Jacobin's own downfall.

00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:45.765
Meanwhile, France found itself
at war with neighboring monarchs

00:04:45.804 --> 00:04:48.836
seeking to strangle the Revolution
before it spread.

00:04:49.586 --> 00:04:54.097
Amidst the chaos, a general named
Napoleon Bonaparte took charge,

00:04:54.097 --> 00:04:58.898
becoming Emperor as he claimed to defend
the Revolution's democratic values.

00:04:59.494 --> 00:05:02.823
All in all, the Revolution
saw three constitutions

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:05.736
and five governments within ten years,

00:05:05.736 --> 00:05:09.517
followed by decades
alternating between monarchy and revolt

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:12.341
before the next Republic formed in 1871.

00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:15.756
And while we celebrate
the French Revolution's ideals,

00:05:15.795 --> 00:05:19.170
we still struggle with many
of the same basic questions

00:05:19.233 --> 00:05:21.358
raised over two centuries ago.
