00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.800
we're not talking honestly about what it

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:07.810
we're not talking honestly about what it
 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.520
we're not talking honestly about what it
really takes to get from poverty to the

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.530
really takes to get from poverty to the
 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.070
really takes to get from poverty to the
middle class so for example we know that

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080
middle class so for example we know that
 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.199
middle class so for example we know that
only 4% of people who are born into

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209
only 4% of people who are born into
 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:17.870
only 4% of people who are born into
poverty will ever make it to the

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880
poverty will ever make it to the
 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.909
poverty will ever make it to the
upper-middle class or to you know have

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:20.919
upper-middle class or to you know have
 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:22.349
upper-middle class or to you know have
middle-class success and so what that

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:22.359
middle-class success and so what that
 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.080
middle-class success and so what that
means is that 96% of people are not

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090
means is that 96% of people are not
 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.029
means is that 96% of people are not
making it out and I think we're being

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039
making it out and I think we're being
 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.950
making it out and I think we're being
dishonest when we say everybody has a

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960
dishonest when we say everybody has a
 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.700
dishonest when we say everybody has a
fair and equal chance of achieving the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710
fair and equal chance of achieving the
 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.710
fair and equal chance of achieving the
American dream so it wasn't until

American dream so it wasn't until
 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.479

that I was outside of what was

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:51.369
that I was outside of what was
 

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:53.280
that I was outside of what was
considered the middle class and the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290
considered the middle class and the
 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.789
considered the middle class and the
first time that I heard about people

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:56.799
first time that I heard about people
 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:59.250
first time that I heard about people
living in poverty was in a political

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260
living in poverty was in a political
 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.840
living in poverty was in a political
science class and there we were talking

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850
science class and there we were talking
 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.630
science class and there we were talking
about on welfare policies and one of the

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640
about on welfare policies and one of the
 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.550
about on welfare policies and one of the
big policies at the time was welfare

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560
big policies at the time was welfare
 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.550
big policies at the time was welfare
reform and the debate was raging about

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560
reform and the debate was raging about
 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.530
reform and the debate was raging about
what should be done and a lot of the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540
what should be done and a lot of the
 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.600
what should be done and a lot of the
conversation was up here and really

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610
conversation was up here and really
 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.850
conversation was up here and really
detached from the women and families

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860
detached from the women and families
 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.170
detached from the women and families
that were going to be directly impacted

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180
that were going to be directly impacted
 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.480
that were going to be directly impacted
by the policy so we heard a lot of

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490
by the policy so we heard a lot of
 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.380
by the policy so we heard a lot of
things about welfare queens people

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390
things about welfare queens people
 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.900
things about welfare queens people
living off the system not wanting to

work women being lazy having multiple

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640
work women being lazy having multiple
 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.880
work women being lazy having multiple
children and that really wasn't the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890
children and that really wasn't the
 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.570
children and that really wasn't the
reality for the women who were actually

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580
reality for the women who were actually
 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.700
reality for the women who were actually
impoverished and so when we look at the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710
impoverished and so when we look at the
 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.610
impoverished and so when we look at the
kind of policies that result are the tan

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620
kind of policies that result are the tan
 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.500
kind of policies that result are the tan
of policy the welfare reform policy that

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510
of policy the welfare reform policy that
 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.750
of policy the welfare reform policy that
we got on the other end we got a policy

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760
we got on the other end we got a policy
 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.240
we got on the other end we got a policy
that said well you can't if you don't

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250
that said well you can't if you don't
 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.480
that said well you can't if you don't
work you can't receive benefits and you

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490
work you can't receive benefits and you
 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.700
work you can't receive benefits and you
have time limits and if you have another

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710
have time limits and if you have another
 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.430
have time limits and if you have another
child you're penalized those policies

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440
child you're penalized those policies
 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.469
child you're penalized those policies
and those that restrictiveness was

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479
and those that restrictiveness was
 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.480
and those that restrictiveness was
counter to the everyday lived

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490
counter to the everyday lived
 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.520
counter to the everyday lived
experiences of the women who were

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530
experiences of the women who were
 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.190
experiences of the women who were
actually receiving the benefits so what

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200
actually receiving the benefits so what
 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.899
actually receiving the benefits so what
was excluded from that policy was a

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909
was excluded from that policy was a
 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.710
was excluded from that policy was a
clear pathway out of poverty like

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720
clear pathway out of poverty like
 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.710
clear pathway out of poverty like
education were there missing in the very

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720
education were there missing in the very
 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.350
education were there missing in the very
beginning there was very few provisions

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360
beginning there was very few provisions
 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.449
beginning there was very few provisions
for child care and a lot of other things

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459
for child care and a lot of other things
 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.120
for child care and a lot of other things
that we know family and women need

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130
that we know family and women need
 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.760
that we know family and women need
need to be able to chart a path out of

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770
need to be able to chart a path out of
 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.370
need to be able to chart a path out of
poverty when people think of poverty

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380
poverty when people think of poverty
 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.670
poverty when people think of poverty
they think about money and resources and

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680
they think about money and resources and
 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.270
they think about money and resources and
cash but a big part of poverty is the

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280
cash but a big part of poverty is the
 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.790
cash but a big part of poverty is the
lack of social connections and social

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800
lack of social connections and social
 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.670
lack of social connections and social
networks and what we know is that those

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680
networks and what we know is that those
 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.640
networks and what we know is that those
social networks and connections are

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650
social networks and connections are
 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.100
social networks and connections are
really powerful in terms of helping

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110
really powerful in terms of helping
 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.890
really powerful in terms of helping
people to navigate complex institutions

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900
people to navigate complex institutions
 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.140
people to navigate complex institutions
and structures and for for for poor

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150
and structures and for for for poor
 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.140
and structures and for for for poor
people those social networks are often

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150
people those social networks are often
 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.660
people those social networks are often
missing and when we talk about bridging

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670
missing and when we talk about bridging
 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.130
missing and when we talk about bridging
from the from poverty to the middle

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140
from the from poverty to the middle
 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.160
from the from poverty to the middle
class social networks and social capital

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170
class social networks and social capital
 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.690
class social networks and social capital
that are really important to making that

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700
that are really important to making that
 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.490
that are really important to making that
that leap and so when we talk about what

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500
that leap and so when we talk about what
 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.050
that leap and so when we talk about what
can institutions and leaders do to

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060
can institutions and leaders do to
 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.690
can institutions and leaders do to
support that it's really important to

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700
support that it's really important to
 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.240
support that it's really important to
make sure that children and people in

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250
make sure that children and people in
 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.250
make sure that children and people in
low-income neighborhoods have have Apple

low-income neighborhoods have have Apple
 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.170
low-income neighborhoods have have Apple
