&gt;&gt;Julie Wiskirchen: Hello everybody, I'm Julie
Wiskirchen from the Authors Team in Santa

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.269
Monica and today I'm excited to welcome Frances
Noble and Ian Noble who will be discussing

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.000
their book, "Blanket of Stars: Homeless Women
in Santa Monica".

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.020
Frances Noble is a bestselling author, lawyer,
and 35 year resident of Santa Monica. Her

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.130
previous books include "The Situe Stories"
and "The New Belly Dancer of the Galaxy".

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.900
And her son, Ian Noble, is an architectural
and fine art photographer. Together they spent

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.380
a year interviewing and photographing the
homeless women in Santa Monica to create this

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.380
book.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.240
Please join me in welcoming Frances Noble.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.040
[applause]

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:43.450
&gt;&gt;Frances Noble: Thank you, Julie. It's a
pleasure to be here and to tell you about

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.790
our book. As Julie said our family lived here
in Santa Monica for over 35 years. I think

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.200
we're more like 45 years at this point when
I recalculate the numbers.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.590
And we moved here when Santa Monica was kind
of a sleepy beach town, when real estate prices

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:06.299
were lower, when life was easier, and it wasn't
such a chic address, didn't have fancy stuff,

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.240
and really contemporary industries like Sony
and MGM and Google.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.249
We were in the pre-Google years primarily.
And in those years when things were quieter

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:22.319
and simpler there were also no homeless people
in Santa Monica. And as I look across the

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:30.079
audience I see that it's a younger audience
and you probably do not remember that time.

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:38.229
And so you can imagine what we felt and what
we were talking about when the first homeless

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.780
people appeared on the streets in Santa Monica,
and I remember the three. There were three

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.939
of them and it was in the 1980s; two men and
one woman.

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.170
The one woman I'll bet you've seen though;
she lived primarily, if that's the word you

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.429
want, on Wilshire Boulevard and she dragged
a string of shopping carts down the street

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.600
filled with her possessions which to the rest
of us would look like junk and garbage and

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.289
trash and so forth. And her face was smeared
with makeup. Do any of you recall seeing her

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.769
at all on Wilshire Boulevard? I see a hand.
Good. Well I'm happy to report that she's

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.980
off the streets now. But she was on those
streets for 25 years, 20 years.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.930
The two men are still out there and I see
them periodically. I've watched their hair

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:36.120
turn gray and watched them, one in particular,
deteriorate. They're both to me, to my novice's

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.230
view, seriously mentally ill which means they're
roaming those streets untaken care of and

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.360
primarily uncared for except for the kindness
of strangers.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.939
The Urban Institute in 2006 commissioned a
study about homeless people in Santa Monica

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:59.329
and, excuse me the City of Santa Monica commissioned
the study. And the Urban Institute determined

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:05.890
that at that time which seemed to have been
the peak time for the population, there were

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:13.079
on any given day in Santa Monica 2,800 homeless
people. Now of course it's a fluid group,

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:21.140
it moves around, and in any given year 10,500.
That is a lot of people.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.400
And so it got to the point where you couldn't
go anywhere or do anything without noticing

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.250
or seeing homeless people. And after a while
in a way to defend yourself you got to the

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.579
point of not seeing them. And they became
part of the landscape, they became part of

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.890
the seascape since they were everywhere we
didn't see them at all.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:53.569
And so I had to confront my own perhaps moral
invisibility one day when I practically stepped

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:59.999
over the body of an elderly woman sleeping
on the sidewalk. And didn't look back, didn't

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:03.670
think about it, and I thought, "What am I
doing here? What is going on?"

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.889
And so it occurred to us that we wanted to
find out more about homeless people in Santa

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:16.200
Monica and so I asked Ian, who is a photographer,
if he would be interested in working on a

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.660
book project with me.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:24.470
The main reason is that there are hundreds
of articles in words. There are newspaper

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.450
stories, there are radio stories, but they
don't show the pictures, and our feeling was

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.041
that if we we're going to try to make them
visible again, then they have to be visible,

00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:37.700
their faces have to be visible. We have to
be able to see what they look like, we have

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:44.260
to be able to hear their words so that we
can rehumanize this very large homeless population.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.380
And so in, I think it was November 2005, it
takes a while to do the research and do a

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.420
book, Ian and I started, decided we would
start walking the streets. We had no idea

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:02.860
what to expect. We had no idea if people would
talk to us. We had no idea if they would be

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.830
angry with us or happy to see us.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.200
And we decided to cover every square foot
of Santa Monica. It's 8.3 square miles; that's

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.530
pretty doable we figured. And that's what
we started doing. Up and down every street,

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:22.860
in every park, in every market, parking lot,
in every alley, we did these again and again

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:23.860
and again.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:30.150
Now, at first, we probably naively thought
we could talk to everybody. And we would do

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.340
this from dawn until dusk and thereafter for
as long as it took. Of course, that's unreasonable.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.730
In the first place, the crowd's very fluid;
the group was fluid, people come and go. And

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:46.470
secondly, when we approached certain of the
men on the streets, we found that they were

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:52.780
not happy to be approached by us. And some
of them frankly seemed dangerous and primarily

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.930
unwilling and so we thought, "We need to beat
a retreat." We really felt as though we had

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.630
entered into unwelcome territory.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.680
So we thought for a couple of days, "What
would we do here?" And decided, "Well, we'll

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.300
just go forward and we'll interview and talk
to, photograph as many women as is possible."

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:15.180
Let me introduce you to some of the women
that we met. And if you have seen these women

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.110
or spoken to them when I show you their photo,
let me know.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:24.660
The first one I wanna introduce you to is
Betty. Betty appears at page 96 of the book

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.250
if you'd like to take a look.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.250
[pause]

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.740
[sound of moving book]

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.530
And when I show Betty's photo I always, when
I look at it I always think, "This is the

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:43.200
face of an angel." At time that this photo
was taken, she was 79. She had been on the

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:50.930
streets for years. I'm happy to report that
recently at the age of 82 though, she has

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.440
been given an apartment and she's being taken
care of.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:01.980
When I saw Betty, she was holding and examining
one half of a Christmas card. It was a picture

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:08.620
of a mother and child, of the Madonna and
child, that she had taken out of a trash can.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.110
And she looked at it so lovingly.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.160
When I asked her if I could talk to her she
looked at me and said, "Well do you believe

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:20.940
in Jesus? Because if you don't, I really have
nothing to say to you."

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:27.870
Well we continued speaking and she told me
that she had this unshakable faith in God;

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:32.970
that she knew God would take care of her,
although life had been very hard, very hard

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.860
for Betty.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.280
She left her family, her husband and it seemed
like, although she's so delicate in her speech,

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:45.810
it must have been because of domestic violence.
And that is a major cause of why certain women

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.650
are homeless. They have to leave their homes
to protect themselves, protect their children.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.940
It's usually frankly in concert with other
factors as well which I can get to in the

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.460
conversation.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:02.490
Betty told us that when she left she took
her cat; the only thing she had. She's the

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:07.120
only one of the family that's left. And when
the cat died she experienced the greatest

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.720
possible sorrow. And so she went into the
downtown women's center, this is in Los Angeles

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:17.000
years and years ago to recover herself, to
recover her strength. And she did.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.270
Speaking with Betty was like speaking with
a person of great spiritual wisdom. I don't

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:30.890
think she knows that she has it, but she is
so serene, she's so at peace, she's so free

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.620
of anger or fear that it really was inspirational.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:39.760
Now I'm not a Pollyanna. Not every woman we
met on the street was like this, but I can

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:45.310
say that she was. And it was really a pleasure
to meet her.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:52.620
I had seen Betty on the streets about eight
years before and she was walking along Wilshire

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:58.700
Boulevard, walking along the gutter in Wilshire
Boulevard, and at the time when the influx

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:02.000
of homeless people was getting greater and
greater. And I did try to speak to her then

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.950
and she just looked at me without interest
and so I backed off.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:13.230
I was very happy to see her again. In fact
I had been looking for her for years so it

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:16.020
was like a found treasure to see her again.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.800
[pause]

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:25.270
I just have to read you a couple of Betty's
words because I personally find them irresistible

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:32.690
and you can take them as metaphorical or literal,
however you want. But the few phrases really

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:33.970
give the key to her personality.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:34.970
[pause]

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:38.050
[sound of pages turning]

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:43.190
Where did it go?

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:51.600
Well, she describes, she said, "When I was
a child" she met a man who was a "genuine

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:57.590
hobo" and that's how she said it. And she
gave him a potato. She knows you shouldn't

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:03.380
talk to strangers "but sometimes a stranger
is merely an angel unaware and if you don't

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:07.100
talk to strangers you won't meet the angel."

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:11.450
This is basically how Betty led her life.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:12.670
Let me introduce you to another woman.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.090
[pause]

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:19.740
[sound of moving paper]

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:28.300
Now this is Lydie. Ian and I met Lydie one
lovely bright day when she was sitting on

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:35.140
the grass outside Sears Department Store on
Colorado Boulevard writing furiously, furiously

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:41.830
in legal pads. And when I approached her and
asked her what she was doing and I talked

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:46.779
to her she told me she was writing to her
various lawyers to try and bring the various

00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:49.830
lawsuits that she felt she had coming to her.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:56.910
One of the first things I noticed about Lydie
was that her pupils were hugely dilated, suggesting

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:02.700
the obvious use of drugs, use of alcohol,
although I didn't have any more particular

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.700
proof of that.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:10.160
Lydie told us a number of things. That she
had a grandmother who was a 106 and not a

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:15.490
gray hair in her head. And yet she looked,
or a mother who was 106 and yet she looked

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:20.220
maybe late 40s, it's hard to tell sometimes.
That she had children that she wasn't getting

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:25.060
child support for and then she describes her
adult children. That she was a member of the

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:31.630
Retail Clerk's Union having worked for Rite
Aid formerly Thrifty's, she told me. That

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:34.650
part she sounded pretty accurate about that.

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:40.130
I mention these various things that she told
us because when we spoke, because I want you

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:46.040
to know that when we spoke to homeless people,
homeless women, we didn't examine them; we

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:52.110
didn't question them; we didn't cross examine;
we listened. And so there were a lot of contradictions.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:58.110
And I also didn't record what they said mainly
because they wouldn't let me. It made people

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:03.920
very nervous just like it would make us nervous.
Nor would some of them even allow me to take

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.610
notes, although most did.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:10.500
So what I would do after speaking to a woman
who wouldn't allow notes, wouldn't allow me

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.280
to take notes, was run back to the car, write
as fast as I could and then every night I

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.560
would transcribe so I had as accurate a picture
as possible.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:22.490
I do believe that I caught the essence of
what they were saying even if there are some

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:29.710
minor factual inconsistencies, because what
we're looking for is the essence, the soul

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:30.850
of the person.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:36.450
And with all of her difficulties Lydie was
communicating to us and we were trying to

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:43.750
catch what she was trying to say. And she
came across as a confused, depressed, unaware

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:47.870
woman. I don't know where she is today; I
haven't seen her in a long time.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.080
[pause]

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.110
Lydie was at page --

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:54.110
[pause]

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:59.860
well, we don't need to worry about that.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.610
[sound of papers being moved]

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:07.380
Thirty four if you wanna read more that Lydie
has said.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:13.220
The next person I'd like to introduce you
to is Carol Ann Murphy.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.760
[pause]

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:21.370
We met Carol Ann in Palisades Park. You may
have seen her there. I think she's still there

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:25.430
and we've seen her numerous times and spoken
to her more than one time.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:30.210
Let me show you Carol Ann's picture. Carol
Ann is at page 30.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:34.530
[pause]

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:46.350
Obviously the first things you notice about
Carol Ann are that she's unkempt, she looks

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:53.779
suspicious, she looks wary.

00:13:53.779 --> 00:14:00.710
Carol Ann sat in the park and still sits in
the park day after day. She's usually with

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:08.250
her shopping carts full of stuff and she gets
very, very anxious when people approach her.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:14.330
When I spoke to Carol Ann, I could barely
follow what she was saying. Her speech patterns

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:21.230
were so disordered, which I assume reflected
her mental patterns. Verbs and subjects didn't

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:26.770
agree and she would leap from topic to topic
and I could barely follow what she was saying.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:31.120
I wrote it down as fast I could -- those words;
I think she said something about multiple

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:36.170
husbands, multiple children, but once again
the Gestalt, the essence of that woman came

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:42.220
through. She's extremely confused; she's extremely
unwell.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:49.250
During the time that we were talking, she
relaxed a little bit and she let Ian take

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:55.089
her picture. By the way, we never took pictures
without specific expressed permission from,

00:14:55.089 --> 00:14:58.270
of anyone that we actually spoke to.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:04.520
And it was really quite charming. Carol Ann,
who obviously lives in her own world, looked

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:08.500
up coyly and smiled and was thrilled to have
her picture taken. There was something quite

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.899
charming about that.

00:15:12.899 --> 00:15:17.590
Who are these women that we're meeting on
the streets? I don't wanna say something so

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:24.000
simple as that they're just like us, but in
many ways they are. And I say not like us

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.589
because they're poorer. They're homeless.
Many of them deal with very severe, chronic

00:15:29.589 --> 00:15:35.470
mental and physical illnesses. We're fortunate
for the most part; we don't have to deal with

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:36.470
that.

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:40.840
But on the other levels, we are really quite
the same. When someone asks you if they can

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:45.640
take your picture, you don't crouch in a doorway.
You don't look as bad as you can. You look

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:51.190
up and you smile. Every one of them did the
same thing. It was very charming.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:56.910
Another thing, sometimes we encountered women
who seemed so severely mentally ill that they

00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:01.350
couldn't know where they were. I direct your
attention to the two large photos on my left.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:06.980
You can see those women there. The one on
the far left believe it or not, the one who

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:11.890
was crying out, we saw in Palisades Park.
She wasn't making any noise. Can you imagine?

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:17.680
She was a beautiful woman. She still had the
hospital bracelet on her wrist. She was in

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:22.360
such tragic condition and she should be in
a hospital.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:29.040
And the other one I saw, we saw on the Promenade,
and she was running up and down the Promenade,

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:34.390
the woman in the sweat suit grabbing at people's
purses. At first we were reluctant to go up,

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:38.570
what if she starts grabbing at us, we don't
wanna be in a spot where we have to push back

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:45.709
or whatever. But I decided to try and talk
to her anyway and I went up and said, "Excuse

00:16:45.709 --> 00:16:50.290
me. My name is Frances." That's always fair.
They get to know about me because I'm gonna

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:51.620
ask about them.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:55.920
And I'd always say, "My name is Frances and
my son is here and we're doing a book about

00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.370
homeless women and we would appreciate it
so much if you would talk to us. Anything

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:05.489
you want to know about me you ask and I'll
tell you." And then I would ask about them.

00:17:05.489 --> 00:17:09.889
And she looked so disoriented. She was so
dirty. It looked like she had just crawled

00:17:09.889 --> 00:17:16.019
out of a really filthy sleeping place, which
I think in fact was the case. But when I said

00:17:16.019 --> 00:17:21.120
to her, and she was kind of raving and looked
so irrational. When I asked her her name there

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:27.079
was this moment of clarity and she looked
and she said, "Erma." And then she was gone

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:28.079
again.

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:35.019
That's another thing. The center was holding
for certain purposes. The center part of the

00:17:35.019 --> 00:17:40.460
personality in many cases is still there.
So when we asked her her name, "Erma" she

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:43.999
told us. And then we tried to talk a little
but couldn't; gave her some money which she

00:17:43.999 --> 00:17:48.029
put inside the sweatshirt and dropped out.
She's looking at it on the floor there; I

00:17:48.029 --> 00:17:51.869
don't think she knew what it was. She was
gone again and there was no other possibility

00:17:51.869 --> 00:17:53.739
of talking to her.

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:59.270
So back to Carol Ann Murphy, who unfortunately
shares some of the symptoms and some of the

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:06.309
conditions we feel that the two women whose
larger photos on my left also share, which

00:18:06.309 --> 00:18:08.899
seems to be a severe mental disorder.

00:18:08.899 --> 00:18:14.769
After we had spoken to Carol, we left and
we are walking down the sidewalk -- on to

00:18:14.769 --> 00:18:20.950
find somebody else or perhaps take off the
rest of the day and she looked really, really,

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:25.539
she was agitated. So we looked back and a
man had come out and just for the fun of it,

00:18:25.539 --> 00:18:30.989
if you can imagine, was shaking and rattling
her shopping cart. She was very, very afraid.

00:18:30.989 --> 00:18:35.460
She was so agitated. And so we went over and
said, "Okay, fellow, leave her alone. You're

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:40.259
scaring her." And he says basically, "So what?
She's crazy." And she was. Like that doesn't

00:18:40.259 --> 00:18:46.789
matter, "doesn't matter what I do to her because
she's lesser than I am. She's an other, she's

00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:49.049
not like me."

00:18:49.049 --> 00:18:53.539
It took us several times to get rid of this
man. He would go hide behind a tree and come

00:18:53.539 --> 00:18:59.820
back, agitate her again. It was truly amazing
to see such kind of brazen cruelty, broad

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:04.429
daylight; shameless, the man had no remorse.

00:19:04.429 --> 00:19:08.700
Another man whose name was Walter whom we
got to know in the park, also homeless, came

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:12.020
to Carol's rescue and said, "Don't worry.
I'll take care of it." And we've seen him

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:18.950
out there on other occasions helping her out
and they seem to have a very general and generous

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:23.640
mutual relationship. I am hopeful that Carol
Ann will find a place to live because she

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.750
really cannot take care of herself.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.190
[pause]

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:36.289
Another woman I'd like to introduce you to
is Sister Chi Chi, page 88, a goddess by anyone's

00:19:36.289 --> 00:19:45.279
standards. Sister Chi Chi describes herself
as a priest of Isis. She knows that she was

00:19:45.279 --> 00:19:48.889
in a former life because she had a reading
and the woman told her that she was.

00:19:48.889 --> 00:19:56.320
She has a larger than life personality, a
glorious presence, a checkered background.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:00.950
She loved having her picture taken. She asked
if Ian would take one of her kissing the tree,

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:07.190
which of course he did. It's a gorgeous photo.
She's so exuberant.

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:11.820
We started talking because she was sitting
on a bench in Palisades Park and there was

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:16.789
a little pair of pink moccasins next to her
and she asked me if I wanted them. She hated

00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:20.529
to see things going to waste; she didn't like
them. They weren't very comfortable.

00:20:20.529 --> 00:20:26.639
And so of course we start visiting and she's
open and she's talkative, and she's happy

00:20:26.639 --> 00:20:31.399
and really a pleasure to talk to. She told
us she became homeless because of domestic

00:20:31.399 --> 00:20:39.940
violence. She also has five children whom
she never sees. She has had difficulty staying

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:46.960
in shelters. She has indicated that she doesn't
like to follow the rules.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.850
We've seen Sister Chi Chi around quite a bit
in town. She's quite a well known presence.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:56.429
Once you see her, you do not forget her. But
I'm not sure if her life is any different

00:20:56.429 --> 00:21:04.009
and I'm not sure if her children's lives are
any different. You can read more of her full

00:21:04.009 --> 00:21:06.480
story in the book.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.490
[pause]

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:12.570
[sound of moving pictures around]

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:16.629
[sound of papers shuffling]

00:21:16.629 --> 00:21:22.559
Nell is on page 66. And if you've walked down
Wilshire Boulevard in the last few months

00:21:22.559 --> 00:21:28.299
between Ocean and Second you have seen Nell.
She sits in front of Hennessey + Ingalls in

00:21:28.299 --> 00:21:40.379
a wheelchair and she panhandles. And she's
adorably sweet and modest and unassuming and

00:21:40.379 --> 00:21:43.840
I thought she would have housing by now, but
she doesn't.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:49.340
We met Nell in Palisades Park. The day that
we met her was a sunny, warm day and she was

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:54.669
eating an ice cream cone in her wheelchair
and motating forward by pushing her feet along

00:21:54.669 --> 00:22:00.350
the ground. And after she finished the ice
cream cone, or what she was going to eat of

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:06.109
it, she moved forward in her wheelchair and
put the rest of the cone in the trash. And

00:22:06.109 --> 00:22:07.200
I thought to myself, "Good citizen."

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:14.440
And then she moved back and she appeared to
be falling asleep in her wheelchair on the

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:19.530
sidewalk and she went forward more and more
and her head dropped more and more and I'm

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:24.070
standing back kind of patiently, respectfully
I'd like to say something to her, but I don't

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:29.429
want to interrupt or interfere. But she kept
going lower and lower and lower and it looked

00:22:29.429 --> 00:22:33.039
to me like she was gonna fall out of the wheelchair
on the sidewalk. So I went over and, "Excuse

00:22:33.039 --> 00:22:38.160
me, ma'am, ma'am I'm afraid you're gonna whatever."
And she snapped up and she said, "I'm reading."

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.160
[laughter]

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:43.279
[laughs] And she had one of these large print
comic books in her lap. Apparently that's

00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:49.309
what she was reading. It was really, it was
funny. And so we talked as much as we could.

00:22:49.309 --> 00:22:54.799
I find it very difficult to understand her
because I think she'd had a stroke or another

00:22:54.799 --> 00:23:04.690
debilitating accident and so our conversation
didn't go on very long, but as you can see,

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:11.779
the sweetness of that face. I mean she's really
darling. When I introduced her to Ian and

00:23:11.779 --> 00:23:18.190
she said yes, we could have her picture. He
could take her photo. She looked over all

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:24.809
smiles, just as warm and thrilled as anybody
to have her picture taken.

00:23:24.809 --> 00:23:29.600
And we shouldn't I guess be surprised because
when you wanna talk to somebody typically

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:34.950
you don't go out and seek out a homeless person
to talk to. Nobody ever asks them except a

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:40.549
social service provider or maybe another homeless
person. Nobody ever says, "How are you? What

00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:45.249
can we do for you today? Nice day isn't it?"
Or "What do you feel about such and such?"

00:23:45.249 --> 00:23:49.860
When's the last time you asked a homeless
person for his or her opinion? And so they

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:56.359
were almost to a person, thrilled to talk
to us, absolutely thrilled that somebody cared

00:23:56.359 --> 00:23:58.499
enough to talk to them.

00:23:58.499 --> 00:24:01.919
I still see some of the homeless women on
the streets that were there during the time

00:24:01.919 --> 00:24:08.989
that we were working on the book and one in
particular, Miriam calls out and she says,

00:24:08.989 --> 00:24:10.361
"How the book coming? Is it finished yet?"

00:24:10.361 --> 00:24:11.361
[laughter]

00:24:11.361 --> 00:24:14.550
And there's Linda on the Promenade who said,
"When do I get a copy?" And I actually took

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:19.229
one down to give it to her and I couldn't
find her, but I'm sure our paths will cross.

00:24:19.229 --> 00:24:26.019
And there was darling Jeanine who we met on
the beach one day who as we were leaving said

00:24:26.019 --> 00:24:28.090
to Ian, "Now you take care of your mother."

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:29.090
[laughter]

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:33.529
I mean these are -- and I would say that Jeanine
was very, had a very difficult life, she was

00:24:33.529 --> 00:24:38.450
very young and she seemed very impaired to
me and yet she seemed like she had been a

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:43.960
very well brought up girl. She had lovely
manners and so she communicated this well

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.259
wish.

00:24:46.259 --> 00:24:54.100
And then there was Star. Star's, I'm not sure
what page she's on, but if you've, Star wore

00:24:54.100 --> 00:25:00.179
so much makeup and a long blond wig and kind
of elaborate headdress and she called herself

00:25:00.179 --> 00:25:05.519
"Star" because she was absolutely convinced
that she could be one. The first time I met

00:25:05.519 --> 00:25:12.049
Star was on the Promenade. She seemed very
depressed, very afraid, paranoid I think it's

00:25:12.049 --> 00:25:17.580
probably fair to say, and so we had a lengthy
interview but no photograph. Ian wasn't there

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:19.539
that day, I just happened to run into her.

00:25:19.539 --> 00:25:24.169
And then a few weeks later we were walking
in Palisades Park and there is Star again,

00:25:24.169 --> 00:25:33.190
a totally different person, practically [pause]
flying through the park, flying with joy with

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:38.830
her new bicycle and so happy and so expressive
and so emotive. I mean the shift in moods

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:44.799
was so noticeable that you wonder what kinds
of mood burdens that she has to bear.

00:25:44.799 --> 00:25:49.169
She was ecstatic to see us again. She said
that she would love to have her photo taken

00:25:49.169 --> 00:25:53.390
but only with me. We have a wonderful one
of us together [laughs] and then Ian managed

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:55.279
to get some others of her.

00:25:55.279 --> 00:26:02.619
And the last time we saw her, she was sitting
on the cannon, you know the old Civil War

00:26:02.619 --> 00:26:07.950
cannon in Palisades Park, with a cordless
microphone in her hand. Not cordless fancy

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:12.840
like the ones in here that actually work,
but a microphone without a wire and singing

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:18.659
her heart out because she knows that she can
be like J.Lo or Mariah Carey if she only gets

00:26:18.659 --> 00:26:19.659
the opportunity.

00:26:19.659 --> 00:26:24.600
[pause]

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:37.039
And let me introduce you also to Glory, page
76. Glory is one of those women that is older

00:26:37.039 --> 00:26:42.919
like so many of the women we met on the street
and what a surprise to think that this is

00:26:42.919 --> 00:26:49.299
the way you're gonna spend your old age. Glory
had a career as a nurse's helper as I think

00:26:49.299 --> 00:26:53.470
she told me. It was difficult sometimes for
me to follow what she was saying. But she

00:26:53.470 --> 00:27:00.960
was a magnificent presence. She had a great
sense of herself as you can see, a very powerful

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:07.779
personality that demanded respect and observance
of whatever particular customs she was going

00:27:07.779 --> 00:27:15.480
to enforce at the time. And of course we,
as usual, let her determine the course of

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.659
the conversation.

00:27:17.659 --> 00:27:22.440
The City of Santa Monica was as surprised
as anybody when the homeless people first

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:30.229
appeared on the streets. And at first, and
I read 25 years of newspaper articles to do

00:27:30.229 --> 00:27:34.849
some background work with this, for this book
as well as doing a legal review all the laws

00:27:34.849 --> 00:27:39.869
that pertained, as well as reading medical
journals and sociological journals, etcetera,

00:27:39.869 --> 00:27:40.869
etcetera, etcetera.

00:27:40.869 --> 00:27:45.099
But I remember some of the earliest articles
about the City of Santa Monica saying in effect,

00:27:45.099 --> 00:27:49.960
"We've got a couple of homeless people here.
Well let's give them some job counseling and

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:57.080
that should take care of it." And I think
the figure was $85,000 this year for that.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:00.899
If you've ever spent time online looking at
the city budget, you know that it's up in

00:28:00.899 --> 00:28:06.629
the tens of millions now and we still have
a lot of homeless people.

00:28:06.629 --> 00:28:14.330
The city had to learn like everybody else
what to do about this problem. And so from

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:19.070
just assuming it was an employment issue like
so and so lost his job or she lost her job.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:25.309
It's rough and so she couldn't make the mortgage
payments or she was living paycheck to paycheck,

00:28:25.309 --> 00:28:30.830
no family around, these things happen. But
that hasn't been the case for the population

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:37.710
of homeless people, those long term homeless
people, the chronic homeless I believe they've

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:39.139
come to be called.

00:28:39.139 --> 00:28:44.830
So the next kind of program that the city
used and it was I think probably state of

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:50.239
the art at the time or least it met the highest
standards of what the information was, the

00:28:50.239 --> 00:28:54.899
available information was at the time, was
called the continuum of care. So we get you

00:28:54.899 --> 00:28:59.609
a case manager, you check in at OPCC, Ocean
Park Community Center and we'll give you a

00:28:59.609 --> 00:29:05.399
case manager and then if you have substance
abuse problems, alcohol problems -- okay we're

00:29:05.399 --> 00:29:08.989
gonna take care of that and we're gonna teach
you how to budget. And if you need medical

00:29:08.989 --> 00:29:14.990
assistance and you need some kind of prescriptions
for mental or physical problems okay we'll

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:19.460
give you those. And then the gold at the end
of the rainbow was then you got housing. And

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:23.440
it worked for some people, no question about
it. It didn't seem to work for the chronic

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.440
homeless.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:29.399
And now the thinking is, and I think this
is probably the gold standard in the care

00:29:29.399 --> 00:29:36.080
of homeless people, is housing first. Because
most people can't do all the things, a lot

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:41.989
of the people cannot accomplish all the steps
that they must accomplish to earn that housing

00:29:41.989 --> 00:29:47.049
at the end of the rainbow. And so you get
them off the streets, get them to a safe environment,

00:29:47.049 --> 00:29:51.309
and then presumably the rest will come.

00:29:51.309 --> 00:29:57.769
What we found is that that would probably
apply to many people, but not to most of the

00:29:57.769 --> 00:30:04.580
women that we met in Santa Monica. The estimates
that you'll probably read in the paper are

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:11.159
that a third are mentally ill of homeless
people, a third are just out of a job, a third

00:30:11.159 --> 00:30:15.370
are just poor -- not "just", but you know
what I'm saying. They try to give some categorical

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:16.370
breakdown.

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:25.270
But in fact of the women that we spoke to,
Ian and I pretty much concluded that 85 percent

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:32.970
or so seem to display symptoms for a serious,
chronic, mental disorder. Now what does that

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:38.239
mean? It means that they're never gonna be
able to live by themselves. They're never

00:30:38.239 --> 00:30:43.470
going to be able to have a job. Most of them
never had a job already, today, they never

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:49.259
had that. They can't be reunited with families
who don't know how to take care of them.

00:30:49.259 --> 00:30:56.499
And so for that group, for those people, those
women that we met who are afflicted with long

00:30:56.499 --> 00:31:02.679
term, serious, mental illness, they need,
we felt, the equivalent of assisted living;

00:31:02.679 --> 00:31:07.570
some kind of a shelter where there's somebody
around to give a hand when they need it.

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:18.659
When we started the book, we had never heard
of Daybreak. Daybreak is an arm of OPCC here

00:31:18.659 --> 00:31:26.730
in Santa Monica and it runs two facilities.
One is the drop in center where any woman

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:31.679
can drop in, have something to eat maybe get
cleaned up a little bit, rest, get off the

00:31:31.679 --> 00:31:35.090
street, escape the miseries of the street
for a few hours.

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:40.769
And the other is the Daybreak shelter which
is a transitional shelter of six to nine months

00:31:40.769 --> 00:31:49.549
residency and the women live on site, and
during that time are given the skills to try

00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:55.419
to live on their own once and if, let's say
if, housing becomes available. They can always

00:31:55.419 --> 00:32:00.419
go back to Daybreak, they can always participate
in the group therapy and the various sessions

00:32:00.419 --> 00:32:05.679
in the clubs, in the skill groups, in the
craft groups. Once you're there you can always

00:32:05.679 --> 00:32:06.679
go.

00:32:06.679 --> 00:32:12.389
But yet even then some of the, and it's the
best facility we saw by far, and it was the

00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:17.599
only place that not one woman we spoke to
had a critical word for. Everybody loved it,

00:32:17.599 --> 00:32:22.269
everybody wished they could be there. It's
quite a remarkable place. I attribute that

00:32:22.269 --> 00:32:30.549
to Amy Turk who runs it and her help. They
are, and we were there many, many times -- they

00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:35.969
are unfailingly respectful and kind and intelligent
in how they deal with the women that are there.

00:32:35.969 --> 00:32:40.139
It's a really remarkable facility. But there
are not enough Daybreaks -- that's really

00:32:40.139 --> 00:32:41.139
the problem.

00:32:41.139 --> 00:32:47.109
[pause]

00:32:47.109 --> 00:32:53.909
Santa Monica has really rolled out the carpet
for homeless people in a very generous way,

00:32:53.909 --> 00:33:01.409
but it's the only political entity in L.A.
County, of which I think there are 88 different

00:33:01.409 --> 00:33:04.350
cities, which has taken its responsibility
to heart.

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:09.469
Now there are things about the way that they
run their programs that Ian and I would have

00:33:09.469 --> 00:33:15.749
perhaps comments on. But to be fair it's the
only one that says, "This is our social responsibility.

00:33:15.749 --> 00:33:20.840
How are we going to take care of it?" And
they allocate generous amounts of money to

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:22.480
try to help their homeless population.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:28.970
Some of you may have been aware of the $100
million that the L.A. County Board of Supervisors

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:38.969
earmarked for five, I think it was, like organizing
centers in various cities throughout L.A.

00:33:38.969 --> 00:33:45.999
County. It is my understanding that because
of so much resistance by the five locations

00:33:45.999 --> 00:33:50.450
that were chosen none of that money has been
spent. But that appeared in the paper, "Wonderful,

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:55.799
my God," we think "$100 million. This is gonna
help solve the problem." But as far as I know

00:33:55.799 --> 00:33:59.749
it's still, it probably never moved from one
account to another and of course there isn't

00:33:59.749 --> 00:34:05.989
any money now is there? And so that kind of
thing didn't really, didn't really come to

00:34:05.989 --> 00:34:06.989
pass.

00:34:06.989 --> 00:34:08.700
[pause]

00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:22.280
When there are so many competing social needs,
it is very difficult to believe that one social

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:28.750
problem will be solved. And on realistic days,
we don't believe that. It is known, we know

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:34.389
how to do it, the people that give the care
know how to do it. But there at this time

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:35.700
isn't money or the political will.

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:40.960
I mean the same can be said for our school
systems. There are so many areas that require

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:48.179
attention and they won't be getting the complete
attention that they require. Nevertheless,

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:53.800
one thing that was said to me, both of us
during our research was that, "As long as

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:57.210
you cure homelessness one woman at a time,"
we were just talking about the care of women,

00:34:57.210 --> 00:35:04.270
"that's how you progress." I think that is
a good way to look at it.

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:15.089
There's some photos here on my left that I
wanted to point out to you, identify them

00:35:15.089 --> 00:35:19.290
for you; Ian Noble took them. These are mainly,
these are his night shots. I didn't go out

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:26.180
at night and he went out, I didn't. He was
out all night many nights watching what was

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:27.180
out there.

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:31.369
[pause]

00:35:31.369 --> 00:35:34.869
This first one was taken in front of the Christian
Science Reading Room and we actually gave

00:35:34.869 --> 00:35:41.990
them a copy of the photo. It takes a few minutes,
or few seconds for your eyes to focus to see

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:49.299
that there's somebody sleeping there in front.
Hopefully in the protection of a religious

00:35:49.299 --> 00:35:56.990
sentiment, one hopes. That's on the Promenade
in Santa Monica.

00:35:56.990 --> 00:36:03.560
The next photo was also taken on the Promenade.
I think it's a great shot of a woman reading

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.950
a book in the middle of the night by the light
of one of the store windows.

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:08.200
[pause]

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:16.660
The next shot was taken on Santa Monica Boulevard.
You don't have a bed so you make yourselves

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:22.760
into a bed. This enterprising couple, they
had I think a flat sheet and a fitted sheet

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:27.660
just like you have on your normal bed. And
each one of those sheets each is wrapped around

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:32.580
the person. You become invisible you hope
 -- at least you feel protected.

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:33.580
[pause]

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:41.210
And then we have Erma and the other woman
and then down the way she was sleeping in

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:50.849
Palisades Park. She appears to be wearing
a blanket made into a jacket and the arms

00:36:50.849 --> 00:36:56.339
are made out of tying parts of the blanket
with string. We saw numbers of those blankets

00:36:56.339 --> 00:37:01.281
throughout the city during the time that we
were writing the book, and I believe that

00:37:01.281 --> 00:37:07.700
some agency handed out blankets during the
cold part of the year and she made hers into

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:08.700
a coat, jacket.

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:13.490
[pause]

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:21.720
The next photo is a poor woman sitting at
Inspiration Point, bent down looking like

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:28.579
she's experiencing some sort of despair, if
her posture is any indication.

00:37:28.579 --> 00:37:36.890
And the last one is on Second Street at the
Knoll Chair Store and once again it takes

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:45.690
a few seconds to look to see the person sleeping
just outside the light.

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:52.000
People say, "Well, if there are shelters,
why do some of these women stay outside and

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.940
not go to the shelters?" And let's assume
for purposes of the discussion that there

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.470
are shelter beds.

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:03.589
Well, we were told many, many times, as a
matter of fact it was a constant theme from

00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:10.529
the women we spoke to, almost regardless of
their mental condition that they didn't like

00:38:10.529 --> 00:38:17.000
the shelters because they're very noisy which
was frightening; some of the men there they

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.059
felt were dangerous, they didn't want to be
around them; and who wants to sleep a few

00:38:21.059 --> 00:38:25.410
feet away from somebody that you don't know
if they're crazy or violent or whatever. And

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:30.770
so some of the women stayed away from the
shelters. It's not that they were ungrateful;

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:36.930
it's that they wanted to take care of themselves,
they can be frightening places.

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:41.861
And I was talking to a retired city attorney
from Santa Monica and saying, "Well would

00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:46.150
you want to sleep in a shelter?" "Actually
no." He said, "All they would like is a small

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:51.920
room of their own," assuming that they're
well enough to take care of it.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:54.339
[pause]

00:38:54.339 --> 00:39:04.039
[sound of papers shuffling]

00:39:04.039 --> 00:39:11.230
So people say, "How did it happen? How did
this happen?" Well you can see some of the

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:17.630
reasons just from the stories of some of the
women that I've told you about today. The

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:23.520
mental illness, and there's a period in this
country when there was a deinstitutionalization

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:27.750
of the mentally ill; they were moved out of
mental hospitals supposedly into community

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:32.950
care centers which, of course, were never
funded. As Daniel Patrick Moynihan said at

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:37.520
the time, "We're capable of doing this and
we do it with regularity." Congress failed

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:41.549
to take care of the problem that it said it
would take care of.

00:39:41.549 --> 00:39:46.010
People were first moved away from the mental
hospitals in the 60s and the 70s. They were

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:53.210
terrible places. People were not treated,
often they were just drugged to control really

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:59.490
aberrant or violent behavior. And the kinds
of fancy psychotropic drugs that we have today

00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:02.940
did not exist. I mean one can appreciate the
quandary of people who are trying to take

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:08.710
care of severely, severely mentally ill people,
nevertheless, a bad situation all around.

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:16.960
And so there was the deinstitutionalization
that was pushed by many people in the 60s

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:21.829
and the 70s who were trying to break away
from other perceived authoritarian structures.

00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:28.760
The problem was there wasn't much to replace
it with. We didn't, the society didn't fund

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:35.200
better care and so what you had is what we
see on the streets today.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:41.790
We see people who are out of the mental, are
out of a mental care system and free, but

00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:46.000
what are they free to do? They're free to
go to roam through a garbage can, they're

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.279
free to sleep in any doorway that they want.

00:40:48.279 --> 00:40:53.271
There's a lot of discussion legally as well
about what kinds of restrictions should be

00:40:53.271 --> 00:40:59.670
put on a mentally ill person. California law
for many years only allowed involuntary commitment

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:07.849
if the person was an immediate danger to him
or herself or to another, which didn't really

00:41:07.849 --> 00:41:15.250
allow for evidence from those people who knew
the mentally ill person best about whole series

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:22.019
of events perhaps culminating in something
or culminating, or other kinds of behavior

00:41:22.019 --> 00:41:26.730
being told to the court which would clearly
indicate a severe mental illness. That has

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:30.410
been changed. There is a better evidentiary
requirement now; more evidence can get in;

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:37.619
families can get more involuntary commitment
if that's what they seek. But that's still

00:41:37.619 --> 00:41:40.789
a very, very controversial topic.

00:41:40.789 --> 00:41:46.010
If I had asked, we did ask some of the women
that we spoke to what would they like, where

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:52.289
would they like to be? And I don't think either
of us had the courage to ask any of them,

00:41:52.289 --> 00:41:55.990
"Would you prefer involuntary commitment?"
We know the answer. It would have been no.

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:58.010
So I mean it's a very difficult subject.

00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:59.660
[pause]

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:09.589
So people ask me, "So what are they like?"
And "What are homeless people like? What are

00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:19.569
homeless women like?" Well, it's very difficult,
it's very difficult for me to give a short

00:42:19.569 --> 00:42:24.481
answer in a sentence or two. But let me just
read you a couple of, a few paragraphs from

00:42:24.481 --> 00:42:29.579
the beginning of the book which I think sums
it up, at least from our point of view.

00:42:29.579 --> 00:42:34.099
"They sit on the grass under trees in the
parks. They sit in filthy cars in front of

00:42:34.099 --> 00:42:41.420
City Hall. They sit on benches, park benches,
bus benches, benches on Third Street Promenade,

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:46.049
benches on the pier. They stand in doorways.
They sleep in doorways. They rummage through

00:42:46.049 --> 00:42:49.900
trash cans. They panhandle. They visit with
friends.

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:56.980
They move around -- walking, shuffling, staggering,
often looking down, usually alone, burdened

00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:02.250
by bags and backpacks, pushing shopping carts
spilling over with their possessions.

00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:10.140
They are distressed, calm, disoriented, rational,
incoherent, articulate, filthy, clean, angry,

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:17.220
forgiving, pretty, plain, resigned, hopeful,
brave, afraid, unspoken to.

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:23.799
They write poetry. They paint. They drink
too much. They use drugs. They're sober. Their

00:43:23.799 --> 00:43:28.200
families don't know where they are. Their
families kicked them out. Their families want

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.200
them to come home.

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:35.490
They come from far away. They are home grown.
They appreciate the kindness of strangers.

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:37.400
They want to be left alone.

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:43.119
They're ex-cons. They're church goers. They're
old and they're young. They hate the cold,

00:43:43.119 --> 00:43:49.099
the rain, the wind. They stay out of the heat
of the sun. They don't trust the police. They

00:43:49.099 --> 00:43:51.880
had a job once. They never worked.

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:57.579
One grabs at people as she walks by. Another
howls silently. Many talk to themselves when

00:43:57.579 --> 00:44:01.930
they think nobody's listening. They're always
poor.

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:05.799
They say they live outside because they don't
qualify for assistance. They say they don't

00:44:05.799 --> 00:44:10.210
qualify for assistance because they aren't
insane or a drunk or an addict or they'll

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:14.660
lose their freedom if they go inside, or they're
afraid of the men at the shelters, or the

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:18.970
bank stole all their money, or they're being
followed by a man who assumes many shapes

00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:23.510
and identities, or the FBI and the CIA are
after them, or they're helping the police

00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:27.360
find a serial killer, or nobody asked them
if they wanted an apartment and there are

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:30.010
no apartments available to them anyway.

00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:35.599
Many have a hard time knowing what they think
much less saying it because their thoughts

00:44:35.599 --> 00:44:40.400
are muddled and their words don't come out
right. They hear extra voices in their heads,

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:44.640
they see things the rest of us don't see,
and they believe things the rest of us don't

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:45.640
believe.

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:50.829
Who are they? They're the homeless women of
Santa Monica. They are the homeless women

00:44:50.829 --> 00:44:52.230
everywhere."

00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:54.460
Thank you.

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:56.540
[applause]

00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:59.400
[sound of dog barking]

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.400
Thank you.

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:02.480
I take that as applause. [laughs]

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:03.480
[laughter]

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:07.690
&gt;&gt;Julie Wiskirchen: Does anybody have any
questions for Frances or her son, Ian, the

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:08.690
photographer is here as well?

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:09.690
[pause]

00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:10.690
&gt;&gt;Frances Noble: Anyone?

00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:11.690
[pause]

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:12.690
&gt;&gt;male #1: I actually have a question because
I've spoken to a bunch of homeless people

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:56.880
in Santa Monica and I find them really interesting
and I wanted to just see if your take though

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:57.880
was that if you found this to be correct that
everybody is fearful about talking to people.

00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:58.880
They might look fascinating and you see that
some of these people are highly intelligent

00:45:58.880 --> 00:45:59.880
and creative but there's always the fear that
they are gonna be nuts and they're gonna go

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:00.880
off on you, go crazy. I mean is that often
the case or do you think it's not so much

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:01.880
the case when you talk to them?

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:02.880
&gt;&gt;Frances Noble: Well as I said no we, we
antici--, we weren't sure about initial reactions

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:06.770
either when we began. And what we found among
the women was that there was really no need

00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:12.510
to be anxious or afraid. And there was only
one woman I spoke to who, whose face completely

00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:18.730
changed expression and she was going into
a psychotic episode and I stepped back and

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:22.120
gave her space, but it didn't accelerate into
anything. And I said, "Thank you and good

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:23.120
bye."

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:28.609
But by that time we'd had a lot of experience.
We spoke to hundreds of people, not all of

00:46:28.609 --> 00:46:34.349
them of course got in the book. But as I mentioned
an untreated, seriously, mentally ill male

00:46:34.349 --> 00:46:45.650
is a different person from the counterpart
who is a female. And so we were wary, that's

00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:48.410
why we stopped interviewing men.

00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:56.369
We were out so long too that we got to the
point where we could pick out the most subtle

00:46:56.369 --> 00:47:02.670
body language and see that somebody was homeless
and they were trying to hide it. And in those

00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:06.180
cases we were hesitant to go up sometimes
'cause you didn't want to embarrass them and

00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:10.339
make them feel -- but you could tell certain
things. The way a person walked, all sorts

00:47:10.339 --> 00:47:14.590
of things. What their feet looked like. And
we got, it got to the point where we had a

00:47:14.590 --> 00:47:17.630
pretty good read on the person's personality.

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:18.630
[pause]

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:27.130
&gt;&gt;male #2: What's the police, like the police
do they, what are their sort of instructions

00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:28.839
on how to deal with the homeless?

00:47:28.839 --> 00:47:33.369
&gt;&gt;Frances Noble: Well there is a liaison,
a homeless liaison in the Santa Monica Police

00:47:33.369 --> 00:47:34.369
Department.

00:47:34.369 --> 00:47:38.030
[pause]

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:44.650
What we heard from a lot of the women was
that they felt uncared for by the police or

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:54.981
hassled. And the City's a little bit schizophrenic
in its approach sometimes. There are these

00:47:54.981 --> 00:48:01.430
extraordinary programs which are online, so
anyone can read what kind of care or services

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:02.950
are available for homeless people.

00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:09.860
At the same time there are signs in various
businesses doorways, "Don't sleep here." And

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:13.910
if somebody sleeps there in violation of the
warning on the sign, the police can pick them

00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:18.810
up. There are other places where sometimes
people are sleeping [clears throat] excuse

00:48:18.810 --> 00:48:24.380
me, which I'll show my bias like in the industrial
section there's nobody there. There doesn't

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:26.799
really seem to be a problem where the person
will be told in the middle of the night, "Get

00:48:26.799 --> 00:48:27.799
up and move on."

00:48:27.799 --> 00:48:34.779
So I think it's not the easiest relationship.
I also understand that the police probably

00:48:34.779 --> 00:48:41.030
spend a huge percentage of their time on problems
"created by homeless people." So that's an

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:44.250
issue for them I'm sure. It's a complicated
matter.

00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:47.950
[pause]

00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:53.849
My sense is that probably more, my sense is
that most of the women don't feel that the

00:48:53.849 --> 00:48:55.240
police are their ally. That's my sense.

00:48:55.240 --> 00:49:02.319
&gt;&gt;male #3: So I've got a question for you.
Well first, thanks so much for making visible

00:49:02.319 --> 00:49:05.230
and pursuing this project. We really appreciate
it.

00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:06.230
&gt;&gt;Frances Noble: You're welcome.

00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:13.700
&gt;&gt;male #3: And a question for I think Ian
and for you both is what do the subjects of

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:19.359
your photos think and have you had a chance
to share with them? I know you talked a little

00:49:19.359 --> 00:49:20.359
bit about it but --

00:49:20.359 --> 00:49:25.210
&gt;&gt;Frances Noble: They all really love it.
It's very touching. You don't always know

00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:29.200
if that will be the case even if you went
forth with permissions and signed releases

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:34.559
and all that. There are times when people
say things and then when they look back they

00:49:34.559 --> 00:49:39.359
didn't quite fully understand that it would
be made public. And yet we have a very, very

00:49:39.359 --> 00:49:44.250
positive response. We spent more days at Daybreak
again, for example, giving books to the women

00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:49.130
there. They're so pleased. One woman said,
"Look at this picture. It made me remember

00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:51.760
that I used to smile." It was touching.

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:59.869
And we feel that we have a very good relationship
with the homeless community.

00:49:59.869 --> 00:50:02.599
&gt;&gt;male #3: Thanks.

00:50:02.599 --> 00:50:03.599
[pause]

00:50:03.599 --> 00:50:11.420
&gt;&gt;female #1: Thank you for coming. When you
started this project, you probably had some

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:15.819
preconceived notions about homeless and what
for you is the one thing that changed the

00:50:15.819 --> 00:50:17.450
most when you finished this project?

00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:19.089
[pause]

00:50:19.089 --> 00:50:30.670
&gt;&gt;Frances Noble: I feel, well I didn't know
what to expect. I don't think Ian did either.

00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:40.750
But I feel that I understand the population
better and it was a huge educational experience.

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:44.970
And we spoke to not only homeless people,
we spoke to people in the city, we spoke to

00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:51.250
citizens, we spoke to social service providers,
psychiatrists, everybody you can think about

00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:55.339
to try and get a complete picture. The main
source of information frankly though was the

00:50:55.339 --> 00:50:58.369
women. I mean really there's no question about
that.

00:50:58.369 --> 00:51:11.319
I just feel comfortable with the idea of them.
I don't, and I see them very, very much. So

00:51:11.319 --> 00:51:15.380
in the old days, it's easier to look away
sometimes. Once we started working on this

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:20.930
book, it got to the point that all I could
see on the street were homeless women. And

00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:26.360
sometimes I would not go out. I would not
take my usual walk. I needed a break. It would

00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:28.150
be all I could see.

00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:35.220
And so it certainly increased my information
and my knowledge about a part of humanity

00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:36.550
I didn't know too much about.

00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:38.759
Um-hum.

00:51:38.759 --> 00:51:40.970
[pause]

00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:48.119
&gt;&gt;Ian Noble: I think for me -- is this working?
Cool. I think for me it was just the level

00:51:48.119 --> 00:51:53.000
of mental illness, how many really were suffering
from something serious. I'd always heard the

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.260
a third, and a third, and a third argument.
Some people are down on their luck, they'll

00:51:56.260 --> 00:52:00.430
be back on their feet soon. Some are addicts
or alcoholics and the other third is mentally

00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:06.069
ill. But just the percentage of people who
seem to be suffering from something very serious

00:52:06.069 --> 00:52:11.270
was far beyond that and that's really what
struck me above anything else, I think.

00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:17.569
&gt;&gt;Frances Noble: If I could just add one thought
to that. We wondered why that was. And we

00:52:17.569 --> 00:52:23.880
came to the conclusion that in the sense we
had a self-selected group. People who were

00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:28.750
able to take care of themselves better, get
back into the employment world, or get themselves

00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:35.019
back to a family member who could assist,
were doing that.

00:52:35.019 --> 00:52:40.779
The people that we saw were the ones who were
sitting and kind of hiding in the parks or

00:52:40.779 --> 00:52:47.160
cocooning in the parks, or hoping that they
would be alright. Not that some are not social

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:51.779
and visiting with each other, but in general
we felt that we were exposed to the most vulnerable

00:52:51.779 --> 00:52:55.369
for the most part of the group. And that's
why they were self-selected. They couldn't

00:52:55.369 --> 00:52:57.381
do anything else but what they were doing.

00:52:57.381 --> 00:52:58.539
[pause]

00:52:58.539 --> 00:53:04.390
&gt;&gt;Julie Wiskirchen: Any other questions?

00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:05.559
[pause]

00:53:05.559 --> 00:53:11.859
&gt;&gt;male #4: You talked about some of the issues
that were keeping them away from shelters.

00:53:11.859 --> 00:53:16.990
When you were speaking to people who were
involved in shelters, did you get the sense

00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:22.240
that they all understood that and it was simply
an issue of funding of administrating or that

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:30.030
that was, that they didn't fully understand
the sort of issues that were, what they were

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:34.690
doing maybe that was driving people away or
what they would need to do to be, bring more

00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:35.690
people in?

00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:41.960
&gt;&gt;Frances Noble: I think that most people
that were involved in administering the shelters

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:46.720
or the programs understood. I also think at
this particular time when we were doing the

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:54.160
book they were inundated and you can't, and
so it was a scramble, "Can we get this bed

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:56.809
for so and so. Somebody is calling and saying
they have two people."

00:53:56.809 --> 00:54:04.349
I think that it's probably quieter now. I
know that there's been relocation of some

00:54:04.349 --> 00:54:11.059
of the programs and they seem to be much more
orderly on the outside which I'm going to

00:54:11.059 --> 00:54:16.089
suggest or hope to suggest that it's more
orderly on the inside. The people at Daybreak

00:54:16.089 --> 00:54:21.640
of course always understood what was going
on and how to provide a safe environment for

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:22.640
the women.

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:28.490
And I really believe in equality of the sexes
and I can also say I think that women do need

00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:33.950
more protection. On the streets they're subject
to -- I mean the statistics are horrifying

00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:40.839
 -- to far greater numbers of assaults and
rapes and robberies. And many women told us

00:54:40.839 --> 00:54:44.839
about their terrible experiences being on
the street.

00:54:44.839 --> 00:54:48.119
So I do think that most people are aware.

00:54:48.119 --> 00:55:03.980
&gt;&gt;male #5: Is there something particular about
Santa Monica that there's been such a concentration

00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:04.980
of homeless people versus like Pasadena or
Beverly Hills or other affluent communities?

00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:07.380
&gt;&gt;Frances Noble: Oh sure. Santa Monica what
is it, the People's Republic of Santa Monica,

00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:12.690
the non-nuclear proliferation zone, wearing
its heart on its sleeve at all times. That

00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:17.619
is not Beverly Hills. Pasadena actually does
have a significant homeless population, but

00:55:17.619 --> 00:55:18.641
nothing like Santa Monica.

00:55:18.641 --> 00:55:26.539
Also by the ocean, a straight shot down the
freeway, and it's the personality of the city.

00:55:26.539 --> 00:55:32.529
It wants to be a progressive, liberal, generous
city. That's, as I know you all know when

00:55:32.529 --> 00:55:37.569
you read the newspapers, the arguments that
go on in the City Council meetings and so

00:55:37.569 --> 00:55:40.160
forth. That's how they portray themselves.

00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:46.700
Beverly Hills, I think, just doesn't allow
it and that's my understanding. I'm sure exactly

00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:50.599
how they do that, but [laughs] if you had
a choice of going to Beverly Hills or here,

00:55:50.599 --> 00:55:53.191
you'd come here if you're any kind of a knowledgeable
homeless person.

00:55:53.191 --> 00:56:11.020
&gt;&gt;male 6: I heard actually at – I was talking
to a homeless person one night -- we were

00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:13.940
at [ ] saying that something about Santa Monica
being much safer than somewhere like downtown

00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:14.940
LA --

00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:15.940
&gt;&gt;Frances Noble: Oh.

00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:16.940
&gt;&gt;male #6: and I think probably there is such
a tolerance [ ] why [ ]

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:17.940
&gt;&gt;Frances Noble: Of course.

00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:18.940
&gt;&gt;male #6: [unintelligible]

00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:20.690
&gt;&gt;Frances Nobel: But downtown L.A. is its
own horrid world. It's terrible. It's very

00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:27.140
dangerous. It's, skid row down there is truly
a terrible, terrible place. That is not the

00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:33.819
case here. It is much safer here and there's
no doubt.

00:56:33.819 --> 00:56:35.279
[pause]

00:56:35.279 --> 00:56:39.670
[talking in background]

00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:46.609
&gt;&gt;male #7: It looks like the problem's not
ever gonna be solved, so from our point of

00:56:46.609 --> 00:56:54.180
view; us versus them. So it looks like there's
a way of living together and learning from

00:56:54.180 --> 00:57:01.170
each other and I just wonder what you, what
kind of generosity and kindness and openness

00:57:01.170 --> 00:57:06.650
and great things might have arisen from what
looks like something really difficult so it's

00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:14.470
something that is more attractive for the
more established side of that us/them divide

00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:17.109
to wanna engage with?

00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:24.410
How can we either enjoy it or make it more
attractive to people who don't even look at

00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:25.869
it like you were saying at the beginning?

00:57:25.869 --> 00:57:34.329
&gt;&gt;Frances Noble: Well I guess education is
part of it, isn't it? And learning more about

00:57:34.329 --> 00:57:39.660
people so that they're not other; they're
not perceived as beneath us. Anytime we don't

00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:44.240
perceive the other person as individual human,
it's very easy to be cruel, unkind, to be

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:53.640
oppressive as we see around the world every
day. Education, of course, is one way.

00:57:53.640 --> 00:58:01.109
I guess how do we learn more about homeless
people? I guess volunteer at some of these

00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:10.500
organizations that offer care to people. That
can be very rewarding. And on a more specific

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:14.400
basis or in a more specific way, I guess as
people say, "Well should we give them money?

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:23.109
Do you give them money?" And I said, "Of course,
always." If there were a place for everybody

00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:27.410
and people just refused to go, I probably
wouldn't. But I know there isn't. I know there

00:58:27.410 --> 00:58:31.890
are not enough places to live. And as one
man said, "Anything that makes the sidewalk

00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:35.109
softer." That is a very touching phrase to
me.

00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:44.180
So, and saying hello, although I do not -- it
feels natural to me now because I know some

00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:49.890
of them and because I worked on this project
for so long, I'm not uncomfortable approaching

00:58:49.890 --> 00:58:53.930
somebody and saying, "Can I give you a couple
of dollars?" Or, "How you doing?" whatever.

00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:59.999
But it didn't feel natural at all in the beginning.
So I'm saying, so I say, "Hello," but maybe

00:58:59.999 --> 00:59:03.790
you all shouldn't say, "Hello" or you're not
ready to say, "Hello." You know what I'm tryin'

00:59:03.790 --> 00:59:09.700
to say? I don't want this forced companionship,
but there are various ways compatible with

00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:14.150
our various personalities and our levels of
experience, information.

00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:15.150
[pause]

00:59:15.150 --> 00:59:18.470
&gt;&gt;Julie Wiskirchen: Okay. Thanks very much,
Frances.

00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:19.470
&gt;&gt;Frances Noble: Oh, my pleasure.

00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:20.470
&gt;&gt;Julie Wiskirchen: Thanks everybody for coming.

00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:20.529
[applause]
