00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.756
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Even numbers are divisible by 2. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, I know I need to include any numbers

00:00:04.756 --> 00:00:09.256
between 1 and 9 that can be divided by 2. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, I have 2, 4, 6, and 8. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; To

00:00:09.256 --> 00:00:14.062
find the set of even numbers between 1 and 9, we just list them off, 2, 4, 6, 8.

00:00:14.062 --> 00:00:19.181
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We use curly braces on both ends and commas between the elements. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Nice

00:00:19.181 --> 00:00:19.500
work.
