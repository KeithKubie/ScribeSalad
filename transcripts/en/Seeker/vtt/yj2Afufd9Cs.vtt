00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.640
The survey results are in, and guess what
- we're all a bunch of hateful idiots!

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:16.840
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - with some
eye-opening survey results that show just

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.930
how entrenched anti-Semitism is in places
all around the globe.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.840
An organization called the Anti-Defamation
League commissioned a worldwide survey recently,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:32.660
polling over 53,000 adults across 102 countries,
in order to gauge attitudes about Jewish people.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.540
And if it wasn't obvious already - the results...
are not great.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.550
According to the poll, 1 in 4 adults worldwide
are "deeply infected with anti-Semitic attitudes";

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.219
almost half have never heard of the Holocaust,
and a third of the people who have heard of

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.250
it - believe it's either a myth, or has been
extremely exaggerated.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.379
The survey featured a set of 11 traditional
anti-Semitic statements - like "Jews are responsible

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.910
for most of the world's wars" or "Jews think
they're better than other people" - and then

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.309
had people answer whether they thought those
statements were "probably true" or "probably

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.309
false."

00:01:06.309 --> 00:01:12.140
Of all the adults polled, a whopping 26% believed
at least 6 of the 11 stereotypes to be true

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.790
- which equates to almost 1.1 billion people
worldwide.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.790
And of that 26%, nearly three quarters of
them admitted to never having met a Jewish

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.910
person.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.990
Regions with the most anti-Semitic attitudes,
were the Middle East and North Africa - where

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.759
74% of adults agreed with the majority of
the anti-Semitic remarks.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.020
The absolute highest levels - reaching 93%
- were found in Palestinian territories and

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.020
Iraq.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.730
Yet only 8% of adults in those regions had
even heard of the Holocaust.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.470
The most popular stereotype was that Jews
are more loyal to Israel than to the countries

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.509
in which they live.

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.509
It's not all bad, though - there do appear
to be regions of the world where anti-Semitism

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:53.890
is virtually nonexistent.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.110
In Laos, for example - only 0.2% of the population
hates Jews.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.290
And The Philippines, Sweden, and the Netherlands
- were also extremely tolerant.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.429
In the United States, 9% of respondents were
considered anti-Semitic.

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.650
The survey also shows that the majority of
people have no clue how many Jews there actually

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.890
are in the world.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.980
Currently, they make up .19% of the global
population - but three-quarters of the adults

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.480
polled assumed they comprised at least 1%
- and almost a tenth thought that Jews accounted

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.150
for more than 20% of the world's population.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.550
Also interesting - is that people who overestimated
the Jewish population, were also more likely

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.709
to harbor anti-Semitic views.

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.690
If you wanna see a more complete breakdown
of the survey results, we have a link in the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.900
description of this episode - and it's pretty
enlightening, so I recommend checking that

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.900
out.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.300
As always if you have questions, comments,
anything NON-HATEFUL you wanna say about this

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.180
survey, then leave your thoughts in the comments
below.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.659
Otherwise, thank you for watching!
