ian ni-lewis and we're going to be
 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.700
ian ni-lewis and we're going to be
taking a look at the technology behind a

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710
taking a look at the technology behind a
 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.030
taking a look at the technology behind a

task launcher and profile widget so

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710
task launcher and profile widget so
 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.050
task launcher and profile widget so
we'll stick around to find out what

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060
we'll stick around to find out what
 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.550
we'll stick around to find out what
features and technical tips and tricks

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560
features and technical tips and tricks
 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.160
features and technical tips and tricks
it takes to make a device profile app

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170
it takes to make a device profile app
 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:31.339
it takes to make a device profile app
today on the App clinic so so we're

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349
today on the App clinic so so we're
 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.080
today on the App clinic so so we're
going to take a look at that these three

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090
going to take a look at that these three
 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.790
going to take a look at that these three
apps today and they're all fairly

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800
apps today and they're all fairly
 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.410
apps today and they're all fairly
similar in what they're trying to do

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420
similar in what they're trying to do
 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.729
similar in what they're trying to do
which is excellent because it makes it

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739
which is excellent because it makes it
 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.260
which is excellent because it makes it
much easier for us to talk about the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270
much easier for us to talk about the
 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.479
much easier for us to talk about the
technology that really makes them great

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489
technology that really makes them great
 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.850
technology that really makes them great
it's also great because we really relate

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860
it's also great because we really relate
 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.580
it's also great because we really relate
to these apps I think that these apps

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590
to these apps I think that these apps
 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.680
to these apps I think that these apps
although they have an appeal to everyone

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690
although they have an appeal to everyone
 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.200
although they have an appeal to everyone
I think everyone would like the

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210
I think everyone would like the
 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.180
I think everyone would like the
functionality that these apps provide

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190
functionality that these apps provide
 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.100
functionality that these apps provide
but it turns out that the people that

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110
but it turns out that the people that
 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.380
but it turns out that the people that
actually use them or mostly hackers and

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390
actually use them or mostly hackers and
 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.270
actually use them or mostly hackers and
software engineers it's true and that's

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280
software engineers it's true and that's
 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.529
software engineers it's true and that's
actually something which we're going to

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539
actually something which we're going to
 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.119
actually something which we're going to
see as we go through each of these apps

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129
see as we go through each of these apps
 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.070
see as we go through each of these apps
we can almost see who the target

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080
we can almost see who the target
 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.600
we can almost see who the target
audience ends up being and so I think

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610
audience ends up being and so I think
 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.880
audience ends up being and so I think
much like the evolution of most

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890
much like the evolution of most
 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.620
much like the evolution of most
technologies and mobile phones most

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630
technologies and mobile phones most
 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.149
technologies and mobile phones most
recently you sort of start off with

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159
recently you sort of start off with
 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.789
recently you sort of start off with
something that appeals to a kind of a

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799
something that appeals to a kind of a
 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.620
something that appeals to a kind of a
geek crowd and then if you create

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630
geek crowd and then if you create
 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.390
geek crowd and then if you create
something which just anyone can use to

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400
something which just anyone can use to
 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.679
something which just anyone can use to
make their life easier it's going to

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689
make their life easier it's going to
 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.240
make their life easier it's going to
become massively popular so we're going

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250
become massively popular so we're going
 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.710
become massively popular so we're going
to look at how these apps are

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720
to look at how these apps are
 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.359
to look at how these apps are
approaching those problems and how we

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369
approaching those problems and how we
 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.490
approaching those problems and how we
think they can do a good job of taking

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500
think they can do a good job of taking
 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.380
think they can do a good job of taking
that one step further so we're going to

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390
that one step further so we're going to
 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.580
that one step further so we're going to
start off by looking at the standard

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590
start off by looking at the standard
 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.370
start off by looking at the standard
feature so these are the things that all

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380
feature so these are the things that all
 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.990
feature so these are the things that all
of these apps can do so this is

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000
of these apps can do so this is
 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.300
of these apps can do so this is
basically the the key core functionality

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310
basically the the key core functionality
 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.310
basically the the key core functionality
that we would consider that you need in

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320
that we would consider that you need in
 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.160
that we would consider that you need in
order to make a device profile switching

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170
order to make a device profile switching
 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.960
order to make a device profile switching
app yeah let's talk about what a device

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970
app yeah let's talk about what a device
 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.149
app yeah let's talk about what a device
profile swimming or fishing app it's an

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159
profile swimming or fishing app it's an
 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.510
profile swimming or fishing app it's an
idol it is definitely that well it's

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520
idol it is definitely that well it's
 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.789
idol it is definitely that well it's
just because I call them task apps ok

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799
just because I call them task apps ok
 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.410
just because I call them task apps ok
let's go um toss you know what I don't

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420
let's go um toss you know what I don't
 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.700
let's go um toss you know what I don't
call them anything they trick the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710
call them anything they trick the
 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.050
call them anything they trick the
problem you call them 10 may be there

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060
problem you call them 10 may be there
 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.660
problem you call them 10 may be there
auto apps I don't yeah the thing about

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670
auto apps I don't yeah the thing about
 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.490
auto apps I don't yeah the thing about
device profile is I think the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500
device profile is I think the
 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.679
device profile is I think the
terminology comes from the idea of

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689
terminology comes from the idea of
 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.850
terminology comes from the idea of
having your device in a completely

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860
having your device in a completely
 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.520
having your device in a completely
different state for certain things and

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530
different state for certain things and
 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.429
different state for certain things and
we certainly introduced that concept

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439
we certainly introduced that concept
 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.469
we certainly introduced that concept
when we started looking into docs and

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479
when we started looking into docs and
 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.420
when we started looking into docs and
the ideas you'd have one profile when

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430
the ideas you'd have one profile when
 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.180
the ideas you'd have one profile when
you're undocked versus another profile

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190
you're undocked versus another profile
 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.340
you're undocked versus another profile
while you're docked but these ads that

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350
while you're docked but these ads that
 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.140
while you're docked but these ads that
we're looking at today go far beyond

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150
we're looking at today go far beyond
 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.750
we're looking at today go far beyond
that and I think it's it's almost hard

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760
that and I think it's it's almost hard
 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.000
that and I think it's it's almost hard
to talk about a specific profile because

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010
to talk about a specific profile because
 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.430
to talk about a specific profile because
there are multiple overlapping things

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440
there are multiple overlapping things
 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.830
there are multiple overlapping things
that each app can do absolutely but the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840
that each app can do absolutely but the
 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.010
that each app can do absolutely but the
core of it is we're going to change

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020
core of it is we're going to change
 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.050
core of it is we're going to change
something in the system or possibly just

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060
something in the system or possibly just
 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.640
something in the system or possibly just
do something in the system and you

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650
do something in the system and you
 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.430
do something in the system and you
execute an action when the conditions of

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440
execute an action when the conditions of
 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.380
execute an action when the conditions of
the system change exactly and so the

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390
the system change exactly and so the
 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.910
the system change exactly and so the
idea here is that rather than having

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920
idea here is that rather than having
 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.040
idea here is that rather than having
sort of a single toggle you're able to

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050
sort of a single toggle you're able to
 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.920
sort of a single toggle you're able to
say I'm at home I'm at work I am

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930
say I'm at home I'm at work I am
 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.580
say I'm at home I'm at work I am
entering a meeting whatever your profile

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590
entering a meeting whatever your profile
 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.680
entering a meeting whatever your profile
case is and execute a whole bunch of

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690
case is and execute a whole bunch of
 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.270
case is and execute a whole bunch of
different settings changes or launch a

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280
different settings changes or launch a
 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.610
different settings changes or launch a
bunch of apps as as Ian says basically

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620
bunch of apps as as Ian says basically
 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.590
bunch of apps as as Ian says basically
perform a series of actions in relation

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600
perform a series of actions in relation
 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.710
perform a series of actions in relation
to that change in environment so they

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720
to that change in environment so they
 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.450
to that change in environment so they
can all change the volume and ringtones

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460
can all change the volume and ringtones
 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.830
can all change the volume and ringtones
they can all change brightness they can

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840
they can all change brightness they can
 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.810
they can all change brightness they can
all modify your connectivity settings as

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820
all modify your connectivity settings as
 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.360
all modify your connectivity settings as
well some of the apps i think task in

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370
well some of the apps i think task in
 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.730
well some of the apps i think task in
particular go significantly further than

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740
particular go significantly further than
 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.110
particular go significantly further than
that but these are sort of the core

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120
that but these are sort of the core
 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.390
that but these are sort of the core
things that i think anyone downloading

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400
things that i think anyone downloading
 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.920
things that i think anyone downloading
one of these apps is going to want to be

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930
one of these apps is going to want to be
 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.530
one of these apps is going to want to be
able to do mute the volume change your

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540
able to do mute the volume change your
 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.090
able to do mute the volume change your
ringtone alter the screen brightness

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100
ringtone alter the screen brightness
 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.180

some several of the apps that we looked

some several of the apps that we looked
at have this functionality but only in

at have this functionality but only in
 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:15.679
at have this functionality but only in
the pro version mmm so that's something

00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:15.689
the pro version mmm so that's something
 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:18.740

thing that you need I think you
 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:21.769
thing that you need I think you
mentioned is these things are really

00:06:21.769 --> 00:06:21.779
mentioned is these things are really
 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:24.019
mentioned is these things are really
difficult to set up yes they and that's

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:24.029
difficult to set up yes they and that's
 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:26.600
difficult to set up yes they and that's
I think the cool thing here is that it's

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:43.570
not receiving calls I think the
 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.270
not receiving calls I think the
challenge has always been presenting

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280
challenge has always been presenting
 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.710
challenge has always been presenting
this in a way that just regular people

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720
this in a way that just regular people
 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.950
this in a way that just regular people
can use at the moment and we'll see it

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960
can use at the moment and we'll see it
 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.500
can use at the moment and we'll see it
varies for each of these apps but at the

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:52.510
varies for each of these apps but at the
 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.420
varies for each of these apps but at the
moment you've got that tendency to feel

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.430
moment you've got that tendency to feel
 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.860
moment you've got that tendency to feel
like you're having to program the phone

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870
like you're having to program the phone
 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.180
like you're having to program the phone
alright and that's what you want to get

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.190
alright and that's what you want to get
 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.770
alright and that's what you want to get
away from so when we say easy to use

00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:58.780
away from so when we say easy to use
 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.159
away from so when we say easy to use
what we mean is easy to configure

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:01.169
what we mean is easy to configure
 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:03.510
what we mean is easy to configure
especially the actual use case I think

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520
especially the actual use case I think
 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.950
especially the actual use case I think
for all three is pretty straightforward

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960
for all three is pretty straightforward
 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.350
for all three is pretty straightforward
but the configuration is is the trick

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360
but the configuration is is the trick
 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.640
but the configuration is is the trick
and so we really want to make it as easy

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:08.650
and so we really want to make it as easy
 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.159
and so we really want to make it as easy
as possible and that kind of relates to

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:11.169
as possible and that kind of relates to
 

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:13.379
as possible and that kind of relates to
the to the last point yeah there's

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:13.389
the to the last point yeah there's
 

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:15.779
the to the last point yeah there's
really two ways that you can make this

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:15.789
really two ways that you can make this
 

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:17.460
really two ways that you can make this
easy to use you can egg you can either

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:17.470
easy to use you can egg you can either
 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:21.450
easy to use you can egg you can either
make it very easy to program I which if

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:21.460
make it very easy to program I which if
 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.300
make it very easy to program I which if
you figure out how to do that um let me

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:24.310
you figure out how to do that um let me
 

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.430
you figure out how to do that um let me
know yeah that could be because yeah

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:26.440
know yeah that could be because yeah
 

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.230
know yeah that could be because yeah
there's there's a ton of money this is a

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240
there's there's a ton of money this is a
 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.150
there's there's a ton of money this is a
you know I used to program games and one

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160
you know I used to program games and one
 

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.490
you know I used to program games and one
of the things that we would always say

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:32.500
of the things that we would always say
 

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.939
of the things that we would always say
is boy I don't want a program all this

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:35.949
is boy I don't want a program all this
 

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:37.409
is boy I don't want a program all this
gameplay it seems like the designers

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:37.419
gameplay it seems like the designers
 

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:39.409
gameplay it seems like the designers
should be able to do that and so

00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:39.419
should be able to do that and so
 

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:41.820
should be able to do that and so
multiple projects this happened to me I

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:41.830
multiple projects this happened to me I
 

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.080
multiple projects this happened to me I
wasn't always the one calling the shots

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:43.090
wasn't always the one calling the shots
 

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.260
wasn't always the one calling the shots
but you make a scripting language and

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:46.270
but you make a scripting language and
 

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.089
but you make a scripting language and
give it to the designers and they're

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:48.099
give it to the designers and they're
 

00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:50.670
give it to the designers and they're
like oh thanks and then they come to you

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:50.680
like oh thanks and then they come to you
 

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.400
like oh thanks and then they come to you
and say hey can you write this script

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:52.410
and say hey can you write this script
 

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:56.190
and say hey can you write this script
and you realize wow i just spent a huge

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:56.200
and you realize wow i just spent a huge
 

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.900
and you realize wow i just spent a huge
amount of time making this scriptable

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:57.910
amount of time making this scriptable
 

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.640
amount of time making this scriptable
and i'm going to have to write all the

00:07:59.640 --> 00:07:59.650
and i'm going to have to write all the
 

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.129
and i'm going to have to write all the
code descriptive and that's the feeling

00:08:02.129 --> 00:08:02.139
code descriptive and that's the feeling
 

00:08:02.139 --> 00:08:03.810
code descriptive and that's the feeling
that I get with these apps is you know

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:03.820
that I get with these apps is you know
 

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.159
that I get with these apps is you know
for a software engineer or someone who's

00:08:05.159 --> 00:08:05.169
for a software engineer or someone who's
 

00:08:05.169 --> 00:08:07.800
for a software engineer or someone who's
used to thinking in terms of code these

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:07.810
used to thinking in terms of code these
 

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.450
used to thinking in terms of code these
are very easy to use I mean some of them

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:09.460
are very easy to use I mean some of them
 

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.830
are very easy to use I mean some of them
are more cumbersome than others

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:10.840
are more cumbersome than others
 

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.360
are more cumbersome than others
navigation wise some of them are

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:12.370
navigation wise some of them are
 

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.159
navigation wise some of them are
prettier than others but the concepts

00:08:14.159 --> 00:08:14.169
prettier than others but the concepts
 

00:08:14.169 --> 00:08:16.230
prettier than others but the concepts
are easy at the same time for most

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.240
are easy at the same time for most
 

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.279
are easy at the same time for most
people I think it's going to be like

00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:17.289
people I think it's going to be like
 

00:08:17.289 --> 00:08:20.010
people I think it's going to be like
programming a VCR which is you know you

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:20.020
programming a VCR which is you know you
 

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.050
programming a VCR which is you know you
you want to do it you know what you want

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:22.060
you want to do it you know what you want
 

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.930
you want to do it you know what you want
but you're never gonna do it if you

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:24.940
but you're never gonna do it if you
 

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.879
but you're never gonna do it if you
never gonna figure that out right it'll

00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:26.889
never gonna figure that out right it'll
 

00:08:26.889 --> 00:08:28.230
never gonna figure that out right it'll
be one person in the house who figures

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240
be one person in the house who figures
 

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.750
be one person in the house who figures
it out and that's it exactly can you set

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:30.760
it out and that's it exactly can you set
 

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.760
it out and that's it exactly can you set
up no one person in the extended family

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:32.770
up no one person in the extended family
 

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.079
up no one person in the extended family
and you don't want to be that guy I

00:08:34.079 --> 00:08:34.089
and you don't want to be that guy I
 

00:08:34.089 --> 00:08:36.690
and you don't want to be that guy I
don't want to be that guy so let's take

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:36.700
don't want to be that guy so let's take
 

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.250
don't want to be that guy so let's take
a tip from the VCR well you remember

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:38.260
a tip from the VCR well you remember
 

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.430
a tip from the VCR well you remember
that this was very very difficult until

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440
that this was very very difficult until
 

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.170
that this was very very difficult until
things like TiVo came along and what

00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:43.180
things like TiVo came along and what
 

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.090
things like TiVo came along and what
they were doing was leveraging the

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:45.100
they were doing was leveraging the
 

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.110
they were doing was leveraging the
information that was on the internet

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.120
information that was on the internet
 

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.630
information that was on the internet
community um to help you know instead of

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:49.640
community um to help you know instead of
 

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.480
community um to help you know instead of
saying I want to program this amount of

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:52.490
saying I want to program this amount of
 

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:53.980
saying I want to program this amount of
time you could say yeah I want to watch

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:53.990
time you could say yeah I want to watch
 

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.990
time you could say yeah I want to watch
this show yeah which is always what you

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000
this show yeah which is always what you
 

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.370
this show yeah which is always what you
want to do right no one just randomly

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:57.380
want to do right no one just randomly
 

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.630
want to do right no one just randomly
wants to record half an hour of

00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:58.640
wants to record half an hour of
 

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.250
wants to record half an hour of
television sometime on Friday night

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:00.260
television sometime on Friday night
 

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
television sometime on Friday night
there is a theme there is something on

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:02.270
there is a theme there is something on
 

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.910
there is a theme there is something on
that they want to record usually yeah

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920
that they want to record usually yeah
 

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.720
that they want to record usually yeah
generally so it turns out the best way

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:07.730
generally so it turns out the best way
 

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.820
generally so it turns out the best way
to solve this is to have a community

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:09.830
to solve this is to have a community
 

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:11.590
to solve this is to have a community
repository so I can go to the Internet

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600
repository so I can go to the Internet
 

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.720
repository so I can go to the Internet
and say oh yeah someone else had a

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:13.730
and say oh yeah someone else had a
 

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.820
and say oh yeah someone else had a
problem where they don't want to receive

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:15.830
problem where they don't want to receive
 

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:19.180
problem where they don't want to receive
alarm notifications between 10pm and 6am

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:19.190
alarm notifications between 10pm and 6am
 

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.990
alarm notifications between 10pm and 6am
and yet they still want their their

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:23.000
and yet they still want their their
 

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.430
and yet they still want their their
clock to be able to send them an alarm

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:24.440
clock to be able to send them an alarm
 

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.730
clock to be able to send them an alarm
and I pull down that code and install it

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:27.740
and I pull down that code and install it
 

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.340
and I pull down that code and install it
into the task application that I'm using

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:30.350
into the task application that I'm using
 

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.740
into the task application that I'm using
and boom I got what I wanted and I

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:32.750
and boom I got what I wanted and I
 

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.240
and boom I got what I wanted and I
didn't have to learn how to program the

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:34.250
didn't have to learn how to program the
 

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:39.160
didn't have to learn how to program the
thing so the ease of use is important

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:39.170
thing so the ease of use is important
 

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:42.880
thing so the ease of use is important
but you can get away with less ease of

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:42.890
but you can get away with less ease of
 

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.130
but you can get away with less ease of
use if you have a better repository of

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:45.140
use if you have a better repository of
 

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.500
use if you have a better repository of
community scripts the people can very

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:47.510
community scripts the people can very
 

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:49.900
community scripts the people can very
easily browse and install exactly this

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:49.910
easily browse and install exactly this
 

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:51.880
easily browse and install exactly this
gets to one of the points which we tend

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:51.890
gets to one of the points which we tend
 

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:53.050
gets to one of the points which we tend
to make again and again it's one of

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:53.060
to make again and again it's one of
 

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.210
to make again and again it's one of
these recurring themes is you want to

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:55.220
these recurring themes is you want to
 

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.860
these recurring themes is you want to
make it really easy for people to see

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:56.870

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:25.240
cool cut that up as oh yeah I wanted to
 

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.200
cool cut that up as oh yeah I wanted to

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:28.210
point out a modal dialog please don't do
 

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.270
point out a modal dialog please don't do

modal dialog popping up over an empty
 

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.230
modal dialog popping up over an empty
screen so I mean this there is nothing

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240
screen so I mean this there is nothing
 

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.940

here so if you want to display some

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:35.950
here so if you want to display some
 

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:37.800
here so if you want to display some
information that's the place to put it

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:37.810
information that's the place to put it
 

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:39.450

not on a proper well and that's that's

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:39.460
not on a proper well and that's that's
 

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.340
not on a proper well and that's that's
really the issue that we're going to see

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:41.350
really the issue that we're going to see
 

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:43.470
really the issue that we're going to see
over and over again is that this is a

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:43.480
over and over again is that this is a
 

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.560
over and over again is that this is a
very modal dialog based application and

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:45.570
very modal dialog based application and
 

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.480
very modal dialog based application and
I think part of it you know especially

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:48.490
I think part of it you know especially
 

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:49.920
I think part of it you know especially
when you look at the buttons I think you

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:49.930
when you look at the buttons I think you
 

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:51.060
when you look at the buttons I think you
can see that this was definitely

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:51.070
can see that this was definitely
 

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.640
can see that this was definitely
designed in the you know the Clare era

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:53.650
designed in the you know the Clare era
 

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:57.870
designed in the you know the Clare era
and that used to be I think a better way

00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:57.880
and that used to be I think a better way
 

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.190
and that used to be I think a better way
of doing things than it is now I think

00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200
of doing things than it is now I think
 

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.560
of doing things than it is now I think
we have much better design language now

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:01.570
we have much better design language now
 

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.590
we have much better design language now
than we did one was at that time it was

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:04.600

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.180
than we did one was at that time it was
quite ambiguous you know it's really up

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:06.190

to you and if you wanted your apt to
 

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.540
to you and if you wanted your apt to
look good you really needed to do it all

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:09.550
look good you really needed to do it all
 

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:10.800
look good you really needed to do it all
yourself and I can say that they've put

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:10.810

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:12.420

uses modal dialogues automate it uses
drop downs and it uses what do we

obvious place for instance is when you
 

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:36.299
obvious place for instance is when you
choose a location on automated then it

00:19:36.299 --> 00:19:36.309
choose a location on automated then it
 

00:19:36.309 --> 00:19:38.990
choose a location on automated then it

turns on the alarm etc etc so it's
 

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.720
turns on the alarm etc etc so it's
really automating a lot of the stuff

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:17.730
really automating a lot of the stuff

you've set it up once you never really

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:20.730
you've set it up once you never really
 

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:22.160
you've set it up once you never really
need to think about it it's genius and

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:22.170
need to think about it it's genius and
 

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:23.630
need to think about it it's genius and
actually I tried to do this very same

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:23.640
actually I tried to do this very same
 

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.570
actually I tried to do this very same
thing I ran into a few problems I

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:25.580
thing I ran into a few problems I
 

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:27.500
thing I ran into a few problems I
realized that actually this app works a

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:27.510
realized that actually this app works a
 

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:29.150
realized that actually this app works a
lot better if you're consistently sober

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:29.160
lot better if you're consistently sober
 

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.280
lot better if you're consistently sober
so that was an issue there's an issue

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:31.290
so that was an issue there's an issue
 

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:34.520
so that was an issue there's an issue
right there is that but also the one

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:34.530
right there is that but also the one
 

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:36.140
right there is that but also the one
thing I noticed and this really isn't a

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:36.150
thing I noticed and this really isn't a
 

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:39.050
thing I noticed and this really isn't a
an issue with this app per se it's more

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:39.060
an issue with this app per se it's more
 

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:40.190
an issue with this app per se it's more
the operating system in general I would

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:40.200
the operating system in general I would
 

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:43.130
the operating system in general I would
love to see us at this is the app needs

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:43.140
love to see us at this is the app needs
 

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.930
love to see us at this is the app needs
to be installed so for instance I

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:44.940
to be installed so for instance I
 

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.210
to be installed so for instance I
thought oh I'll put a Wi-Fi sticker for

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:47.220
thought oh I'll put a Wi-Fi sticker for
 

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:48.770
thought oh I'll put a Wi-Fi sticker for
my guest network next to the door that

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:48.780
my guest network next to the door that
 

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:50.170
my guest network next to the door that
was one of the things the app suggested

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:50.180
was one of the things the app suggested
 

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:52.460
was one of the things the app suggested
then I went to the sticker and it turns

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:52.470
then I went to the sticker and it turns
 

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:54.500
then I went to the sticker and it turns
out first thing it needs to do is

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:54.510
out first thing it needs to do is
 

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:55.940
out first thing it needs to do is
download the app because there's no

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:55.950
download the app because there's no
 

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:59.660

00:28:59.660 --> 00:28:59.670
general set up a Wi-Fi NFC intent she's
 

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:01.430
general set up a Wi-Fi NFC intent she's
a shame which in a way is a shame

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440
a shame which in a way is a shame
 

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.050
a shame which in a way is a shame
because it would be really useful but it

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:03.060
because it would be really useful but it
 

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.060
because it would be really useful but it
would also make this Apple s useful so

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:05.070
would also make this Apple s useful so
 

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:06.440

will want to stick like a barcode on to

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:08.520
will want to stick like a barcode on to
 

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.640
will want to stick like a barcode on to
the NFC tag so you can scan the barcode

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:10.650
the NFC tag so you can scan the barcode
 

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:11.930
the NFC tag so you can scan the barcode
which will install the app which will

00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:11.940
which will install the app which will
 

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:14.030
which will install the app which will
then let you use the tag but that well

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:14.040
then let you use the tag but that well
 

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.430
then let you use the tag but that well
no no it does actually install the app

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440
no no it does actually install the app
 

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.250
no no it does actually install the app
but the problem for me was well if I'm

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:19.260
but the problem for me was well if I'm
 

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:21.350
but the problem for me was well if I'm
bringing somebody over to use my guest

makes it a little bit easier
 

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:57.909
makes it a little bit easier
particularly if you have a lot of these

you're not actually going to be using
the UI that much because it's one of

the UI that much because it's one of

forever type scenarios so if we go

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440
forever type scenarios so if we go
 

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.140
forever type scenarios so if we go
through will create a tag based on

something else so create a Wi-Fi network

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:12.950
something else so create a Wi-Fi network
 

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:14.980
something else so create a Wi-Fi network
that's probably a bad example because we

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:14.990
that's probably a bad example because we
 

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:17.669
that's probably a bad example because we
need to actually have a Wi-Fi network

00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679
need to actually have a Wi-Fi network
 

00:32:17.679 --> 00:32:20.200

that makes sense and when you get to

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:23.900
that makes sense and when you get to
 

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:27.250
that makes sense and when you get to
this to this point you can almost get a

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:27.260
this to this point you can almost get a
 

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.330
this to this point you can almost get a
little bit confusing so we're going to

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:28.340
little bit confusing so we're going to
 

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:29.590
little bit confusing so we're going to
say save and write so I like that

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600

they've got the confirmation up the top
here that that's great and at this point

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:33.770
here that that's great and at this point
 

00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:35.529
here that that's great and at this point
it gets a little bit confusing so this

00:32:35.529 --> 00:32:35.539
it gets a little bit confusing so this
 

00:32:35.539 --> 00:32:36.880
it gets a little bit confusing so this
is the point where you would put you

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:36.890
is the point where you would put you
 

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:40.050
is the point where you would put you

but then to finish you kind of have

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:47.330
but then to finish you kind of have
 

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:48.970
but then to finish you kind of have
these two options on the one hand at the

these two options on the one hand at the

these two options on the one hand at the
top left it says finish and on the top

top left it says finish and on the top
 

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:54.430
top left it says finish and on the top
right it says done if you keep finish it

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:54.440
right it says done if you keep finish it

clicking so you do have to write down
 

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.940
clicking so you do have to write down
but I just found that a little bit

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:00.950
but I just found that a little bit
 

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:02.980
but I just found that a little bit
confusing you almost don't want to

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:02.990
confusing you almost don't want to

that's kind of important in it so okay

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:19.910
that's kind of important in it so okay

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:51.500
alternative way you basically have a
 

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.310
alternative way you basically have a
save and a cancel right up the top here

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320
save and a cancel right up the top here
 

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.840
save and a cancel right up the top here
so those are the two things that you can

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:55.850
so those are the two things that you can
 

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:57.550
so those are the two things that you can
do and it emits type of them yeah

00:33:57.550 --> 00:33:57.560
do and it emits type of them yeah
 

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.380
do and it emits type of them yeah
exactly like a commute or cancel at any

00:33:59.380 --> 00:33:59.390
exactly like a commute or cancel at any
 

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:02.410
exactly like a commute or cancel at any
point and in general if you're going to

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:02.420
point and in general if you're going to
 

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:04.750
point and in general if you're going to
do a use a wizard the very best way to

do a use a wizard the very best way to
 

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.910
do a use a wizard the very best way to
do it that the users like is just use a

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:06.920
do it that the users like is just use a
 

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.120
do it that the users like is just use a
few pagers so you know because it is

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:10.130
few pagers so you know because it is
 

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:14.740
few pagers so you know because it is
weird to have a verb in your action i'll

00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:14.750
weird to have a verb in your action i'll
 

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:17.530

buy ya annual at a bar so but having
that as as a particular tab on a wizard

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:20.149
that as as a particular tab on a wizard
 

00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:22.030
that as as a particular tab on a wizard
especially a wizard that you can swipe

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:22.040
especially a wizard that you can swipe
 

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.690
especially a wizard that you can swipe
through which is becoming a far more

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:24.700
through which is becoming a far more
 

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:28.419
through which is becoming a far more
interesting and understood action than a

00:34:28.419 --> 00:34:28.429
interesting and understood action than a
 

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:30.070

back button honestly I mean you'd think

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:30.080
back button honestly I mean you'd think
 

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.510
back button honestly I mean you'd think
a back button is the easiest thing in

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520
a back button is the easiest thing in
 

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.159
a back button is the easiest thing in
the world yeah but I've seen people with

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:33.169
the world yeah but I've seen people with
 

00:34:33.169 --> 00:34:35.080
the world yeah but I've seen people with
the back button right there trying to

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:35.090
the back button right there trying to
 

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:36.880
the back button right there trying to
swipe yeah because as soon as you start

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:36.890
swipe yeah because as soon as you start
 

00:34:36.890 --> 00:34:39.190
swipe yeah because as soon as you start
thinking in a horizontal flow you want

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200
thinking in a horizontal flow you want
 

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.050
thinking in a horizontal flow you want
to be able to swipe a viewpager style

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:41.060
to be able to swipe a viewpager style
 

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:42.700
to be able to swipe a viewpager style
exactly and that's the biggest it's

00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:42.710
exactly and that's the biggest it's
 

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:43.990
exactly and that's the biggest it's
still one of the biggest challenges like

00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000
still one of the biggest challenges like
 

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.820
still one of the biggest challenges like

to see that but the trick here is that

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:19.310
to see that but the trick here is that

I'm no longer looking at tags I'm

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:25.190
I'm no longer looking at tags I'm
 

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:27.160
I'm no longer looking at tags I'm
looking at stats and so my temptation is

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:27.170
looking at stats and so my temptation is
 

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:28.420

to hit back to go back to my tags and

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:30.950
to hit back to go back to my tags and
 

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:32.440
to hit back to go back to my tags and
then I exit the app and I'm angry and

then I exit the app and I'm angry and
 

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:34.900
then I exit the app and I'm angry and
frustrated so that's I don't necessarily

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:34.910
frustrated so that's I don't necessarily
 

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:36.670
frustrated so that's I don't necessarily
have a great solution but it's a risk of

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:36.680
have a great solution but it's a risk of
 

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.660
have a great solution but it's a risk of

score is fully automated you set up your

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:51.710
score is fully automated you set up your
 

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:53.260
score is fully automated you set up your
context and then you leave it in your

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:53.270
context and then you leave it in your
 

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:55.180

pocket it does it all for you right this

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:55.190
pocket it does it all for you right this
 

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:58.930

you do need to hit the NFC tag which is

00:35:58.930 --> 00:35:58.940
you do need to hit the NFC tag which is
 

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:00.970
you do need to hit the NFC tag which is
nice the disadvantage here of course is

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:00.980
nice the disadvantage here of course is
 

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:02.349
nice the disadvantage here of course is
that you have to be conscious of it you

00:36:02.349 --> 00:36:02.359
that you have to be conscious of it you
 

00:36:02.359 --> 00:36:03.880

the advantage is that you don't need to
have any services running it's really

then last year there was another
 

00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:59.650
then last year there was another
follow-up session to that up close and

00:36:59.650 --> 00:36:59.660
follow-up session to that up close and
 

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:00.819

they've customized their toasts really

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200
they've customized their toasts really

well with a valid color or background so

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:15.180
well with a valid color or background so
 

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:16.520
well with a valid color or background so
it's not just sort of that general

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:16.530
it's not just sort of that general
 

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:18.710
it's not just sort of that general
standard generic toast which pops up so

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720
standard generic toast which pops up so
 

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.510
standard generic toast which pops up so
and this is one of the few places where

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520
and this is one of the few places where
 

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.700
and this is one of the few places where
a toast is truly appropriate exactly and

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:22.710
a toast is truly appropriate exactly and
 

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:24.170
a toast is truly appropriate exactly and
it's nice to see that they have used it

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:24.180
it's nice to see that they have used it
 

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.060
it's nice to see that they have used it
appropriately and printed it up as well

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:26.070
appropriately and printed it up as well
 

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:28.310
appropriately and printed it up as well
which is great so let's jump to the

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:28.320
which is great so let's jump to the
 

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:30.110
which is great so let's jump to the
giant phone really quickly so if we have

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:30.120
giant phone really quickly so if we have
 

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:34.220
giant phone really quickly so if we have
a look at profile widget here you can

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:34.230
a look at profile widget here you can
 

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:36.620
a look at profile widget here you can
see straight away like if we go back to

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:36.630
see straight away like if we go back to
 

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:39.080
see straight away like if we go back to
the the main page so the way it works is

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:39.090
the the main page so the way it works is
 

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:41.120
the the main page so the way it works is
you go into your profiles and then

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:41.130
you go into your profiles and then
 

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:43.160
you go into your profiles and then
there's activate profiles and create and

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:43.170
there's activate profiles and create and
 

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:44.870
there's activate profiles and create and
edit and what you actually want to do

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880
edit and what you actually want to do
 

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.520
edit and what you actually want to do
for most cases is either create or edit

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:46.530
for most cases is either create or edit
 

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:49.100
for most cases is either create or edit
a profile reordering and activating a

a profile reordering and activating a
 

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:51.200
a profile reordering and activating a
sort of secondary functions if we go

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:51.210
sort of secondary functions if we go
 

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:53.990
sort of secondary functions if we go
into editing day then we end up with

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000
into editing day then we end up with
 

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.310
into editing day then we end up with
this screen so we're already having to

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:55.320
this screen so we're already having to
 

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.200
this screen so we're already having to
sort of navigate deep into the innards

00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:57.210
sort of navigate deep into the innards
 

00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:59.330
sort of navigate deep into the innards
of the app and at this point we can do

00:39:59.330 --> 00:39:59.340
of the app and at this point we can do
 

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:02.090
of the app and at this point we can do
things like change the icons modify the

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:02.100
things like change the icons modify the
 

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:05.390
things like change the icons modify the
sound connection and and screen so one

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:05.400
sound connection and and screen so one
 

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.490
sound connection and and screen so one
of the other I guess not necessarily

this app so it doesn't have quite the
 

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:12.890
this app so it doesn't have quite the
same level of control that the others do

it's a little bit more limited in its
 

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.270
it's a little bit more limited in its
functionality there as well once you

functionality there as well once you
 

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.280

actually have it set up it creates this

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:25.290

a lot of time into the design effort of

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:31.560
a lot of time into the design effort of
 

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.200
a lot of time into the design effort of

so it can see what profile you're in so

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:45.150
so it can see what profile you're in so
 

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:47.390
so it can see what profile you're in so
the expectation here is really much more

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.400
the expectation here is really much more
 

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.580
the expectation here is really much more
sort of that older approach of defining

to that I mean we've got airplane mode

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:00.870
to that I mean we've got airplane mode
 

00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:04.250

for instance demo work mode home mode so

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:04.260
for instance demo work mode home mode so

those all makes sense and I like that

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:05.550
those all makes sense and I like that
 

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:07.300
those all makes sense and I like that
it's probably worth mentioning that

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:07.310
it's probably worth mentioning that
 

00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:09.350

and so I think this this there is an
 

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.850
and so I think this this there is an

key for these guys is to really try and

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:25.930
key for these guys is to really try and
 

00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:27.900
key for these guys is to really try and
make that process as simple and an easy

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:27.910
make that process as simple and an easy

to to do well I think we knew this show

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:30.730
to to do well I think we knew this show

is going to run long because these are

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:32.380
is going to run long because these are
 

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:35.340
is going to run long because these are
such complex apps but let's go ahead and

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:35.350
such complex apps but let's go ahead and
 

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:38.520
such complex apps but let's go ahead and
talk a little bit now wrap it up and see

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:38.530
talk a little bit now wrap it up and see
 

00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:40.620
talk a little bit now wrap it up and see
what all of these apps should be doing

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:40.630
what all of these apps should be doing
 

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:42.810
what all of these apps should be doing
absolutely so we kind of introduced this

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:42.820
absolutely so we kind of introduced this
 

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:45.090
absolutely so we kind of introduced this
stuff at the beginning you know we

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:45.100
stuff at the beginning you know we
 

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:46.470
stuff at the beginning you know we
wanted to do as much as possible we want

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480
wanted to do as much as possible we want
 

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.090
wanted to do as much as possible we want
it to be easy to use we wanted to work

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:48.100
it to be easy to use we wanted to work
 

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.880
it to be easy to use we wanted to work
on tablets and tablets I guess this is

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:50.890
on tablets and tablets I guess this is
 

00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:52.680
on tablets and tablets I guess this is
one which i do want to bring up because

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:52.690
one which i do want to bring up because
 

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:54.150
one which i do want to bring up because
i think they've all been designed for

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160
i think they've all been designed for
 

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.520
i think they've all been designed for
phones which makes sense but you know we

00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:56.530
phones which makes sense but you know we
 

00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:57.840
phones which makes sense but you know we
really want to try and emphasize how

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:57.850
really want to try and emphasize how
 

00:42:57.850 --> 00:42:58.860
really want to try and emphasize how
much people should be thinking about

00:42:58.860 --> 00:42:58.870
much people should be thinking about
 

00:42:58.870 --> 00:43:01.230
much people should be thinking about
doing those things and so step one is

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:01.240
doing those things and so step one is
 

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.760
doing those things and so step one is
really creating a great responsive

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:02.770
really creating a great responsive
 

00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:04.650
really creating a great responsive
design so that the app is going to look

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:04.660
design so that the app is going to look
 

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:06.360
design so that the app is going to look
good and work great on any device that

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:06.370
good and work great on any device that
 

00:43:06.370 --> 00:43:08.430

select it from a list and that's very

00:46:21.809 --> 00:46:21.819
select it from a list and that's very
 

00:46:21.819 --> 00:46:23.190
select it from a list and that's very
very odd especially since there are

00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:23.200
very odd especially since there are
 

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.829
