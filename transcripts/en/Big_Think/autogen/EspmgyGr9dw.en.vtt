00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.830
 
you know I thought I looked at that

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840
you know I thought I looked at that
 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.020
you know I thought I looked at that
question and you know I my favorite

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030

the business world that I knew was gay

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030
the business world that I knew was gay
 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.000
the business world that I knew was gay
and that I think is telling right

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010
and that I think is telling right
 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.940
and that I think is telling right
because I'm sure that some of these very

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950
because I'm sure that some of these very
 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.440
because I'm sure that some of these very
successful business people that are out

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450
successful business people that are out
 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.289
successful business people that are out
there are gay but they're not out and so

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299
there are gay but they're not out and so
 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.449
there are gay but they're not out and so
that's why it's difficult to answer that

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459
that's why it's difficult to answer that
 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.369
that's why it's difficult to answer that
question and in the business world

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379
question and in the business world
 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.619
question and in the business world
because you know I know confidentially

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629
because you know I know confidentially
 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.470
because you know I know confidentially
so I won't say but I can think of five

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480
so I won't say but I can think of five
 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.030
so I won't say but I can think of five
major household name companies where I

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040
major household name companies where I
 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.580
major household name companies where I
know either the CEO or very senior

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590
know either the CEO or very senior
 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.539
know either the CEO or very senior
people who are gay and but they're very

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549
people who are gay and but they're very
 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.949
people who are gay and but they're very
careful about it and so hey you know I

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959
careful about it and so hey you know I
 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.229
careful about it and so hey you know I
think the business world is kind of the

think the business world is kind of the
 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.420
think the business world is kind of the
last frontier I think for that kind of

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430
last frontier I think for that kind of
 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.189
last frontier I think for that kind of
diversity to really take hold and it's

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:00.199
diversity to really take hold and it's
 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:05.089
diversity to really take hold and it's
it's a I don't know it's it's

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099
it's a I don't know it's it's
 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.710
it's a I don't know it's it's
interesting it also is very regional I

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720
interesting it also is very regional I
 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.990
interesting it also is very regional I
