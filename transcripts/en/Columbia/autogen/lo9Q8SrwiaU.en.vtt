human rights area despite the fact that
 

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:34.439
human rights area despite the fact that
you could sort of get the impression

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:31.790
convinced that the right will
drastically change their well-being and

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:31.800
drastically change their well-being and
 

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.250
drastically change their well-being and
when they live under conditions in which

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:35.260
when they live under conditions in which
 

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.950
when they live under conditions in which
they have some chance of making a demand

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:37.960
they have some chance of making a demand
 

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.500
they have some chance of making a demand
that will succeed and I'm going to

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:40.510
that will succeed and I'm going to
 

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:43.080
that will succeed and I'm going to
really explain what I mean by this but

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:43.090
really explain what I mean by this but
 

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:45.300
really explain what I mean by this but
the shorthand terms I have in mind is

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:45.310
the shorthand terms I have in mind is
 

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:48.980
the shorthand terms I have in mind is
when there is a motive and a means for

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:48.990
when there is a motive and a means for
 

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.360
when there is a motive and a means for
demanding compliance with a ratified

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:51.370
demanding compliance with a ratified
 

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:55.220
demanding compliance with a ratified
treaty that treaties provide very useful

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:55.230
treaty that treaties provide very useful
 

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:58.140
treaty that treaties provide very useful
strategic tools for trying to achieve

00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:58.150
strategic tools for trying to achieve
 

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.630
strategic tools for trying to achieve
your goals in the human rights area now

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.640
your goals in the human rights area now
 

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.810
your goals in the human rights area now
with the 450 page book yeah so I guess

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:03.820
with the 450 page book yeah so I guess
 

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.370
with the 450 page book yeah so I guess
it raises the question why did it take

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:05.380
it raises the question why did it take
 

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.190
it raises the question why did it take
so many pages to try to establish this

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:08.200
so many pages to try to establish this
 

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.680
so many pages to try to establish this
point I think primarily on that that as

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:12.690
point I think primarily on that that as
 

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.880
point I think primarily on that that as
it exists right now there's not a lot of

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:14.890
it exists right now there's not a lot of
 

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.730
it exists right now there's not a lot of
evidence on this issue area there's not

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:17.740
evidence on this issue area there's not
 

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.120
evidence on this issue area there's not
a lot of systematic look at the sort of

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:21.130
a lot of systematic look at the sort of
 

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:22.790
a lot of systematic look at the sort of
a range of outcomes to see whether

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800
a range of outcomes to see whether
 

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.350
a range of outcomes to see whether
international law really has had much of

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.360
international law really has had much of
 

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.670
international law really has had much of
an influence of course it's an area

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:26.680
an influence of course it's an area
 

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.890
an influence of course it's an area
everybody has an opinion on you know

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:28.900
everybody has an opinion on you know
 

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.130
everybody has an opinion on you know
that is people presume or hold priors if

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:32.140
that is people presume or hold priors if
 

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.260
that is people presume or hold priors if
you will about the influence event

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:34.270
you will about the influence event
 

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:35.790
you will about the influence event
national law but the evidence I don't

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:35.800
national law but the evidence I don't
 

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.800
national law but the evidence I don't
think has been readily assembled in one

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:37.810
think has been readily assembled in one
 

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:39.600
think has been readily assembled in one
place so part of what I want to do this

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:39.610
place so part of what I want to do this
 

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:41.610
place so part of what I want to do this
evening is to give you a sort of a

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:41.620
evening is to give you a sort of a
 

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.260
evening is to give you a sort of a
little flavor of the kind of evidence

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:43.270
little flavor of the kind of evidence
 

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.870
little flavor of the kind of evidence
that can be brought to bear in this

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:45.880
that can be brought to bear in this
 

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.810
that can be brought to bear in this
issue on this issue as well I have two

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:48.820
issue on this issue as well I have two
 

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.990
issue on this issue as well I have two
distinguished discusses tonight and I I

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000
distinguished discusses tonight and I I
 

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.240
distinguished discusses tonight and I I
can never predict what a discussant will

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:54.250
can never predict what a discussant will
 

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.060
can never predict what a discussant will
say but I'm going to suggest that there

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:57.070
say but I'm going to suggest that there
 

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.100
say but I'm going to suggest that there
are sort of two kinds of responses

00:10:59.100 --> 00:10:59.110
are sort of two kinds of responses
 

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:02.580
are sort of two kinds of responses
generally and I would imagine that Ken

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:02.590
generally and I would imagine that Ken
 

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:05.010
generally and I would imagine that Ken
Roth will be closer to one and that Alex

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:05.020
Roth will be closer to one and that Alex
 

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.950
Roth will be closer to one and that Alex
will be closer to the other and so one

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:07.960
will be closer to the other and so one
 

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.440
will be closer to the other and so one
reaction that I've gotten in terms of

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:10.450
reaction that I've gotten in terms of
 

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.140
reaction that I've gotten in terms of
sort of the more practical oriented

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:13.150
sort of the more practical oriented
 

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.780
sort of the more practical oriented
community as Beth you are leaning on an

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:15.790
community as Beth you are leaning on an
 

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:18.960
community as Beth you are leaning on an
open door of course we use these

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:18.970
open door of course we use these
 

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.360
open door of course we use these
treaties it's obvious that we use these

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:21.370
treaties it's obvious that we use these
 

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:25.020
treaties it's obvious that we use these
treaties to try to mobilize groups and

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:25.030
treaties to try to mobilize groups and
 

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.060
treaties to try to mobilize groups and
to create and stimulate demand sometimes

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:27.070
to create and stimulate demand sometimes
 

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:28.890
to create and stimulate demand sometimes
litigating when that seems like a

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:28.900
litigating when that seems like a
 

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.880
litigating when that seems like a
reasonable possibility and and so so my

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:32.890
reasonable possibility and and so so my
 

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:36.570
reasonable possibility and and so so my
message to those folks is we have a

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:36.580
message to those folks is we have a
 

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.340
message to those folks is we have a
number of Alex coolies in the audience

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:38.350
number of Alex coolies in the audience
 

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:41.040
number of Alex coolies in the audience
that is we have a number of scholars

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:41.050
that is we have a number of scholars
 

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:42.830
that is we have a number of scholars
that come from the direction of

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:42.840
that come from the direction of
 

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.960
that come from the direction of
international relations and have a

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:45.970
international relations and have a
 

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:48.390
international relations and have a
harder time imagining that the

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:48.400
harder time imagining that the
 

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.480
harder time imagining that the
cumulative effect of these treaties over

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:51.490
cumulative effect of these treaties over
 

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:53.700
cumulative effect of these treaties over
time would really amount to anything

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:53.710
time would really amount to anything
 

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.670
time would really amount to anything
very positive on the ground and this is

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:56.680
very positive on the ground and this is
 

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.560
very positive on the ground and this is
because all the shortcomings that we

00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:58.570
because all the shortcomings that we
 

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.690
because all the shortcomings that we
well know of that these treaties are

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:00.700
well know of that these treaties are
 

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.820
well know of that these treaties are
difficult to enforce internationally

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:02.830
difficult to enforce internationally
 

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.670
difficult to enforce internationally
that outside actors States in particular

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680
that outside actors States in particular
 

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.700
that outside actors States in particular
often have very little motive to become

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:08.710
often have very little motive to become
 

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.040
often have very little motive to become
involved and entangled in the human

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:11.050
involved and entangled in the human
 

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:12.960
involved and entangled in the human
rights issue error issues of other

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:12.970
rights issue error issues of other
 

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.120
rights issue error issues of other
states and that in many cases they would

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:15.130
states and that in many cases they would
 

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:18.510
states and that in many cases they would
just rather conduct state relations on a

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:18.520
just rather conduct state relations on a
 

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.920
just rather conduct state relations on a
more diplomatic level rather than

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:19.930
more diplomatic level rather than
 

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:23.250
more diplomatic level rather than
critiquing domestic political practices

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:23.260
critiquing domestic political practices
 

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.280
critiquing domestic political practices
so what I want to do tonight is to not

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:26.290
so what I want to do tonight is to not
 

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.550
so what I want to do tonight is to not
offer you proof of my proposition but

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:29.560
offer you proof of my proposition but
 

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.770
offer you proof of my proposition but
instead just offer evidence of the

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:31.780
instead just offer evidence of the
 

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.840
instead just offer evidence of the
proposition that these treaties have

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:33.850
proposition that these treaties have
 

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:36.900
proposition that these treaties have
made a difference on the ground to a

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:36.910
made a difference on the ground to a
 

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.030
made a difference on the ground to a
broad range of countries I'm going to

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040
broad range of countries I'm going to
 

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.470
broad range of countries I'm going to
specify some conditions under which

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480
specify some conditions under which
 

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.670
specify some conditions under which
these treaties have been especially

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680
these treaties have been especially
 

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.400
these treaties have been especially
important

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:45.410
important
 

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:46.749
important
especially useful and the bottom line

00:12:46.749 --> 00:12:46.759
especially useful and the bottom line
 

00:12:46.759 --> 00:12:49.869
especially useful and the bottom line
message is not that we should stop doing

00:12:49.869 --> 00:12:49.879
message is not that we should stop doing
 

00:12:49.879 --> 00:12:52.420
message is not that we should stop doing
everything else but that these treaties

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:52.430
everything else but that these treaties
 

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:56.110
everything else but that these treaties
rightfully belong in a toolkit that the

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:56.120
rightfully belong in a toolkit that the
 

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.090
rightfully belong in a toolkit that the
international community should use and

00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:58.100
international community should use and
 

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.819
international community should use and
should encourage locals to use as well

00:13:00.819 --> 00:13:00.829
should encourage locals to use as well
 

00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:03.579
should encourage locals to use as well
when they are trying to articulate the

00:13:03.579 --> 00:13:03.589
when they are trying to articulate the
 

00:13:03.589 --> 00:13:05.530
when they are trying to articulate the
kinds of demands that they would like to

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:05.540
kinds of demands that they would like to
 

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.499
kinds of demands that they would like to
see their governments meet in the area

00:13:08.499 --> 00:13:08.509
see their governments meet in the area
 

00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:10.780
see their governments meet in the area
of human rights let me start with just a

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:10.790
of human rights let me start with just a
 

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.280
of human rights let me start with just a
little bit of background about the book

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:12.290
little bit of background about the book
 

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.559
little bit of background about the book
I mean you know one initial question is

00:13:14.559 --> 00:13:14.569
I mean you know one initial question is
 

00:13:14.569 --> 00:13:16.629
I mean you know one initial question is
why do we have an international legal

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639
why do we have an international legal
 

00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:21.429
why do we have an international legal
regime for human rights at all and I

00:13:21.429 --> 00:13:21.439
regime for human rights at all and I
 

00:13:21.439 --> 00:13:22.780
regime for human rights at all and I
think I think this is an interesting

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:22.790
think I think this is an interesting
 

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:26.290
think I think this is an interesting
question and it's important I feel like

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:26.300
question and it's important I feel like
 

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.420
question and it's important I feel like
to put it in a broader context over the

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:28.430
to put it in a broader context over the
 

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:30.639
to put it in a broader context over the
course of the 20th century where a lot

00:13:30.639 --> 00:13:30.649
course of the 20th century where a lot
 

00:13:30.649 --> 00:13:32.800
course of the 20th century where a lot
of things are happening a lot of things

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:32.810
of things are happening a lot of things
 

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:36.280
of things are happening a lot of things
are happening that I think build sort of

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:36.290
are happening that I think build sort of
 

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.319
are happening that I think build sort of
a context in a background in which these

00:13:38.319 --> 00:13:38.329
a context in a background in which these
 

00:13:38.329 --> 00:13:41.350
a context in a background in which these
treaties might eventually gain some kind

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360
treaties might eventually gain some kind
 

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.720
treaties might eventually gain some kind
of traction so you know if we were to

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:43.730
of traction so you know if we were to
 

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.179
of traction so you know if we were to
have had this lecture 60 years ago the

00:13:46.179 --> 00:13:46.189
have had this lecture 60 years ago the
 

00:13:46.189 --> 00:13:47.679
have had this lecture 60 years ago the
stunning fact is there would be almost

00:13:47.679 --> 00:13:47.689
stunning fact is there would be almost
 

00:13:47.689 --> 00:13:50.110
stunning fact is there would be almost
nothing to say that is there be almost

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:50.120
nothing to say that is there be almost
 

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.879
nothing to say that is there be almost
nothing nope no tree used to point to

00:13:51.879 --> 00:13:51.889
nothing nope no tree used to point to
 

00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:53.889
nothing nope no tree used to point to
but a lot of changes that occurred over

00:13:53.889 --> 00:13:53.899
but a lot of changes that occurred over
 

00:13:53.899 --> 00:13:55.540
but a lot of changes that occurred over
the course of the 20th century and they

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:55.550
the course of the 20th century and they
 

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.150
the course of the 20th century and they
have given rise I think to the

00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160
have given rise I think to the
 

00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.920
have given rise I think to the
possibility for the development of a

00:13:59.920 --> 00:13:59.930
possibility for the development of a
 

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:02.579
possibility for the development of a
meaningful regime first democratization

00:14:02.579 --> 00:14:02.589
meaningful regime first democratization
 

00:14:02.589 --> 00:14:05.650
meaningful regime first democratization
these treaties empower individuals visa

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:05.660
these treaties empower individuals visa
 

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.840
these treaties empower individuals visa
to their governments the natural

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:07.850
to their governments the natural
 

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:11.699
to their governments the natural
constituency for such treaties would be

00:14:11.699 --> 00:14:11.709
constituency for such treaties would be
 

00:14:11.709 --> 00:14:14.740
constituency for such treaties would be
democratic constituencies would be

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:14.750
democratic constituencies would be
 

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.139
democratic constituencies would be
countries in which there is a broad

00:14:17.139 --> 00:14:17.149
countries in which there is a broad
 

00:14:17.149 --> 00:14:19.840
countries in which there is a broad
demand and broad responsiveness to the

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:19.850
demand and broad responsiveness to the
 

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:21.819

democratization over the course of the

democratization over the course of the
 

00:14:25.579 --> 00:14:28.329
democratization over the course of the
century has have made it possible to

00:14:28.329 --> 00:14:28.339
century has have made it possible to
 

00:14:28.339 --> 00:14:30.939
century has have made it possible to
create an international human rights

00:14:30.939 --> 00:14:30.949
create an international human rights
 

00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:34.269
create an international human rights
regime that might be meaningful the

regime that might be meaningful the
 

00:14:34.279 --> 00:14:36.579
regime that might be meaningful the
second development over time is that

00:14:36.579 --> 00:14:36.589
second development over time is that
 

00:14:36.589 --> 00:14:39.009
second development over time is that

treaties hold States Parties more and
more accountable over time if you were

of the main things to keep in mind is
that there were proximate conditions as

World War of course gave rise to the

pushed the movement along for the

the inspiration for what went one
 

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.020
the inspiration for what went one
internationally in the creation of a

movements as well and drew mutual
 

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.290

so the Alliance for codifying the

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:05.070
of Human Rights and putting them into a
binding treaty form I think came down to

00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:05.080
binding treaty form I think came down to
 

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:08.400

probably obvious as well so it took this
 

00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:50.210

the ground the results over time was the
development of a large number of

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:00.450
development of a large number of
 

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.740
development of a large number of
treaties which we can see taking off

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:02.750
treaties which we can see taking off
 

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:06.230
treaties which we can see taking off
between 1945 1950 and then increasing

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240
between 1945 1950 and then increasing
 

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:10.279
between 1945 1950 and then increasing
this is a picture here which sort of

00:18:10.279 --> 00:18:10.289
this is a picture here which sort of
 

00:18:10.289 --> 00:18:13.250
this is a picture here which sort of
looks in at the cumulative number of

treaties enforce non-binding

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640
treaties enforce non-binding
 

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.770
treaties enforce non-binding
declarations enforced relating to the

human rights area and other kinds of
 

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.169
human rights area and other kinds of
agreements and standards but we can see

00:18:23.169 --> 00:18:23.179
agreements and standards but we can see
 

00:18:23.179 --> 00:18:26.270
agreements and standards but we can see
increasingly the bottom sort of set of

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280
increasingly the bottom sort of set of
 

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.320
increasingly the bottom sort of set of
the brightest darkest part of the

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:29.330
the brightest darkest part of the
 

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:32.620
the brightest darkest part of the
picture there relates to legally binding

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:32.630
picture there relates to legally binding
 

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:35.210

multilateral treaties that address the

multilateral treaties that address the
 

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:38.390
multilateral treaties that address the
human rights area so this raises some

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400
human rights area so this raises some
 

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.799
human rights area so this raises some
interesting questions about why States

00:18:41.799 --> 00:18:41.809
interesting questions about why States
 

00:18:41.809 --> 00:18:44.510
interesting questions about why States
once they're sort of faced with this

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:44.520
once they're sort of faced with this
 

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.669
once they're sort of faced with this
decision of whether or not to ratify a

00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679
decision of whether or not to ratify a
 

00:18:46.679 --> 00:18:49.130
decision of whether or not to ratify a
treaty or not would really want to put

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:49.140
treaty or not would really want to put
 

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.560
treaty or not would really want to put
themselves on the line and publicly

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:51.570
themselves on the line and publicly
 

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:54.080
themselves on the line and publicly
commit themselves to observing one of

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:54.090
commit themselves to observing one of

these legally binding international

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:56.220
these legally binding international
 

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:59.000
these legally binding international
treaties now when I start to examine

00:18:59.000 --> 00:18:59.010
treaties now when I start to examine
 

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:01.070
treaties now when I start to examine
this question I decided to start looking

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080
this question I decided to start looking
 

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.799
this question I decided to start looking
at six of the core treaties the core

00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:03.809
at six of the core treaties the core
 

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:06.049
at six of the core treaties the core
human rights treaties basically these

00:19:06.049 --> 00:19:06.059
human rights treaties basically these
 

00:19:06.059 --> 00:19:08.210
human rights treaties basically these
are the ones that I focus on when I try

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:08.220
are the ones that I focus on when I try
 

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.159
are the ones that I focus on when I try
to look at the question of why do

00:19:10.159 --> 00:19:10.169
to look at the question of why do
 

00:19:10.169 --> 00:19:13.010
to look at the question of why do
governments commit themselves I mean

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:13.020
governments commit themselves I mean
 

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.600
governments commit themselves I mean
after all wouldn't it be easier to stand

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:14.610
after all wouldn't it be easier to stand
 

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:18.560
after all wouldn't it be easier to stand
aside not get involved and sort of not

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:18.570
aside not get involved and sort of not
 

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:20.480
aside not get involved and sort of not
put your reputation on the line or make

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:20.490
put your reputation on the line or make
 

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.600
put your reputation on the line or make
a promise that in fact

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:22.610
a promise that in fact
 

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:25.660
a promise that in fact
we'll live up to certain international

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:25.670
we'll live up to certain international
 

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:27.520
we'll live up to certain international
standards with respect to human rights

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:27.530
standards with respect to human rights
 

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:30.490
standards with respect to human rights
so when I was looking at these six

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:30.500
so when I was looking at these six
 

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.039
so when I was looking at these six
treaties I was noticing some interesting

00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:33.049
treaties I was noticing some interesting
 

00:19:33.049 --> 00:19:36.160
treaties I was noticing some interesting
patterns over time now most many people

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:36.170
patterns over time now most many people
 

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:38.710
patterns over time now most many people
not legal scholars generally that many

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720
not legal scholars generally that many
 

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.350
not legal scholars generally that many
international relations scholars will

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360
international relations scholars will
 

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.030
international relations scholars will
argue that these treaties are ratified

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:43.040
argue that these treaties are ratified
 

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.090
argue that these treaties are ratified
simply because they're costless they're

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:46.100
simply because they're costless they're
 

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:49.000
simply because they're costless they're
not enforced there's no easy way to hold

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:49.010
not enforced there's no easy way to hold
 

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:51.760
not enforced there's no easy way to hold
the state to its obligations and so it's

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:51.770
the state to its obligations and so it's
 

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:53.620
the state to its obligations and so it's
simply cost listen States take these

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:53.630
simply cost listen States take these
 

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.680
simply cost listen States take these
sort of symbolic gestures to ratify

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:56.690
sort of symbolic gestures to ratify
 

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:58.900
sort of symbolic gestures to ratify
these treaties well if that was the case

00:19:58.900 --> 00:19:58.910
these treaties well if that was the case
 

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:01.990
these treaties well if that was the case
we faced some puzzles but that's the

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:02.000
we faced some puzzles but that's the
 

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.669
we faced some puzzles but that's the
case it's hard to understand why you

00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:03.679
case it's hard to understand why you
 

00:20:03.679 --> 00:20:05.919
case it's hard to understand why you
might get some of these patterns over

00:20:05.919 --> 00:20:05.929
might get some of these patterns over
 

00:20:05.929 --> 00:20:08.409
might get some of these patterns over
time in ratification what I'm showing

00:20:08.409 --> 00:20:08.419
time in ratification what I'm showing
 

00:20:08.419 --> 00:20:10.780
time in ratification what I'm showing
you now are the six major treaties and

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:10.790
you now are the six major treaties and
 

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:13.030
you now are the six major treaties and
what I'm doing is stacking up the

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:13.040
what I'm doing is stacking up the
 

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.880
what I'm doing is stacking up the
ratification basically of those treaties

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:15.890
ratification basically of those treaties
 

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:18.190
ratification basically of those treaties
over time on the vertical axis we're

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:18.200
over time on the vertical axis we're
 

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.010
over time on the vertical axis we're
just getting a total number of

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:20.020
just getting a total number of
 

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.120
just getting a total number of
ratifications for these six treaties if

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:22.130
ratifications for these six treaties if
 

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:24.549
ratifications for these six treaties if
we were to add them all up and there's

00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559
we were to add them all up and there's
 

00:20:24.559 --> 00:20:26.590
we were to add them all up and there's
some interesting things going on here if

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:26.600
some interesting things going on here if
 

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.110
some interesting things going on here if
treaties were costless why doesn't

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120
treaties were costless why doesn't
 

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.630
treaties were costless why doesn't
everybody jump on board and why don't

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:31.640
everybody jump on board and why don't
 

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.669
everybody jump on board and why don't
they do it immediately or the same for

00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679
they do it immediately or the same for
 

00:20:33.679 --> 00:20:36.159
they do it immediately or the same for
all treaties and that's not what's going

00:20:36.159 --> 00:20:36.169
all treaties and that's not what's going
 

00:20:36.169 --> 00:20:38.919
all treaties and that's not what's going
on here instead what's going on is we

00:20:38.919 --> 00:20:38.929
on here instead what's going on is we
 

00:20:38.929 --> 00:20:41.710
on here instead what's going on is we
can see some treaties glean a lot of

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:41.720
can see some treaties glean a lot of
 

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.840
can see some treaties glean a lot of
international ratifications very quickly

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:43.850
international ratifications very quickly
 

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:46.330
international ratifications very quickly
the one that especially does so is the

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:46.340
the one that especially does so is the
 

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.250
the one that especially does so is the
children's convention the Convention on

you can see on the very top it's slow

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280
you can see on the very top it's slow
 

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.909
you can see on the very top it's slow
getting off the ground and it never does

Rights the child gets and we can think
 

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.039
Rights the child gets and we can think
of a lot of reasons why that might be

of a lot of reasons why that might be
 

00:21:12.049 --> 00:21:15.520
of a lot of reasons why that might be

detect the case torture is often related
to issues having to do with national

the children's convention is often

described as an aspirational tree it
does admit that there are some

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:06.650
does admit that there are some
 

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:09.130
does admit that there are some
circumstances under which it would be

those conditions so there are some

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:15.560
those conditions so there are some
 

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.410
those conditions so there are some
differences across these treaties that

we should not be able to see if it were
simply the fact that ratifying these

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:23.660
simply the fact that ratifying these
 

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:26.440
simply the fact that ratifying these
treaties was completely costless across

treaties was completely costless across
the board this pattern is also difficult

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:28.760
the board this pattern is also difficult
 

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.900
the board this pattern is also difficult
to understand if ratifying treaties are

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:31.910
to understand if ratifying treaties are
 

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:36.000
to understand if ratifying treaties are

one reason is they often have

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:03.300
one reason is they often have
 

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:05.780
one reason is they often have
information deficits so I found what I

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:05.790
information deficits so I found what I
 

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:07.580
information deficits so I found what I
was looking at this work that a lot of

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:07.590
was looking at this work that a lot of
 

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:10.850
was looking at this work that a lot of
mimicry went on in regions that have

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:10.860
mimicry went on in regions that have
 

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.790
mimicry went on in regions that have
poor information and I looked at the

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:13.800
poor information and I looked at the
 

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.500
poor information and I looked at the
degree of freedom of the press for

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:15.510
degree of freedom of the press for
 

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:17.090
degree of freedom of the press for
example in the different regions and

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:17.100
example in the different regions and
 

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:20.720
example in the different regions and
found mimicry really high where the

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:20.730
found mimicry really high where the
 

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:22.660
found mimicry really high where the
press was controlled by governments

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:22.670
press was controlled by governments
 

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:25.670
press was controlled by governments
mimicry was low in regions where the

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:25.680
mimicry was low in regions where the
 

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.680
mimicry was low in regions where the
press was rather more free so

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:27.690
press was rather more free so
 

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:29.830
press was rather more free so
information deficits are one possibility

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:29.840
information deficits are one possibility

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:11.000
this made and so in order to answer that
question I look very closely at domestic

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:11.010
question I look very closely at domestic
 

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:14.360
question I look very closely at domestic
politics and the argument that I make is

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:14.370
politics and the argument that I make is
 

00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:16.580
politics and the argument that I make is
the main argument in the book this isn't

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:16.590
the main argument in the book this isn't
 

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:17.840
the main argument in the book this isn't
the only argument that i'm just going to

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:17.850
the only argument that i'm just going to
 

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:20.090
the only argument that i'm just going to
simplify and focus in on one of the

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:20.100
simplify and focus in on one of the
 

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.340
simplify and focus in on one of the
mechanisms that i look at in the book is

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:22.350
mechanisms that i look at in the book is
 

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:25.399
mechanisms that i look at in the book is
that ratify treaties help to mobilize

00:33:25.399 --> 00:33:25.409
that ratify treaties help to mobilize
 

00:33:25.409 --> 00:33:28.700
that ratify treaties help to mobilize
groups to expect and to demand their

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:28.710
groups to expect and to demand their
 

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:31.460
groups to expect and to demand their
rights and I argue that treaties have

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:31.470
rights and I argue that treaties have
 

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:35.180
rights and I argue that treaties have
two kinds of effects in countries they

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:35.190
two kinds of effects in countries they
 

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:37.010
two kinds of effects in countries they
influence values they can have an

influence values they can have an
 

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:39.860
influence values they can have an
educated function that is they can

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:39.870
educated function that is they can
 

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:42.500
educated function that is they can
actually convince people that who have

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:42.510
actually convince people that who have
 

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:44.270
actually convince people that who have

in addition they actually increase the

in addition they actually increase the
 

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:54.980
in addition they actually increase the

in order to flush this out let's think

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:12.450
in order to flush this out let's think
 

00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:14.180
in order to flush this out let's think
first of all why people would mobilize

00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:14.190
first of all why people would mobilize
 

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:16.909

treaty and the way I think about this is
 

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:23.480
treaty and the way I think about this is
that people mobilize when the expected

it's a function of how likely you are to

it's a function of how likely you are to

it's a function of how likely you are to
succeed and how much valium you put on

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200
succeed and how much valium you put on
 

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:39.649

let's just go back to the original

let's just go back to the original
picture and think about the introduction

you think of both of those pervs go up
is that the motive and the means to

is that the motive and the means to
mobilize and the influence that a treaty

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:54.450
mobilize and the influence that a treaty
 

00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:56.750
mobilize and the influence that a treaty
actually adds when those two branches

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:56.760
actually adds when those two branches
 

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:59.000
actually adds when those two branches
for those two curves kind of move up

00:42:59.000 --> 00:42:59.010
for those two curves kind of move up

for those two curves kind of move up
asymmetrically is that introducing a

asymmetrically is that introducing a
 

00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:04.430
asymmetrically is that introducing a

I really stimulates groups that now

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:31.320
I really stimulates groups that now

I really stimulates groups that now
think they can increasingly succeed and

to try to do so um and this just simply

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:40.680
to try to do so um and this just simply
 

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.170
to try to do so um and this just simply
shows us this is a result of a

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:42.180
shows us this is a result of a
 

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:44.480
shows us this is a result of a
regression that shows that the

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:44.490
regression that shows that the
 

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:47.600

correlation between ratifying the treaty
 

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:51.380
correlation between ratifying the treaty
and the mobilization of groups gets

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:51.390
and the mobilization of groups gets
 

00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:54.350
and the mobilization of groups gets
stronger and more positive after

00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:54.360
stronger and more positive after
 

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:57.620
stronger and more positive after

there's been a ratification this is a

participate and to do so
alright so my expectation though is a

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:30.670
alright so my expectation though is a
 

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:32.190
alright so my expectation though is a
treaty should have their greatest and

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:32.200
treaty should have their greatest and

that we had the least bit of time

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000
that we had the least bit of time
 

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.150
that we had the least bit of time
formula in the few minutes remaining is

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160
formula in the few minutes remaining is
 

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:55.980
formula in the few minutes remaining is
the area of torture so I just want to

00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:55.990
the area of torture so I just want to
 

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:57.450
the area of torture so I just want to
give you a little bit of evidence on

00:44:57.450 --> 00:44:57.460
give you a little bit of evidence on
 

00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:00.240
give you a little bit of evidence on
this so this is the scale that I use to

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:00.250
this so this is the scale that I use to
 

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:03.540
this so this is the scale that I use to
try to examine the incidence of torture

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:03.550
try to examine the incidence of torture
 

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:05.670
try to examine the incidence of torture
and they intensity really of torture I

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680
and they intensity really of torture I
 

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:06.780
and they intensity really of torture I
don't believe it makes any sense to

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:06.790
don't believe it makes any sense to
 

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:09.240
don't believe it makes any sense to
count tortures I don't believe that but

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:09.250
count tortures I don't believe that but
 

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:10.890
count tortures I don't believe that but
it does make sense to put states in two

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:10.900
it does make sense to put states in two
 

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:13.710
it does make sense to put states in two
broad categories and we can make these

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:13.720
broad categories and we can make these
 

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:17.099
broad categories and we can make these
categories based on two kinds of

you torture the effects differ across
 

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:55.840
you torture the effects differ across
some of these other issue areas and then

countries like the United States would
 

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:15.340
countries like the United States would
use their rhetoric and their material

00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:15.350
use their rhetoric and their material
 

00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:17.500
use their rhetoric and their material
resources to show that they support

these treaties as well because it seems
like the least you can do to sort of

think prediction i would say which you

00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160
think prediction i would say which you
 

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:12.970
think prediction i would say which you
know I mean I at a certain level

know I mean I at a certain level
 

00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:15.519
know I mean I at a certain level
naturally I think treaties matter

00:51:15.519 --> 00:51:15.529
naturally I think treaties matter
 

00:51:15.529 --> 00:51:18.019
naturally I think treaties matter
ratification of treaties matter of you

00:51:18.019 --> 00:51:18.029
ratification of treaties matter of you
 

00:51:18.029 --> 00:51:20.000
ratification of treaties matter of you
know so I don't I don't find that a

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:20.010
know so I don't I don't find that a
 

00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:22.309
know so I don't I don't find that a
controversial proposition and I'm happy

00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319
controversial proposition and I'm happy
 

00:51:22.319 --> 00:51:23.870
controversial proposition and I'm happy
that you were able to prove that you

00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:23.880
that you were able to prove that you
 

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:28.279
that you were able to prove that you
know um but I'm going to I mean I also

00:51:28.279 --> 00:51:28.289
know um but I'm going to I mean I also
 

00:51:28.289 --> 00:51:30.170
know um but I'm going to I mean I also
understand sort of the political context

00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:30.180
understand sort of the political context
 

00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:31.819
understand sort of the political context
in which you thought it was important to

00:51:31.819 --> 00:51:31.829
in which you thought it was important to
 

00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:32.990
in which you thought it was important to
pursue that because I realized that

00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.000
pursue that because I realized that
 

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.900
pursue that because I realized that
there are some who claim not only do

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:35.910
there are some who claim not only do
 

00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:37.880
there are some who claim not only do
treaties or not matter but that

00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:37.890
treaties or not matter but that
 

00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:41.210
treaties or not matter but that
ratification is negative and you know

00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:41.220
ratification is negative and you know
 

00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:43.760
ratification is negative and you know
taking the I mean I guess the case where

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:43.770
taking the I mean I guess the case where
 

00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:44.900
taking the I mean I guess the case where
that would come out most acutely would

00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:44.910
that would come out most acutely would
 

00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:47.630
that would come out most acutely would
be your false positives and and I agree

00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:47.640
be your false positives and and I agree
 

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:49.160
be your false positives and and I agree
with you that that that's a short-term

00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:49.170
with you that that that's a short-term
 

00:51:49.170 --> 00:51:51.559
with you that that that's a short-term
strategy you know that that perhaps for

00:51:51.559 --> 00:51:51.569
strategy you know that that perhaps for
 

00:51:51.569 --> 00:51:53.870
strategy you know that that perhaps for
a moment ratification could deflect

00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:53.880
a moment ratification could deflect
 

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:56.539
a moment ratification could deflect
pressure but it's it's not a long-term

00:51:56.539 --> 00:51:56.549
pressure but it's it's not a long-term
 

00:51:56.549 --> 00:51:59.150
pressure but it's it's not a long-term
strategy because you know over time the

00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160
strategy because you know over time the
 

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:00.230
strategy because you know over time the
human rights movement will get to that

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240
human rights movement will get to that
 

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.390
human rights movement will get to that
country and and the ratification won't

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.400
country and and the ratification won't
 

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:05.089
country and and the ratification won't
help I actually think it's interesting

00:52:05.089 --> 00:52:05.099
help I actually think it's interesting
 

00:52:05.099 --> 00:52:07.640
help I actually think it's interesting
the point you made about autocrats doing

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:07.650
the point you made about autocrats doing
 

00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:09.920
the point you made about autocrats doing
this toward the end I would interpret

00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:09.930
this toward the end I would interpret
 

00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:11.510
this toward the end I would interpret
that differently I mean I you know where

00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520
that differently I mean I you know where
 

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.609
that differently I mean I you know where
as you know an elected government knows

00:52:13.609 --> 00:52:13.619
as you know an elected government knows
 

00:52:13.619 --> 00:52:16.670
as you know an elected government knows
when the end is almost a definition of

00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:16.680
when the end is almost a definition of
 

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:17.870
when the end is almost a definition of
an autocrat is that they don't know when

00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:17.880
an autocrat is that they don't know when
 

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:18.890
an autocrat is that they don't know when
the end is they're trying to cling to

00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:18.900
the end is they're trying to cling to
 

00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:22.750
the end is they're trying to cling to
power and and so you know if indeed

00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:22.760
power and and so you know if indeed
 

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:25.039
power and and so you know if indeed
ratifications of autocrats tend to come

00:52:25.039 --> 00:52:25.049
ratifications of autocrats tend to come
 

00:52:25.049 --> 00:52:26.660
ratifications of autocrats tend to come
toward the end of what in retrospect we

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:26.670
toward the end of what in retrospect we
 

00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:28.700
toward the end of what in retrospect we
know was the the conclusion of their

00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:28.710
know was the the conclusion of their
 

00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:31.250
know was the the conclusion of their
regime it may have been sort of a last

00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:31.260
regime it may have been sort of a last
 

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:33.859
regime it may have been sort of a last
ditch effort to cling to power and that

00:52:33.859 --> 00:52:33.869
ditch effort to cling to power and that
 

00:52:33.869 --> 00:52:35.599
ditch effort to cling to power and that
you know as the pressure is building for

00:52:35.599 --> 00:52:35.609
you know as the pressure is building for
 

00:52:35.609 --> 00:52:37.549
you know as the pressure is building for
them to step down they may have sort of

00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559
them to step down they may have sort of
 

00:52:37.559 --> 00:52:39.559
them to step down they may have sort of
offered this as you know one last effort

00:52:39.559 --> 00:52:39.569
offered this as you know one last effort
 

00:52:39.569 --> 00:52:42.170
offered this as you know one last effort
to legitimize their rule which failed

00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:42.180
to legitimize their rule which failed
 

00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:43.930
to legitimize their rule which failed
you know since we know was at the end

00:52:43.930 --> 00:52:43.940
you know since we know was at the end
 

00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:48.079
you know since we know was at the end
but anyway that's a small point um I i'm

00:52:48.079 --> 00:52:48.089
but anyway that's a small point um I i'm
 

00:52:48.089 --> 00:52:50.180
but anyway that's a small point um I i'm
going to my main thesis here is is I

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:50.190
going to my main thesis here is is I
 

00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:51.380
going to my main thesis here is is I
think different from what you would

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:51.390
think different from what you would
 

00:52:51.390 --> 00:52:56.049
think different from what you would
expect me to say and and that is that um

00:52:56.049 --> 00:52:56.059
expect me to say and and that is that um
 

00:52:56.059 --> 00:52:58.370
expect me to say and and that is that um
perhaps I can only say that because I'm

00:52:58.370 --> 00:52:58.380
perhaps I can only say that because I'm
 

00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:00.920
perhaps I can only say that because I'm
a lawyer but I don't think the law

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:00.930
a lawyer but I don't think the law
 

00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:04.640
a lawyer but I don't think the law
matters nearly as much as the underlying

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:04.650
matters nearly as much as the underlying
 

00:53:04.650 --> 00:53:08.000
matters nearly as much as the underlying
norms and and to just to kind of you

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:08.010
norms and and to just to kind of you
 

00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:10.220

which you know you still get get
 

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:42.920
which you know you still get get
glimmers of for now and then but it's a

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:42.930
glimmers of for now and then but it's a
 

00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:44.390
glimmers of for now and then but it's a
totally discredited argument and it

00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400
totally discredited argument and it
 

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:47.030
totally discredited argument and it
doesn't get you know people anything if

00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040
doesn't get you know people anything if

I think it's treaties that have helped
 

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:53.090
I think it's treaties that have helped
to undermine that argument and so um

00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:53.100
to undermine that argument and so um
 

00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:55.040
to undermine that argument and so um
just you know whether any particular

human rights treaties shows that the

00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:01.380

its people is a legitimate conversation
at the international level I mean that's

00:55:08.359 --> 00:55:08.369
at the international level I mean that's
 

00:55:08.369 --> 00:55:11.390
at the international level I mean that's
tremendously important the other thing

00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:11.400
tremendously important the other thing
 

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:12.800
tremendously important the other thing
that I think is important and this is a

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:12.810
that I think is important and this is a
 

00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:17.000
that I think is important and this is a
corollary of that is that much of the

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:17.010
corollary of that is that much of the
 

00:55:17.010 --> 00:55:19.070
corollary of that is that much of the
way the human rights movement puts

00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:19.080

for me the norms that matter much more

00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:54.210
for me the norms that matter much more
 

00:58:54.210 --> 00:58:56.150
for me the norms that matter much more
are at the level of sort of what you

00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:58.070
are at the level of sort of what you
might call public morality just you know

00:58:58.070 --> 00:58:58.080

and and you know that that population

00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:03.390
and and you know that that population
 

00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:06.590
and and you know that that population
can be ideally would be within the the

00:59:06.590 --> 00:59:06.600
can be ideally would be within the the
 

00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:08.480

a surrogate public so if you have a sort

00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:10.170
a surrogate public so if you have a sort
 

00:59:10.170 --> 00:59:11.630
a surrogate public so if you have a sort
of a significant aid relationship and

you can convince you know another public
 

00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:16.010
you can convince you know another public
to change that aid relationship or to

evolved sufficiently in the target
 

00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:24.800
evolved sufficiently in the target
country but you know when I think about

00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:24.810
country but you know when I think about
 

00:59:24.810 --> 00:59:27.500
country but you know when I think about
sort of the different types of rites I

00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:27.510
sort of the different types of rites I
 

00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:28.760
sort of the different types of rites I
mean I guess put let me put it this way

00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:28.770

I think would be useful in your analysis

00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:31.110
I think would be useful in your analysis
 

00:59:31.110 --> 00:59:33.830

and so you know at one extreme i would

00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440
and so you know at one extreme i would
 

00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:46.090
and so you know at one extreme i would
put things like you know torture or

00:59:46.090 --> 00:59:46.100
put things like you know torture or
 

00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:48.950

summary executions where there is just

00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960

you know broad public record
 

00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:54.820
you know broad public record
these are wrong and and my hypothesis

00:59:54.820 --> 00:59:54.830
these are wrong and and my hypothesis
 

00:59:54.830 --> 00:59:56.770
these are wrong and and my hypothesis
would be that in those situations on

00:59:56.770 --> 00:59:56.780
would be that in those situations on
 

00:59:56.780 --> 01:00:02.140
would be that in those situations on
treaties matter the least I also would

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:02.150
treaties matter the least I also would
 

01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:06.640
treaties matter the least I also would
guess that treaties matter less when the

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:06.650
guess that treaties matter less when the
 

01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:09.460

right as codified is subject to
 

01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:11.590
right as codified is subject to
interpretation and so if you think take

01:00:11.590 --> 01:00:11.600
interpretation and so if you think take
 

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.060
interpretation and so if you think take
something like the right to freedom of

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:13.070
something like the right to freedom of
 

01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:14.320
something like the right to freedom of

you end up having to debate you know
what is the meaning of this norm in a

what is the meaning of this norm in a
 

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:39.280
what is the meaning of this norm in a

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:39.290
certain context and there again I think
 

01:00:39.290 --> 01:00:41.440
certain context and there again I think
that again it's the public morality that

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:41.450
that again it's the public morality that
 

01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:42.850
that again it's the public morality that
probably matters much more my guess

01:00:42.850 --> 01:00:42.860
probably matters much more my guess
 

01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:45.550
probably matters much more my guess
would be than the treaty itself we're

01:00:45.550 --> 01:00:45.560
would be than the treaty itself we're
 

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.260
would be than the treaty itself we're
ratification i would think matters a lot

01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:47.270
ratification i would think matters a lot
 

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:50.470
ratification i would think matters a lot
is where the norm itself is very

01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:50.480
is where the norm itself is very
 

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:54.550
is where the norm itself is very
contestant and so you know for me I

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:54.560
contestant and so you know for me I
 

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:58.080
contestant and so you know for me I
would look at things like women's rights

01:00:58.080 --> 01:00:58.090
 
 

01:00:58.090 --> 01:01:03.130
 
religious rights sexual rights rights

01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:03.140
religious rights sexual rights rights
 

01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:05.860
religious rights sexual rights rights
where there really is not universal

01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:05.870
where there really is not universal
 

01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:08.920
where there really is not universal
acceptance at the public level so that

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:08.930
acceptance at the public level so that
 

01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:11.470
acceptance at the public level so that
if a government ratifies that's a major

01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:11.480
if a government ratifies that's a major
 

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:15.160
if a government ratifies that's a major
statement and it is sort of settling a

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:15.170
statement and it is sort of settling a
 

01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:18.910
statement and it is sort of settling a
cultural dispute in a way that there's

01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:18.920
cultural dispute in a way that there's
 

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:20.920
cultural dispute in a way that there's
really not a lot too subtle when the

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:20.930
really not a lot too subtle when the
 

01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:26.710
really not a lot too subtle when the
issue is torture so you know I would to

01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:26.720
issue is torture so you know I would to
 

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:31.680
issue is torture so you know I would to
qualify this further I think that the I

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:31.690
qualify this further I think that the I
 

01:01:31.690 --> 01:01:34.450
qualify this further I think that the I
mean to use the sort of the three types

01:01:34.450 --> 01:01:34.460
mean to use the sort of the three types
 

01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:37.690
mean to use the sort of the three types
of effects that you see treaties having

01:01:37.690 --> 01:01:37.700
of effects that you see treaties having
 

01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:39.730
of effects that you see treaties having
her ratification having you know one

01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:39.740
her ratification having you know one
 

01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:43.420

setting the agenda to creating legal

01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:43.430
setting the agenda to creating legal
 

01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:45.580
setting the agenda to creating legal
mechanisms or legal opportunities and

01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:45.590
mechanisms or legal opportunities and
 

01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:48.070
mechanisms or legal opportunities and
three opportunities for social

01:01:48.070 --> 01:01:48.080
three opportunities for social
 

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:51.190
three opportunities for social
mobilization I would think that a

01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200
mobilization I would think that a
 

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:55.090
mobilization I would think that a
ratification matters most with respect

01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:55.100
ratification matters most with respect
 

01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:57.970
ratification matters most with respect
to legal remedies and that's almost by

01:01:57.970 --> 01:01:57.980
to legal remedies and that's almost by
 

01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:59.290
to legal remedies and that's almost by
definition you know that if you are

01:01:59.290 --> 01:01:59.300
definition you know that if you are
 

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:01.270
definition you know that if you are
going to appeal to a court whether it's

01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:01.280
going to appeal to a court whether it's
 

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.740
going to appeal to a court whether it's
a domestic court or for that matter in

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:02.750
a domestic court or for that matter in
 

01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:04.870
a domestic court or for that matter in
international court you know to have

01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:04.880
international court you know to have
 

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.700
international court you know to have
chapter and verse I've actually you know

01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:06.710
chapter and verse I've actually you know
 

01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:09.549
chapter and verse I've actually you know
the treaty legally binding des matter

01:02:09.549 --> 01:02:09.559
the treaty legally binding des matter
 

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:11.349
the treaty legally binding des matter
and so you would expect it to you no

01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:11.359
and so you would expect it to you no
 

01:02:11.359 --> 01:02:14.079
and so you would expect it to you no
matter um you know in the european union

01:02:14.079 --> 01:02:14.089
matter um you know in the european union
 

01:02:14.089 --> 01:02:15.670

or for that matter in Latin America

01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:15.680
or for that matter in Latin America
 

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:16.720
or for that matter in Latin America
where the inter-american Court is

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:16.730
where the inter-american Court is
 

01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:18.490
where the inter-american Court is
increasingly playing a significant role

01:02:18.490 --> 01:02:18.500
increasingly playing a significant role
 

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.499
increasingly playing a significant role
now I recognize that these are also the

01:02:20.499 --> 01:02:20.509
now I recognize that these are also the
 

01:02:20.509 --> 01:02:21.370
now I recognize that these are also the
government's to tend to be more

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:21.380
government's to tend to be more
 

01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:22.720
government's to tend to be more
democratic so there may be other factors

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:22.730
democratic so there may be other factors
 

01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:25.890
democratic so there may be other factors
at play that reduce the significance of

01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:25.900
at play that reduce the significance of
 

01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:28.960
at play that reduce the significance of
having that legally recognized right but

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:28.970
having that legally recognized right but
 

01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:32.140
having that legally recognized right but
you know I think that the you know I do

01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:32.150
you know I think that the you know I do
 

01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:36.039
you know I think that the you know I do
see your thesis having significance

01:02:36.039 --> 01:02:36.049
see your thesis having significance
 

01:02:36.049 --> 01:02:40.329
see your thesis having significance

mobilization what I would you know

01:02:44.829 --> 01:02:44.839
mobilization what I would you know
 

01:02:44.839 --> 01:02:47.019
mobilization what I would you know
suggesting it maybe I couldn't really

01:02:47.019 --> 01:02:47.029
suggesting it maybe I couldn't really
 

01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:49.740
suggesting it maybe I couldn't really
have just not well enough first in the

01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:49.750
have just not well enough first in the
 

01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:52.269
have just not well enough first in the
sort of the mathematical side of this to

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:52.279
sort of the mathematical side of this to
 

01:02:52.279 --> 01:02:54.130
sort of the mathematical side of this to
know what all this meant but I you know

01:02:54.130 --> 01:02:54.140
know what all this meant but I you know
 

01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:55.749
know what all this meant but I you know
and maybe have already sort of tested

01:02:55.749 --> 01:02:55.759
and maybe have already sort of tested
 

01:02:55.759 --> 01:02:58.059
and maybe have already sort of tested
for this but I would when I look through

01:02:58.059 --> 01:02:58.069
for this but I would when I look through
 

01:02:58.069 --> 01:03:00.190
for this but I would when I look through
your list I didn't see it there and and

01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:00.200
your list I didn't see it there and and
 

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.829
your list I didn't see it there and and
that is you know is an alternative

01:03:02.829 --> 01:03:02.839
that is you know is an alternative
 

01:03:02.839 --> 01:03:05.259
that is you know is an alternative
explanation that there is a strong

01:03:05.259 --> 01:03:05.269
explanation that there is a strong
 

01:03:05.269 --> 01:03:08.380
explanation that there is a strong
public norm as opposed to that the

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:08.390
public norm as opposed to that the
 

01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:09.880
public norm as opposed to that the
government is ratified and in this maybe

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:09.890
government is ratified and in this maybe
 

01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:11.620
government is ratified and in this maybe
it's kind of a cause and effect question

01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:11.630
it's kind of a cause and effect question
 

01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:13.870
it's kind of a cause and effect question
I mean has the movement toward

01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:13.880
I mean has the movement toward
 

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:15.519
I mean has the movement toward
ratification at least assuming some

01:03:15.519 --> 01:03:15.529
ratification at least assuming some
 

01:03:15.529 --> 01:03:18.279
ratification at least assuming some
degree of sincerity using your core part

01:03:18.279 --> 01:03:18.289
degree of sincerity using your core part
 

01:03:18.289 --> 01:03:21.370
degree of sincerity using your core part
scheme there is that more product of the

01:03:21.370 --> 01:03:21.380
scheme there is that more product of the
 

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:25.450
scheme there is that more product of the
emergence of norms and and as the put it

01:03:25.450 --> 01:03:25.460
emergence of norms and and as the put it
 

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:28.720
emergence of norms and and as the put it
another way is this the significance

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:28.730
another way is this the significance
 

01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:30.999
another way is this the significance
with respect to behavior is that come

01:03:30.999 --> 01:03:31.009
with respect to behavior is that come
 

01:03:31.009 --> 01:03:32.559
with respect to behavior is that come
more from the existence of the norm or

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:32.569
more from the existence of the norm or
 

01:03:32.569 --> 01:03:35.079
more from the existence of the norm or
from the existence of the treaty and I

01:03:35.079 --> 01:03:35.089
from the existence of the treaty and I
 

01:03:35.089 --> 01:03:37.359
from the existence of the treaty and I
you know I say this because you know

01:03:37.359 --> 01:03:37.369
you know I say this because you know
 

01:03:37.369 --> 01:03:41.049
you know I say this because you know
again I when you look at how the at

01:03:41.049 --> 01:03:41.059
again I when you look at how the at
 

01:03:41.059 --> 01:03:42.039
again I when you look at how the at
least two only begin with the

01:03:42.039 --> 01:03:42.049
least two only begin with the
 

01:03:42.049 --> 01:03:44.049
least two only begin with the
international human rights movement we

01:03:44.049 --> 01:03:44.059
international human rights movement we
 

01:03:44.059 --> 01:03:45.999
international human rights movement we
almost by definition don't use

01:03:45.999 --> 01:03:46.009
almost by definition don't use
 

01:03:46.009 --> 01:03:48.009
almost by definition don't use
litigation you know if there's kind of a

01:03:48.009 --> 01:03:48.019
litigation you know if there's kind of a
 

01:03:48.019 --> 01:03:50.950
litigation you know if there's kind of a
an ACLU the local version of the ACLU

01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:50.960
an ACLU the local version of the ACLU
 

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.779
an ACLU the local version of the ACLU
that can handle the matter we stay away

01:03:52.779 --> 01:03:52.789
that can handle the matter we stay away
 

01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:54.700
that can handle the matter we stay away
I mean groups like Human Rights Watch or

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:54.710
I mean groups like Human Rights Watch or
 

01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:57.089
I mean groups like Human Rights Watch or
amnesty international are basically non

01:03:57.089 --> 01:03:57.099
amnesty international are basically non
 

01:03:57.099 --> 01:04:00.009
amnesty international are basically non
litigation organizations and so you know

01:04:00.009 --> 01:04:00.019
litigation organizations and so you know
 

01:04:00.019 --> 01:04:03.249
litigation organizations and so you know
we use shaming we use you know various

01:04:03.249 --> 01:04:03.259
we use shaming we use you know various
 

01:04:03.259 --> 01:04:04.599
we use shaming we use you know various
forms of pressure from third-party

01:04:04.599 --> 01:04:04.609
forms of pressure from third-party
 

01:04:04.609 --> 01:04:07.599
forms of pressure from third-party
governments and you know for those to

01:04:07.599 --> 01:04:07.609
governments and you know for those to
 

01:04:07.609 --> 01:04:11.230
governments and you know for those to
work my sense is the existence of this

01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:11.240
work my sense is the existence of this
 

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.299
work my sense is the existence of this
norm matters much more than the

01:04:13.299 --> 01:04:13.309
norm matters much more than the
 

01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:14.150
norm matters much more than the
existence of radical

01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160
existence of radical
 

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:17.450
existence of radical
and while you know there is an educative

01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:17.460
and while you know there is an educative
 

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:21.170
and while you know there is an educative
role to ratification again it's just

01:04:21.170 --> 01:04:21.180
role to ratification again it's just
 

01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:22.940
role to ratification again it's just
thinking intuitively my sense is that it

01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:22.950
thinking intuitively my sense is that it
 

01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:25.160
thinking intuitively my sense is that it
matters much less than other factors in

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:25.170
matters much less than other factors in
 

01:04:25.170 --> 01:04:26.870
matters much less than other factors in
terms of building you know public

01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880
terms of building you know public
 

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.490

disapproval of a particular governmental

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:28.500
disapproval of a particular governmental
 

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.680
disapproval of a particular governmental
practice um you know similarly with

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:30.690
practice um you know similarly with
 

01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:32.420
practice um you know similarly with
respect to mobilization if you're

01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:32.430
respect to mobilization if you're
 

01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:36.349
respect to mobilization if you're
mobilizing to well I guess even there's

01:04:36.349 --> 01:04:36.359
mobilizing to well I guess even there's
 

01:04:36.359 --> 01:04:38.240
mobilizing to well I guess even there's
worth dividing mobilization into to sort

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:38.250
worth dividing mobilization into to sort
 

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:39.799
worth dividing mobilization into to sort
into two types I mean on the one end if

01:04:39.799 --> 01:04:39.809
into two types I mean on the one end if
 

01:04:39.809 --> 01:04:43.520
into two types I mean on the one end if
the mobilization is is simply to put

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:43.530
the mobilization is is simply to put
 

01:04:43.530 --> 01:04:44.660
the mobilization is is simply to put
pressure on the governor and get a lot

01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:44.670
pressure on the governor and get a lot
 

01:04:44.670 --> 01:04:47.180
pressure on the governor and get a lot
of people in the streets I actually

01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:47.190
of people in the streets I actually
 

01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:49.670
of people in the streets I actually
don't think either the norm or the legal

01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680
don't think either the norm or the legal
 

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:51.170
don't think either the norm or the legal
right matters that much I mean if you're

01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:51.180
right matters that much I mean if you're
 

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:52.460
right matters that much I mean if you're
succeed in getting enough people on the

01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:52.470
succeed in getting enough people on the
 

01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:54.049
succeed in getting enough people on the
street you'll move the government to

01:04:54.049 --> 01:04:54.059
street you'll move the government to
 

01:04:54.059 --> 01:04:56.750
street you'll move the government to
change his behavior but if the the aim

01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760
change his behavior but if the the aim
 

01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:02.000
change his behavior but if the the aim
is is more of a shaming one then my

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:02.010
is is more of a shaming one then my
 

01:05:02.010 --> 01:05:05.000
is is more of a shaming one then my
sense is that the existence of sort of

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:05.010
sense is that the existence of sort of
 

01:05:05.010 --> 01:05:06.799
sense is that the existence of sort of
some public sense that government should

01:05:06.799 --> 01:05:06.809
some public sense that government should
 

01:05:06.809 --> 01:05:09.950
some public sense that government should
operate a certain way matters more than

01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960
operate a certain way matters more than
 

01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:11.720
operate a certain way matters more than
whether that government has ratified a

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:11.730
whether that government has ratified a
 

01:05:11.730 --> 01:05:13.940
whether that government has ratified a
particular treaty or not and I can't

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:13.950
particular treaty or not and I can't
 

01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:14.990
particular treaty or not and I can't
prove this but this is just kind of

01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:15.000
prove this but this is just kind of
 

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.180
prove this but this is just kind of
intuitively as I look it sort of you

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:17.190
intuitively as I look it sort of you
 

01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:19.160
intuitively as I look it sort of you
know the factors that seem to go into

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:19.170
know the factors that seem to go into
 

01:05:19.170 --> 01:05:20.750
know the factors that seem to go into
both domestic rights and international

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:20.760
both domestic rights and international
 

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:23.480
both domestic rights and international
rights organizations we really are

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:23.490
rights organizations we really are
 

01:05:23.490 --> 01:05:25.339
rights organizations we really are
looking more at areas where a government

01:05:25.339 --> 01:05:25.349
looking more at areas where a government
 

01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:28.789
looking more at areas where a government
it is under some expectation of a

01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799
it is under some expectation of a
 

01:05:28.799 --> 01:05:31.059
it is under some expectation of a
certain behavior quite apart from the

01:05:31.059 --> 01:05:31.069
certain behavior quite apart from the
 

01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:33.079
certain behavior quite apart from the
seeming technicality of whether it's

01:05:33.079 --> 01:05:33.089
seeming technicality of whether it's
 

01:05:33.089 --> 01:05:35.359
seeming technicality of whether it's
ratified or not let me just make one

01:05:35.359 --> 01:05:35.369
ratified or not let me just make one
 

01:05:35.369 --> 01:05:37.250
ratified or not let me just make one
final point about where I think treaties

01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:37.260
final point about where I think treaties
 

01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:41.990
final point about where I think treaties
matter the most and this is not in the

01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000
matter the most and this is not in the
 

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.339
matter the most and this is not in the
case of any of the six treaties that you

01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:43.349
case of any of the six treaties that you
 

01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:45.289
case of any of the six treaties that you
were looking at but where I think

01:05:45.289 --> 01:05:45.299
were looking at but where I think
 

01:05:45.299 --> 01:05:49.010
were looking at but where I think
treaties are most important is where you

01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:49.020
treaties are most important is where you
 

01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:52.010
treaties are most important is where you
already have a treaty but it's ambiguous

01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:52.020
already have a treaty but it's ambiguous
 

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:55.160
already have a treaty but it's ambiguous
as to what's required and so I mean to

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:55.170
as to what's required and so I mean to
 

01:05:55.170 --> 01:05:56.750
as to what's required and so I mean to
give an example which is I realize it

01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:56.760
give an example which is I realize it
 

01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.069
give an example which is I realize it
may be a notch away from what you were

01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079
may be a notch away from what you were
 

01:05:58.079 --> 01:06:00.799
may be a notch away from what you were
looking at but if you take the the

01:06:00.799 --> 01:06:00.809
looking at but if you take the the
 

01:06:00.809 --> 01:06:02.920
looking at but if you take the the
concept of indiscriminate warfare um

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:02.930
concept of indiscriminate warfare um
 

01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:05.450

there is a treaty that prohibits

there is a treaty that prohibits
indiscriminate warfare that's what you

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:08.010
indiscriminate warfare that's what you
 

01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:09.319
indiscriminate warfare that's what you
know the first additional protocols and

international law was able to coexist
with the widespread use of

indiscriminate warfare so sorry you lose
and so in that circumstance what was

01:07:11.790 --> 01:07:11.800
and so in that circumstance what was
 

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:15.830
and so in that circumstance what was
required was a new treaty a treaty that

01:07:15.830 --> 01:07:15.840
required was a new treaty a treaty that
 

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:18.930

that Norm proceeded any treaty it was
 

01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:42.980
that Norm proceeded any treaty it was
from that norm that we were slowly able

01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:42.990
from that norm that we were slowly able
 

01:08:42.990 --> 01:08:44.660
from that norm that we were slowly able
to mobilize civil society and then

01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:44.670
to mobilize civil society and then
 

01:08:44.670 --> 01:08:46.910
to mobilize civil society and then
ultimately governments to adopt a treaty

01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:46.920
ultimately governments to adopt a treaty
 

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:50.000
ultimately governments to adopt a treaty
and that new treaty then have

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:50.010
and that new treaty then have
 

01:08:50.010 --> 01:08:51.620
and that new treaty then have
reinterpreted the broad provisions of

01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:51.630

01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:53.180
reinterpreted the broad provisions of
the the week or more general treaty that

01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:53.190
the the week or more general treaty that
 

01:08:53.190 --> 01:08:55.820
the the week or more general treaty that

that process did government behavior

01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600
that process did government behavior
 

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:01.370
that process did government behavior
change and my sense is that for the most

01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:01.380
change and my sense is that for the most
 

01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:04.550
change and my sense is that for the most
part government behavior it began to

01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560
part government behavior it began to
 

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:07.630
part government behavior it began to
switch with the creation of the norm and

01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:07.640
switch with the creation of the norm and
 

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:11.120
switch with the creation of the norm and
it completely switched by the time we

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:11.130
it completely switched by the time we
 

01:09:11.130 --> 01:09:13.340
it completely switched by the time we
got a treaty but before anybody had

01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:13.350
got a treaty but before anybody had
 

01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:15.770
got a treaty but before anybody had
ratified and so you know at the moment

01:09:15.770 --> 01:09:15.780
ratified and so you know at the moment
 

01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:19.330
ratified and so you know at the moment
that the treaty was adopted um you know

01:09:19.330 --> 01:09:19.340

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:30.050
began to ratify but that it was you know
it was the the norm process and then the

01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:30.060
it was the the norm process and then the
 

01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:32.180
it was the the norm process and then the
kind of the formal process of having a

01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:32.190
kind of the formal process of having a
 

01:09:32.190 --> 01:09:34.880

done and in those circumstances my
 

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:30.350
done and in those circumstances my
hypothesis would be that the norm is

01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:30.360
hypothesis would be that the norm is
 

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:32.810
hypothesis would be that the norm is
more important than the treaty it's all

pick this up so much in the

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:18.550
pick this up so much in the
 

01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:19.919
pick this up so much in the
presentations but in the book she she

01:11:19.919 --> 01:11:19.929
presentations but in the book she she
 

01:11:19.929 --> 01:11:21.899
presentations but in the book she she
she singles out a number of episodes

01:11:21.899 --> 01:11:21.909
she singles out a number of episodes
 

01:11:21.909 --> 01:11:24.899
she singles out a number of episodes
that seem to be innocuous or

01:11:24.899 --> 01:11:24.909
that seem to be innocuous or
 

01:11:24.909 --> 01:11:27.899
that seem to be innocuous or
insignificant and then really looks at

01:11:27.899 --> 01:11:27.909
insignificant and then really looks at
 

01:11:27.909 --> 01:11:29.910
insignificant and then really looks at
some of the long-term downstream effects

01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920
some of the long-term downstream effects
 

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:32.189
some of the long-term downstream effects
that these have for mobilization and so

01:11:32.189 --> 01:11:32.199
that these have for mobilization and so
 

01:11:32.199 --> 01:11:35.220
that these have for mobilization and so
forth so for instance you know 1974 1976

01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:35.230
forth so for instance you know 1974 1976

01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:43.880
Amnesty International but if you are
 

01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:46.089
Amnesty International but if you are
living in the country and trying to

living in the country and trying to
 

01:23:46.099 --> 01:23:49.340
living in the country and trying to
think of a strategy for making demands

01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:49.350
think of a strategy for making demands
 

01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:52.050
think of a strategy for making demands
that's a huge factor to have in your

01:23:52.050 --> 01:23:52.060
that's a huge factor to have in your
 

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:55.530
that's a huge factor to have in your

norms matter it helps to spell things
out and put them in very clear focus I

01:24:00.270 --> 01:24:00.280
out and put them in very clear focus I
 

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:02.970
out and put them in very clear focus I
can think of specific rights that it

01:24:02.970 --> 01:24:02.980
can think of specific rights that it
 

01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:05.010
can think of specific rights that it
would be very hard to sort of coalesce

01:24:05.010 --> 01:24:05.020
would be very hard to sort of coalesce
 

01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:06.870
would be very hard to sort of coalesce
around had it not been in a treaty and

01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:06.880
around had it not been in a treaty and
 

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:08.700
around had it not been in a treaty and
one of the things I can think of for

01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:08.710
one of the things I can think of for
 

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:10.770
one of the things I can think of for
example is that we didn't even talk

01:24:10.770 --> 01:24:10.780
example is that we didn't even talk
 

01:24:10.780 --> 01:24:12.720
example is that we didn't even talk
about women's rights for example in here

01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:12.730
about women's rights for example in here
 

01:24:12.730 --> 01:24:14.880
about women's rights for example in here
but an entire chapter I have deals on

but an entire chapter I have deals on
 

01:24:14.890 --> 01:24:16.410
but an entire chapter I have deals on
that the right woman's right to

01:24:16.410 --> 01:24:16.420
that the right woman's right to
 

01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:19.080
that the right woman's right to

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:22.930
sort of freeform but something's very
 

01:24:22.930 --> 01:24:26.190
sort of freeform but something's very
concrete in a treaty that women for

into their constitution and that again

and that's why to them it's it's very
 

01:25:43.930 --> 01:25:46.140
and that's why to them it's it's very
important to i doin digitize these

important to i doin digitize these
rights and and that's what ratification

01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:49.330
rights and and that's what ratification
 

01:25:49.330 --> 01:25:52.860

and that's again why ratification is

01:25:59.520 --> 01:25:59.530
and that's again why ratification is
 

01:25:59.530 --> 01:26:01.600
and that's again why ratification is
quite important is that it

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:01.610

indicator is possible anything I say is
 

01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:25.300
indicator is possible anything I say is
going to be inadequate but I would say

01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:25.310
going to be inadequate but I would say
 

01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:27.910
going to be inadequate but I would say
that that when they start to tolerate

01:26:27.910 --> 01:26:27.920
that that when they start to tolerate
 

01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:30.700
that that when they start to tolerate
and acknowledge the legitimacy of

opposition is when that door starts to
 

01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:38.080
opposition is when that door starts to
crack open just a little bit which is

01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:38.090
crack open just a little bit which is
 

01:26:38.090 --> 01:26:40.180
crack open just a little bit which is
quickly I mean in terms of but the

01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:40.190
quickly I mean in terms of but the
 

01:26:40.190 --> 01:26:41.830
quickly I mean in terms of but the
argument is sort of spelling out rights

01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840
argument is sort of spelling out rights
 

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:44.680
argument is sort of spelling out rights
I agree that it's important that a right

01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:44.690
I agree that it's important that a right
 

01:26:44.690 --> 01:26:46.900
I agree that it's important that a right
is spelled out in a treaty but that's

01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:46.910
is spelled out in a treaty but that's
 

01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:48.940
is spelled out in a treaty but that's
true whether or not there's ratification

01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:48.950
true whether or not there's ratification
 

01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:51.010
true whether or not there's ratification
and so if you want to know you know what

01:26:51.010 --> 01:26:51.020
and so if you want to know you know what
 

01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:53.140
and so if you want to know you know what
what you know what are women's rights

01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:53.150

ratification isn't critical now where I

01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:00.830
ratification isn't critical now where I
 

01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:02.440

do think you know ratification matters
 

01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:03.970
do think you know ratification matters
as I said I think on something like

01:27:03.970 --> 01:27:03.980
as I said I think on something like
 

01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:07.120
as I said I think on something like
women's rights where they were much more

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:07.130
women's rights where they were much more
 

01:27:07.130 --> 01:27:09.460

behavioral consequences I think it
matters much less in the realm of

01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:19.430
they ratified no government's going to
 

01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:20.800
they ratified no government's going to
sort of claim the right to torture and

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:20.810
sort of claim the right to torture and
 

01:27:20.810 --> 01:27:23.560
sort of claim the right to torture and
so I think that you know I think it

01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:23.570
so I think that you know I think it
 

01:27:23.570 --> 01:27:24.940
so I think that you know I think it
really you almost have to look at the

01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:24.950
really you almost have to look at the
 

01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:27.280
really you almost have to look at the
kind of like that we're talking about in

01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:27.290
kind of like that we're talking about in
 

01:27:27.290 --> 01:27:29.020
kind of like that we're talking about in
terms of assessing the significance of

01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:29.030
terms of assessing the significance of
 

01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:31.600
terms of assessing the significance of
the of the ratification itself I'm Alex

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:31.610
the of the ratification itself I'm Alex
 

01:27:31.610 --> 01:27:33.550
the of the ratification itself I'm Alex
introduce your question when you know

01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:33.560
introduce your question when you know
 

01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:35.080
introduce your question when you know
what you do with the heart authoritarian

01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:35.090
what you do with the heart authoritarian
 

01:27:35.090 --> 01:27:39.550
what you do with the heart authoritarian
governments there I mean I I do think

01:27:39.550 --> 01:27:39.560
governments there I mean I I do think
 

01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:41.560
governments there I mean I I do think
that local pressure ultimately is is

01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:41.570
that local pressure ultimately is is
 

01:27:41.570 --> 01:27:44.110
that local pressure ultimately is is
determinative and so you know if you

01:27:44.110 --> 01:27:44.120
determinative and so you know if you
 

01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:48.190
determinative and so you know if you
don't have civil society you try to do

01:27:48.190 --> 01:27:48.200
don't have civil society you try to do
 

01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:49.720
don't have civil society you try to do
two things I mean you know one is you

01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:49.730
two things I mean you know one is you
 

01:27:49.730 --> 01:27:52.390
two things I mean you know one is you
you gradually try to create space so

01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:52.400
you gradually try to create space so
 

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.070
you gradually try to create space so
they're so local civil society can

01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:54.080
they're so local civil society can
 

01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:56.440
they're so local civil society can
emerge but second you pay much more

01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:56.450
emerge but second you pay much more
 

01:27:56.450 --> 01:27:58.120
emerge but second you pay much more
attention to third-party pressure and

01:27:58.120 --> 01:27:58.130
attention to third-party pressure and
 

01:27:58.130 --> 01:28:00.460
attention to third-party pressure and
indeed one of the major focuses of that

01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:00.470
indeed one of the major focuses of that
 

01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:02.380
indeed one of the major focuses of that
pressure usually is one of two things

01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:02.390
pressure usually is one of two things
 

01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:04.210
pressure usually is one of two things
it's either you know aimed at creating

01:28:04.210 --> 01:28:04.220
it's either you know aimed at creating
 

01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:06.490
it's either you know aimed at creating
that civil society space or it's aimed

01:28:06.490 --> 01:28:06.500
that civil society space or it's aimed
 

01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:07.810
that civil society space or it's aimed
at curtailing the worst kinds of

01:28:07.810 --> 01:28:07.820
at curtailing the worst kinds of
 

01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:10.180
at curtailing the worst kinds of
atrocities well and so for example if

01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:10.190
atrocities well and so for example if
 

01:28:10.190 --> 01:28:12.640
atrocities well and so for example if
you take you know your Central Asia

01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:12.650
you take you know your Central Asia
 

01:28:12.650 --> 01:28:14.770
you take you know your Central Asia
caucuses example I actually don't think

01:28:14.770 --> 01:28:14.780
caucuses example I actually don't think
 

01:28:14.780 --> 01:28:15.380
caucuses example I actually don't think
what they're

01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:15.390
what they're
 

01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:17.750
what they're
objecting to our the you know the

01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:17.760
objecting to our the you know the
 

01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:20.510
objecting to our the you know the
so-called Western norms they at this

01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:20.520
so-called Western norms they at this
 

01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:22.160
so-called Western norms they at this
point they want to be a member of the

01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:22.170
point they want to be a member of the
 

01:28:22.170 --> 01:28:24.350
point they want to be a member of the
OSCE they just don't want the OSCE

01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:24.360
OSCE they just don't want the OSCE
 

01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:26.480
OSCE they just don't want the OSCE
enforcement mechanisms and so they're

01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:26.490
enforcement mechanisms and so they're
 

01:28:26.490 --> 01:28:28.010
enforcement mechanisms and so they're
not challenging the standards right now

01:28:28.010 --> 01:28:28.020
not challenging the standards right now
 

01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:29.330
not challenging the standards right now
they're challenging things like

01:28:29.330 --> 01:28:29.340
they're challenging things like
 

01:28:29.340 --> 01:28:31.700
they're challenging things like
deploying police monitors or deploying

01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:31.710
deploying police monitors or deploying
 

01:28:31.710 --> 01:28:34.100
deploying police monitors or deploying
investigative teams and and that's you

01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:34.110
investigative teams and and that's you
 

01:28:34.110 --> 01:28:36.050
investigative teams and and that's you
know that's that's that's enforcement

01:28:36.050 --> 01:28:36.060
know that's that's that's enforcement
 

01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:40.430
know that's that's that's enforcement
that's not the norm itself ok so we're

01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:40.440
that's not the norm itself ok so we're
 

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:43.550
that's not the norm itself ok so we're
close to our advertising ending time but

01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:43.560
close to our advertising ending time but
 

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:46.730
close to our advertising ending time but
we will take a couple of questions if

01:28:46.730 --> 01:28:46.740
we will take a couple of questions if
 

01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:48.830
we will take a couple of questions if
you have them and please stand at the

01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:48.840
you have them and please stand at the
 

01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:56.550
you have them and please stand at the
mic

01:28:56.550 --> 01:28:56.560

there are different situations I mean
 

01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:22.830
there are different situations I mean
those who are who ratified because they

01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:22.840
those who are who ratified because they
 

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:28.850
those who are who ratified because they
are misinformed or because they are

01:29:28.850 --> 01:29:28.860
 
 

01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:35.040

cynically so it's not nothing of those

01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:16.270
cynically so it's not nothing of those
 

01:30:16.270 --> 01:30:22.110
cynically so it's not nothing of those
situations you described and yeah what

01:30:22.110 --> 01:30:22.120
situations you described and yeah what
 

01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:24.570
situations you described and yeah what
is the impact of double standards on

01:30:24.570 --> 01:30:24.580
is the impact of double standards on
 

01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:31.140
is the impact of double standards on
your on your scheme the world is rife

01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:31.150
your on your scheme the world is rife
 

01:30:31.150 --> 01:30:32.880
your on your scheme the world is rife
with double standards they are

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:32.890
with double standards they are
 

01:30:32.890 --> 01:30:36.450
with double standards they are
everywhere they are in particular among

01:30:36.450 --> 01:30:36.460
everywhere they are in particular among
 

01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:40.500
everywhere they are in particular among
the false negatives and especially among

01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:40.510
the false negatives and especially among
 

01:30:40.510 --> 01:30:42.180
the false negatives and especially among
the dog's paws talk is the fourth

01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:42.190
the dog's paws talk is the fourth
 

01:30:42.190 --> 01:30:44.400
the dog's paws talk is the fourth
positive so what do we so your question

01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:44.410
positive so what do we so your question
 

01:30:44.410 --> 01:30:46.460
positive so what do we so your question
is what do we do about double standards

01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:46.470
is what do we do about double standards
 

01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:49.560
is what do we do about double standards
right or what do know what is the impact

01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:49.570
right or what do know what is the impact
 

01:30:49.570 --> 01:30:51.660
right or what do know what is the impact
of double standards on false positives

01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:51.670
of double standards on false positives
 

01:30:51.670 --> 01:30:54.440
of double standards on false positives
and then the consequence on mobile

01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:54.450
and then the consequence on mobile
 

01:30:54.450 --> 01:30:56.760
and then the consequence on mobile
mobilizing the US game long sorry are

01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:56.770
mobilizing the US game long sorry are
 

01:30:56.770 --> 01:30:58.170
mobilizing the US game long sorry are
you asking that the double standards

01:30:58.170 --> 01:30:58.180
you asking that the double standards
 

01:30:58.180 --> 01:30:59.850
you asking that the double standards
like in the United States with respect

01:30:59.850 --> 01:30:59.860
like in the United States with respect
 

01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:01.980
like in the United States with respect
to human right yeah a strong strong

01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:01.990
to human right yeah a strong strong
 

01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:04.950
to human right yeah a strong strong
player has a double standard and then

01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960
player has a double standard and then
 

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:06.930
player has a double standard and then
you have a country where the government

01:31:06.930 --> 01:31:06.940
you have a country where the government
 

01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:09.520
you have a country where the government
ratifies because yeah it

01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:09.530
ratifies because yeah it
 

01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:11.380
ratifies because yeah it
knows that there is a double standard so

01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:11.390
knows that there is a double standard so
 

01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:14.830
knows that there is a double standard so
it doesn't care it is cynical and and

01:31:14.830 --> 01:31:14.840
it doesn't care it is cynical and and
 

01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:17.920
it doesn't care it is cynical and and
then the consequence of mobilizing local

01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:17.930
then the consequence of mobilizing local
 

01:31:17.930 --> 01:31:19.690
then the consequence of mobilizing local
people because those local people they

01:31:19.690 --> 01:31:19.700
people because those local people they
 

01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:21.340
people because those local people they
are of course so sufficiently

01:31:21.340 --> 01:31:21.350
are of course so sufficiently
 

01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:23.860
are of course so sufficiently
sophisticated to understand what

01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:23.870
sophisticated to understand what
 

01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:25.740
sophisticated to understand what
ratification means in this particular

01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:25.750
ratification means in this particular
 

01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:29.530
ratification means in this particular
context I mean I wouldn't stand up on

01:31:29.530 --> 01:31:29.540
context I mean I wouldn't stand up on
 

01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:33.820
context I mean I wouldn't stand up on
the peanut chat regime as it was during

01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:33.830
the peanut chat regime as it was during
 

01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:35.470
the peanut chat regime as it was during
the time of ratification of the

01:31:35.470 --> 01:31:35.480
the time of ratification of the
 

01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:37.480
the time of ratification of the
convention well a lot of people did

01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:37.490
convention well a lot of people did
 

01:31:37.490 --> 01:31:40.480
convention well a lot of people did
actually though what was the interested

01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:40.490
actually though what was the interested
 

01:31:40.490 --> 01:31:43.830
actually though what was the interested
but the effect of double standards is to

01:31:43.830 --> 01:31:43.840
but the effect of double standards is to
 

01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:47.680
but the effect of double standards is to
create a sort of expectation that

01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:47.690
create a sort of expectation that
 

01:31:47.690 --> 01:31:49.330
create a sort of expectation that
nothing will be done and so it actually

01:31:49.330 --> 01:31:49.340
nothing will be done and so it actually
 

01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:53.070
nothing will be done and so it actually
allows for the potential of more false

01:31:53.070 --> 01:31:53.080
allows for the potential of more false
 

01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:56.170
allows for the potential of more false
positives and this is precisely what we

01:31:56.170 --> 01:31:56.180
positives and this is precisely what we
 

01:31:56.180 --> 01:31:58.660
positives and this is precisely what we
saw in the earlier years of many of

01:31:58.660 --> 01:31:58.670
saw in the earlier years of many of
 

01:31:58.670 --> 01:32:00.850
saw in the earlier years of many of
these treaties so like in the 70's 1980s

01:32:00.850 --> 01:32:00.860
these treaties so like in the 70's 1980s
 

01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:03.820
these treaties so like in the 70's 1980s
when we were a period in which the Cold

01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:03.830
when we were a period in which the Cold
 

01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:06.520
when we were a period in which the Cold
War for example convinced a lot of

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:06.530
War for example convinced a lot of
 

01:32:06.530 --> 01:32:08.200
War for example convinced a lot of
countries that we're buddies with the

01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:08.210
countries that we're buddies with the
 

01:32:08.210 --> 01:32:12.040
countries that we're buddies with the
United States we can ratify they're not

01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:12.050
United States we can ratify they're not
 

01:32:12.050 --> 01:32:14.260
United States we can ratify they're not
going to do anything to us despite the

01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:14.270
going to do anything to us despite the
 

01:32:14.270 --> 01:32:15.760
going to do anything to us despite the
fact that they demand you knows our

01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:15.770
fact that they demand you knows our
 

01:32:15.770 --> 01:32:17.680
fact that they demand you knows our
human rights standards in there I see

01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:17.690
human rights standards in there I see
 

01:32:17.690 --> 01:32:19.150
human rights standards in there I see
it's not going to come down on us they

01:32:19.150 --> 01:32:19.160
it's not going to come down on us they
 

01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:20.890
it's not going to come down on us they
need a strategically and everything else

01:32:20.890 --> 01:32:20.900
need a strategically and everything else
 

01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:23.470
need a strategically and everything else
where their allies and I think that is a

01:32:23.470 --> 01:32:23.480
where their allies and I think that is a
 

01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:25.900
where their allies and I think that is a
kind of condition that has led to a

01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:25.910
kind of condition that has led to a
 

01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:28.480
kind of condition that has led to a
period in which a number of countries

01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:28.490
period in which a number of countries
 

01:32:28.490 --> 01:32:31.600
period in which a number of countries
ratified just two for the short-term

01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:31.610
ratified just two for the short-term
 

01:32:31.610 --> 01:32:34.390
ratified just two for the short-term
gains involved and it turns out that

01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400
gains involved and it turns out that
 

01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:37.210
gains involved and it turns out that
this you know it doesn't stand for long

01:32:37.210 --> 01:32:37.220
this you know it doesn't stand for long
 

01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:38.380
this you know it doesn't stand for long
because the international rights

01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:38.390
because the international rights
 

01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:41.200
because the international rights
community ends up exposing the fact that

01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:41.210
community ends up exposing the fact that
 

01:32:41.210 --> 01:32:43.990
community ends up exposing the fact that
there's a double standard there but it

01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:44.000
there's a double standard there but it
 

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.910
there's a double standard there but it
does open up this expectation that maybe

01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920
does open up this expectation that maybe
 

01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:49.090
does open up this expectation that maybe
I can get away with it by the last point

01:32:49.090 --> 01:32:49.100
I can get away with it by the last point
 

01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:51.780
I can get away with it by the last point
I was intrigued was costly law actually

01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:51.790
I was intrigued was costly law actually
 

01:32:51.790 --> 01:32:54.490
I was intrigued was costly law actually
customary law the effect of customary

01:32:54.490 --> 01:32:54.500
customary law the effect of customary
 

01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:58.120
customary law the effect of customary
law I mean let's take a Rome Statute for

01:32:58.120 --> 01:32:58.130
law I mean let's take a Rome Statute for
 

01:32:58.130 --> 01:33:01.210
law I mean let's take a Rome Statute for
example I mean most of the contents of

01:33:01.210 --> 01:33:01.220
example I mean most of the contents of
 

01:33:01.220 --> 01:33:03.820
example I mean most of the contents of
the Rome Statute are customary law so if

01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:03.830
the Rome Statute are customary law so if
 

01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:05.920
the Rome Statute are customary law so if
I ratify as a government and

01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:05.930
I ratify as a government and
 

01:33:05.930 --> 01:33:10.690
I ratify as a government and
authoritarian it's kind of fatalism also

01:33:10.690 --> 01:33:10.700
authoritarian it's kind of fatalism also
 

01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:13.150
authoritarian it's kind of fatalism also
because I have any way no choice whether

01:33:13.150 --> 01:33:13.160
because I have any way no choice whether
 

01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:16.600
because I have any way no choice whether
I ratify or not the law will apply one

01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:16.610
I ratify or not the law will apply one
 

01:33:16.610 --> 01:33:18.959
I ratify or not the law will apply one
day if I'm thinking

01:33:18.959 --> 01:33:18.969
day if I'm thinking
 

01:33:18.969 --> 01:33:21.220
day if I'm thinking
the rome statute is a sort of a

01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:21.230
the rome statute is a sort of a
 

01:33:21.230 --> 01:33:23.049
the rome statute is a sort of a
different case because it doesn't

01:33:23.049 --> 01:33:23.059
different case because it doesn't
 

01:33:23.059 --> 01:33:25.689
different case because it doesn't
require mobilization domestically or

01:33:25.689 --> 01:33:25.699
require mobilization domestically or
 

01:33:25.699 --> 01:33:28.299
require mobilization domestically or
anything else to really have some kind

01:33:28.299 --> 01:33:28.309
anything else to really have some kind
 

01:33:28.309 --> 01:33:30.549
anything else to really have some kind
of an enforcement power so what I'm

01:33:30.549 --> 01:33:30.559
of an enforcement power so what I'm
 

01:33:30.559 --> 01:33:33.430
of an enforcement power so what I'm
talking about our treaties in which the

01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:33.440
talking about our treaties in which the
 

01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:35.649
talking about our treaties in which the
most likely mechanism for their

01:33:35.649 --> 01:33:35.659
most likely mechanism for their
 

01:33:35.659 --> 01:33:37.120
most likely mechanism for their
enforcement is likely to be on the

01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:37.130
enforcement is likely to be on the
 

01:33:37.130 --> 01:33:39.370
enforcement is likely to be on the
ground in the domestic context

01:33:39.370 --> 01:33:39.380
ground in the domestic context
 

01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:41.020
ground in the domestic context
enforcement at the domestic level the

01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:41.030
enforcement at the domestic level the
 

01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:42.780
enforcement at the domestic level the
Roman statutes quite the opposite

01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:42.790
Roman statutes quite the opposite
 

01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:45.069
Roman statutes quite the opposite
enforcement is precisely external in

01:33:45.069 --> 01:33:45.079
enforcement is precisely external in
 

01:33:45.079 --> 01:33:46.899
enforcement is precisely external in
that case except if you take into

01:33:46.899 --> 01:33:46.909
that case except if you take into
 

01:33:46.909 --> 01:33:48.780
that case except if you take into
account of course the the

01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:48.790
account of course the the
 

01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:50.799
account of course the the
complementarity provisions of the Rome

01:33:50.799 --> 01:33:50.809
complementarity provisions of the Rome
 

01:33:50.809 --> 01:33:54.879
complementarity provisions of the Rome
Statute thank you so let's collect both

01:33:54.879 --> 01:33:54.889
Statute thank you so let's collect both
 

01:33:54.889 --> 01:33:58.000
Statute thank you so let's collect both
of the last questions and respond to

01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:58.010
of the last questions and respond to
 

01:33:58.010 --> 01:34:01.359
of the last questions and respond to
them together thank you for a

01:34:01.359 --> 01:34:01.369
them together thank you for a
 

01:34:01.369 --> 01:34:04.209
them together thank you for a
stimulating discussion um I want to ask

01:34:04.209 --> 01:34:04.219
stimulating discussion um I want to ask
 

01:34:04.219 --> 01:34:06.490
stimulating discussion um I want to ask
you about perhaps a more enigmatic

01:34:06.490 --> 01:34:06.500
you about perhaps a more enigmatic
 

01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:09.549
you about perhaps a more enigmatic
example that the case of Russia which I

01:34:09.549 --> 01:34:09.559
example that the case of Russia which I
 

01:34:09.559 --> 01:34:11.709
example that the case of Russia which I
have some personal experience with and

01:34:11.709 --> 01:34:11.719
have some personal experience with and
 

01:34:11.719 --> 01:34:13.060
have some personal experience with and
it's not a treaty that you covered but

01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:13.070
it's not a treaty that you covered but
 

01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:15.069
it's not a treaty that you covered but
the example of the European Convention

01:34:15.069 --> 01:34:15.079
the example of the European Convention
 

01:34:15.079 --> 01:34:18.310
the example of the European Convention
on Human Rights I think that it would be

01:34:18.310 --> 01:34:18.320
on Human Rights I think that it would be
 

01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:20.680
on Human Rights I think that it would be
we could make the case that when Russia

01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:20.690
we could make the case that when Russia
 

01:34:20.690 --> 01:34:22.689
we could make the case that when Russia
ratify this treaty with sincere rata

01:34:22.689 --> 01:34:22.699
ratify this treaty with sincere rata
 

01:34:22.699 --> 01:34:27.729
ratify this treaty with sincere rata
fire but that may have changed at the

01:34:27.729 --> 01:34:27.739
fire but that may have changed at the
 

01:34:27.739 --> 01:34:29.620
fire but that may have changed at the
same time there is sort of a very

01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:29.630
same time there is sort of a very
 

01:34:29.630 --> 01:34:31.000
same time there is sort of a very
dedicated community in Russia that's

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:31.010
dedicated community in Russia that's
 

01:34:31.010 --> 01:34:33.520
dedicated community in Russia that's
highly mobilized behind the rights that

01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:33.530
highly mobilized behind the rights that
 

01:34:33.530 --> 01:34:37.299
highly mobilized behind the rights that
this convention bodies but it's a very

01:34:37.299 --> 01:34:37.309
this convention bodies but it's a very
 

01:34:37.309 --> 01:34:39.459
this convention bodies but it's a very
small but highly mobilize communion with

01:34:39.459 --> 01:34:39.469
small but highly mobilize communion with
 

01:34:39.469 --> 01:34:41.399
small but highly mobilize communion with
in the country and so my question is

01:34:41.399 --> 01:34:41.409
in the country and so my question is
 

01:34:41.409 --> 01:34:44.020
in the country and so my question is
more in a different position now and the

01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:44.030
more in a different position now and the
 

01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:46.089
more in a different position now and the
sincerity of Russia with respect to

01:34:46.089 --> 01:34:46.099
sincerity of Russia with respect to
 

01:34:46.099 --> 01:34:47.709
sincerity of Russia with respect to
these obligations is it's much more in

01:34:47.709 --> 01:34:47.719
these obligations is it's much more in
 

01:34:47.719 --> 01:34:49.930
these obligations is it's much more in
question and so I was wondering if you

01:34:49.930 --> 01:34:49.940
question and so I was wondering if you
 

01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:52.600
question and so I was wondering if you
had sort of any understanding with your

01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:52.610
had sort of any understanding with your
 

01:34:52.610 --> 01:34:55.060
had sort of any understanding with your
model of how to understand which way the

01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:55.070
model of how to understand which way the
 

01:34:55.070 --> 01:34:57.250
model of how to understand which way the

it will call into a raise a question
 

01:36:18.780 --> 01:36:23.090
it will call into a raise a question
whether how particles science come deal

you prove the public opinion is more
 

01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:46.070
you prove the public opinion is more
important than treaty and my question to

01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080
important than treaty and my question to

01:36:57.570 --> 01:37:01.790
 
okay well I let's just I guess start

01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:01.800
okay well I let's just I guess start
 

01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:05.149
okay well I let's just I guess start
with a question of Russia and you know

01:37:05.149 --> 01:37:05.159
with a question of Russia and you know
 

01:37:05.159 --> 01:37:08.720
with a question of Russia and you know
here the issue is sort of thinking about

01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:08.730
here the issue is sort of thinking about
 

01:37:08.730 --> 01:37:12.020
here the issue is sort of thinking about
Russia you know involved in various

01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:12.030
Russia you know involved in various
 

01:37:12.030 --> 01:37:14.030
Russia you know involved in various
kinds of political and regime change

01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:14.040
kinds of political and regime change
 

01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:16.729
kinds of political and regime change
that would make it a sort of no longer

01:37:16.729 --> 01:37:16.739
that would make it a sort of no longer
 

01:37:16.739 --> 01:37:19.010
that would make it a sort of no longer
interested in being held to its

01:37:19.010 --> 01:37:19.020
interested in being held to its
 

01:37:19.020 --> 01:37:21.560
interested in being held to its
ratification obligations that maybe at

01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:21.570
ratification obligations that maybe at
 

01:37:21.570 --> 01:37:23.839
ratification obligations that maybe at
one point it was a sincere rata fire and

01:37:23.839 --> 01:37:23.849
one point it was a sincere rata fire and
 

01:37:23.849 --> 01:37:27.620
one point it was a sincere rata fire and
now it no no longer is and you know that

01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:27.630
now it no no longer is and you know that
 

01:37:27.630 --> 01:37:30.859
now it no no longer is and you know that
that many of these regimes are still in

01:37:30.859 --> 01:37:30.869
that many of these regimes are still in
 

01:37:30.869 --> 01:37:33.080
that many of these regimes are still in
flux when I sort of say who the sincere

01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:33.090
flux when I sort of say who the sincere
 

01:37:33.090 --> 01:37:35.450
flux when I sort of say who the sincere
rata fires are and since your nan rata

01:37:35.450 --> 01:37:35.460
rata fires are and since your nan rata
 

01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:37.129
rata fires are and since your nan rata
fires that's at the time of ratification

01:37:37.129 --> 01:37:37.139
fires that's at the time of ratification
 

01:37:37.139 --> 01:37:39.470
fires that's at the time of ratification
basically there is nothing in these

01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:39.480
basically there is nothing in these
 

01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:40.669
basically there is nothing in these
treaties it's going to prevent

01:37:40.669 --> 01:37:40.679
treaties it's going to prevent
 

01:37:40.679 --> 01:37:43.669
treaties it's going to prevent
underlying political change I mean if we

01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679
underlying political change I mean if we
 

01:37:43.679 --> 01:37:45.290
underlying political change I mean if we
think that's going to happen it's not

01:37:45.290 --> 01:37:45.300
think that's going to happen it's not
 

01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:47.839
think that's going to happen it's not
it's it's the kind of thing in which

01:37:47.839 --> 01:37:47.849
it's it's the kind of thing in which
 

01:37:47.849 --> 01:37:50.359
it's it's the kind of thing in which
these treaties could at a minimum I

01:37:50.359 --> 01:37:50.369
these treaties could at a minimum I
 

01:37:50.369 --> 01:37:53.629
these treaties could at a minimum I
think and maybe even at a maximum prove

01:37:53.629 --> 01:37:53.639
think and maybe even at a maximum prove
 

01:37:53.639 --> 01:37:58.129
think and maybe even at a maximum prove
useful to make a case or a claim that

01:37:58.129 --> 01:37:58.139
useful to make a case or a claim that
 

01:37:58.139 --> 01:38:01.220
useful to make a case or a claim that
despite important you know regime

01:38:01.220 --> 01:38:01.230
despite important you know regime
 

01:38:01.230 --> 01:38:02.959
despite important you know regime
changes in political changes that

01:38:02.959 --> 01:38:02.969
changes in political changes that
 

01:38:02.969 --> 01:38:05.510
changes in political changes that
nonetheless it's in it's important to

01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520
nonetheless it's in it's important to
 

01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:07.790
nonetheless it's in it's important to
try to live up to these obligations and

01:38:07.790 --> 01:38:07.800
try to live up to these obligations and
 

01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:10.609
try to live up to these obligations and
I would expect completely that as a sort

01:38:10.609 --> 01:38:10.619
I would expect completely that as a sort
 

01:38:10.619 --> 01:38:13.609
I would expect completely that as a sort
of other indicators of democracy and

01:38:13.609 --> 01:38:13.619
of other indicators of democracy and
 

01:38:13.619 --> 01:38:15.169
of other indicators of democracy and
rule of law begin to send a great that

01:38:15.169 --> 01:38:15.179
rule of law begin to send a great that
 

01:38:15.179 --> 01:38:18.410
rule of law begin to send a great that
the obligation to to live up to a treaty

01:38:18.410 --> 01:38:18.420
the obligation to to live up to a treaty
 

01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:21.399
the obligation to to live up to a treaty
obligation would as well so all of the

01:38:21.399 --> 01:38:21.409
obligation would as well so all of the
 

01:38:21.409 --> 01:38:24.500
obligation would as well so all of the
all of the models that I look at like

01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:24.510
all of the models that I look at like
 

01:38:24.510 --> 01:38:26.629
all of the models that I look at like
control for the level of democracy for

01:38:26.629 --> 01:38:26.639
control for the level of democracy for
 

01:38:26.639 --> 01:38:28.760
control for the level of democracy for
example and control for things like

01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:28.770
example and control for things like
 

01:38:28.770 --> 01:38:30.410
example and control for things like
Civil War which is not the Russian

01:38:30.410 --> 01:38:30.420
Civil War which is not the Russian
 

01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:32.660
Civil War which is not the Russian
situation at all but control for other

01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:32.670
situation at all but control for other
 

01:38:32.670 --> 01:38:34.640
situation at all but control for other
kinds of facts you know conditions that

01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:34.650
kinds of facts you know conditions that
 

01:38:34.650 --> 01:38:37.160
kinds of facts you know conditions that
we know affect human rights because I

01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:37.170
we know affect human rights because I
 

01:38:37.170 --> 01:38:38.930
we know affect human rights because I
don't think we can expect magic out of

01:38:38.930 --> 01:38:38.940
don't think we can expect magic out of
 

01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:41.240
don't think we can expect magic out of
these treaties there the European

01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:41.250
these treaties there the European
 

01:38:41.250 --> 01:38:42.890
these treaties there the European
Convention is not going to prove magic

01:38:42.890 --> 01:38:42.900
Convention is not going to prove magic
 

01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:45.229
Convention is not going to prove magic
in Russia any more than these treaties

01:38:45.229 --> 01:38:45.239
in Russia any more than these treaties
 

01:38:45.239 --> 01:38:47.780
in Russia any more than these treaties
do it in any other circumstance what I'm

01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:47.790
do it in any other circumstance what I'm
 

01:38:47.790 --> 01:38:49.069
do it in any other circumstance what I'm
trying to argue is that they proved

01:38:49.069 --> 01:38:49.079
trying to argue is that they proved
 

01:38:49.079 --> 01:38:51.830
trying to argue is that they proved
useful for those who want to try to

01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840
useful for those who want to try to
 

01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:53.720
useful for those who want to try to
press their rights and I would imagine

01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:53.730
press their rights and I would imagine
 

01:38:53.730 --> 01:38:56.660
press their rights and I would imagine
that in the Russian case the locals

01:38:56.660 --> 01:38:56.670
that in the Russian case the locals
 

01:38:56.670 --> 01:38:58.370
that in the Russian case the locals
would make as much use as they possibly

01:38:58.370 --> 01:38:58.380
would make as much use as they possibly
 

01:38:58.380 --> 01:39:01.100
would make as much use as they possibly
could make out of the European invention

01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:01.110
could make out of the European invention
 

01:39:01.110 --> 01:39:03.140
could make out of the European invention
and at the margins it will help that I

01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:03.150
and at the margins it will help that I
 

01:39:03.150 --> 01:39:05.680
and at the margins it will help that I
won't reverse you know sort of broadly

01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:05.690
won't reverse you know sort of broadly
 

01:39:05.690 --> 01:39:08.060
won't reverse you know sort of broadly
deteriorating trends in Russia that is

01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:08.070
deteriorating trends in Russia that is
 

01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:10.030
deteriorating trends in Russia that is
that is to imagine way to lunch

01:39:10.030 --> 01:39:10.040
that is to imagine way to lunch
 

01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:11.590
that is to imagine way to lunch
in terms of the power of treaties I

01:39:11.590 --> 01:39:11.600
in terms of the power of treaties I
 

01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:13.930
in terms of the power of treaties I
don't have an answer to local

01:39:13.930 --> 01:39:13.940
don't have an answer to local
 

01:39:13.940 --> 01:39:15.970
don't have an answer to local
legislation in cities of course I don't

01:39:15.970 --> 01:39:15.980
legislation in cities of course I don't
 

01:39:15.980 --> 01:39:18.430
legislation in cities of course I don't
have any data on this one can imagine a

01:39:18.430 --> 01:39:18.440
have any data on this one can imagine a
 

01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:20.470
have any data on this one can imagine a
completely different kind of a research

01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480
completely different kind of a research
 

01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:22.900
completely different kind of a research
project in which the unit of analysis

01:39:22.900 --> 01:39:22.910
project in which the unit of analysis
 

01:39:22.910 --> 01:39:25.600
project in which the unit of analysis
was the city instead of the country and

01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:25.610
was the city instead of the country and
 

01:39:25.610 --> 01:39:27.400
was the city instead of the country and
to look to see whether some of these

01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:27.410
to look to see whether some of these
 

01:39:27.410 --> 01:39:29.470
to look to see whether some of these
ordinances about discrimination and

01:39:29.470 --> 01:39:29.480
ordinances about discrimination and
 

01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:31.720
ordinances about discrimination and
minimum wage have some kind of local

01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:31.730
minimum wage have some kind of local
 

01:39:31.730 --> 01:39:33.670
minimum wage have some kind of local
impact there would be a different kind

01:39:33.670 --> 01:39:33.680
impact there would be a different kind
 

01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:36.850
impact there would be a different kind
of a research focus but you could

01:39:36.850 --> 01:39:36.860
of a research focus but you could
 

01:39:36.860 --> 01:39:39.510
of a research focus but you could
imagine using some of the same kinds of

01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:39.520
imagine using some of the same kinds of
 

01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:42.960
imagine using some of the same kinds of
same kinds of sort of theoretical

01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:42.970
same kinds of sort of theoretical
 

01:39:42.970 --> 01:39:45.760
same kinds of sort of theoretical
accounts that I've used at the national

01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:45.770
accounts that I've used at the national
 

01:39:45.770 --> 01:39:47.440
accounts that I've used at the national
level so you'd expect those who want a

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:47.450
level so you'd expect those who want a
 

01:39:47.450 --> 01:39:50.200
level so you'd expect those who want a
minimum wage to wave around the the

01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:50.210
minimum wage to wave around the the
 

01:39:50.210 --> 01:39:51.820
minimum wage to wave around the the

would be very useful to have a very
 

01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:10.900
would be very useful to have a very
explicit commitment on the part of the

opinion hard to codify so the issue here
is that you know sort of how do we

01:40:25.750 --> 01:40:25.760
is that you know sort of how do we
 

01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:28.060
is that you know sort of how do we
handle this sort of issue that you know

01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:28.070
handle this sort of issue that you know
 

01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:32.380

it's a little hard to explain my results

01:40:39.310 --> 01:40:39.320
it's a little hard to explain my results
 

01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:42.310
it's a little hard to explain my results
if that's the case because the treatment

01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:42.320

ratification so it sort of flies in the
 

01:40:51.140 --> 01:40:55.440

use that before and after treaty

01:40:58.210 --> 01:40:58.220
use that before and after treaty
 

01:40:58.220 --> 01:41:00.610
use that before and after treaty
ratification if we think that it's

01:41:00.610 --> 01:41:00.620
ratification if we think that it's
 

01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:03.070

something much broader like public

01:41:03.070 --> 01:41:03.080
something much broader like public
 

01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:05.200
something much broader like public

the field to know I would urge sort of a

01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:16.050
the field to know I would urge sort of a
 

01:42:16.050 --> 01:42:18.800
the field to know I would urge sort of a
more systematic anecdotal approach that

01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:18.810
more systematic anecdotal approach that
 

01:42:18.810 --> 01:42:21.890
more systematic anecdotal approach that
is to say I think the way to to kind of

01:42:21.890 --> 01:42:21.900
is to say I think the way to to kind of
 

01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:26.090
is to say I think the way to to kind of
get at these issues is to look at a

01:42:26.090 --> 01:42:26.100
get at these issues is to look at a
 

01:42:26.100 --> 01:42:28.729
get at these issues is to look at a
series of country situations and talk to

01:42:28.729 --> 01:42:28.739
series of country situations and talk to
 

01:42:28.739 --> 01:42:30.110
series of country situations and talk to
people who have been through the

01:42:30.110 --> 01:42:30.120
people who have been through the
 

01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:32.540
people who have been through the
evolution and ask them what their

01:42:32.540 --> 01:42:32.550
evolution and ask them what their
 

01:42:32.550 --> 01:42:35.860

systematic look at different additives I
 

01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:44.570
systematic look at different additives I
mean just you know to pick one example

01:42:44.570 --> 01:42:44.580
