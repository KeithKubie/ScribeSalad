00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.220
To do this, I'll first add a new variable. I'll call

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.130
it friends2 for now. Now in the constructor, I need to

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.990
initialize friends2, and there's that error. I needed to import it.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.720
So far so good. Now I'll fix addfriend. I'll add the friend

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.650
to both of the lists that I'm keeping track of right

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.990
now. I tried to add the whole friend instead of just the

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.670
name. Much better. Let's see if the tests are still passing.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.120
Person tester. Looks like things are matching, so I'll go to getfriends.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.240
Instead of using friends, I want to use friends2, but friends2

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.390
is an array list, so I need to get a string

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.330
representation of it. But toString returns brackets around what I

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.230
want, so I'll need to remove the brackets using substring. I'll

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.950
put it in a variable, and now I'll return substring,

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.850
starting with the second character and stopping before the last character.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.450
Let's see if the tests still pass. Looks like everything

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.000
is still matching, except that there's a trailing comma right here.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.370
But that's the getfriend method, so I'll come back to

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.270
that. And now for the especially satisfying one. I'll get to

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.420
delete all of this code and replace it with one line.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.430
I'll get the element of the ArrayList at friendIndex, and now

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.130
everything is actually matching what we wanted it to. But

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.170
I need to clean up my extra unused variables. I still

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.550
have this private String friends, and I'm not using it anywhere,

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.800
or at least I shouldn't be. So I'll delete it there,

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.840
and here, and here, and I think that's all of it.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.210
But now friends2 has a sort of silly name. So I

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.860
just want to change friends2 to be friends. So I'll use find

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.150
replace and replace all of the occurences. Creating an extra variable

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.620
might have looked like extra work, and if you didn't do

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.400
all of that, that's fine. I did it to show you

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.650
how you might approach a much larger refactoring. Sometimes when you're

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.520
working on a very big refactoring, it's good to make sure

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.910
that everything still works at each intermediate stage. You'll learn more

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.560
about that if you take a job as a software engineer.
