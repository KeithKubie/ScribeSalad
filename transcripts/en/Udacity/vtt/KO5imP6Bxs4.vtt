00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.300
This staircase is steeper,

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.900
it will be much more difficult
to climb this staircase.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.630
We're actually seeing here when you see
a staircase with a greater steepness

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.650
than this one is a staircase
with a larger slope.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.350
But we're mathematicians, it's not
enough to know that this one is steeper

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.940
than this one,
we want to know by how much.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.080
We want to put a number to
this thing we call a slope.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.300
The definition of slope is
that it's the vertical change

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.540
divided by the horizontal change.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.170
Or a good way to remember this is that
it's the rise divided by the run,

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.930
and we'll talk a little
bit about what this means.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.440
For example, let's look at this
set of stairs, and let's say that

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.170
they have a vertical change,
the height we could say of 5 feet.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.330
They also have a horizontal
change which is also 5 feet.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.030
This staircase, on the other hand,
has a vertical change of 10 feet but

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.060
also has a horizontal change of 5.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.900
If I want to calculate
the slope of this staircase,

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.740
I would take the vertical change,
the rise of 5 feet and

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.870
divide it by the run, also 5 feet and
5 divided by 5 is equal to 1.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.069
Likewise for this staircase,
if I want to calculate the slope,

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.950
I'd use 10 feet as the rise because
that's how tall the staircase is and

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.460
I divide it by this horizontal run of 5.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.350
And 10 divided by 5 is equal to 2.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.300
This is the slope of 1, and
this is the slope of 2.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.480
Just like we said, intuitively,
if this staircase is steeper,

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.539
our slope calculation is the same
thing because 2 is bigger than 1.
