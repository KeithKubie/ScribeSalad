00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.485
[SOUND] And now the award for

00:00:03.485 --> 00:00:08.832
most innovative technology goes to Dr.

00:00:08.832 --> 00:00:12.927
Emmet Brown and Marty McAppy.

00:00:12.927 --> 00:00:16.736
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Looks like Marty and

00:00:16.736 --> 00:00:18.065
Doc saved the day.

00:00:18.065 --> 00:00:21.545
And now, it's your turn to implement
Core Data all on your own for

00:00:21.545 --> 00:00:24.025
the final project,
the virtual tourist app.

00:00:24.025 --> 00:00:26.844
&gt;&gt; While we've gone over what you
need to know in order to create

00:00:26.844 --> 00:00:29.720
a Persistence App, know that
Core Data is a huge framework and

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.990
we've only scratched the surface.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.870
We do hope, however,
that you realize how useful it can be.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.740
If you want to learn more,
we'll be waiting for

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.470
you in the senior iOS nanodegree.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.360
&gt;&gt; So thanks.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.200
&gt;&gt; Good luck.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.597
&gt;&gt; And we hope to see you in the future.

00:00:44.597 --> 00:00:46.829
