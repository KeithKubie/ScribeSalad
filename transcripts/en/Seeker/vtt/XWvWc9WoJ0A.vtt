00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.709
When I was kid I thought I was gonna live
till I was like a hundred!

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:05.120
Man I was up for a rude awakening.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.390
But maybe kids these days might get close.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.520
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.529
So recently, the oldest man in the world died
at the ripe old age of 112.

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.710
Sakari Momoi died from kidney failure at a
nursing home in Tokyo.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.199
What’s strange about the story is not his
old age, but his gender.

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.300
Typically the oldest people in the world are
women, like the oldest person who ever lived

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.510
was Jeanne Calment, a French woman who died
in 1997 when she was 122.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.250
For some reason women typically live longer
than men do.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.250
For most of history, men and women had the
same life expectancy.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.890
But something started to change around 1870.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.980
As medication practices and dietary habits
improved over the decades, women started living

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.360
longer than men.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.830
Some people suggested the difference was because
men simply take more risks than women.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.260
Like climbing into tiger cages or testing
out a new supposedly stab proof jacket.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.530
And this risky behavior can sometimes have
deadly consequences.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.530
Darwin.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.290
But a recent study published in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences found

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.100
that in individuals born after 1880, female
death rates decreased 70 percent faster than

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.180
those of males.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.640
The researchers pinpointed heart disease as
a reason for the deadly discrepancy.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.159
But they also said they’d like to do more
research to see how lifestyle factors like

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.390
diet and exercise relates to their data.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.689
Speaking of lifestyle factors... if you’d
like to live longer, exercise, eat right and

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:22.700
stop smoking!

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.130
Seriously, I know you’ve probably heard
it a million times, but a recent study published

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.560
in The Journal of the American Medical Association
found that poor lifestyle choices could cut

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.369
23 years off your life.

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.179
Which is just a lot of years to be missing.

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.310
The large, 50 year study found that nearly
80% of cases of early death by things like

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.770
diabetes and heart disease could be prevented.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.749
The researchers found that having both diabetes
and heart disease is a deadly combination

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:47.579
and that the earlier you get them, the worse
your chances are.

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.951
So like, a guy in his 60s with both conditions
would be out about 12 years on his life, but

00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:55.920
if his younger brother who’s 40 would have
23 years knocked off his life.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.490
And the same goes for a women too, at 60 years
a women would be about 13 years short, at

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.700
40 she would be about 20 years out.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.909
So if you ate right and exercised, just how
long would you be expected to live?

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.930
Well for the longest time, infant mortality
heavily skewed life expectancy.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.349
So a lot of people died before they saw their
first birthday.

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.540
But once someone reached the age of 21, a
mostly well off person could expect to live

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.540
a decently long life.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.760
Like in the 13th century, a person might live
to 64.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.730
Two hundred years later he or she could live
until 71.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.290
One study published in the journal Lancet
estimates that someone born since 2000, could

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.349
expect to see triple digits.

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.739
The researchers also suggest that half of
the people born since 2007 will live to see

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.540
their 104th birthday.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.870
While research into longevity is a hot topic
these days, one theory suggests that maximum

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.519
lifespan for us might be only 125 years.

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.190
Okay well I shouldn’t say only.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.879
That’s still a really long time.

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.250
So if you wanna see some triple digits some
day, eat right, exercise, and please don’t

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.250
smoke.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.560
And it also helps to be a lady.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.290
Or maybe you should live in a different country.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.939
To learn more about which countries have the
highest life expectancy, check out this great

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:13.140
video from our sister show TestTube news.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.140
So how long would you want to live?

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.299
