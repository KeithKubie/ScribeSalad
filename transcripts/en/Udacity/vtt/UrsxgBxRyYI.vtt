00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.050
For this module we're still in
the Lesson1_Constants&amp;Variables

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.170
playground file.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.000
You've seen that the values of
constants remain well, constant, and

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.310
the values of variables can vary.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.460
There are actually a couple of different
ways in which a constant is immutable

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.860
and a variable is mutable.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.300
The first way has to do with
assignment and reassignment.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.250
Once a constant has been assigned
a value, it can't be reassigned,

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.700
even when reassignment wouldn't
change the value, as in this case.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.460
Let's take a look at this error, cannot
assign to let value, yearsOfTheGoat.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.370
Notice that even though the values
of the yearsOfTheGoat and

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.300
yearsOfTheSheep arrays are identical,
these constants can't be reassigned.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.190
The second way of being immutable
has to do with changing values.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.600
If we try to change the value of the
array by appending a value to the end of

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.595
it, the compiler complains, but
for a different reason this time.

00:00:54.595 --> 00:00:55.785
Let's take a look at this error.

00:00:56.805 --> 00:01:01.245
Immutable value of type int only
has mutating members named append.

00:01:01.245 --> 00:01:04.565
The problem here does not lie
with the assignment per say, but

00:01:04.565 --> 00:01:06.485
with mutating the constant's
current value.
