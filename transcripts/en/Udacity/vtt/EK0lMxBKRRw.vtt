00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.650
Welcome to lesson three. This'll be databases. Databases are

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.240
how you actually store all those information that we've

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.190
been collecting from users. This is basically the final

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.190
piece that'll allow us to build fully functional web applications,

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.380
and your homework for this lesson ought to be

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.870
actually build the first version of your blog. So. Databases

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.180
are actually quite complex. We can spend a lot

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.235
of time talking about them. You can actually get a

00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:29.360
Ph.D in databases if you want. But, in this lesson, we

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.492
have about an hour, so we're going to divide it into

00:00:31.492 --> 00:00:34.150
two parts. The first part of this lesson will talk about

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.760
SQL and kind of basic database technologies, a lot of things

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.310
you'll probably encounter outside of this course. And then, in the

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.000
second part of this lesson, we will talk about Google App

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.240
Engine's data store which abstracts away a lot of the headaches

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.410
of installing a database and getting it setup. It's actually the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.410
reason we decided to use App Engine for this course, it was

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.280
the ease of getting started with databases, so let's dive right in.
