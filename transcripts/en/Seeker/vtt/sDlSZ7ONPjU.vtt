This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Audible.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.279
It's the most wonderful time of the year!

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.569
The time when you freak out for 3-4 weeks
and feel more stressed than you ever have

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:09.589
in your life.

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:11.389
Yay?

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:17.510
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.369
I miss a lot of things about being in college,
but finals!

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.140
Haha......noooo finals is not one of them.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.600
There are a lot of insane things that people
do to prepare for finals--but none of them

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.390
are quite as effective as rolling up your
sleeves and studying *the right way*.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.820
Here are 5 scientifically backed ways to get
it in this finals season.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.040
#1 - DO NOT CRAM.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.829
Yeah, everyone knows cramming sucks and they
do it anyway.

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:40.309
But hey, it's gotta be said.

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.851
The Association for Psychological Science
asserts that cramming doesn't work(!), in

00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:46.970
large part because of the all nighters that
are pulled to cram.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.230
Keeping irregular hours impairs your memory
the next 4 DAYS!

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.899
Scientists at NYU also found that a huge chunk
of what you take in while cramming is lost

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.149
as soon as the next day.

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.630
Generally, people remember what they studied
FIRST and LAST the most - and forget everything

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.630
in between.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.650
So, prioritize your information accordingly.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.500
#2 - Practice tests.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.390
Forget highlighting, rereading, summarizing
-- the APS has found that even though they're

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.500
the most common, they're amongst the WORST
methods to help you study.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.500
But practice tests do work.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.240
REALLY WELL, actually.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.870
When you force yourself to repeatedly call
information to the mind, you strengthen your

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.610
knowledge of the material and your ability
to retrieve it.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.670
If you don't have a practice test, flash cards
have similar benefits.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.290
#3 - Explain the material to someone else.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.950
Say you're studying the digestive system,
explain each step of the process to someone

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:32.950
IN DETAIL.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.860
It's similar to a practice test in that it
helps you memorize and recall, but it also

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.670
helps you find the missing gaps in your knowledge
and to get better at articulating the information.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.640
If you can accurately explain something to
someone out loud, you're in good shape!

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.870
#4 - When you're structuring your study schedule,
study a subject in intervals.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.840
For instance, bio on M/W/F and physics on
T/Th/S instead of 3 days in a row.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.000
Distributing your study into intervals over
the course of several weeks will strengthen

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
your retention of the material.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.340
The longer you need to remember the information,
the longer the intervals should be.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.500
#5 - Do the hardest part of your studying
before bed.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.850
A good night's sleep helps to consolidate
your memory and scientists have found that

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.281
the information taken in right before bed
is often the first to come back to you.

00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:14.480
There you go my dears, good luck this finals
season!

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.230
The whole DNews team is rootin' for ya.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.600
After you're all done, if you need a good
book to unwind with I just finished "The Ocean

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.750
at the End of the Lane" by Neil Gaiman, which
you can find on Audible.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.030
IT'S SUCH A GREAT READ!

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.610
I've been recommending it to everyone.
