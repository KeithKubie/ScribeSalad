00:00:10.047 --> 00:00:12.130
MELINDA BRIANA EPLER: My
purpose is and always has

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.520
been to change the world.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.660
I started with
cultural anthropology,

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.900
looking at how change
happens in societies

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.870
and how individuals create
change in societies.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.660
And from there I found
the power of storytelling.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.570
I became a
documentary filmmaker.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.490
I moved to LA,
and for 10 years I

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.700
was a documentary
filmmaker looking

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.940
at HIV/AIDS in South Africa,
women's rights in Turkey,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.530
environmental issues and social
and climate change-related

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.610
issues.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.080
That brought me to learn
the power of storytelling

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.860
through business, so
I became a consultant.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.230
I worked with entrepreneurs
all the way through Fortune 500

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.180
companies launching
mission-driven brands

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.930
to really change the world.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.650
And that led me to my dream job.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.700
I moved to San Francisco, I
became a C-Suite executive

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.560
in an engineering firm, an
international engineering firm,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.540
I built my own team,
I had no budget.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.760
I was changing the world.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.520
But it didn't quite
work out that way.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.820
It was actually one of the
worst experiences of my life.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.860
I hit rock bottom.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.060
It was so bad that I can't
even talk about it legally.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.150
I learned there the power
of diversity and inclusion

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.960
and the need for both.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.010
Diversity is bringing
people to the table.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.740
Key to this,
inclusion is actually

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.540
inviting them to speak and to
lead, and we need both of them.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.360
When you're not
included, it sucks.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.600
It really sucks.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.400
I'm sure a lot of you have
been in the situation before.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.120
Unconscious biases,
microaggressions,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.650
macroaggressions, when they
come at you every single day,

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.390
you lose your power.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.670
Exclusion is where
good ideas die.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.930
It's a culture.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.690
It's a culture thing.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.130
When we're not welcome,
we're not able to thrive.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.890
That's what's happening
in the STEM fields.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.120
In computer science
degrees, in tech fields,

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.910
we're having a revolving door
where people are leaving.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.820
So I crawled myself out
of the hole that I was in,

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.954
and I started putting
things into place

00:02:18.954 --> 00:02:21.370
and I started hiring people
that really cared about making

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.280
a change in that company.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.370
But I kept thinking more.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.380
I kept thinking bigger.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.330
What is the societal change
that needs to happen?

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.770
And I realized that most
of the world's problems

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.310
boil down to exclusion in
one way or another-- poverty,

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.580
environment, education, health.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.960
Bringing diverse and
inclusive leadership,

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.000
and having inclusive
innovation, can drive change

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.290
in these areas.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.912
Here we are at the center of
innovation in Silicon Valley,

00:02:48.912 --> 00:02:51.230
and we have to change
it here and now.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.090
So I started a company.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.900
I started Change Catalyst.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.120
Our mission is to drive
inclusive innovation.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.930
So what is inclusive innovation?

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.130
It starts with education, K
through 12, higher ed, coding

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.680
schools, boot camps.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.220
Then the workplace--
recruiting, retention,

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.360
promotion, and creating
that culture of inclusion.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.260
And then entrepreneurship,
because entrepreneurs

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.200
are driving the next wave
of our economy, right?

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.530
We need to look at
access to capital, access

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.000
to other early-stage resources.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.440
All of these things together,
along with policy-- policy

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.980
is often forgotten
in this equation.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.500
Both local policy
and national policy

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.490
can really create
change in this space.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.550
And then lastly,
ecosystem development.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.990
So looking at emerging markets,
looking at the digital divide,

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.420
really creating these
inclusive tech ecosystems.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.800
So we brought all
of these-- people

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.600
across all of these
areas together

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.870
for a conference in September
of 2015 called Tech Inclusion.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.670
We explored
comprehensive solutions

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.860
to diversity inclusion in tech.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.140
It ended up selling out.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.890
We had a two-day two-track
conference and career fair.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.190
The career fair also sold out.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.570
We had a thousand people.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.990
We had 137 speakers, 27
companies represented

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.440
at the career fair, and
it was so successful we

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.940
decided to keep going.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.279
So we are now a
team of five people.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.760
We have five conferences
across the US this year,

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.090
three career fairs,
two startup showcases,

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.190
we're also doing
consulting and training

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.930
for companies that
want to do more.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.970
And we're starting to
look across the world.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.880
We're starting to look at
those emerging markets.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.360
How do we develop inclusive tech
ecosystems from the beginning?

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.010
So we can learn
what we did right

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.180
and what we've done
wrong in Silicon Valley.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.160
So I want to invite you to join
us in developing inclusive tech

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.900
ecosystems across the US.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.930
We all have a role to play, and
we can all make a difference.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.050
Think of something that you
can do differently tomorrow,

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.025
and make that change.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.110
And focus on solutions.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.160
Come meet us.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.450
We have a table out
here, and look for us

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.360
online at TechInclusion.co.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.300
Thanks.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.000
