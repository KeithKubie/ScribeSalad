00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.960
So polylines are made up of a number of
line segments that are drawn on a map.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.620
The end points of these line segments
are defined using the latitude and

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.030
longitude.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.300
Google Maps will then draw the correct
line for you, based on the location of

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.210
your camera, your zoom level,
your bearing, and your tilt.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.960
It's smart enough to be able
to do all of that for you.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.820
All you need to worry about,
is the latitude and

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.250
longitude of the end
points of your line.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.340
Let's take a look at how to do that.
