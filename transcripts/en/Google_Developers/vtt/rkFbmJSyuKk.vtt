00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:10.680
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Hello, and
welcome to public speaking

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.930
pro tips with Speechless,
presented by Google Developers.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.970
We help people turn the
mundane into the memorable.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.754
ARJITA SETHI: Challenges
into insights.

00:00:18.754 --> 00:00:20.920
CLAIRE SLATTERY: And
presentations into performance.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.040
ARJITA SETHI: And we do
that with something we

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.310
call improv thinking.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.560
CLAIRE SLATTERY: We'll give
you exercises and insights

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.240
to help you become more agile,
more confident, and more

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.180
engaging.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.770
Which brings us to our
first core principle--

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.000
if you are a presenter,
you are a performer.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.750
ARJITA SETHI: If you're speaking
in front of an audience of 300,

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.770
or one on one, or team meeting,
or even just on video camera,

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.750
then you are a performer.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.000
CLAIRE SLATTERY: That's right.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.800
So we want to make sure you
approach your talk, your video,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.660
or your meeting with
that same attitude

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.680
that a performer would
approach their work.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.600
ARJITA SETHI: Sounds like we are
ready for our tip number one.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.020
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Warm-ups!

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.624
ARJITA SETHI: Let's start
with our voice and face.

00:01:02.624 --> 00:01:04.290
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
Before I walk on stage.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.623
ARJITA SETHI: Or into a meeting.

00:01:05.623 --> 00:01:08.250
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Or in front of
a camera, I warm up my voice.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.060
This exercise is
called squish splat.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.190
It's going to seem pretty
silly, and that's because it is.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.410
ARJITA SETHI: Almost all
of these warm-ups are

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.940
a little off the wall in
the hopes of getting you

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.399
and your brain into
a playful mood.

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.523
CLAIRE SLATTERY: And there's
plenty of science that

00:01:23.523 --> 00:01:24.930
proves why that's important.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.730
Visit the description
below to learn more

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.460
about the positive effects
of improv on your brain.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.400
Now imagine you're
holding a ball of dough.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.112
ARJITA SETHI: Like
beats of dough.

00:01:34.112 --> 00:01:35.820
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Now
you take that dough,

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.160
and you throw it against
an imaginary window.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.520
And when you do, you
articulate it with Splat!

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.704
ARJITA SETHI: Splat!

00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:45.620
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Really
stick that tongue out.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.770
Open your mouth as wide as
you can because after we

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.580
throw the dough,
we're going to grab it

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.420
back up from the window,
and squish it up.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.169
ARJITA SETHI: Squish!

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:56.210
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Perfect.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.620
And really try to make sure
that your facial features all

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.570
squeeze together.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.650
Make them a single point.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.080
ARJITA SETHI: Squish!

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.080
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Lovely.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.590
Now back to Splat!

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.940
And make sure that you really
vocalize that-- Aaah-- part.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.130
ARJITA SETHI: Splat!

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.660
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Squish!

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.715
ARJITA SETHI: Squish!

00:02:13.715 --> 00:02:15.840
CLAIRE SLATTERY: This is
going to be hard at first,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.010
but over time, you'll get
more and more comfortable

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.030
making these weird blaaa faces.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.780
ARJITA SETHI: And
eventually you will even

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.210
be able to look another
person in the eyes

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.000
and do this back and forth.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.420
BOTH: Splat!

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.980
Squish!

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.310
Splat!

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.390
Squish!

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.531
ARJITA SETHI: Until then,
try doing it in the mirror.

00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:38.780
CLAIRE SLATTERY: And this
is just one warm-up exercise

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.570
of many, so check
out the description

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.150
below for more helpful warm-ups.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.160
ARJITA SETHI: And that
brings us to tip number

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.490
two-- always put a story
into your meetings, talks,

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.920
or presentations.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.753
CLAIRE SLATTERY: And
we're going to practice

00:02:51.753 --> 00:02:54.090
telling a story with an
exercise we call portkey.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.400
ARJITA SETHI: It helps
to get a random word

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.340
to inspire your story.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.850
CLAIRE SLATTERY: OK, so the
random word is breakfast.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.400
It's important to launch
into the story right away.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.440
Don't sit, and
think for too long.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.200
A story in motion tends
to stay in motion.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.390
ARJITA SETHI: OK, breakfast.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.120
So when I first came to San
Francisco about two years ago,

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.060
I had to make my own breakfast.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.190
So now I had two choices.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.150
Either I cook my
breakfast, which

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.270
meant I would burn,
melt, overcook,

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.870
spoil something, or
hunt down a place which

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.000
gave amazing breakfast.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.780
And luckily, I found this
mom-and-pop shop right

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.980
beneath my apartment, which gave
these amazing bagels and cream

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.360
cheese and lovely coffee.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.550
Well not lovely but then hunger
is the best sauce, you see.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.770
Two months ago the
shop shut down,

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.520
and now I'm again on my hunt.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.370
But I at least bought a
coffee maker, which gets me

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.890
up and running in the morning.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.520
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
So let's break down

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.820
what made that story
engaging and delightful,

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.330
using tip number three.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.310
ARJITA SETHI: Feedback.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.880
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Feedforward.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.730
In this exercise, we focus
on a series of questions,

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.470
starting with, how did you
feel telling that story?

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.770
ARJITA SETHI: Well
initially, it was strange

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.220
because I've never told
that story to anyone,

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.582
and I never thought I would be
telling that story to anyone.

00:04:12.582 --> 00:04:13.540
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Great.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.300
How do you think
the audience felt?

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.800
ARJITA SETHI: I
think initially they

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.959
might not be so interested.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.090
But as I got into
the story, I realized

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.220
it was a personal story, they
would have also wanted to know,

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.410
what's next?

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.810
CLAIRE SLATTERY: What did
you feel was successful?

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.185
ARJITA SETHI: I
think the ending.

00:04:28.185 --> 00:04:30.170
I got a coffee maker

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.920
CLAIRE SLATTERY: What
made it challenging?

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.340
ARJITA SETHI: The beginning.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.940
I mean, a random word breakfast.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.240
I never thought I could
come up with a story.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.230
CLAIRE SLATTERY: What
would you do differently?

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.430
ARJITA SETHI: I would ramble
less and be quicker, I think.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.072
CLAIRE SLATTERY: OK,
that makes sense.

00:04:46.072 --> 00:04:48.280
So you said it was a little
awkward at the beginning,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.040
starting from the
random word breakfast

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.010
and that you had never
told the story before.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.200
But once you got started, you
felt like you kind of got more

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.770
into it, the audience
started feeling

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.190
engaged, wanting to know
what was happening next.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.230
And so you wanted to
keep that feeling.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.280
So moving forward,
you want it to maybe

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.580
make it a little less rambly,
maybe a little more concise,

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.000
and you really
like you're ending,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.657
the bit about the coffee maker.

00:05:10.657 --> 00:05:12.990
And so I really want you to
stick the landing next time.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.840
That felt a great last line.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.829
ARJITA SETHI: That
sounds like feedforward.

00:05:16.829 --> 00:05:17.870
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Totally.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.600
And as you can see, I was able
to help synthesize what Arjita

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.410
experienced, helping her
sort through the insights

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.560
and next steps.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.190
ARJITA SETHI: OK, let's recap.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.320
Tip number one-- warm-up.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.160
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Squish!

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.700
Splat!

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.720
ARJITA SETHI: Exactly.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.732
And tip number
two-- tell a story.

00:05:33.732 --> 00:05:35.690
CLAIRE SLATTERY: And
finally, tip number three,

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.800
give feedback, feedforward.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.260
ARJITA SETHI:
Thanks for watching!

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.170

like an improviser

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.760
and develop your voice.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.460
ARJITA SETHI: Ouch.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.010
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Sorry.
