[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.680
AMY SHAMUS: All right.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.800
Let's get started.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.850
Thank you guys so
much for coming.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:13.750
I'm so excited.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.600
It's definitely my
honor and privilege

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.260
to introduce our two guests
today, Catherine, Dr. Birndorf

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.630
of the Motherhood
Center, and chief content

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.910
officer of Goop, Elise Loehnen.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.770
I am Amy Shamus.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.260
I'm on the events and
experience team here at Google.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.020
I've been at Google
almost seven years,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.950
but with two maternity
leaves back to back.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.310
So it feels long,
but there is a chunk

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.480
missing as I started my
other career as a mom.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.490
But we're here today
because I actually

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.260
saw Elise interview Dr. Birndorf
at the In Goop Health Summit

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.650
in January in New York City.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.066
And she was on a panel, and I
was sitting in the audience.

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.380
My son was seven and a half
months old at the time,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.510
and everything you
were saying resonated

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.700
with me, which I'm sure
a lot of you here, same,

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.740
as we'll be hearing
more from you.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.769
And then I thought--

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:04.560
I ran up to Elise at
the end of the summit.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.660
I said, we've got to
do something at Google.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.910
And then life got in the
way, and it took me a while.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.400
But you had your podcast.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.010
And it was the third
ever Goop podcast,

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.860
and you deep dove on this
conversation of postpartum

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.307
anxiety, postpartum
depression, and what

00:01:19.307 --> 00:01:21.390
you're calling the motherhood
shift, which I love.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.940
And that was it.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:22.981
That was the sign for me.

00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:24.780
I said, let's get
these ladies to Google.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.570
A lot of people will
want to hear from you

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.090
and talk about
this these issues.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.340
We're very fortunate
at Google because we

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.150
have a wonderful benefits
team and a great paid

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.070
maternal and paternal leave.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.180
But that's not to say that
Google isn't a very exhausting

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.190
and demanding place to
work, as it should be.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.210
We are Google.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.240
But there is a lot
to be learned when

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.326
we are in this post-baby,
postpartum phase, which

00:01:51.326 --> 00:01:53.700
is why I thought that not only
myself would love to learn

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.400
more, and as I already said
to you guys, become your best

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.210
friends forever, but that
everyone else would learn

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.910
a lot about this
particular issue

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.970
and how we can work
through these changes

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.180
while we're at work.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.740
And I would of course be remiss
if I didn't mention that May

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.700
is mental health month.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.400
So Google is hosting
a series of talks

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.130
throughout the month
of May to dive deeper

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.110
into specific parts
of mental health.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.234
And I know we're going to
address that a little bit

00:02:21.234 --> 00:02:22.890
in our conversation today.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.090
But just know that mental health
has a wide variety of looks

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.450
and feels, and
one in five people

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.550
suffer from some version of it.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.610
So if there is
anything you're feeling

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.680
you need more out of Google
and from our benefits team,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.934
be sure to look things up this
month on Go Mental Health,

00:02:41.934 --> 00:02:44.100
and look out for different
talks throughout the rest

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.900
of the month.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.810
So with all of that
said, let's get to going.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.080
So again, I have two young boys.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.530
I've only been back from
my second maternity leave

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.390
for seven and a
half months, which

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.430
feels so short yet so long.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.260
And navigating being a
working mom is difficult.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.640
And it was so wonderful
when I was hearing

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.360
that not only anecdotally it was
difficult, but scientifically

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.580
and biologically, it
is in fact difficult.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.160
So while I had very high
functioning pregnancies

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.260
and postpartum experiences,
that was not the case,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.740
certainly, for all
of my mommy friends.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.640
And so I want to
just start today

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.711
with asking what is
postpartum anxiety?

00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:27.960
What is postpartum depression?

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.016
What's the difference?

00:03:29.016 --> 00:03:30.390
And then also, I
know you're kind

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.010
of coining a new term in that
sphere, so starting there.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.750
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
Starting there, OK.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.373
AMY SHAMUS: And that'll
be the whole hour.

00:03:38.373 --> 00:03:40.289
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
[INAUDIBLE] Keep it short.

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:41.000
AMY SHAMUS: Yeah.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.930
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Well,
I think postpartum is just

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:43.800
after birth, right.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.920
So everybody is postpartum
once they have a kid.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.572
And there's a normal range
of adjustment, right.

00:03:49.572 --> 00:03:51.030
So we were just
talking about this.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.680
Everybody has something.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.550
It doesn't have to go all
the way to a disorder, right.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.440
So what you're referring to is
what we're calling perinatal

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.550
mood and anxiety
disorders, PMAD,

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.534
[? P-MADs. ?] And that is
the new phrase for PPD,

00:04:06.534 --> 00:04:08.700
which people are starting,
thankfully, to recognize.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.700
Postpartum depression, that's
sort of the catch all phrase,

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.690
or postpartum.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.520
People say, did you
have postpartum?

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.440
And that's in that
sort of whisper.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.769
That's beyond the adjustment,
beyond the normal adjustment.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.970
But it doesn't
capture it all, right.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.854
So people are missed
because they think,

00:04:24.854 --> 00:04:25.770
postpartum depression?

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.150
I'm not depressed.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.390
So they get confused.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.300
And so that's why
when you guys, when

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.800
Goop wanted to
talk about anxiety,

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.910
I thought it was great.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.020
It's not new.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.270
It just wasn't discussed.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.270
So there can be normal--
look, when you have a kid,

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.920
everyone gets-- things change.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.680
And I think we are very
adaptive, thankfully.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.390
And so everyone's a
little bit anxious,

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.240
because you're taking
care of this totally

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.306
dependent creature.

00:04:50.306 --> 00:04:51.180
You may not know how.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.530
You probably don't know how.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.332
And you have to figure it out.

00:04:54.332 --> 00:04:56.040
And so everyone's a
bit anxious, but when

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.130
it goes beyond just
anxiety, that you

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.957
can get to work, do your things,
do your normal daily routines,

00:05:02.957 --> 00:05:04.290
then we're getting into trouble.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.470
And that may be in the anxious
realm or in a depressive realm.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.490
And I can blather on
forever about those things.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.471
So just know it's normal to have
a little bit of an adjustment.

00:05:13.471 --> 00:05:14.220
How could you not?

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.870
It's the most profound
identity shift imaginable.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.110
AMY SHAMUS: Yeah, I remember--
this is an all too intimate

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.937
story, I'm sure,
but when I was--

00:05:23.937 --> 00:05:25.770
see my poor husband
sitting in the audience.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.930
But I was, I think,
three or four weeks

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.310
postpartum with my oldest son.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.390
And I was so happy.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.500
And I ran up to him,
just hysterical sobs,

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.600
hugging him saying it was
the happiest I'd ever been.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.670
But yet I was--

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.090
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Crying.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.140
AMY SHAMUS: --crying.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.200
And I even said, once
I lose the baby weight,

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.580
this'll be the best ever.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.490
And I mean, I look
back on it now like,

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.050
what was going on there?

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.790
And again, I was so happy.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.510
So it wasn't anything to be
concerned about at the time.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.834
But the emotions are--

00:05:55.834 --> 00:05:57.000
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Intense.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.690
AMY SHAMUS: --certainly
there and so intense.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.270
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Well,
that's the blues, right.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.860
And that's almost everybody.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.810
I say to patients
and to friends,

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.240
you're the unusual person
who doesn't have that.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.830
You described it perfectly.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.010
Happy, sad, we call it emotional
lability, sort of the ups

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.325
and downs, super intense.

00:06:12.325 --> 00:06:14.700
And you feel like you're losing
your mind for that moment

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.190
or for those few minutes.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.060
But you're not.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.980
That's the hormonal
fluctuation that

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.840
is happening after delivery.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.280
AMY SHAMUS: And
completely normal.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.340
Just biologically--

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:24.670
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
Totally normal.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:25.560
AMY SHAMUS: --what happens.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:25.825
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Absolutely.

00:06:25.825 --> 00:06:28.241
AMY SHAMUS: Which is, again,
what is so wonderful to hear.

00:06:28.241 --> 00:06:30.300
And normal's not the
right word, but--

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.880
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Typical.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.770
AMY SHAMUS: --to know that--

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:32.710
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Common.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:33.810
Happens to almost everybody.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:34.518
AMY SHAMUS: Yeah.

00:06:34.518 --> 00:06:36.660
So talk about the Motherhood
Center, which opened

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.160
in New York City, how long ago?

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.000
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
Just over a year.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.530
AMY SHAMUS: A year
ago, hopefully a

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.110
to be opening offices all over.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.580
And just to note for people--

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.332
I know a bunch of you
who had emailed me--

00:06:46.332 --> 00:06:48.540
it's not just for people
who are currently pregnant--

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.420
which if you are,
congratulations--

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.460
or if you just had a
baby, but if you are

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.740
thinking about having a baby.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.330
So talk about the Motherhood
Center, what it is,

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.520
and how it helps.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.130
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: So we
opened this place called

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.860
the Motherhood Center,
which is trying

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.550
to help women and families
trying to conceive,

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.130
thinking about conceiving,
so fertility issues,

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.270
those who are pregnant, and
then those in the postpartum.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.260
So it's really the
perinatal experience.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.020
That's what that
time frame is, right.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.030
And I know we're called
the Motherhood Center,

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.340
but as I see men out there
and I know who are dads,

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.415
I think, we really
do, we also address--

00:07:25.415 --> 00:07:27.540
it's really a family issue,
and I think maybe we'll

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.800
talk some of that later.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.470
But it's not just about the mom.

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.820
But we really wanted a
place where we could--

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.440
we've sort of turned ourselves
into the mothering center.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.470
So we're really helping women
go through the adjustment

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.020
and the transition
into motherhood.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.930
And the dads come on
Fridays, or the partners.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.069
And we have a group
for just them.

00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:49.860
And we also bring them
into different kinds

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.660
of family groups
so that they can

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.224
talk about their experience
in this transition.

00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:55.890
But we go from-- just
to tell you a bit,

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:57.690
it's a comprehensive
treatment center.

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.430
Nothing like this
exists in the country.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.940
So we're trying to
create this pilot program

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.790
that we hope we can
nail, so that we

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.400
can make it a
place that could be

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.830
in other areas of
the country, helping

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.510
women adjust to motherhood.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:15.554
But it's not just those
who are well and having

00:08:15.554 --> 00:08:16.470
the normal adjustment.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.450
We are also dealing
with women who

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:20.580
are just shy of going
into the hospital, right,

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.450
so who are really needing a
comprehensive day program.

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:26.120
They're just not
making it out there.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.780
They're not getting
out of the house.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.200
They're not getting
prenatal care.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.366
They're not going to their
pediatricians afterwards,

00:08:31.366 --> 00:08:33.900
or just not able to function
as well as they should.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.380
And these are high
functioning women who

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.230
just are so down or so anxious.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:41.789
We see a lot of postpartum OCD.

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:44.025
That's one of the postpartum
anxiety disorders.

00:08:44.025 --> 00:08:45.150
We see all kinds of things.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.394
And they're just not--

00:08:46.394 --> 00:08:47.310
they're not making it.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.980
And so they come in for
therapies, group therapies,

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.450
from 9:45 to 2:45.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:54.210
And we have an on-site nursery,
so they bring the babies,

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:57.300
and we help them kind of figure
out how to be with a baby.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.410
Are they too attached?

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.630
Are they not-- are
they too detached?

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.510
So different iterations
of bonding and attachment

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.400
we address with the new moms.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.930
AMY SHAMUS: It's so amazing.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.020
How's it going?

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.812
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
It's going really well.

00:09:10.812 --> 00:09:11.520
It's so much fun.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.353
And I think those of
us who've come together

00:09:13.353 --> 00:09:17.040
are so passionate about this
time period and treatment that

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.730
is so lacking.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.700
There's a dearth of this kind
of treatment in the country.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:25.980
And I think that to see women
go from struggling so much

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.600
and feeling like
they're never going

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.140
to be able to be the mother
they want to be, to within two

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.530
to four to six weeks, walking
out of there confident

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.990
and feeling like they got this--

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.490
we have graduates
come back and talk

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.820
to the moms who are newly coming
in, and it is like goosebumps.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:42.804
AMY SHAMUS: Yeah.

00:09:42.804 --> 00:09:43.470
And you said it.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:46.110
Certainly, the passion is there.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.180
Even in just meetings
at Google, once you

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.450
identify that somebody
else is a mom, it is--

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:50.710
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Connection.

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.001
AMY SHAMUS: There's an
immediate switch and connection.

00:09:53.001 --> 00:09:55.230
And people are so
passionate about this topic,

00:09:55.230 --> 00:10:00.990
and feeling empowered is
difficult during the postpartum

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.920
time frame.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.647
So Elise, to you, also
a mom of two boys.

00:10:05.647 --> 00:10:06.480
ELISE LOEHNEN: Yeah.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.587
AMY SHAMUS: Boy moms.

00:10:07.587 --> 00:10:08.420
Girl moms are great.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.545
Everything-- it's all good.

00:10:09.545 --> 00:10:11.020
Babies are all good.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.900
But you are the chief
content officer of Goop.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.830
You have to see so much
come across your desk.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:20.950
So how did you sift out
Catherine and the Motherhood

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.191
Center and say,
this is something

00:10:23.191 --> 00:10:24.190
that we need to promote?

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.260
This is so brand right.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.610
The synergy is so great.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.430
What was it that
struck you about this

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:33.670
that's different than everything
else I'm sure you see?

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:35.830
ELISE LOEHNEN: So before--

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.620
actually, I wish I
had met Catherine

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.915
when I had my first child.

00:10:40.915 --> 00:10:42.060
I'm sad that I didn't.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.600
It would've been different.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.535
I was not-- like
everyone, I don't

00:10:45.535 --> 00:10:49.420
know anyone who's well
equipped for parenthood.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.650
Definitely not well equipped.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:57.700
And after I had my first
child, I felt really bad.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.800
It was probably a
year after, and I

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.670
was talking to a doctor, this
doctor, Alejandro Junger.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.740
And I was like,
what's wrong with me?

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.756
I don't feel good.

00:11:07.756 --> 00:11:09.130
I'm tired of being
told that it's

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:10.505
because I have a
child, because I

00:11:10.505 --> 00:11:12.442
was getting really good sleep.

00:11:12.442 --> 00:11:13.900
And he put me on
his clean program.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.066
He was like, let's get you
more vitamin D. He's just

00:11:16.066 --> 00:11:18.520
like, I'm just going
to put something

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.010
based on what I think
is probably going on,

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:22.750
vitamin B, clean program.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:23.840
I felt incredible.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.650
I felt dramatically
better six weeks later.

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.400
And in that process, he
introduced me to this doctor

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.920
in the Australian bush.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.710
His name's Oscar
Serrallach, and he

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:38.745
was working on this concept
called postnatal depletion.

00:11:38.745 --> 00:11:40.660
And he was like,
there's just nothing

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.130
in literature about this.

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.140
But he was observing
it in this family

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.420
clinic in rural
Australia, these women who

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.510
would have multiple
children, and every time

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:53.350
they would present, they were
more depleted, more run down.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.170
And he was like,
this is so weird.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:59.210
There's stuff on postpartum
depression, not enough.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:02.420
And then there's
nothing about depletion.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:07.840
And I did a story with him,
and it was incredibly--

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.670
the response was insane.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:12.280
Women were-- just
tons of emails.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:16.060
Because essentially, he
believes for seven to 10 years--

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.130
it can take seven to
10 years to recover.

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:22.540
Women start in the sort
of depleted state already.

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.910
Even if you have the best
intention to eat perfectly,

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.690
I don't know anyone who does,
and our food is not amazing.

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:32.770
And you start behind
the starting block.

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:33.760
You have a child.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.480
They take everything
that they need from you,

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.700
all the fat in your brain.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.700
And you end up worse off.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.440
And we all know
from having a baby

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.380
that you go to the
doctor a lot, and then

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:51.080
as soon as you have the
baby, no one cares about you.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.240
You have like one check up
where they're like, looks fine.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.320
I think your abs
aren't separated.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.720
You can have sex
with your husband.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.890
See you in a year.

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:04.360
And so anyway, this story,
people were like, this is me.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.460
This is describing
the last decade

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:10.720
of my life, this
profound resonance.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.150
And we were like,
wow, we really need

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.220
to talk more about
what's happening.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.500
Because I think there's
a world of mom blogs,

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.290
and there's this perception
issue of people being like,

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:24.850
this is me and my perfectly
swaddled clothed child,

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:26.720
and I'm doing great.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.160
And the reality that women
everywhere are struggling,

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.640
and then the whole--

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.710
the psychological part
came in through Birndorf

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:37.990
and the spectrum.

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:43.720
And we had a mom at Goop
who was really struggling.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.320
She wouldn't mind me sharing
that, but just extreme panic

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:47.950
attacks.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:49.390
She had had anxiety before.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.440
She was great during
her pregnancy,

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:57.090
and then was not postpartum
depression, but OCD, anxiety,

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:00.370
to the extent that she
was like, I'm certifiable.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.040
I need the hospital.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:02.600
I need--

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.700
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
She couldn't function.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.116
ELISE LOEHNEN:
Could not function.

00:14:05.116 --> 00:14:10.430
And so Birndorf quarterbacked
her to function, I'd say.

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:11.180
She's doing great.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.110
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
She's doing great.

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.150
ELISE LOEHNEN: So that's sort
of the long-- it was just like,

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:16.524
this needs to be something
that we talk about culturally.

00:14:16.524 --> 00:14:18.440
AMY SHAMUS: So you're
truly filling a void.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.610
There isn't anything else.

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:20.390
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
There's nothing.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:21.734
AMY SHAMUS: That's incredible.

00:14:21.734 --> 00:14:23.900
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: There
are individuals out there.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.566
I have colleagues
across the country who

00:14:25.566 --> 00:14:28.070
are doing this kind of
work, who are amazing,

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:31.640
who are in the field of
reproductive and perinatal

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.230
psychiatry, psychology.

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:34.730
But they're all
sort of individuals.

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:37.146
I mean, they tend to be in big
cities like my good friends

00:14:37.146 --> 00:14:39.850
in LA and Chicago and New York.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:44.140
But they're not-- we wanted to
create a center of community

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:47.280
where we could really
be the experts in this

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.349
and try to figure it out, right.

00:14:49.349 --> 00:14:51.140
We have a lot of creative
space to do that.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.500
We're a startup.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.880
So we were a group of
passionate clinicians

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.580
who came together
trying to fill a need,

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.472
sort of solve for
something that is missing,

00:15:01.472 --> 00:15:02.930
because we weren't
getting it done.

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:05.863
And I come from the academic
world, the ivory tower.

00:15:05.863 --> 00:15:07.414
Can't even-- people
would say to me,

00:15:07.414 --> 00:15:09.080
my phone number on
the internet is still

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.210
from when I was a
resident before now.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:12.420
So it's ridiculous.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.660
You can't even get the--

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:15.890
So it's hard.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:17.550
It's a very fortressed
world out there.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.889
Medicine, you know
it from your family,

00:15:19.889 --> 00:15:21.680
but if you don't know
someone in the field,

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.340
it's very hard to break in.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.950
And then you get
to mental health.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:26.900
Forget physical
health, hard enough.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:27.930
Mental health?

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.290
And that's why May, this
month, is so important

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:31.190
to talk about it.

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:33.290
I mean, nobody wants
to talk about this.

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:35.900
The fact that you'll even
say you had this hard time

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.524
postpartum is novel.

00:15:38.524 --> 00:15:40.190
I mean, yes, celebrities
are coming out.

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:43.046
They're talking about it,
which I think is great.

00:15:43.046 --> 00:15:45.420
It's definitely-- the word on
the street, it's out there.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.970
But again, it's
getting mistaken as,

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:48.412
oh, I don't have depression.

00:15:48.412 --> 00:15:50.120
I didn't have that
postpartum depression.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.850
It used to be, I would say
five, 10 years ago, when

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:55.360
I would get calls, it would be
somebody killed their child,

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:55.860
right--

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:56.440
AMY SHAMUS: It was very extreme.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.570
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
--their infant, right.

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:59.840
And everyone thought that
was postpartum depression.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.500
AMY SHAMUS: That's not.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.791
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: That's not.

00:16:01.791 --> 00:16:04.040
That is postpartum psychosis,
when you lose touch

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:08.090
with reality and you
have these thoughts

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:10.580
that you're saving your
child if you kill them,

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.140
because you're so bad.

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.220
These are delusions.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.930
This is a person
who is out of touch

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:16.520
with reality, because
as I always say,

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:20.690
no mother in their right mind
would hurt their child, right.

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:21.275
That's not--

00:16:21.275 --> 00:16:23.400
So no one talks about it,
because they're like, oh,

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.550
if I tell anyone.

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:26.840
I mean, there was a
Sacramento story not long ago

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.410
where a woman told someone
in the pediatrician's

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:33.860
office or OB's office,
and they called the cops.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.010
And then the cops-- then it
became a-- or ACS comes in,

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:38.489
Adult Child Services.

00:16:38.489 --> 00:16:40.280
No one knows what's
going to happen if they

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.229
admit that they're struggling.

00:16:42.229 --> 00:16:44.270
They think, they're going
to think I'm a bad mom.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.490
They're going to think I'm
a bad person, that I might

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.073
try and hurt my kid, like those
horrible, sensationalized news

00:16:49.073 --> 00:16:50.480
stories I've heard about.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.200
So the fact that we're having
just a conversation about

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.170
routine stuff that I cannot--

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:00.945
one in five women
struggle, and dads too.

00:17:00.945 --> 00:17:02.820
ELISE LOEHNEN: That has
to be under reported.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:03.490
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: I totally--

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:04.823
well, the number's one in seven.

00:17:04.823 --> 00:17:06.869
I go with one in five,
because for sure, it's

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:11.450
under reported, under diagnosed,
under treated, and dads too.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:12.599
AMY SHAMUS: Yeah.

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:16.160
Well, I think what's amazing--
and this is moving a bit away

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.680
from Motherhood Center, but
obviously tangentially tied

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.480
to it and somebody
else that was on Goop--

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.582
"The Clarity Cleanse,"
so wonderful book

00:17:22.582 --> 00:17:23.540
if you haven't read it.

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.680
I forget the author's name.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.480
ELISE LOEHNEN: Habib Sadeghi.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.188
AMY SHAMUS: Yeah.

00:17:26.188 --> 00:17:28.119
And he was actually at
the first Goop Summit.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:30.850
I'm a Goop fan, if
you couldn't tell.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.860
Next summit is in
three weeks, June 9.

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.490
Be there, LA.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.200
But he talks about
actually, the mental health

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.300
and physical health
are the same thing.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.210
And so while we're
still working to get

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:44.540
there and de-stigmatize
mental health, all of that

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:48.286
is so closely tied to
everything inside your body.

00:17:48.286 --> 00:17:49.910
And so if you're
holding onto something

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:51.950
from the past
mentally, there will

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:54.484
be a physical manifestation
of it at some point.

00:17:54.484 --> 00:17:56.150
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
There's a great book

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:59.150
by a trauma expert,
Bessel van der Kolk called

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:00.720
"The Body Keeps a Score."

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.620
And I just love the title,
because I feel like it says it

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.580
all, right.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.650
You don't escape your past.

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:10.100
You don't escape your mind,
your body, your trauma.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.650
Everyone's got something.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:14.285
It lives in the body,
and it will come out.

00:18:14.285 --> 00:18:15.410
ELISE LOEHNEN: Or the mind.

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:15.470
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Or the mind.

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.780
ELISE LOEHNEN: To channel
our other favorite parenting

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:23.960
expert, Robin Berman, becoming
a parent creates a crisis to you

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:28.867
because it forces the way you
were parented to the surface.

00:18:28.867 --> 00:18:30.700
And suddenly, it's like,
what kind of mother

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:31.420
am I going to be?

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:34.210
What kind of mothering
did I not get?

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:35.635
Just a total--

00:18:35.635 --> 00:18:36.760
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Crisis.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:37.840
ELISE LOEHNEN:
Yeah, it's a crisis.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.798
And I don't think people
are necessarily even--

00:18:39.798 --> 00:18:41.190
they're not conscious of that.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.910
AMY SHAMUS: No.

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:42.660
Sometimes you are.

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.493
I mean, I think with
"Permission to Parent,"

00:18:44.493 --> 00:18:46.780
which is a wonderful book
if you haven't read it--

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.279
and you just so happen to be
the author's best friend, which

00:18:49.279 --> 00:18:51.730
is adorable.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.830
My husband I talk
about this often with,

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:57.020
we try to create for our boys
the opposite of what we had.

00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:00.537
But as we're in the midst of
seeing all of our friends also

00:19:00.537 --> 00:19:02.620
become parents, it's very
interesting because some

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:04.390
of them just directly
want to copy that,

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:06.610
because they had such
wonderful-- so they

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:08.230
seem-- idyllic childhoods.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.990
But it is an act of
becoming a parent,

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:13.270
and you chose it the
minute you got pregnant.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:16.450
But it isn't something that is
fully fleshed out in your brain

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:19.370
until you start seeing these
little things run around.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:20.140
ELISE LOEHNEN: And
then there's this idea

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:21.973
that it's all supposed
to be natural, right.

00:19:21.973 --> 00:19:24.550
Like, there is no act
and you're supposed

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:27.940
to know how to breastfeed,
and I mean, these things

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.050
that are not natural.

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:32.210
I'm sorry, but like--

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:34.390
And what's a natural birth?

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:37.550
And that conversation
drives me nuts too.

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:40.690
And it starts, the
judgment starts--

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:42.905
I mean, what kind of birth
are you going to have?

00:19:42.905 --> 00:19:43.780
I mean, not to just--

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.321
I'm not complaining
just to complain.

00:19:45.321 --> 00:19:47.316
But it's complicated.

00:19:47.316 --> 00:19:48.690
AMY SHAMUS: But
I also think too,

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:51.739
that's another thing about going
back to, when you're pregnant,

00:19:51.739 --> 00:19:53.780
you are the princess, and
once you have the baby,

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:55.000
you're the peasant.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.349
Even with when you had the
lactation consultant come,

00:19:58.349 --> 00:19:59.890
I remember I thought
this was for me,

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:02.949
because it was so painful
and so hard the first time.

00:20:02.949 --> 00:20:04.990
And they're like, nope,
nope, all about the baby.

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:06.850
I'm like, but what--
how do I-- no,

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:08.600
can I get some
help over here too?

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.849
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Culturally,
we've missed the boat.

00:20:10.849 --> 00:20:11.770
We've missed the boat.

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:15.025
And again, that's why what we're
finding when these women leave

00:20:15.025 --> 00:20:17.380
the Motherhood Center
is they are repleted,

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.360
to go back to that
depleted word.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.360
They feel cared for, nourished.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.895
We do not do that for moms.

00:20:23.895 --> 00:20:24.520
AMY SHAMUS: No.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.710
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
It's all about the baby.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:28.930
You're celebrated when
you're pregnant, right,

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:31.780
but the minute that kid's
out, all eyes on the baby.

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.454
And great, but
what about the mom?

00:20:34.454 --> 00:20:36.370
AMY SHAMUS: Yeah, and I
hope there is a shift.

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:38.830
I mean, at least, again,
in my small circle,

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:41.470
we always do, when
a baby's born,

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:43.090
it's not about
holding that new baby.

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:44.670
It's, where's your laundry?

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.420
And what can I do for you?

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:49.960
Because I will Mary Poppins
this, because that's selfishly

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.340
what I would like to have.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:54.940
But it is, you don't
know until you know.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.670
And it's, but how do we educate?

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:58.420
So obviously Motherhood
Center, but Elise,

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:00.479
what other opportunities
are out there?

00:21:00.479 --> 00:21:02.020
I guess opportunity's
the wrong word.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.810
But what other things
are in place for women

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:07.750
to go to and get this
sort of resource?

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.510
Obviously, if we can't
all be in New York City,

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.880
which, as Googlers, we're
lucky because we potentially

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.050
do work in New York.

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:16.120
And we can visit, and we will.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:21.220
But for those of us who can't,
digital's key right now.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:25.770
So what resources are out there,
other than Goop, of course?

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:28.270
ELISE LOEHNEN: Other than Goop
and hopefully more Motherhood

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:34.390
Centers too, I mean, I
wouldn't-- it's hard to say.

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:36.760
I mean, I'd say it's
piecing together

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.880
things that work for you.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.960
And a lot of it, it's
like we can learn a lot

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.550
from the airline industry.

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:45.280
You have to put the oxygen
mask on yourself first

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.240
before you help other people.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.390
And I think it's a
familial conversation.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:51.550
I think it's a forced
conversation with partners

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:58.840
too of like, I need to be
as prioritized as my child.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.600
And that needs to be
a social conversation.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:06.604
That needs to be the
cultural conversation of--

00:22:06.604 --> 00:22:08.020
We were talking
about this before.

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.470
I'm married to a
really lovely man.

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:10.970
He's great.

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:12.970
He has a far less
stressful career,

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:14.530
and he's a really good dad.

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:18.620
I still do 60% of the work.

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:20.080
And he is applauded.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.930
He is celebrated
as an amazing dad,

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:25.330
because sometimes he drops
our kid off at preschool

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:26.422
and he puts them to bed.

00:22:26.422 --> 00:22:27.880
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
No anger there.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:28.713
ELISE LOEHNEN: Yeah.

00:22:28.713 --> 00:22:30.850
And I am not celebrated.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:34.690
I'm an absent mom, even
though I do more of the work.

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:37.720
And so it's even just
bringing awareness to that.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.970
And then I think
in order for things

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:44.260
to change, it's connecting with
women who are not yet mothers,

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.510
because nobody knows.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:49.020
I just was shocked.

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:53.020
It was before I was at Goop,
but when I had my first child,

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.600
and I was eight months pregnant,
and I went to the benefits

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.521
office for my matern--
and I was like, oh,

00:22:58.521 --> 00:22:59.770
so I'll be on maternity leave.

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:02.050
And she was like, OK,
so you'll be paid--

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:06.310
and this is far better than
vast majority of Americans--

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:08.380
we're going to pay
you for six weeks,

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.240
and then you go on disability.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.310
I was like, I can't
survive on disability.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:13.810
What are you talking about?

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:16.930
I thought I had a 12 week leave.

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:22.480
And I think 27% of women are
back at work two weeks after

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.060
having a baby because
they have no family leave.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:29.750
And then you start this whole
cycle, a pernicious cycle.

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:32.040
And I was furious.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.060
I was so mad, not
only at my company,

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.960
but also at the culture.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.080
And that's not a
good way to start--

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.415
that's not a good way
to become a mom either.

00:23:44.415 --> 00:23:46.040
AMY SHAMUS: That's
not good for anyone.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.331
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: It's funny.

00:23:47.331 --> 00:23:50.960
I was a resident when I had
my first kid, who's now 19,

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.620
and I didn't know
what I got either.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:53.720
And I'm like, huh,
I don't even know

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:54.620
if there's maternity leave.

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.180
I was one of the
few residents to get

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:58.430
pregnant during
residency in those years.

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:00.980
And I went in, and I'm
like, what's the deal?

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.660
And they said, six weeks.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:05.690
And if you have a
C-section, you'll get eight.

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:08.020
This is at a hospital, right.

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:10.130
I mean, it's so ironic.

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:12.370
It was dismal.

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:14.630
AMY SHAMUS: Well, I will
say, to Google's credit--

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.870
ELISE LOEHNEN: I know.

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:15.510
You guys win.

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:17.218
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
You guys do it right.

00:24:17.218 --> 00:24:19.820
AMY SHAMUS: We have an
incredible maternity

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.899
and paternity leave policy.

00:24:21.899 --> 00:24:23.690
And for those of you
thinking about getting

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:25.770
pregnant, thinking, I don't
need all that, you need it all.

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:26.440
Take it all.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:30.470
There's never a day you'll
wish you didn't do that.

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:33.650
But we also-- and I said
when I opened this talk,

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:35.330
the expectation when
you're working here

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:36.920
is incredibly high.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.050
And it is so
difficult to be a mom

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:40.760
and have all of
those expectations.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.310
So I agree with you that
it starts with women

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:46.020
who haven't had children.

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:49.610
And I have a lovely manager, and
he's so responsive to my needs.

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:52.610
I force it, because I always
have these conversations

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:53.390
with him.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:55.850
But not everyone is like that.

00:24:55.850 --> 00:25:00.270
But I find it to be a
little trickier with peers

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:01.910
who don't have children.

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:04.015
So I mean, I'm
sure you've seen--

00:25:04.015 --> 00:25:06.140
New York City, you've got
to have some high powered

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:07.970
ladies coming in there.

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:14.569
So what is some advice to help
moms in high powered jobs deal

00:25:14.569 --> 00:25:16.610
with women that don't have
kids, who may want to?

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:21.170
And it's no one's fault, but
it is an interesting place

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:24.120
to navigate with when
you get that call.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.750
Yesterday, my son, we had
to take him to the doctor

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:29.550
unexpectedly at 2:30 PM, and
so I had to work from home.

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:33.330
And it's very difficult.

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:36.560
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Well,
it's a systemic issue, right.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.530
And we look at it as
the mother's problem.

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:43.879
I'm not sure if dads are running
home as much or partners are

00:25:43.879 --> 00:25:44.420
running home.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:46.340
But the primary
caretaker, whoever

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:51.290
that is, typically the mom,
is really disadvantaged,

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:52.765
which should not be the case.

00:25:52.765 --> 00:25:53.390
This is a fam--

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:56.100
I mean, do we want to
populate this country?

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:56.940
I--you know.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.970
But so isn't this
everyone's issue?

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:01.800
Isn't it a natural thing?

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.570
So why it's
considered a problem--

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:06.770
and everyone's hiding.

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:08.480
Can you cover for
me while I run out?

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.370
It's like, what?

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:14.480
So again, it's hard,
but I think that it has

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.250
to be a community, a familial.

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:18.912
We have to-- it's a
cultural, systemic issue.

00:26:18.912 --> 00:26:20.120
AMY SHAMUS: And you're right.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.680
Even yesterday,
I kind of cowered

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.480
when I said, well, I've got
to take him to the doctor,

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.972
because he might
have bronchitis.

00:26:25.972 --> 00:26:27.638
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
You should be there.

00:26:27.638 --> 00:26:29.450
You should be able to
go, or your partner

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:30.800
should be able to go.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.300
That's normal.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.812
Normal, we were using that word.

00:26:34.812 --> 00:26:36.020
AMY SHAMUS: And you're right.

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.730
I mean, it is
difficult for people,

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:41.150
but I think the verbiage
around it is so important.

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.280
ELISE LOEHNEN: Well,
and I think honestly,

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:47.220
it's an issue that needs
to start with men, I think.

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:49.700
One, when you look
at the research,

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.770
they have the power
to advocate change.

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.920
And I think they feel shy about
it, like it's a woman's issue

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.630
and it's not really my place.

00:26:56.630 --> 00:27:00.640
But it's sadly, going
to be the most well--

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.320
they can--

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.150
AMY SHAMUS: It's a numbers game.

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:02.390
They just--

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:03.848
ELISE LOEHNEN: It's
a numbers game.

00:27:03.848 --> 00:27:07.430
Women and minorities, when
they advocate for themselves,

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:10.040
it doesn't always go well.

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:13.640
Men, when they advocate,
are seen as big hearted.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:14.930
It's positive.

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:20.180
So men need to start
advocating for it.

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:24.350
They need to make sure that
there are women in the room.

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:29.960
They need to model it and make
sure that that environment is

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.210
one that is ideally--

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:35.740
and this, it only works in
places like Goop and Google--

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:39.590
but that they're setting
reasonable work hours

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:41.660
and not inundating
people on the weekends,

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.430
and letting mothers
in particular

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:45.410
do their work when
they can do their work.

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:47.660
I mean, if you want
something done, ask a mom.

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:48.605
I don't know any mom--

00:27:48.605 --> 00:27:49.010
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: A busy mom.

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:51.200
ELISE LOEHNEN: Yeah,
who falls down on that.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.390
But it has to start.

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:55.425
It has to be that
sort of conversation.

00:27:55.425 --> 00:27:57.050
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
Do the men take it?

00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:58.640
I'm wondering, at
Goop and at Google,

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.680
do they take maternity,
or paternity?

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.949
Because I think that that's
another issue, is that they're

00:28:03.949 --> 00:28:05.240
eh, they'll take a week or two.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.823
And again, I don't
mean to stereotype,

00:28:06.823 --> 00:28:09.110
but are they modeling it?

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:12.250
Are they taking it, or
are they seen as somehow

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:14.460
weaker if they actually use it?

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.610
AMY SHAMUS: So I don't
know the stats on that.

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:18.560
I'm sure we can get it.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:22.730
But I do know that my husband,
he works for a different tech

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:26.320
company, and he did take
his two paternity leaves.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.160
Thank you very much.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.690
That's a gift
we'll all certainly

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:30.820
never want to give back.

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:34.130
And I know my brother-in-law
works at Google,

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:36.220
and will be taking
his paternity leave.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.650
So it certainly
is becoming more--

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:39.150
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
It's encouraged.

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:39.890
AMY SHAMUS: It's
certainly encouraged.

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:41.182
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: The
culture encourage-- well,

00:28:41.182 --> 00:28:42.180
you guys are the cutting edge.

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:43.513
I mean, you are leading the way.

00:28:43.513 --> 00:28:46.750
AMY SHAMUS: But even for us--
and I am much more glass half

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:48.460
full, so I see us as being--

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:50.710
it's such a wonderful
experience in the amount of time

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:51.630
we get off.

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:54.280
But even two weeks
ago when my son was--

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.830
who turned one, there
was a gal in Canada

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:57.910
who I was chatting with.

00:28:57.910 --> 00:28:59.440
And her son also
just turned one,

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.231
and she just got back
from maternity leave.

00:29:01.231 --> 00:29:02.450
And she too works at Google.

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:04.660
So it is very interesting.

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:07.340
And I certainly am so
happy to have what we have,

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.950
but it isn't perfect.

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:13.990
And what is the right amount
of time for a woman to have off

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:15.490
is obviously
different per woman.

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:19.197
But we should have a
larger spectrum of--

00:29:19.197 --> 00:29:20.530
ELISE LOEHNEN: That's the thing.

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:23.755
I mean, I'm, in some ways, not
maybe a good representative.

00:29:23.755 --> 00:29:27.860
But when I had my
second child, it was--

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:30.905
this'll probably
drive you crazy.

00:29:30.905 --> 00:29:35.440
It was an incredibly busy time,
and I just brought him to work.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.110
I stayed home for
six weeks, and then

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:40.820
I just brought my baby to
work for eight weeks, I think.

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:41.619
And it was awesome.

00:29:41.619 --> 00:29:43.160
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
Did anybody care?

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.080
ELISE LOEHNEN: No,
everyone loved it.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.850
I mean, he just was
like the office baby.

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:48.160
He'd be napping in
everyone's arms.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:51.210
I'd nurse him at work.

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:54.280
And sure, if it had
been a different time,

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.350
I would have stayed
away for longer.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:58.390
But that worked for
me, and what also

00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:02.450
works for me is if I
need to go to the doctor,

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:04.780
I go to the doctor
without guilt.

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.490
Or he goes to a
co-op nursery school,

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:10.850
so I work at the school
one day a month, et cetera.

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:14.940
That's what I need, is prolonged
and constant flexibility.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.440
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
That's the word.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:16.880
ELISE LOEHNEN: Yeah.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:17.500
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
That's the word.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:20.000
ELISE LOEHNEN: And I
definitely get my job done,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.909
but it has to be within the
confines of a flexible--

00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:26.200
and I am fine with that for
my whole team, many of whom

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:26.741
are not moms.

00:30:26.741 --> 00:30:30.310
I'm like, I don't care
if you are in Alaska

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:31.480
and your work is done.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.340
Like--

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:32.700
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Fine.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:34.280
AMY SHAMUS: Yeah,
more power to you.

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.640
Yeah, flexibility
is certainly key.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.290
So before I open up
to Q&amp;A, because I'm

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:39.789
sure a lot of people
have questions,

00:30:39.789 --> 00:30:42.760
and we have some questions that
will be coming from online,

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.020
one of my last
questions is how do we

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:49.720
de-stigmatize or normalize
postpartum anxiety

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.830
or postpartum depression?

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:54.047
How can we make it a more
welcome environment for women

00:30:54.047 --> 00:30:55.630
to talk about it,
not only at a center

00:30:55.630 --> 00:31:00.430
or behind closed doors with
their managers or girlfriends?

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:02.340
Is it simply just
talking about it?

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:03.700
Is it men talking about it?

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.920
Is it women without
children talking about it--

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:06.120
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Everybody.

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.330
AMY SHAMUS: --because
they've seen it?

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:09.246
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
Talking, talking, talking.

00:31:09.246 --> 00:31:12.430
Cannot talk enough about
it to help people feel--

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:16.510
to normalize the
transition, that it's hard,

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:19.210
to validate their
varied experiences.

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:20.900
It's different for everyone.

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:25.870
But talking is key, and in
a non-judgmental way, right.

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:27.640
There's no judgment,
right, whether you

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:32.140
work outside the home or
work inside, wherever it is.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.880
People are different,
and we want

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.790
to respect their different
experiences vis a vis

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:37.840
motherhood, parenthood.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:42.102
And so just in a way, just
being curious, right asking,

00:31:42.102 --> 00:31:43.060
how's it going for you?

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:47.394
I always say, doctors don't
like to not know answers.

00:31:47.394 --> 00:31:49.060
And they'll say, well,
I don't ask women

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:51.340
about postpartum
anxiety or depression

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.644
because I don't treat it.

00:31:52.644 --> 00:31:53.810
I'm not the expert like you.

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:54.809
I don't know what to do.

00:31:54.809 --> 00:31:57.100
And I said, oh god, we
have a long way to go.

00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:00.010
But you don't have to know what
scales, what questions to ask.

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:02.920
Just look them in the
eye, hold their gaze,

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.900
and say, how are you?

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.600
And don't move,
and look at them.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.220
And often people
burst into tears.

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.770
They'll be like, no one's
asked how I am, right.

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:14.160
It's all about this
cute little baby, right.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.420
But you've got to just
look someone in the eye,

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.340
just have a real
conversation, not like hey,

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:20.298
how are you doing, oh
it's great, right, right.

00:32:20.298 --> 00:32:20.950
Wrong.

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:23.260
Just have the conversation.

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.762
Just have a real conversation.

00:32:24.762 --> 00:32:26.220
AMY SHAMUS: I
absolutely love that.

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.900
And I was talking to a teammate
of mine about something

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.465
very similar with just ask.

00:32:30.465 --> 00:32:33.090
You might feel uncomfortable or
you might not know what to ask,

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:36.970
but just do exactly
what you said.

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:39.340
A few months ago, I was
listening to the Oprah Winfrey

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:41.590
podcast and she was
interviewing Sheryl Sandberg.

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:44.530
And she was talking about--
obviously her husband died,

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:47.620
and people were, with
trepidation, circling

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:48.160
the issue.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.590
And she said, I'm always
thinking about it,

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:52.820
so you can always ask me.

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:55.120
And while this,
becoming a mother,

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.400
is a much happier thing,
but you can always

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.320
ask me how I'm doing
because I'm always

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.580
thinking about my children.

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:02.230
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: And you
don't have to know what to say.

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.990
That's the thing.

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:05.510
You can even say, I don't
really know how to ask you this,

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:07.030
but I know you're--

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:07.430
AMY SHAMUS: How are you doing?

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:08.650
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
Yeah, how are you doing?

00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:09.520
And you don't have
to know the answer.

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.970
You can Google it.

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:12.730
ELISE LOEHNEN: We
do something at Goop

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:15.550
on occasion for meetings where
we just quickly go around

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:18.790
the room and people say,
either personal and work,

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:20.710
or combination, or
however you want to do it,

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:22.540
are you red, yellow, green.

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:26.840
And it's very helpful just to,
one-- and people can explain,

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.520
or they don't have to explain.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:30.710
But I think it also,
in any context--

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:33.950
it gives greater context
to any interaction of just

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:37.370
like, I might be red, because
maybe I was up all night

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:38.510
with a sick kid.

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:42.510
And it I might not be in a
great mood, and it's not you.

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:45.550
But I think it also creates a--

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:48.360
it's important what
happens at home,

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.780
and the two are so
intermingled now.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:53.670
AMY SHAMUS: Yeah, and also
at home when you get home

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:55.460
with asking your partner.

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:57.950
You red, yellow, or green?

00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:01.390
OK, any questions
in the audience?

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:02.976
OK, too shy?

00:34:02.976 --> 00:34:04.100
We've got some on the Dory.

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:05.360
ELISE LOEHNEN: We just
answered everyone's questions.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.151
AMY SHAMUS: I know.

00:34:06.151 --> 00:34:07.800
No, we have lots coming.

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.409
So OK, first one on here.

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:11.929
"What can husbands do
to support their spouse

00:34:11.929 --> 00:34:14.330
when they're suffering
from postpartum depression?

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:16.730
Even later, when my wife
seems to have come out of it

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:18.590
but isn't 100% of
her earlier self,

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:20.840
can I do anything to make
her feel better, outside

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.570
of the medical help she
is and was getting?"

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:24.290
Great question.

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:26.370
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
Awesome question.

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:28.183
I think you can ask.

00:34:28.183 --> 00:34:31.639
People don't often, or won't,
volunteer what they need.

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:34.730
But I'll often say,
we're not mind readers.

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:35.690
Ask.

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:37.020
How can I help you?

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:38.179
What can I do for you?

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:38.960
And observe.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.750
See what she's struggling
with, where are areas

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:42.949
in which you can be helpful.

00:34:42.949 --> 00:34:46.639
But you may not know.

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:49.010
You know the love languages?

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:52.670
You may not know what would
feel cared for for her

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:53.429
and vise versa.

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:54.710
So you're asking.

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:56.120
So what can I do to help you?

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.040
You don't seem
entirely yourself.

00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.340
What am I missing?

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.770
What are we not doing here?

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:03.620
Are you getting-- are there
ways in which you can help

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:05.450
her get to the help she needs?

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:07.910
Is she getting
mental health help?

00:35:10.991 --> 00:35:11.990
Are the needs being met?

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:15.180
Because you can feel--

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:19.970
with proper treatment,
everyone feels better,

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:21.110
and everyone gets well.

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:22.568
And a lot of times,
women will say,

00:35:22.568 --> 00:35:24.140
I feel even better
than I ever felt.

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:26.720
Because maybe they had
a simmering depression

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.670
or they'd always been
chronically anxious,

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:32.150
and it didn't come to light
until they were postpartum,

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:34.100
and then it just blew up.

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:36.530
So I think sometimes
with proper treatment,

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:38.070
you really can be even better.

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:41.510
So if that's not the
case, continue to persist.

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:42.980
Don't ever give up.

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:46.190
If you feel like your
wife's come out of it,

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:48.420
but is not quite there,
just don't give up.

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:50.840
Keep pushing until you get
to a place that feels right,

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:53.240
feels comfortable.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.710
AMY SHAMUS: Great question.

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:56.240
OK.

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.220
"Coming back to work with
postpartum depression

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:00.110
is very hard, but
often times colleagues

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:02.060
don't know what they can do.

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.670
What would you recommend
for manager colleagues

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:06.414
to do to help?"

00:36:06.414 --> 00:36:08.580
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: These
are really good questions.

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:09.750
I wish I could ask that per--

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:10.862
I don't know if
they can hear me.

00:36:10.862 --> 00:36:12.445
AMY SHAMUS: Yeah,
they can everything.

00:36:12.445 --> 00:36:14.060
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: OK.

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:15.050
Do people know?

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:16.650
I mean, that's the thing.

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:20.150
Are you, who's asking the
question, willing to share?

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:24.069
Again, we're sharers
up here, clearly.

00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:26.360
And I don't know that you
have to give all the details,

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.943
but I think if you're
willing-- again,

00:36:27.943 --> 00:36:31.060
this is part of what brings it
out, is to say, I struggled.

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:32.060
You don't have to give--

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.520
just I struggled,
or I'm struggling.

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.295
And then your manager--

00:36:36.295 --> 00:36:37.670
and then you can
think about ways

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:39.920
to assist your
manager helping you.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.960
It would be great if
you could help me with,

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:44.750
or if I could run out to a
pediatrician or appointment,

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:48.710
or you know what, I'm actually
getting treatment for my blank.

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:51.630
Would it be OK with you if I
left for these appointments,

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:52.130
right.

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:53.110
You have to ask.

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:54.964
You have to ask.

00:36:54.964 --> 00:36:55.880
And you have to teach.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.380
You have to help
people help you.

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:01.140
So I think that if you're
willing to share-- and again,

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:03.920
you don't have to go
down to the TMI rabbit

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:07.655
hole of every detail, but
just, I've been struggling.

00:37:07.655 --> 00:37:11.490
So would it be OK if, right.

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:13.560
And anyone says no to that?

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:14.112
I mean.

00:37:14.112 --> 00:37:14.820
AMY SHAMUS: Yeah.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:15.972
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Yeah.

00:37:15.972 --> 00:37:16.680
AMY SHAMUS: Yeah.

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.660
Great question.

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:21.570
"Could you recommend lifestyle
best practices, specifically

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:23.697
diet, nutrition,
supplements, exercise,

00:37:23.697 --> 00:37:25.155
et cetera, to help
replenish moms?"

00:37:25.155 --> 00:37:26.529
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: That's you.

00:37:26.529 --> 00:37:27.570
You're the queen of that.

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:28.486
ELISE LOEHNEN: I know.

00:37:28.486 --> 00:37:29.820
I'm the doctor on this platform.

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:31.985
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: You're
the lifestyle [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:31.985 --> 00:37:33.030
ELISE LOEHNEN: Yeah.

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:39.790
So generally, my advice would
be to get your doctor, or go--

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:41.457
what's it called, One Medical?

00:37:41.457 --> 00:37:42.790
AMY SHAMUS: So One Medical here.

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:45.910
Again, fortunately for us,
Google has amazing benefits.

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:47.969
And One Medical is now
our wellness center.

00:37:47.969 --> 00:37:50.260
So I'm sure you're going to
say, get your panel tested.

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:51.430
ELISE LOEHNEN: Get
your panel tested.

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:53.096
AMY SHAMUS: Which I
did, and you can do.

00:37:53.096 --> 00:37:55.180
ELISE LOEHNEN: Yeah,
so most likely, I mean,

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:57.880
omegas, so like
really good fish oil.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.560
You can't really take
too much of that.

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:07.150
Vitamin D, vitamin B, magnesium,
iron, that's probably baseline.

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:11.560
And then you get your
hormones checked.

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.734
Make sure your thyroid
is functioning.

00:38:13.734 --> 00:38:15.400
And you'll want to
work with your doctor

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:19.180
to address it or tinker with it
if it's not, because that can--

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:22.840
a lot of autoimmune disease
flares up postnatally

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:28.030
for women, and you
want to curb it.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:30.686
There's this autoimmune
spectrum that a lot of doctors

00:38:30.686 --> 00:38:31.810
are starting to talk about.

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:33.336
Like, you don't
get that diagnosis

00:38:33.336 --> 00:38:34.960
of Hashimoto's until
you've essentially

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.800
destroyed your thyroid.

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:37.174
But there are a
lot of things you

00:38:37.174 --> 00:38:41.560
can do in the interim to help.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:43.480
Exercise, it's really hard.

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:46.450
Exercise is really
hard for new moms.

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:50.827
You're nursing, you're
leaking, you're incontinent.

00:38:50.827 --> 00:38:52.160
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: It's so fun.

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:54.040
ELISE LOEHNEN: It's so awesome.

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:58.870
And I'd say I would try to find
someone who can really help you

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:00.350
with your pelvic floor.

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:02.710
I am from Goop, guys.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:05.080
And in Europe, it's mandated.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:08.560
You get an app.

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.800
They are getting your pelvic
floor back into shape.

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.570
But I would definitely
focus on that,

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:16.687
because you don't want
a prolapsed uterus

00:39:16.687 --> 00:39:18.520
or bladder later in
life, and you definitely

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.130
want to be able
to hold your pee.

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:23.170
You can jump on a Rebounder too.

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:24.790
That's really helpful.

00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:26.880
But there are a lot
of physical therapists

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:32.350
who will work on your pelvic
floor and also help you--

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:34.180
like for me, because
I came to Goop

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.124
after I became a
mom, like a year out,

00:39:36.124 --> 00:39:38.290
I went to work with this
woman, Lauren Roxburgh, who

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:40.330
does a lot of film
rolling content with us.

00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:42.590
And I was still holding
myself like I was pregnant,

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:44.050
which is very common.

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:46.210
But just this--

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:47.140
I looked pregnant.

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:50.680
And so she got me
back into alignment,

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:54.132
which you can do through
Pilates or physical therapy.

00:39:54.132 --> 00:39:57.070
But your organs are all
out of whack and stuff.

00:39:57.070 --> 00:40:00.087
And your body will come
back, but you can help.

00:40:00.087 --> 00:40:02.170
There are a lot of things
that you can do to help.

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:03.628
AMY SHAMUS: I'm by
no means expert,

00:40:03.628 --> 00:40:05.290
but do read a lot of content.

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:07.600
And I would say, you
mentioned Alejandro Junger

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.766
who, eight years ago,
significantly changed my life.

00:40:10.766 --> 00:40:12.140
My mom has an
autoimmune disease,

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:14.590
which is what brought me to
this whole wellness thing.

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:18.241
And doing the clean every
year I think is so important.

00:40:18.241 --> 00:40:20.740
And I know it's so hard to get
your mind over not being able

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:23.050
to, for me, drink
alcohol-- well,

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:25.090
just wine-- but drink
a little bit of wine

00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:26.680
and have a piece of pizza.

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:27.610
But it's 21 days.

00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:28.690
You can certainly do it.

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:29.770
You have given birth.

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:30.490
You can do--

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:30.880
ELISE LOEHNEN: It's easy too.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.140
AMY SHAMUS: --a 21-day cleanse.

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:33.190
ELISE LOEHNEN: And
it's nourishing.

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:34.590
It's not about deprivation.

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:36.730
It's not a calorie thing at all.

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:39.680
You can shove as much
stuff into your smoothies.

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.170
You can snack if you're hungry.

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:42.707
AMY SHAMUS: High fat, filling.

00:40:42.707 --> 00:40:43.540
ELISE LOEHNEN: Yeah.

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:46.551
It's all about eliminating
potential things

00:40:46.551 --> 00:40:47.800
that might be aggravating you.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.675
So it's also really good
if you need to know,

00:40:49.675 --> 00:40:50.980
am I tolerant of gluten?

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:53.620
Am I tolerant of dairy?

00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:55.630
And there are supplements
that go with it.

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:59.920
For after my first one,
it profoundly shifted me,

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:00.820
and it reset.

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:01.600
I didn't lose--

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.880
I lost like two pounds
when I did it, 21 days.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:07.010
And then after, I just
dropped all my weight.

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:07.750
It was weird.

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:09.670
It just reset me.

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:10.550
But I agree.

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:13.302
It's two shakes,
breakfast and dinner.

00:41:13.302 --> 00:41:15.010
And it's actually
really nice not to have

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:18.540
to make dinner for 21 days.

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.290
AMY SHAMUS: And yeah,
he's just wonderful.

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:22.373
He has a lot of different
resources out there too.

00:41:22.373 --> 00:41:25.522
So for diet, I would
strongly recommend his stuff.

00:41:25.522 --> 00:41:26.730
ELISE LOEHNEN: He's the best.

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:27.820
AMY SHAMUS: Yeah.

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:31.120
And then for exercise too,
what I found after my second,

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:33.610
especially right away, was
it was very hard to get out,

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:34.900
especially finding classes.

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:35.750
I'm a class person.

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:38.535
I love Orange Theory and
Bar Method and hot Pilates.

00:41:38.535 --> 00:41:40.160
But how do I get
there if he's supposed

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.250
to be nursing at that
time and they're preset?

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:44.030
So I'm a big Bar Method fan.

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:46.690
And if you like bar,
I really, really

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:48.580
believe in it during pregnancy.

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:50.644
It just keeps everything
tight and nice,

00:41:50.644 --> 00:41:52.060
and it's not too
strenuous on you.

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:55.079
But they have online classes.

00:41:55.079 --> 00:41:56.620
And they're just as
good, I swear it.

00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:58.786
I'm not the type of person
who can work out at home,

00:41:58.786 --> 00:42:01.030
and this has really
changed for me, especially

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:02.130
because I travel for work.

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:03.220
ELISE LOEHNEN: YogaGlo,
I think you guys

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.261
have a program with them.

00:42:04.261 --> 00:42:04.874
They're good.

00:42:04.874 --> 00:42:06.290
There are a lot
of good streaming.

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:09.182
It's a good idea, YogaGlo,
Tracy Anderson, bar.

00:42:09.182 --> 00:42:10.390
AMY SHAMUS: [INAUDIBLE] good.

00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:11.980
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
Can I just say walking?

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:12.553
AMY SHAMUS: Yeah, walking.

00:42:12.553 --> 00:42:13.340
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
I'm a basic person.

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:14.210
ELISE LOEHNEN: What?

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:16.251
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Like
how am I doing the walk?

00:42:16.251 --> 00:42:19.600
I mean, I live in New York
City, so you can walk to work.

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:22.360
Just walking, like get
those 10,000 steps in.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.220
I'm so basic.

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:23.720
I can't--

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:24.660
AMY SHAMUS: No,
that's great, though.

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:25.050
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
--barely do it.

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:26.030
I was going to say, and
for the others, sleep.

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:27.300
ELISE LOEHNEN: You can
do it with your baby too.

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.380
Strap that baby on.

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:29.410
AMY SHAMUS: Yeah.

00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:31.520
OK.

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.340
"I had significant
postpartum depression

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:36.690
and took short term disability
leave after my maternity leave.

00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:38.280
Do you have advice
for sharing or not

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.814
sharing with colleagues why
I was on leave for so long?

00:42:40.814 --> 00:42:43.230
My colleagues assume I extended
my maternity leave and was

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:45.605
'lucky,' quote unquote, when
my experience was terrible."

00:42:45.605 --> 00:42:46.646
ELISE LOEHNEN: Oh my god.

00:42:46.646 --> 00:42:48.810
Just invite them to
stay home with the baby.

00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:51.858
I mean, even in
the best scenario.

00:42:51.858 --> 00:42:53.310
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Yeah.

00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:54.940
I think that's very personal.

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:57.840
I think you have to decide
how much you're willing to put

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.256
yourself out there.

00:42:59.256 --> 00:43:00.630
And again, I don't
think you have

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:04.320
to give all the information,
but if you're sensing

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.840
that people feel kind of--

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.990
are looking at you
kind of like, ugh, you

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:13.290
with the extra maternity
leave, you might,

00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:15.060
if you have the
opportunity, or maybe you

00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:17.010
make the opportunity
to address it, and say,

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:19.140
I had a really difficult time.

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:22.120
My extra leave really had
to do with a medical issue.

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:24.960
Again, postpartum
depression is a med--

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.240
mental illness is medical.

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.910
So this is a medical problem.

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:30.990
And when I write notes--

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:34.820
I do a lot of letters
for disability.

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:38.730
I may be a psychiatrist, but
these are medical problems.

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:41.520
And it has to be addressed as
such and considered as such.

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:45.219
And I think sharing that you
had a medical problem, which

00:43:45.219 --> 00:43:47.760
was why you were out, you don't
have to go into the details--

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.710
again, you can choose how
much you want to share.

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:52.650
But I think
reconceptualizing this

00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:54.870
as a medical issue is
important, because I think

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:56.200
that let's us off the hook.

00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:01.370
I'm not just weak or
defective, but this is really--

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:03.330
it's a real thing.

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:05.730
And you can say as
much or as little,

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:08.890
but I think that's up to how
much you're willing to share.

00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:09.630
AMY SHAMUS: Yeah.

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:11.592
It's so hard not to be
ashamed by it, though.

00:44:11.592 --> 00:44:13.050
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
Shame is-- ugh.

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:13.841
AMY SHAMUS: I know.

00:44:13.841 --> 00:44:15.090
How do we get rid of that?

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:15.495
ELISE LOEHNEN: Conversation.

00:44:15.495 --> 00:44:16.960
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
Yeah, we're doing it.

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.376
ELISE LOEHNEN: And
brave people, I

00:44:18.376 --> 00:44:21.210
think, stepping up and
saying, this happened to me,

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:25.795
and let's talk about it.

00:44:25.795 --> 00:44:27.379
Yeah, I know celebrities
are doing it.

00:44:27.379 --> 00:44:28.753
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
Yeah, I think

00:44:28.753 --> 00:44:30.800
the more we bring it into
general conversation,

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:33.440
the better, and
recognize that it's

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.562
a difficult time for anybody.

00:44:35.562 --> 00:44:36.770
It's not love at first sight.

00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:38.561
I mean, sometimes it
is, but a lot of times

00:44:38.561 --> 00:44:41.540
it takes a while before you
kind of fall in love with a kid,

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:45.110
or know what to do,
or feel comfortable.

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:47.150
ELISE LOEHNEN: Do
you have postpartum--

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:49.380
are there support groups here?

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:50.747
AMY SHAMUS: I don't know.

00:44:50.747 --> 00:44:51.580
ELISE LOEHNEN: Yeah?

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:53.420
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
Ooh, excellent.

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:54.378
If not, we'll help you.

00:44:54.378 --> 00:44:56.800
AMY SHAMUS: Do we have
a go-link for that?

00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.009
Sorry, getting the benefits--

00:44:58.009 --> 00:44:59.466
SPEAKER 1: There's
no [INAUDIBLE]..

00:44:59.466 --> 00:45:02.015
If you just Google [? Mama ?]
Moms Support Group, though.

00:45:02.015 --> 00:45:02.640
AMY SHAMUS: OK.

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.180
[? Mama ?] Mom's Support Group.

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:06.471
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: It's so
important to find a cohort.

00:45:06.471 --> 00:45:08.140
I think that it's
very validating.

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:10.570
And then the shame level goes
down, because you're like,

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:11.440
you had that?

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:12.520
You feel this way?

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:17.080
And because it's hard to do, and
it's hard to be in the park--

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:19.530
I always say, women in the
park, they don't mean to lie--

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:20.700
or Instagram, whatever.

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:22.180
Everyone looks good.

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:25.310
So it's hard to sort of break
through that veneer of what

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:25.810
you think.

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:28.335
You think everybody else
has it easier, better.

00:45:28.335 --> 00:45:29.210
They know what to do.

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:34.080
And they're just as
terrified and unsure and--

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:35.030
AMY SHAMUS: Tired.

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:36.220
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
And tired, and how you

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:37.344
get the conversation going.

00:45:37.344 --> 00:45:40.960
So when you have a
moms group, hopefully,

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:44.320
it's a group where there's
honesty and authenticity, where

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.690
you can really share and
validate each other so that you

00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:48.399
can say yeah, it's really hard.

00:45:48.399 --> 00:45:49.690
ELISE LOEHNEN: And pre-sharing.

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:55.680
I think, too, I'm very vocal
about my experience as a mom.

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:59.287
And I feel like people need
to talk about it to people

00:45:59.287 --> 00:46:01.120
who are pregnant or
thinking about it, being

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.119
like there's just some--

00:46:02.119 --> 00:46:05.915
I mean, I was so mad at my
friends when I had my baby.

00:46:05.915 --> 00:46:08.290
And I was like, why did no
one tell me this, any of this?

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:09.956
AMY SHAMUS: We didn't
want to scare you.

00:46:09.956 --> 00:46:12.100
ELISE LOEHNEN:
Hemorrhoids, and--

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:13.840
you're like, heads up.

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:16.530
I could have-- sorry.

00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:18.077
AMY SHAMUS: No, no.

00:46:18.077 --> 00:46:20.410
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: But that
goes for the emotional too.

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:21.325
AMY SHAMUS: Amen.

00:46:21.325 --> 00:46:23.290
ELISE LOEHNEN: But no
one talks about it,

00:46:23.290 --> 00:46:27.200
and so you are left,
again, in shame.

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.160
AMY SHAMUS: Yeah, I
always say, I give--

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:31.020
ELISE LOEHNEN: Get the
Tucks pads in bulk.

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:32.370
AMY SHAMUS: Yeah.

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:34.390
Well, do you see even
Chrissy Teigen just

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:38.320
posted right after she had
the second baby, Asian pear

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:39.020
underwear.

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:41.490
So the little mesh netting
sometimes you see on pears,

00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:43.180
she put a picture of
herself postpartum

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.860
with the hospital underwear on.

00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:48.060
And I mean, the comments
on it were just, yeah,

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:49.700
why is no one
talking about this?

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:52.660
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Well,
actually, a co-author and I

00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:56.590
are writing a new book called
"How Come no One Told Me?"

00:46:56.590 --> 00:46:59.290
because that is the refrain.

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:02.950
And it's the emotional side
of pregnancy and postpartum,

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:04.570
because no one talks about it.

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:06.820
So the idea is, all these
questions are actually

00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:07.720
answered in the book.

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:10.660
We talk about from the
minute you're pregnant,

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:13.450
and what you don't know
and what you need to know.

00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:15.280
It's the need to know stuff.

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.440
What "What to Expect"
did for the physical,

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.824
we want to do for the emotional.

00:47:19.824 --> 00:47:22.240
AMY SHAMUS: And that comes out
to in a year, next Mother's

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:22.390
Day.

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:23.540
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
Yep, that's right.

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:24.070
2019.

00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:25.861
AMY SHAMUS: Everybody
get planning on that.

00:47:25.861 --> 00:47:28.432
I always say I'm
certainly somebody

00:47:28.432 --> 00:47:30.640
that folks come to when
they're about to get pregnant

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:31.750
or they get--

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:33.590
and I've got the whole
email and everything.

00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:35.410
I tailor it to
every single person,

00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:38.950
but I always start it off with
saying, oh, it's the best.

00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:41.020
It's the worst,
but it's the best.

00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:42.020
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: It's
the best and the worst.

00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:43.490
ELISE LOEHNEN: It's
the craziest learning--

00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:44.830
the learning curve is intense.

00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:47.050
AMY SHAMUS: And the pendulum
swings some days really

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:48.590
quickly in between
those two things,

00:47:48.590 --> 00:47:51.190
and sometimes stays for
longer in the euphoria.

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:52.000
But it is.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.020
And if people care
to ask, I will say,

00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:56.353
here's why it's the best, and
here's why it's the worst.

00:47:56.353 --> 00:47:58.739
But oftentimes people
don't always want to know.

00:47:58.739 --> 00:48:00.530
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
And can they retain it?

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:02.155
That's the other
thing I always wonder,

00:48:02.155 --> 00:48:04.660
because when I used to go give
lectures to the new parents

00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:07.619
group, I had to bust my
way in in the hospital.

00:48:07.619 --> 00:48:09.160
I would say, can I
come and just give

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.990
a little preview of what
postpartum might be like?

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:12.573
And they're like,
no, because we don't

00:48:12.573 --> 00:48:13.930
want to scare those people.

00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:14.755
Really?

00:48:14.755 --> 00:48:17.920
We have to tell people what
it could be like, and not

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.600
think of that as--

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:21.894
I felt like the grim
reaper, as opposed to just,

00:48:21.894 --> 00:48:22.935
this is just information.

00:48:22.935 --> 00:48:24.370
AMY SHAMUS: Oh yeah,
just being honest.

00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:24.786
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Yeah.

00:48:24.786 --> 00:48:25.620
AMY SHAMUS: Yeah.

00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:27.620
OK.

00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:29.170
"At almost nine
months postpartum,

00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:32.017
I still feel a loss
of time with my LO--"

00:48:32.017 --> 00:48:33.100
ELISE LOEHNEN: Little one.

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:34.727
AMY SHAMUS: Little one, aww.

00:48:34.727 --> 00:48:35.560
"--when I'm at work.

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:37.900
What can I do to feel
better about being at work?

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:40.420
Trying to rationalize it, I
need to work for my family,

00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:43.480
but it's not helping with the
sadness of lost opportunity

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.354
cost, time with my baby."

00:48:45.354 --> 00:48:46.746
ELISE LOEHNEN: Mm.

00:48:46.746 --> 00:48:48.560
AMY SHAMUS: I know, so it's--

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.050
ELISE LOEHNEN: Yeah.

00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:52.690
It's hard.

00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:54.844
I mean, but it's also--

00:48:54.844 --> 00:48:57.010
I always talk about how I
think about it for myself,

00:48:57.010 --> 00:49:00.470
which I also definitely need
to work, and I do love to work.

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:03.550
One, I'm like, the
universe has created

00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:05.920
enough of a support network
for me to be able to work,

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:07.570
and I'm going to lean into that.

00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:08.560
I love my nanny.

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:12.760
She is like my mother,
everyone's mother.

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.290
And so that makes
me feel better,

00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:16.350
that my child is
surrounded by love.

00:49:16.350 --> 00:49:18.940
But also, I'm like,
I need to model.

00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:21.160
I'm going to model
for my boys what

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:23.090
it is to have a mom who works.

00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:27.000
I feel on some spiritual,
karmic-- like they chose me.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.690
They get it.

00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:33.880
And this might not be true
of you, but I am not--

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:36.070
I wasn't put here--

00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:41.170
I'm not like a on the
floor, playing mom.

00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:43.240
I've let myself off
the hook for that.

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:49.100
But also, I'm good at
work, and I'm a good mom.

00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:49.975
And it's not perfect.

00:49:49.975 --> 00:49:55.560
It doesn't look perfect,
but I think it's

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:57.120
allowing for the messiness.

00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:01.030
And you have to let
yourself off the hook.

00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:02.820
It's not lost opportunity.

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:04.920
It's like you are
also having a life.

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:06.690
You're showing your
kids that there's

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:10.900
more outside of the world than
them too, which is important.

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:14.082
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: And I would
add quality over quantity.

00:50:14.082 --> 00:50:14.790
AMY SHAMUS: Yeah.

00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:17.610
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Which
is cliche, but very true,

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:19.010
or at least I tell myself that.

00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:20.020
And it sounds like--

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:24.540
I mean, it's important that
when you're with them-- look,

00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:28.320
if you're with them and you're
lamenting the loss of time,

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:30.810
or you're having regret
when you're with them,

00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:32.670
or you're so guilty
when you're with them,

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:34.160
then there's a
different problem.

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.889
Then you've got to
address that, right.

00:50:35.889 --> 00:50:37.930
You're not able to put it
aside and be with them.

00:50:37.930 --> 00:50:39.930
So when you're there, be there.

00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:41.910
And when you're at
work, be at work.

00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:43.710
And you can still
be checking in,

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:46.320
but you have to be
present where you are.

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:48.700
And then when you're home
with them, be with them.

00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:54.030
But if that's hard, then you
have to work through this,

00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:57.270
because most people aren't
home with their kids.

00:50:57.270 --> 00:51:01.950
I mean, in our country, two
working families is the norm.

00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:06.460
And I don't think kids are
any worse off because of it.

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:09.360
I think to your point,
modeling and showing them.

00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:14.882
I remember so distinctly when
my older daughter was four,

00:51:14.882 --> 00:51:15.840
she was in the bathtub.

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:17.090
I was running to the hospital.

00:51:17.090 --> 00:51:20.400
I was on call, and I said,
ugh, I have to go to work.

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.940
I'm so sorry to leave you.

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:25.460
And she looked at me and
said, why do you say that?

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:26.390
You like your job.

00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:27.770
You like it.

00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:31.204
And I thought, oh my god,
she let me off the hook.

00:51:31.204 --> 00:51:32.870
And I thought, don't
do this to my kids.

00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:34.160
Don't make them--

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:34.850
She's right.

00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:36.020
I love what I do.

00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:38.270
And I love to work,
and I love my kids,

00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:40.020
and I love to be at
home when I'm at home.

00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:42.451
But I would not be a
good stay at home mom.

00:51:42.451 --> 00:51:43.200
I'd be a disaster.

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:43.760
ELISE LOEHNEN: Me too.

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:44.600
AMY SHAMUS: It's
the hardest job.

00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:45.140
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Hardest job.

00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:46.230
I have such admiration.

00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:47.900
And the women who
stay home and do this,

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:50.180
and want to do it and
love doing it, great.

00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:51.510
It's just complicated.

00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:54.920
You have to figure out whatever
the formula is for yourself,

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:58.070
and there's no right,
wrong, or perfection.

00:51:58.070 --> 00:52:00.110
It's just you've got to
figure out what works

00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:02.730
for you in your family context.

00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:05.390
But the guilt, enough,
the regret, the shame.

00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:07.940
It's so wasteful.

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:10.070
ELISE LOEHNEN: I went
to this moms group

00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:12.800
after I had my first,
and she said something

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.330
that I really needed to hear.

00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:16.480
And she was like, think
about your childhood

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:18.560
and your happiest memories.

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:21.680
And my happiest memories
were running wild

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.690
in the woods with my brother.

00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:25.160
I grew up in Montana.

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:27.470
And she was like, how many
of your happiest memories

00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:29.870
were your parents
in attendance for?

00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:31.774
And not that many.

00:52:31.774 --> 00:52:33.690
I have amazing parents,
and they were present.

00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:37.509
But she was like, your
child, unfortunately, you

00:52:37.509 --> 00:52:39.300
are at the center of
their world right now,

00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:41.850
but their life extends
far beyond you.

00:52:41.850 --> 00:52:43.920
And you don't need
to put yourself

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:47.910
in the center of their
story constantly.

00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:50.880
They have their own
lives, which is difficult.

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:54.090
It kind of broke my heart,
but I needed to hear it.

00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:57.460
AMY SHAMUS: And I will say
that we do have resources,

00:52:57.460 --> 00:53:00.810
so if you are feeling
still really down about it

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:04.740
and missing your child,
to talk to your manager,

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:07.170
talk about a flexible
schedule if that's possible.

00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:07.960
I agree with you.

00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:11.250
We live in Bay
Area, New York, LA.

00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:13.269
A double working
household is very common,

00:53:13.269 --> 00:53:15.060
and yet the culture
hasn't kept up with it.

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:16.710
I always say,
school ends at 2:00?

00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:18.960
Who's going to pick my kid--
work doesn't end at 2:00.

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:19.918
What is this all about?

00:53:19.918 --> 00:53:23.310
So things hopefully
shift and change.

00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:25.360
But there is
flexibility at Google,

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:28.170
so hopefully you can talk
to your manager about it.

00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:32.100
Let's do one more and then
we can close things out.

00:53:34.744 --> 00:53:37.035
So-- I know, I want to do
two more because the next one

00:53:37.035 --> 00:53:37.490
looks really good.

00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:38.960
But OK, "Can you
speak more to how

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:41.330
physical health and
lifestyle behaviors impact

00:53:41.330 --> 00:53:43.550
mental health?"

00:53:43.550 --> 00:53:46.110
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
So intertwined.

00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:48.860
I think that it's probably
false that we separate them.

00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:50.330
AMY SHAMUS: Oh, absolutely.

00:53:50.330 --> 00:53:52.330
And that's what "The
Clarity Cleanse" is about.

00:53:52.330 --> 00:53:53.620
So great question.

00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:56.780
I would certainly read it.

00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:59.029
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
Yeah, I think--

00:53:59.029 --> 00:54:00.070
ELISE LOEHNEN: Vitamin B.

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:01.611
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
Vitamin B, right.

00:54:01.611 --> 00:54:06.140
I think you want to be
physically well so and not so

00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:06.680
stressed.

00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:09.350
You want to minimize
stress, maximize self-care,

00:54:09.350 --> 00:54:10.390
taking care of yourself.

00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:11.450
It's not selfish.

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:14.300
It is self preserving,
self nourishing.

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:16.730
Like the oxygen mask, you're
no good to anybody else

00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:18.260
if you're not OK.

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:21.170
But you're no good to yourself
if you're not physically well

00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:25.820
enough, and I think that helps
you be as mentally well enough.

00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:27.320
Again, you don't
have to be perfect.

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:29.120
Everything doesn't
have to be exact.

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:33.785
But I think that they're
just so intertwined

00:54:33.785 --> 00:54:35.450
that you have to address both.

00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:38.180
And I think that becomes a
problem, because people--

00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:41.210
everyone knows to work
out, go to the gym.

00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:41.900
I'll be walking.

00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:44.650
Everyone else can be in the gym.

00:54:44.650 --> 00:54:47.450
But mental health has
to also be addressed.

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:49.580
I said to someone the
other day, who said, wait,

00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:51.552
is therapy like
gym for your mind?

00:54:51.552 --> 00:54:53.260
It's like going to
the gym for your mind.

00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:53.520
Yeah.

00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:54.680
AMY SHAMUS: It's like
brushing your teeth.

00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:55.763
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Right?

00:54:55.763 --> 00:54:58.460
So OK, not everyone's going
to go to therapy, though I

00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:00.237
kind of think they should.

00:55:00.237 --> 00:55:01.070
AMY SHAMUS: I agree.

00:55:01.070 --> 00:55:03.278
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: I think
almost anyone can use it,

00:55:03.278 --> 00:55:04.520
because we all have pasts.

00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:05.549
We all have baggage.

00:55:05.549 --> 00:55:08.090
We all have things to work out,
so that we don't revisit them

00:55:08.090 --> 00:55:11.000
on our children, as
we're talking about.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.470
And I think that you want to be
as well emotionally, mentally,

00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:16.160
as you can.

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:17.900
And that will help
your physical health.

00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:19.760
They work in concert.

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:23.390
And to ignore one, or to
only focus on the other

00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:24.440
is short sighted.

00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:25.550
AMY SHAMUS: Yeah.

00:55:25.550 --> 00:55:30.170
And again with Google, go
to MoMA and look up Concern.

00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:35.020
We have programs that we can
certainly get therapy sessions,

00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:36.020
and it's really helpful.

00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:38.120
I personally use it and
talk about it openly,

00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:40.232
because I think
it's so important.

00:55:40.232 --> 00:55:41.690
And there have been
many times when

00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:42.890
I've been talking to my
husband and I'm like,

00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:43.750
I'm on my way therapy.

00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:44.480
I nothing to say.

00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:46.666
And then I leave like, that was
the best session I've ever had.

00:55:46.666 --> 00:55:47.900
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: It's better
when you have nothing to say.

00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:48.560
AMY SHAMUS: It is.

00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:49.700
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Can I
just put a plug in for that?

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:51.105
It's not about the content.

00:55:51.105 --> 00:55:52.230
It's about everything else.

00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:54.090
AMY SHAMUS: Yeah.

00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:55.780
Anyway, so great
question, though.

00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:59.450
And then last, "You mentioned
that this can affect dads too.

00:55:59.450 --> 00:56:02.630
My husband has had severe
depression and anxiety

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:05.750
since the birth of our twins,
despite medication and therapy.

00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:07.040
He feels very isolated.

00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:09.560
What resources are
available for dads,

00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:11.600
and what can I do
to help, especially

00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:13.749
when I'm struggling myself?"

00:56:13.749 --> 00:56:15.290
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
Awesome question.

00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:17.420
AMY SHAMUS: Great action.

00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:19.880
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: One
of my fellow board members

00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:23.210
at Postpartum Support
International, Danny Singley,

00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:24.290
this is his thing.

00:56:24.290 --> 00:56:28.790
He's in San Diego, I think,
but he's Mr. postpartum dad.

00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:31.649
He's a great guy and he
writes a ton about this.

00:56:31.649 --> 00:56:33.440
And we also have somebody
at the Motherhood

00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:37.400
Center, Chuck Schaeffer
who works with the dads.

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:38.720
It's really important.

00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:41.810
Again, dads who are
struggling need a cohort.

00:56:41.810 --> 00:56:45.740
They need other dads or other
partners who are struggling.

00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:49.520
And they need the validation,
need the treatment.

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:51.580
It sounds like he's
getting some treatment.

00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:52.770
But you need the resources.

00:56:52.770 --> 00:56:57.052
So I'd say, going back
to that, postpartum.net.

00:56:57.052 --> 00:56:58.760
That's the website
for Postpartum Support

00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:00.110
International.

00:57:00.110 --> 00:57:03.590
Dads are a big part
of it, families.

00:57:03.590 --> 00:57:06.890
Again, it started about moms,
but it's really families.

00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:09.110
And now we're big
into dads right,

00:57:09.110 --> 00:57:11.310
into helping dads find
the resources they need.

00:57:11.310 --> 00:57:14.870
There's a, I think it's a
weekly chat for dads online.

00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:15.920
So you can be anywhere.

00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:17.990
There are just great
resources on the website,

00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:20.600
so postpartum.net.

00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:22.190
Danny Singley, Chuck
Schaeffer, these

00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:23.690
are some of the
guys who are writing

00:57:23.690 --> 00:57:25.109
about it out there nationally.

00:57:25.109 --> 00:57:26.400
And there are others who do it.

00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:30.260
But again, search
for your community.

00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:34.070
And to the mom who's
also struggling,

00:57:34.070 --> 00:57:35.570
this is easy,
because sometimes you

00:57:35.570 --> 00:57:37.611
can't even get online to
look for it if you're so

00:57:37.611 --> 00:57:38.300
down and out.

00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:40.400
So if you can find
those resources,

00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:42.814
just help him get
to the resources.

00:57:42.814 --> 00:57:45.230
A place like Postpartum Support
International will take it

00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:46.540
from there, will help you.

00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:49.820
ELISE LOEHNEN: And remember, I
think that sleep deprivation is

00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:51.770
essentially a mental illness.

00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:53.430
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Totally.

00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:56.452
ELISE LOEHNEN: And I
think it puts everything

00:57:56.452 --> 00:57:57.410
in a different context.

00:57:57.410 --> 00:57:59.142
I mean, it creates crisis too.

00:57:59.142 --> 00:58:01.100
And there's nothing-- it
sucks, because there's

00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:03.391
nothing to really do about
it when you're trying-- when

00:58:03.391 --> 00:58:04.700
you have kids who don't sleep.

00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:06.470
But I think even
just remembering

00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:07.940
that in the back of your mind--

00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:09.040
AMY SHAMUS: It's not permanent.

00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:10.748
ELISE LOEHNEN: --that
it's not permanent,

00:58:10.748 --> 00:58:15.170
but that it is pernicious,
helps in terms of understanding

00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:17.710
what also might be going on.

00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:19.710
AMY SHAMUS: Thank you all
the people on the Dory

00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:22.300
for asking these very
personal questions.

00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:24.570
I'm realizing why
maybe people in person

00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:26.210
didn't want to ask so many
questions and everyone's not

00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:28.084
as open as I am to talk
about all this stuff.

00:58:28.084 --> 00:58:31.740
But a huge thank you
to you guys for coming

00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:33.540
from LA and from New York.

00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:35.370
Every Thursday
Goop has a podcast.

00:58:35.370 --> 00:58:37.620
Elise is usually hosting,
unless it's Gwyneth herself.

00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:40.650
So I'm sure you have a lot of
interesting guests coming up.

00:58:40.650 --> 00:58:43.440
And there are some
other great podcasts

00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:46.970
that are in relationship to
being a parent, and hormones,

00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:47.470
and whatnot.

00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:49.178
So please check those
out if you haven't.

00:58:49.178 --> 00:58:51.860
And then obviously, Catherine,
thank you so much for coming.

00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:53.460
And when I'm in New
York, I certainly

00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:55.690
am coming to the Motherhood
Center, no matter what.

00:58:55.690 --> 00:58:57.230
And I would encourage
other people

00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:58.729
and to our New York
Googlers who are

00:58:58.729 --> 00:59:01.110
listening to go visit as well.

00:59:01.110 --> 00:59:03.600
And is the best way to do that
just to visit your website?

00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:03.780
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Yeah.

00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:05.446
AMY SHAMUS: And is
there an email alias,

00:59:05.446 --> 00:59:06.750
or pick up the phone and call?

00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:08.375
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
Yeah, you can call.

00:59:08.375 --> 00:59:09.300
We have an info site.

00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:12.780
You'll get to Paige Bellenbaum,
who's our program director.

00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:14.601
We'll be happy to
have you come and see.

00:59:14.601 --> 00:59:15.350
AMY SHAMUS: Great.

00:59:15.350 --> 00:59:16.140
CATHERINE BIRNDORF: Figure
out what we can do for you.

00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:17.630
AMY SHAMUS: And
then a new book in--

00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:18.390
CATHERINE BIRNDORF:
Yeah, next year.

00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:19.180
AMY SHAMUS: --a year.

00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:19.680
Thank you, guys.

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:20.550
Thanks, everyone, for coming.

00:59:20.550 --> 00:59:21.591
ELISE LOEHNEN: Thank you.

00:59:21.591 --> 00:59:22.400
AMY SHAMUS: Yay.
