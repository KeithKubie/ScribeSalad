man, its gross"

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:27.240

NARRATOR (CONT'D)
...that lasts a mere 5 minutes before she's

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.100
dumped for no reason.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.440
EDWARD
I don't want you, you're just not good

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.690
for me.

Prompting his desperately obsessed ex girlfriend...

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.850
NARRATOR (CONT'D)
to mope around for months on end...

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.230
NARRATOR (CONT'D)
so they could do this fancy shot outside her

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.660
window.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.879
NARRATOR (CONT'D)
Until Fish face, finds a new man to latch

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:57.430
on to.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)
A very, very shirtless man... with an incredibly

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.430
obvious secret...

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.660
BELLA
"So you're a werewolf?"

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.550
JACOB
"Yeah"

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.590
NARRATOR
Who is only in the movie to create a forced

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.130
love triangle for the franchise...

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.410
NARRATOR (CONT'D)
Even though they make it perfectly clear who

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.130
Dead Eyes will ultimately choose.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.600
BELLA
"Don't make me choose. Cause it will be

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.970
him, it's always been him."

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.180
NARRATOR
A role model so, terrible and wreckless, she'll

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.120
encourage all angsty teenagers to:

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.250
NARRATOR (CONT'D)
Drive off on motorcycles with complete strangers.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.320

Jump off cliffs.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.850

Slap shirtless weird dudes.

OTHER WEREWOLF -- O.S.
"Calm down now."

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.300
WEREWOLF
"Rrrarr."

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.040

Stand between vampires and large, deadly werewolves.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.390
NARRATOR (CONT'D)
Travel to foreign countries without telling

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.160
their parents.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.740
NARRATOR (CONT'D)
And drown themselves to see hallucinations

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.470
of their ex-boyfriends...

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.280
NARRATOR (CONT'D)
I'm pretty sure this makes her a schizophrenic.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.430
NARRATOR (CONT'D)
Prepare yourself...

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.000
NARRATOR (CONT'D)
For a movie filled with placeholder dialogue

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.280
that wasn't changed from the first draft.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.440
BELLA
How about Face... Punch? Do you guys want

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.960
to go see... Face Punch?

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.700
ERIC
Face Punch! Remember the trailer's like,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.820
pow pow, punch faces.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.920
MIKE NEWTON
I, I remember.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.520
NARRATOR
And werewolves that rip out of their clothes,

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.410
but always seem to get their shorts
back.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.630
NARRATOR (CONT'D)
Seriously, do they keep stashes of jean shorts

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.790
hidden around the forest?

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.300
NARRATOR (CONT'D)
But when Shovel Face is in danger of flashing

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.290
children...

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.760
NARRATOR (CONT'D)
Just-Smelled-Poop-Face will ignore the months

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.240
of unnecessary turmoil he's caused
her...

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.850
NARRATOR (CONT'D)
and ride to save him on an airline that enforces

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.110
the abstinence metaphor.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.280
NARRATOR (CONT'D)
Leading to a rushed climax that will leave

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.280
you wondering... who are these random
last minute villains?

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.870
NARRATOR (CONT'D)
TWILIGHT: NEW MOON.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.910
NARRATOR (CONT'D)
Just watch True Blood instead. At least they

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:37.760
get naked on that show.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.270
NARRATOR (CONT'D)
Don't forget to watch this weeks Screen

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.910

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:51.459
