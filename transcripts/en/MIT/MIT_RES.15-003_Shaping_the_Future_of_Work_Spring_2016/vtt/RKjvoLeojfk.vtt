00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.700
In this video, we're
going to take a look

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.700
at how the social contract
issues have been addressed

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.930
around the world.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.660
It turns out there's quite a
bit of experience with this,

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.240
sometimes with success for
a limited period of time

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.440
and sometimes without
as much success.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.920
So let's see how other
countries address these issues.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.299
Let's start with Australia.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.050
Australia has a long history.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.790
In the 1980s, a
new prime minister

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.780
came along by the
name of Bob Hawke.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.380
And he came into office
negotiating a new labor

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.370
agreement called the accord,
with the labor movement,

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.020
where he was saying to labor,
if you limit your wage increases

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.190
to the price increases that
are happening in the country,

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.590
we will then find
some offsetting things

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.790
that we can do in
social welfare.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.580
So they negotiated a
national health insurance.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.269
They negotiated a
national pension program.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.560
They put in place a variety
of other worker adjustment

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.290
programs.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.880
And for business,
they allowed over time

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.520
much more flexibility in
promoting collective bargaining

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.080
at the level of the firm.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.780
That worked for quite a while.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.450
New prime minister comes
in from a different party,

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.980
says no more of this.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.360
And so it hasn't really
continued up until today.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.710
But now, in recent
years, Australia

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.070
has taken a more
modern approach.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.320
It says today's workforce
needs flexibility

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.230
for more parental leave
so that women and men can

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.950
take care of their family
and work responsibilities.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.060
So in 2011, their first
parental leave program

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.390
was put in place at
a national level.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.730
Now they're struggling
to make that work

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.120
and to fight those
who want to repeal it,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.450
but it is continuing to
play an important role.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.740
Like Australia, Britain
has a long history.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.020
In the 1980s and
'70s, like Australia

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.200
they were trying to
limit wage increases

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.720
to deal with inflation.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.030
And then in the
1980s, along comes

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.490
Margaret Thatcher as a new Prime
Minister, called the Iron Lady.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.160
And she says no more of that.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.840
I'm going to take a hard line.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.280
She took on the
most powerful union

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.380
in the country, the miners'
union in 1984 and 1985.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.970
And she basically broke
a strike of that union

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.410
and started to bring down
the rate of wage increase

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.660
and help companies get more
flexibility and limited labor's

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.390
power.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.440
That carried forward
up until the election

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.570
of another new Prime Minister,
Tony Blair in the 1980s.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.940
And Tony Blair
basically said, I'm not

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.230
going to go back to
the old labor policies,

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.070
but I'm also not going to
continue the Thatcher approach.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.110
We're going to try a third way.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.950
And he looked at the
workplace issues that

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.950
were relevant for
his point in time

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.560
and he said, let's negotiate.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.880
Let's put in place a commission,
a labor, business, government,

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.030
academic commission to
set up a minimum wage

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.970
so that we can help those
at the bottom of our income

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:08.830
distribution.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.700
And that's the most
successful part of his legacy.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.700
Well, if you really want to look
at the longest history of labor

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.510
management consultation
and cooperation,

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.650
you have to go to continental
Europe-- countries

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.690
like Sweden, Denmark,
France, Germany, sometimes

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.910
Italy and others.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.190
In Sweden, for example
there's a long history

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.170
of business, labor, and
government negotiating

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.930
in a cooperative way, both
at the national levels

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.570
and more recently at the local
and regional levels and company

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.430
levels.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.370
Basically, it's all part of
the social democratic values

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.010
of the Swedish and
Nordic societies saying,

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.250
we need to work together to
promote democracy and equity

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.000
in our economic policies.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.470
And so that policy
continues today, even

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.440
in times of difficulty.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.480
We'll take another look at
another country, Denmark.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.040
Denmark in recent
years has recognized

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.990
the real issue is,
how do we adjust

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.270
from an industrial
to a more dynamic,

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.200
innovation-based economy?

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.440
That means firms
need more flexibility

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.730
to hire and fire and lay off
people as the economy changes.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.990
And so Denmark has
traded off what they

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.750
call flexibility for security.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.760
That is, firms are more open
and free to lay people off.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.810
But there's an active
labor market policy

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.240
that then supports workers
as they make the transition

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.370
to new jobs, with a
stronger safety net,

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.280
with training, and with
adjustment and assistance.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.580
So that then helps firms to
maintain their flexibility

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.690
and to adapt to changing times.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.760
So around the world, we see a
variety of different approaches

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.230
to these issues.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.080
Japan is another country
with a long history of labor

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.690
management consultation.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.910
For years, its Ministry
of International Trade

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.120
and Industry worked
with business and labor

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.940
at the national level in
lots of consultation to say,

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.320
here is basically
the wage target

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.590
for increasing wages this year.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.750
And then individual companies
and enterprise unions

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.190
would use that
target to negotiate

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.060
their specific conditions.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.760
And that worked
quite well for Japan

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.640
and for business and labor in
that country for many years.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.620
But then as the economy
changed and Japan

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.810
began to get competition
from China and other places,

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.400
it broke down.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.670
And now China is
trying to figure out

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.610
how to get wages moving
more aggressively

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.090
and prices increasing, because
it's having trouble adapting

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.630
to a more dynamic economy.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.710
Another example, a
very different example,

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:54.870
would be in Korea.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.470
Korea has had a very tumultuous
labor management history.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.100
Up until the mid-1980s, unions
were suppressed in Korea.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.340
And there were often
violent strikes

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.420
that would come and
then get suppressed

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.790
and the police would come in.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.820
And it would all die down
for a while and be quiet.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.370
But then in 1987,
the government began

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.940
to open up the labor market
to stronger worker rights.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.150
And it said, let's
try to work together.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.350
But that long
history of conflict

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.710
made it very, very difficult
for labor and management

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:28.730
to work together.

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:33.150
And so even today, we
now see big protests

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.800
happening in Korean workplaces
as the government tries

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.150
to get Korean employers
to be more flexible.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.370
And Korean workers
are saying, we

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.920
are not sharing in all of the
prosperity of this country.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.950
Another example
would be in China.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.380
Perhaps there's no
country that more needs

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.330
a new social
contract than China.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.110
As we all know, as the
Chinese economy began

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.880
to open up to more
private enterprise

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.100
and foreign investment, we saw
a wave of strikes in China,

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.270
first at Honda in
2010, a big strike that

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.110
resulted in a wage increase.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.400
And we've seen that
carry over in strikes

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.790
at one of Apple's big suppliers
of parts for computers

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.060
called Foxconn, where not
only workers are striking,

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.070
but sometimes they
commit suicide

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.760
in protest of the
conditions that they face.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.530
So China doesn't really have
institutions and policies

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.790
to govern workplace
negotiations.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.940
It badly needs to find a way
to allow workers to express

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.500
their needs, their interests,
their voice at the workplace

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.740
and at the same time maintain
what they call tranquility

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.370
in their relationships.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.360
But it's very difficult.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.640
Today, perhaps
too often, we find

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.000
that not only are these
spontaneous worker

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.080
protests occurring,
but they often

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.370
take the plant manager hostage.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.240
So here's a picture
of an American

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.290
who has a plant in
China who's actually

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.600
waving from inside his office
to people on the outside,

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.580
because the workers
are saying to him,

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.120
you're not paying fair wages.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.660
We need to negotiate
a better arrangement.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.360
So around the world we
see these differences.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.220
We see in Singapore, for example
a much better labor management

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.910
relationship, because there the
government takes a strong hand,

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.870
controls a lot of
economic policy.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:31.840
But it does so with what
we would call a high road

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.559
strategy.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:34.100
It invests in training.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:38.400
It encourages firms to have
good labor management relations.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.309
It's controlled
the labor movement

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:43.880
so that there aren't
as many strikes.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.590
This is controversial,
because it's

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.580
not quite the democratic
society that we would want.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.710
But it's the way in which
they do it in Singapore.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.070
If we turn to South
America, countries

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:55.610
have had a more difficult time.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:59.190
There, they've had on
and off approaches,

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:03.100
again often with dictatorial
governments controlling labor

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.250
and management
activities, but now

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.010
opening up to more
democracy but having

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:12.620
tremendous problems with price
increases and labor protests.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:17.340
And then finally, I think we
can see some countries where

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.960
organizations act on their own.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.610
So in Brazil, for
example, some companies

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:27.820
are taking their own approach
to developing a social contract

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:31.160
and not waiting for the
government to take action.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.400
Well, what lessons can we
learn from all of this?

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.270
I think there are two.

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.680
First, it often takes a crisis.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:42.680
A crisis will lead the
parties to pull together,

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.180
whether it's the
end of World War II

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.140
or whether it's a deep
financial crisis in Asia

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:52.500
or some kind of
other natural crisis

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.470
that might occur, perhaps from
climate change or whatever.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:10:01.130
So crisis often helps parties
to set aside their differences.

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:04.080
And for a while, they can
work together and forge

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.260
a new set of agreements.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:10.910
The second thing to remember
is that timing is everything,

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:14.520
that one has to take
advantage of specific events.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.120
And when they occur,
like a financial crisis,

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.590
maybe you can renegotiate
pensions in an appropriate way,

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:26.540
or you can deal with problems
of recalcitrant unions

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:29.600
or recalcitrant
employers and find

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.370
ways to get them
to work together

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:35.000
because there's a specific
issue that they both confront.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.860
So timing is
everything, using crisis

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.160
as an opportunity for change.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.870
So all around the world,
workers, employers,

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:47.480
governments, educators
need to figure out

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.720
when it's possible to
negotiate a new social contract

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.470
and what are the issues that
are current and relevant

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:56.600
to our times.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.600
Every country in the world
needs to address these issues,

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.450
because we have serious
problems in our workplaces

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.080
that need to be addressed.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.780
And so we're very interested.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:06.980
What are your thoughts?

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.380
What's most important
in your country?

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.580
What issues should the parties,
with your help, be addressing?

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.630
We look forward to
getting your thoughts

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:18.260
on this in our discussions.
