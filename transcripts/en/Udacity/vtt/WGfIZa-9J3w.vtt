00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:06.050
Many of 3JSs geometry object come along with their own UVs built-in. Some of

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.504
these are displayed here. For planar objects, the texture's put flat against

00:00:09.504 --> 00:00:13.264
the face. For round objects, the general idea is that the u-value goes from

00:00:13.264 --> 00:00:17.940
zero to one, around the equator. And V goes from zero to one, around the axis.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.292
To be honest, the mapping on the bottom of the cone shown here is pretty. But

00:00:21.292 --> 00:00:24.612
doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Maybe you'll be the one to fix it. Note that

00:00:24.612 --> 00:00:28.014
3JS truly is a work in progress and anyone can submit bug fixes and

00:00:28.014 --> 00:00:33.526
improvement. I should also point out the tetrahedron. It's mapping is a bit

00:00:33.526 --> 00:00:37.512
distorted. In fact, if you look at the code, no UV mapping is given at all and

00:00:37.512 --> 00:00:41.888
3JS creates one using some rules. Sometimes there simply is no natural UV

00:00:41.888 --> 00:00:45.765
mapping for the object being made. It's then pretty much up to the programmer

00:00:45.765 --> 00:00:49.326
to decide how to proceed. What is happening with each of these objects is that

00:00:49.326 --> 00:00:54.661
UVs are generated by the geometry class used to create the triangles. The form

00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:58.218
for making a triangle with UVs code. Here, three vertices are defined and put

00:00:58.218 --> 00:01:03.480
inside the geometry object. Three UVs are created. I put them in an array so I

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.189
can reuse any that I want. A face is defined as usual. The three numbers given

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.975
are indices to the three vertex locations in the vertices array. The way the

00:01:12.975 --> 00:01:16.900
three UVs are attached to this face is a little non-standard. The first element

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.066
of the face vertex UVs is accessed. And the three uv's we want to use for this

00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:25.164
face are directly placed there. If you want to add more faces with UVs Note

00:01:25.164 --> 00:01:30.048
that you'll access the face vertex UV's class the same way each time. You'll

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:33.320
access a ray element zero and pass in the three UVs desired.
