Hey everyone, Laci Green here!

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.280
Several of you recommended the documentary
"Miss Representation" for our next screening

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.110
room....so I watched it!....again.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.450
It's been a few years so it's good to have
a refresher.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.520
Miss Rep is available on Netflix, which is
my favorite go-to for movies and TV online.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.539
If you don't have netflix, you're missing
out buddy.

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.949
Try it out free for a month at Netflix.com/DNews!

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.300
For those of you unfamiliar with the documentary,
it's a pretty compelling investigation of

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.440
gender representation in media.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.760
The premise for the film is that our primary
source of information is the media and that

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.180
it has a very strong (often subconscious)
effect on us -- for better or worse.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.710
You don't need to be some fancy scholar to
flip on the TV and realize that women are

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.309
often reduced to degrading, 1-dimensional
stereotypes -- that our bodies are valued

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:50.540
much more than our minds.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.489
And, you probably don't even need to be a
woman yourself to realize those messages have

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.140
real effects on peoples' lives.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.379
The film talks about consequences like eating
disorders, increased challenges for women

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:06.640
in politics and leadership, extreme under-representation
of women in literally every influential field,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.980
the destructive female rivalry it creates,
and....violence against women.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.310
How all of those things connect is laid out
pretty well.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.869
The studies they call upon are a wake up call:
women hold 5% of clout positions in the mainstream

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.799
media, they make up 9% of movie directors
and 15% of film writers.

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.960
And, most visibly, a measly 18% of Congress.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.560
Women make up over half of this country - 51%.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.749
The stories behind these figures is a compelling
one.

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:37.079
That said, I'm not sure Miss Rep tells the
entire story.

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.350
A big part of it, sure.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.689
I found some of the solutions to be condescending,
like Katie Couric telling women not to worry

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.689
about their weight and use their minds instead.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.469
Many women KNOW they shouldn't worry about
their weight, but here we are.

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:52.950
It's an oversimplified diagnosis and solution.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.600
Another part of the film that was ironic to
me was that the documentary ITSELF lacked

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.430
representation.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.270
Women with disabilities, queer women - completely
missing.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.549
Rachel Maddow was in the film and never addressed
how being out affects the vitriol she receives

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:08.549
about her show.

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.480
I'm not the type that thinks a film needs
to be EVERYTHING to EVERYONE -- of course

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.480
not.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.610
But if we're talking about the portrayals
of WOMEN, as a group, the voices of women

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.260
who aren't straight, middle class, and white
should be included as well.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.500
But hey, I guess they'll learn that in gender
studies 102.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.750
This film is very much a 101, and I think
that's great.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.750
A good thing to show people as an intro to
say "Hey, this is a big part of what this

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.030
massive field of research and activism is
all about".

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.760
So grab a friend and pull it up on Netflix.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.880
It'll definitely get a good conversation started.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.471
If you don't have Netflix, you can watch the
documentary for free at netflix.com/dnews.

00:02:41.471 --> 00:02:45.500
If you've seen it, let me know what you think!

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.500
I'll see you next time!
