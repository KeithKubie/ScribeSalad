Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. Today in the Times there was a report of a clinical trial, which, uh, event, that kind of thing we talked about on Friday. This was of of a, of a stat in which is like Lipitor, it's a different one, it's crest door, but they just reported that a study of 18,000 people. So a very big clinical trial, uh, seemed to show that this, that uh, it help it reduce the risk of heart attack by a half, uh, for people who didn't have high cholesterol but had another risk. This c reactive protein CRP. And it said in the story this morning, like many clinical trials, the Jupiter study was sponsored by a pharmaceutical company. In this case, Astrazeneca, it makes the drug in the trial receive a stat and which is sold as crest door. And then it says doctor Ridker co-inventor have a CRP test, said he first sought federal financing for the study and was turned down.

Speaker 1:          01:00          He and other scientists interviewed for this article except for doctrine able, Dr. Gardner, Dr. Wolfe have consulted for or received research money from staton makers. I guess I should say that I've occasionally gotten money from Staten makers too, but not for this kind of thing. Uh, okay. So That's interesting and relevant to what we're talking about. But specifically what we're talking about now is nomenclature. And last time we talked about constitutional nomenclature, the rules people made up for naming the nature and sequence of bonds. But since arrangement in space is also important, you have to be able to have names for Stereo Chemistry. And right now we're interested in configurational stereochemistry, the kind that, uh, can only be changed by breaking bonds, right? Whereas as we'll see soon, conformational changes don't require breaking bonds, so typically are much easier to do. So configurational isomers include the tartaric acids that we've been speaking about that have these physical properties.

Speaker 1:          02:04          Uh, one has a unique melting point, the other two are the same, but those two differ by the sign of the optical rotation of polarized light. So the first one is, is, uh, Misa. Now how do we name these things? One way is just to name them according to the phenomenon, to what you observe. So sometimes those, those two tartaric acids that are enantiomers mirror images of one another, but not super imposable, not super imposable, sometimes they're referred to as small D or small l, which stands for Dextro or Livo and means right or left. And all it means is the direction they rotate the plane of polarized light, which you observe experimentally. So there's nothing, uh, more arcane about that. Or you can say plus or minus, meaning that they rotate light to the right or rotate light to the left. And those are absolutely the same thing, right?

Speaker 1:          03:01          Dextro and plus Livo and minus. Sometimes people use both names, but they're redundant. They both mean that rotates light one way or the other. So it just describes the phenomenon. So there's nothing ambiguous about that. It's a perfectly good name, but it doesn't tell you what model you should make to show it which mirror images, which all you know is which way it rotates light. So that's phenomenal logical. But there can be other names that have to do with these Fisher projections. We draw as to exactly which one is which. So that one is clear enough that one has a mirror image is its own mirror image. There's a mirror that goes through the middle of it. So the top is the mirror image of the bottom. It's mere image of itself. And that one's clearly the Mezzo, right? But how about the others? One of them will look one way and one the other, but is there any fundamental thing that we can understand that would tell us which we'll rotate light to the right and which will rotate light to the left.

Speaker 1:          04:04          And I'll tell you that I can say that. And most people I know, in fact almost everybody I know can't say that, but there are a few people who think they can say that and we'll hear about one of them soon, now on Wednesday. But anyhow, it's a question, is it like should it be though those for the right and the left handed the d and the l or those, which one is which? Well, uh, Fisher decided that we'd just have to have names for this and we have to be able to draw pictures. So let's make a guess as to which way it is. And he devised a new, uh, system of naming, which doesn't depend on the phenomenon but depends on genealogy. That is synthesis. You take a compound like Glycerin Aldehyde, which is small d and plus, what does that mean? DDI and plus for this, there's a particular bottle of Palliser Aldehyde which has that constitution, right? And we're going to label it d plus. And what does that mean?

Speaker 1:          05:11          Zach rotates light to the right, but we don't know exactly how we should draw it, right? Which the structure or its mirror image. So, and D and plus here, remember our redundant, they joke both just being at low. Tate rotates light to the right, but Fisher went further. He defined that particular glyceride Aldehyde as capital d. There's a difference between capital d and Small D. Capital d is the names he used. And that big Douglas or Aldehyde, he guessed the one that rotates light to the right. He guests had that structure, which when drawn with a Fischer projection is that structure. So that's just a guess. So we, this is now gives us a starting point. This Melissa Aldehyde, which I'm going to call capital D and I'm guessing has that structure. I might be 100% wrong, right? It might be the other one. But let's just make this gas and then we'll be able to talk about everything.

Speaker 1:          06:11          So what could you talk about? You could do a multistep synthesis in which the carbon, the carbon is connected by the arrows are the same carbon that is, you redo the top half of the molecule by doing chemical reactions. The parts in Greek, the part that's in green. So Cho becomes that much more complicated thing, but you leave in tact that carbon on the bottom. So it's the same in tartaric acid as it was in Douglas or Aldehyde, whatever that was. And we'll guess it's this one with the Oah on the right is everybody with me, with the guests he made.

Speaker 2:          06:48          So now if you could make that particular tartaric acid isomer from d capital d glycerin Aldehyde, then you say that that's capital d

Speaker 1:          07:00          tartaric acid because you could make it from Douglas or Aldehyde. Any questions about that?

Speaker 2:          07:08          So it's just what you make for what if you could make it from a d compound, you call it a d compound, and the mirror image would be the l compound, Capitol Hill, Claire

Speaker 3:          07:19          [inaudible], just swapping policing the green squares, the errors in them,

Speaker 2:          07:26          the swap, the thing that's then the green square on the bottom becomes the stuff in the green square on the top. Obviously you have to add another carbon and you have to add a couple of hydrogens and some more oxygens. So you have to do some chemical transformations. But the important thing is that the thing of the top becomes the thing on the top, and the carbons connected by the Arrow are precisely the same carbon. Right. Okay. So that one, you know, because you know where it came from by genealogy, so that tartaric acid, you'll call capital d according to Fisher,

Speaker 1:          07:59          but do you see a weakness in this nomenclature scheme?

Speaker 3:          08:09          Yeah, sure. What is dependent on your knowledge of this?

Speaker 2:          08:13          Well, of course it could be 100% wrong. Everything could be the mirror image of what we thought it was right. That's clearly a problem and that was well recognized by Fisher, but maybe I didn't understand your question. Did I know that? That's okay. Does anybody see another weakness? Sam?

Speaker 3:          08:30          Capital d isn't very descriptive.

Speaker 2:          08:33          It's certainly not descriptive of the structure accepted. Unless you know what Douglas or Aldehyde is, then it's descriptive, but it's not descriptive alone. It's only relative, right? It's only relative to the Douglas or Aldehyde and you have to know how that relationship works.

Speaker 3:          08:49          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:49          For example, someone else by go into lab and they want to prepare tartaric acid from Douglas or what might the other person do?

Speaker 2:          09:01          Lucas, I can prepare it a different way. So somebody else might put that carpet into the one on the top and change the brown ones.

Speaker 1:          09:11          Right. There could be other transformations you do that would change the carbon on the bottom to the carbon on the bottom and the carbon on the top is now the same as the one on Glycerin Aldehyde, right? In which case it would be exactly, uh, that one on that one on the left would be named capital d if you made it that way. Everybody see the genealogy would just be different.

Speaker 3:          09:33          Okay?

Speaker 2:          09:33          Okay. So there's a fundamental problem here that the capital d capital l designation is ambiguous without having sub detailed synthesis recipe or sub grievance that people say, we'll always make things this way rather than another way, right? So it's not, doesn't have meaning on its own. You have to know exactly how you [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          09:53          you made the transformation. So that's a pretty cumbersome way to do names. But that's what was done for 60 years, right? Those were the names, capital d and capital l or sugars, for example, for amino acids. Okay? And it's relative and it's an it based on a guess. But in 1950, things changed because at 1950, a man named by foot, uh, an x ray crystallography for it. You tracked, in fact working in the van Hoff Laboratory, the same building in which van Hoff did the things in 1874 by foot determined the crystal structure of sodium rubidium salt. Remember, they're two carboxylic acids and tartaric acid. So the sodium rubidium assault of d small d, capital l tartrate. What does a small d mean,

Speaker 3:          10:52          Andrew?

Speaker 2:          10:54          It rotates the plane of polarized light or twists it to the right. And what does the capital l mean?

Speaker 3:          11:01          Alison said previously, we said it resonated.

Speaker 2:          11:06          I couldn't hear very well previously. It was, we assumed that it would read through. No, that's not true. All right. Maybe I didn't understand previously what you love the model we you're just talking about, right? It's what we've talked about with Fisher that Pete was able to make this tar tare Cason from l Glycerin Aldehyde from the day where of what we talked about before. So it was related by that particular synthesis to Elvis around Aldehyde. So there's no conflict between say, D and L, right? It rotates light to the right. That's the small one. But it's geologically related to El Glycerin Aldehyde. Okay. But he was able to use a very special time

Speaker 1:          11:48          x-ray technique called anomalous dispersion, which we don't have time to talk about right now, but it was able to show exactly which way the Adams were oriented. And this is the picture he drew. Right? So clearly on the top is seat seat two o's, right? Carboxylate group on the bottom of Carbox slate group. The middle two carbons each have an h and n o on them. The O is stippled, so you'll see what it is and it's clear the way he draws what's coming out, why he drew at what's coming out toward you and what's going back in. Now here's a swat. Fisher had guessed 60 years before for El tartrate. What he called El Tartrate was Fisher, right or wrong.

Speaker 2:          12:33          How about the top carbon that has o h on the H, c o. H? Is it the same as in, in the model that, uh, that by foot published is does it agree or not? Yes, it agrees the Oah is coming out towards you and to the right. Same as in fishers. Picture of the top carbon. Everybody got that? How about the bottom of carbon? The bottom carbon Fisher has go into the left and by foot has it go into the right. This one here, right? That's going to the right from this carbon Fisher's drawing it to the left. Did they disagree?

Speaker 3:          13:15          Who said something? Do they agree or disagree that funny you say? Uh,

Speaker 2:          13:28          what does Fisher means by this bond here? The CH bond, which isn't going out toward you. The H or back in,

Speaker 3:          13:41          okay.

Speaker 2:          13:41          The official projection, which is shown here. It's got vertical bonds and horizontal bonds. Which one is coming out for you? From the carbon.

Speaker 3:          13:53          Okay. Somebody else? Uh, yeah. Hey, which bonds? Bonds?

Speaker 2:          14:04          The carbon carbon bonds are going into the board. That's Fisher's convention. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          14:08          because I trusted them and so that everybody knows.

Speaker 2:          14:11          Yeah. So these two are coming out on the board. How about in by floods? Picture for the second car. The second department. Here's the first one. Here's the second one. Aha. So to make it like fish or you have to rotate it so they're coming out of the board. So in fact, they do agree, right? It's just that, uh, by foot is made realistically and, and uh, and fissures was made with these rubber tubing bonds and you had the bend it to get it that way. But it's the same configuration. So Fisher was right. So these structures

Speaker 1:          14:48          cheers that had been drawn for 60 years. We're drawn. Right. They could have, it was a 50 50 chance that it could have been the other way around, but thank God he was right so we don't have to go back and correct everything and then know whether things were written before 1950 or after 1950

Speaker 3:          15:04          yeah. You'll just the LSP, that's like each bed. Is John me out of the door? Does that go back?

Speaker 2:          15:14          Okay. If you rotate this molecule by 180 degrees around the vertical axis, then this carbon with respect to the carbon we're interested in here, this carbon will be going back into the board and this carpenter, we're going back into the board. That's the way these are, right? But in the process, that rotation, this, Ooh, that was back into the right after a 180 degree rotation about the vertical axis will be out in front and to the left, which is the way it's drawn in the Fisher project.

Speaker 3:          15:44          It would be good that,

Speaker 2:          15:46          oh yeah, but you don't care. This is just a show that couldn't configuration. Right. When you do that rotation. Yeah, these will, these will do the other. But the point is that Fisher structure was right with respect to each carbon about what's going, which way, which tetrahedron it is. Okay. So that's fine.

Speaker 1:          16:03          And then by foot wrote are in the same paper he wrote. The question of nomenclature is beyond the scope of our investigation. He's just doing the x ray to find out which way it is. The problem of nomenclature now concerns given confirmations. Now you know which one it is you want to show and requires a notation which denotes these configurations in an unambiguous and if possible, self explanatory way. So you don't need to know how it was synthesized or anything. Now you know how it really is, right? What name are you going to give to it so people can know just from the name which way it is. Now this is related to the idea of naming configurations involving double bonds. So we're going to first show you how you do that, which actually came second and then we'll go back to see how they named the configuration at a tetrahedral carbon. So malic acid from, from uh, apples has that structure shown. And if you heat it, you lose water and get a double bond. But you get two isomers mallaig and few Merrick acids.

Speaker 1:          17:14          And you'll remember we showed that before that Vantiff made those with his models. And one of them has the two coh is near one another and one has the farther from one another and we can draw them that way as well near on the left and far on the right. And if you heat these molecules further, the one on the left can lose water and foreman and hydride but not the one on the right. Why not the one on the right? It's pretty obvious, Russell, they're too far apart. So you know which one they're close together

Speaker 2:          17:49          and which one they're far apart. So that experiment proves which is switch, it's not as hard as the case of the right and left hand where you had to do this very special ex-ray technique. So it was known that maleic acid was the one that can form an anhydrite and therefore it had him on the same side. And that was called sis, meaning on this side of, and the other one was called trans across. So that was a perfectly good nomenclature for these two isomers of the dehydrated malic acid. Maleic was sis and fumaric acid was trans. So these names were used for a very long time, but they weren't really good names. And the reason you can see by looking at this molecule is this one, would you call it CIS or trans? Same side or opposite side.

Speaker 3:          18:49          Andrew, what do you say next day, Andrew? This is our nomenclature problem. Would you call it trans? You say this one here. Why?

Speaker 2:          19:13          Because the ch three is are next to one another. So you might, Paul insist on the other end if you want it to say how this ad is related to the acid, you'd say it's trans, right? So that means it's the, as an absolute

Speaker 1:          19:25          naming nomenclature, it's very hard to generalize this because you have to know which one you're picking to say it's CIS or trans. It's fine to talk about the relative configuration to say the methyl on the left is sis to the methyl on the right or to say the methyl on the left is trans to the COO. H that's fine. But as a as to whether to say the molecule itself is cis or trans, you have to know which one you're talking about on the right. So that's another thing where you, you're going to have to have some convention or something. And the way people decided to do it was this, you assign the groups at each end, took one end, and then the other end of the double bond and assign priority. So you say we're going to give higher priority to one group or the other and that's the one we're going to use for the name. So on what basis might you assign a priority to a group?

Speaker 2:          20:19          Say which group has higher priority? C h three or h, which one do you think should have higher priority? C H three. Okay. How about on this n c h three or Coa, which should have higher priority. Why? It's heavier. Okay. Now let's think about how that, how that was gonna work out. So we'll assign of by atomic number or atomic weight. If we have two that are different isotopes of one another, right? But we won't, we won't sell up the atomic numbers of all the groups that are in that. That is, we want some up c and o and o and h and c and d,

Speaker 1:          21:00          three H's. Why not sum them all up and then

Speaker 2:          21:03          see which one has higher total atomic number. What's wrong with that? Perfectly well defined. It's tedious. It's cumbersome to have to add it all up. So what you, what rule are you going to do? You'll go until you find a difference. Go out until you find a difference. Once you find a difference, you stop. So you don't have to go everywhere. Okay? So at the first difference, the same as we said with numbering last time, right? Okay. So on the left, in each case you have a carbon compared to a hydrogen is the thing that's immediately attached. Carbon has higher priority, higher atomic number on the right. It, it begins with the Thai. Incidentally, we're going to have to deal with double bonds, Coh and provato. Right? The way you do it just by convention, there's nothing, God didn't write this on the tablets, right? It's you just pretend that there are two, two of those atoms. When there's a double bond, just pretend. Okay, so now we compare the top of the bottle. If we go to the, the first step, it's carbon versus carbon. It's a tie.

Speaker 1:          22:14          So we're going to have to go further. Why don't we go to the next level? We see on the left it's oxygen versus hydrogen, right? And oxygen is higher. We don't have to go any further. We found a difference so forget the rest of it. Everybody with me? Okay, so we say we might say the one on the left is trans and the one on the right is sis. However, people for 60 years or longer in this case have been used in the name CIS and Trans to mean one thing or another and sometimes will agree with them and sometimes we don't, which is going to cause great confusion as to whether you're using a pre 1950 name or a post 1950 name and at least half the compounds are going to be wrong. Right. So the names trans insists that have been polluted by previous usage. So we're going to have to have new names. Yeah, Lucas [inaudible],

Speaker 2:          23:12          you've mural duplicate all those as well. Okay. Okay. So this one was used with a German root cause. The guys from Switzerland, we're doing this and Gagan which means a posed and the one on the right, so it's e when they're trans, when they're opposite one another, and when they're adjacent to one another, it's called together Suzanne Z. I've always thought this is a real pity that it wasn't the other way around. So I hope this doesn't confuse you because these are on the same side and these are on

Speaker 1:          23:45          opposite sides. Right. But it's just backwards from that. So just to remember that it's unfortunate. Okay, so z beads together and he means apart. Okay, that's the name we use for there. Okay. Now notice that in assigning priority, as we said, just to Belabor this a little bit, you proceed one shell at a time, so, so we saw a tie when it was carbon versus carbon and when it was three oxygens versus three hydrogens, it was obvious that the top wins, but now let's go to this case. Okay, now carbon versus carbon, that's a tie. We go out further. Three oxygens beat a carbon and two hydrogens, right? But there's chlorine is on the bottom right? The chlorine is really high priority, right? But it's irrelevant because the decision has already been made. So you respect earlier decisions, right? You only go as far as you need to go to see a difference. Okay. I think we've said that enough. Now these are the guys that invented the scheme to name handedness, the, it's called the CIP priority scheme and the C is our s con and the eye is CK in gold. Both of them are from Britain. And the P is a lot of mere prayer log who's in Switzerland, although he's a native of, uh, Yugoslavia.

Speaker 1:          25:18          Now, uh, these were many people, particularly synthetic chemists would consider Robert Robinson and RB Woodward, the greatest Chem organic chemists of the 20th century. Uh, they both thought they were probably the greatest individual one. Right. So I love this picture taken by Jack Roberts of them at a seminar at MIT around this same time, uh, because they sort of aren't looking at one another. Right? What's Robinson looking at? Robinson is looking at in gold who'd be really despised and vice versa. Right? There was no love lost between in gold and, and Robinson. Uh, and this is illustrated by an account that pray log gave in his autobiography, he encountered, uh, Robinson in the airport in Zurich. Robinson was on his way to a meeting in Israel. Robinson. Hello Kucharski what are you doing here in Zurich? Pray Log. Excuse me, Sir Robert. I am only pray log. I live here. He got a Nobel prize to pray log. I'm only pray log and I live here. Robinson, you know, pray log your an in gold's configurational notation is all wrong. Pray Long, sir. Robert. It can't be wrong. It's just the convention.

Speaker 2:          26:44          You either accept it or not. Well then if it's not wrong, it's absolutely unnecessary. Okay? So anyhow, it's the point of this slide is that it's a convention. There's not right and wrong about it. It's that they proposed rules and that's, those are the rules that people have adopted. And that's how you give a name to the absolute configuration of a stereo Magenic carbon. And for fun for Wednesday, you can try this exercise going back to this, uh, this medieval manuscript and using the figures in it to devise your own convention to describe Kira Allity. So you can put yourself in the position of con in gold and pray log.

Speaker 2:          27:29          Okay, so here's the con in gold. Pray Log s nomenclature scheme for stereo genic centers. First you have to decide on each of these carbons, which are mirror images you see of one another, which Adams have which priority. So let's start on the left. What's the highest priority for a substituent on the central carbon? Therefore groups, which has the highest priority? Which one? Sorry. Oh, h o o is the highest atomic number. What's the lowest h? Right? Uh, there's also a d there. So same atomic number, hydrogen and deuterium. Which one should be higher? Deuterium? Tyrians heavier. If it's isotopes, you take the heavier one. Okay. So here's one, four, three, two, right? That's the priorities and analogously on the right. And now we have to decide whether there, which one to call, right? And which one to call left. And the way you do it, one way of doing it is to take a, a thing like this where I have uh, these uh, red, yellow, green, blue, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, right?

Speaker 2:          28:54          The order of the spectrum, red, yellow, green, blue. And I make a spiral that connects them like that. And now is that conventionally what you call a right handed or left hand in spiral? You know, if you look at it, if I turned it like this, it would move this way, right? So screws are called right handed and left handed screws. And the reason is that the, that the or the, you know, toe bone connected to the foot bone kind of thing, the way your arm is put together for right handed people, it's easier to drive a screw like this, right? So that's conventionally called her right hand and screw. So this you would call right handed, okay? Now if you can't remember from how to turn a screwdriver, uh, you can look at, you can do

Speaker 1:          29:41          this trick with your hand. You put your thumb along the direction of the lowest priority hydrogen in this case. So it's coming out of the board, right? And you curl your fingers, right? And you notice it goes one, two, three, and then four. So that one on the left, his left hand that everybody, see how I did that? Curl your fingers. They go one, two, three, four. Okay, so that's a lefthanded one. The one on the right, if you, you do it this way, you put that, so that's, and you call it not left. You call it ass for the Latin sinister. So it's not going to get confused with D and l. And so on that have already been used. It's a new way of doing it. So that was s and the one on the right, if I put my thumb, so it goes back toward the h and curl my fingers.

Speaker 1:          30:32          I go from one to two to three. Okay, so that one is called r four rectus Latin for right. Okay. Now there's another there. There are lots of tricks to do this. If you don't like you doing it that way, you can do it this way. Uh, pretend that this is a steering wheel of a car and the h is going back in. All right? So here on this one, on the right, I'm sitting here driving the car like this and the h is going away from me. Everybody got that? And I noticed that I go one, two, three, right? That's going to turn the car to the right. Everybody see that? So this one will turn the car to the left. If I, if I turn the wheel to go from oh to C to d, okay? So that one's a left turn and that one's a right turn. So whatever works for you is fine. And I can assure you that on some tests I'm going to look out and see people with their papers there and so on. And they're going to be going like this, right? How's, that's a handy way to do it. Handy. Okay, so, so let's try it on tartaric acid here. Let's do the top carbon of tartaric acid. Okay? So we've got to decide on the priority of the groups here. Here's one group, another group, another group, another group, which is the highest priority.

Speaker 1:          31:58          Oh, H is the highest, right? Oh, as the highest. Now we've got two carbons that are tied. Which one's gonna win top or bottom? W pop. You sayK , five

Speaker 3:          32:09          times three oxygens.

Speaker 1:          32:16          And only one oxygen. Right? So the one on the top has ox, not, not more oxygens, but it's got the oxygen's nearer. Okay? So we don't have to go as far. So this is going to be one, two, three, four. Okay? Now let me see your hands. Operating. Put, put a farm along with the age, the direction the h goes and curl your hands. One right top. Bottom one, two, three. And tell me whether that's right or left handed.

Speaker 3:          32:55          Okay.

Speaker 2:          32:57          How many big collapse? How many think rice is a democracy? The right have, but they're also correct. Okay. That was one or two or three that it's right handed. And the bottom ones also right handed her. What is, I have to take a lot of time to have you do this. To do the bottom one. Why does the bottom one follow if you know the top one? Because you can rotate the thing 180 degrees and it's the same and that will change the top end of the bottom. So whatever the top is, the bottom is the same thing. So the name of this is in parentheses to our carbon two is our carbon three is also are then dash two three dihydroxy dihydroxy butane dial awake acid. Okay. So now we have a steam that does that and not as, this is the, uh, the, the uh, gate into the new chemistry building just up the prospect street. And it's got things that, that relate to the different branches of chemistry on it. And this one is those carbon tetra heater with the spiral on it that says which handedness it is. They're both right and left handed once there. Okay. Now, Ras advisor [inaudible]. If you start with a molecule, which maybe you've gotten from [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          34:18          nature, that's all one hand like lactic acid from milk are lactic acid. There are processes which converted into a 50 50 mixture of our and Das. For example. Suppose you had a base and it could pull off a hydrogen. What hydrogen would it pull off from this molecule of base?

Speaker 3:          34:42          Any idea?

Speaker 2:          34:44          What is the most reactive group here

Speaker 2:          34:50          or another way of saying this is a high homo. What's the low Lumo going to be? Well, there's several low lumos. There's the COO double bond. Pi Star. That's a good one, right? However, it won't get you any places you put it on, come off again. Okay. Or there's Sigma Star. Oh, age here, but there's also a sigma star. Oh, a chair. But this one's better because it's next to the, to the Pi Star, right, so this is, that's why it's called an acid. You already knew that and you could lose the h plus and get down to this. Okay. And that'll go on off, on, off, on off, long time. That's fine. Nothing special there. But once in a long while, that's easy to do. Once in a long while you might pull off the wrong hydrogen. You might pull off this one. All right. So that's not nearly as easy. But what had happens, it's interesting for two reasons. One is it's not as bad as you might've thought because it's adjacent to this Pi Star,

Speaker 1:          35:52          which means that the vacant orbital here can stabilize those that high homo, which means you can draw that resonance structure with a double bond there. So it's hard, but it's not as hard as it might be once in a while that'll happen. And usually it'll go back again.

Speaker 3:          36:13          Right.

Speaker 1:          36:15          But what's especially interesting, oh, well, just as a footnote, it's possible to pull both of them off. But that would be very unusual to make a Diane ion, which is high in energy because you're putting so many electrons close to one another.

Speaker 3:          36:31          Okay.

Speaker 1:          36:32          But what's relevant for our purposes is it that molecule is plainer. So it's not handed. This one had a car apartment. This one had a chiral carbon in it, but this one doesn't have an asymmetric carbon. Aye. Aye. Stereo genic carbon. So this one is the one in the middle is neither right nor left. So if you go from right to something that isn't right or left, you can come back, put the hydrogen ion, the hydrogen comes from the front of the screen, goes on to where the minus charges and you're back to the left. But the hydrogen could have come from the back of the screen at the same carbon and that would give the one on the right and would be s lactic acid. So after a long time of heating with base, you can take one that's all r and have it become 50 50 rns. And that process is called Rassam. Ization. Why would it be called Rassam? Ization. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          37:27          cause it makes a receiving mixture of 50 50 mixture from something that was pure. Okay. That's interesting. But what, what may be more interesting is, oh, well this is just a footnote on that. If you here to go from our, our tartaric acid to Bizo tartaric acid, you change just one such hydrogen. The one here has been taken off and put back on the other side to give that one. So that's not rationalization. You're not going to a 50 50 mixture of the two hands, right? So it has a different name. It's called the Pim as Asian. That's just for vocabulary. But what's more interesting than rationalization is the reverse does start with a 50 50 mixture and go to all one. And that's the main subject for the rest of what we're going to be talking about, uh, before the exam. Okay. So, so you start with Rs and you separate it into R and s in separate vials. So you have just the one you want. Okay. One

Speaker 1:          38:36          way we've already seen him doing that was pastor a conglomerate is a mixture of crystals were each crystal is all one hand or all the other hand when it's a 50 50 mixture of such crystals. So there's no net handedness to it, right? But then if you can, if you have a situation like that, notice you wouldn't have that. If the crystals had a right handed molecule and then I'll lefthanded and that a right handed and then a lefthanded, you couldn't pick it apart because you can't separate one molecule from another. Right? But if all the crystals are right handed and some crystals are all lefthanded, right, then in principle you can pick them apart and that's what precisely what posture did when he noticed it. Right? So you can separate them and there are tricks that can help you do it even better or more easily.

Speaker 1:          39:31          When the crystals, when the things crystallizes all right handed or left all lefthanded one is to start with molecules in solution and have only one form crystallize and have the other one stay in solution, then all you have to do is filter it. Okay, and how can you do that? It's because, and chiral resolve poison is another one which will keep one form from growing so that only one form crystallizes. How do you do that? Here's a crystal, which is in solution. And suppose that's exactly at equilibrium. So it neither dissolves nor nor a nor crystallizes exactly at equilibrium. It's saturated. Okay. Now the interior molecules and the crystal are very stable because they have exactly the right environment, right there are more stable than the ones in solution. The ones on the surface are not so stable cause they don't have the neighbors, all the neighbors they need. Right. But the average molecule is exactly the savers in solution. So it just sits there. It's at equilibrium with solution now. So that's the situation we have. That's the temperature and concentration. So that this crystal is exactly at Equilibria with solution. Now suppose that you had a smaller crystal, would it also be at equilibrium with solution

Speaker 1:          40:55          if it were smaller or do you see any difference? The smaller one has a higher fraction of molecules on the surface. Okay. What does that mean?

Speaker 3:          41:13          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          41:13          The molecules on the surface are less stable than the ones in side. If the average molecule here is precisely the same as the ones in solution. So it just sits there. How about this one? The average molecule is less stable than the ones in solution. So what will it do?

Speaker 2:          41:35          It'll dissolve. Okay, so a small one dissolves. This one just sits here. How about, uh, so that'll go away. How about, and so as time goes on, it gets smaller and smaller. The phases move in. How about this one? What will it do? It will grow because it's more stable in solution, right? Bingo. So that one grows as small one said, this one in the middle is called the Ismeta stable. We defined it as being stable is just sitting there. Right? But it's not a stable. If it gets any smaller, it'll shrink if it gets any large rental grow. Right? So you have to get a crystal that size called the critical size before the crystal will grow. Right? So this suggests a way of getting only one form to grow. You have a solution, it's receiving 50 50. Right? But there are no crystals in there that are big enough to grow. Can you see what you can do?

Speaker 2:          42:39          You add a little fairy dust, right? Powdered crystal of one of the two forms, but have them be big enough to grow. So only those will grow and then you can filter it and you have just that one. And that's done industrially as a way of getting just one form to separate the two forms of means of resolution. Okay. And the other way is to add a poison that will absorb on one and keep it from growing. Okay? So that's one way that's actually used industrially as well as in the lab. Another way is to form temporary Daya Steria Mers. Because remember the right and the left are mirror images. So almost all their properties in the same like their solubility, okay. But suppose you put something else with it like uh, here, uh, let's shake hands. Josh care. Does that feel normal? Feels weird, right? That feels good.

Speaker 2:          43:42          So write with right is different from right with left, right? It's a different property, okay? So if what I did was make dayas theoria is by adding something else to these molecules, which itself is only one hand. Like right now all have things that reacted that are right with right and things that are reactive right with left. And what's the relationship between those new things? Are they enantiomers right with right, right with left and now I'm comparing rr with Rs. What's the relation? Are they mirror images? No, they're not married. They're just different, different solubility, different boiling point. Everything will be different. Different reactivity. Right. So on the basis of that, I can separate them, but if I did it in such a way that now I can

Speaker 1:          44:32          remove that thing I added now after the separation I can go back and have the original things separated. Okay. So temporary Daya steric there's one way to do it as chromatography. So the stuff that I put in the chromatography column can be all one hand. I've put the new stuff on, I put that's the packing of the column. I now run stuff through it. One absorbs more strongly than the other doesn't move as fast. So one will come out the bottom of the column faster. That's one way of making temporary dietary verse or making a compound with a chiral resolved. Mate. Okay. For example, this Alinia compound that we saw before, that was that proved fan it off was right. This is how it was actually resolved, how it was separated. So it says at the top they used alkaloids. And alkaloid is an organic base, isolated from plants and the plants made only one hand of it.

Speaker 1:          45:27          And so you use it to make a Daya Steri, Americ salt with the receiving mixture of right and left handed acids. So now you have two salts, right? Right, salt and right left salt and they'll have different solubilities and you can crystallize. So here's what happened. There's Bruce scene, that's one of these alkaloids and you'll see it has all those centers, stereo genic centers. So it's Chiral just one hand, cause she got it from nature. And now you mix 4.7 grams of the acid in five, two grams of Bruce scene, which means that they're at about a one to one ratio. So you have both salts there and now you, uh, you crystallize, you get a solid salt and you weighed four grams, which means you've got 42% yield, right? About half of the stuff out and at that stuff, then you, uh, had you recrystallize it to make sure it's pure, that salt you've got out melting point didn't change.

Speaker 1:          46:19          It was already pure. Liberate the acid by shaking it with hydrochloric acid and ether. Now you've got the acid and it melted 145 to 146 and it's rotation was plus 29.5 degrees and recrystallize and didn't change it. It was pure and it turns out that the other one is melts one 44 to one 46 degrees and is so same melting point essentially, but exactly the opposite rotation. So they manage the separation by making salts that were Daya Steria Merrick, so they had different solubility and then take the salts apart again. And pastor figured a way of doing this, uh, in this story, which I suspect is not a true story. Now I'm going to stop here, but we're going to have mostly what's on Wednesday's lecture is not going to be on the exam, but there's a little more here that I'm probably going to make available for the exam that I'll talk about on Wednesday, and I'll have to think over just how much more it's going to be. Not Too much more probably. Okay, so we'll see you on Wednesday. Most of what's on Wednesday won't be on the exam.
