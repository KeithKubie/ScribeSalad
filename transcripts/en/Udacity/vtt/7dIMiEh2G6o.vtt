00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.780
Given these requirements,
cloud computing provides the following.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.500
First, a pool of shared resources.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.930
These can come in as infrastructure,
compute storage networking.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.650
That doesn't mean that
the cloud provider like Amazon,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.240
is renting out physical machines,
or physical disks.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.980
But instead that it's
renting out virtual machines

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.515
that are even potentially interconnected
to form some virtual clusters of such

00:00:25.515 --> 00:00:28.070
[INAUDIBLE] along with some ability

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.409
to store some amount of state
in the underlying storage.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:37.490
Cloud computing can also come in as
shared resources that are used by

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.570
higher level software services,
so these are soft resources.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.030
For instance, this can correspond to
certain popular services like email or

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.740
database or some processing run times.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.155
So it may be easier to just rent all the
infrastructure along with the software

00:00:55.155 --> 00:01:00.235
stack that's appropriately configured,
as opposed to, as a customer, to come in

00:01:00.235 --> 00:01:04.855
and rent actual infrastructure and then
deal with the deployment of the service,

00:01:04.855 --> 00:01:08.070
the configuration and
the management of the service.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.840
So both of these are options in terms of

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.000
what it is that cloud computing
provides as a resource.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.880
These infrastructure software resources

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.330
are all made available via some APIs for
access and configuration.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.550
The point is that they
need to be accessed and

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.170
manipulated as necessary remotely,
over the internet.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.280
This typically includes web-based APIs,
also APIs that are wrapped in

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.890
libraries that can be integrated in
popular language runtimes like Java, or

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.010
command line interfaces,
or other types of tools.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.760
Providers offer many different types
of billing and accounting services.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.230
There is an entire marketplace
surrounding these cloud services and

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.890
cloud resources that includes
pricing models with spot prices or

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.440
reservations for future prices or
other types of models.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.090
One common characteristic is that
billing is typically not done based on

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.480
actual usage.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.090
Just because the overheads
that are associated with

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.982
ultra fine grain monitoring and
management tend to be pretty high, and

00:02:11.982 --> 00:02:16.100
instead billing is done based
on some discreet step function.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.600
For instance, computer resources may
come in some number of preconfigured

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.560
alternatives, like tiny and
medium and large and

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.490
extra large and each of these
will have a different cost.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.960
So, then the user picks which one
of these matches their needs and

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.460
then pays the corresponding
grade when using the VM.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.010
And all of this, finally,

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.510
is managed by the cloud provider via
some sophisticated software stack.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.550
Common software stacks that
are used in this space include

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.060
the Open Source OpenStack and also
the VMWare's vSphere software stack.
