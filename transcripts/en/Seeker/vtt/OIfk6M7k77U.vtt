00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.810
Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, whether that’s
one of the best beatles songs of all time

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.549
or just a weird song about LSD is up for debate.

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:14.330
But what is LSD and is it actually dangerous?

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.070
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.890
When you hear LSD you might think of a Beatles
song or a little piece of white paper that’ll

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.279
take you on a trip, man.

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.439
While both heralded as a mind-expanding wonder
drug or derided as dangerous and triggering

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.670
delusions, LSD holds some power in our collective
imagination.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.949
But what is it?

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.680
LSD is a derivative of ergot.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.590
If that’s familiar to you, it’s because
ergot is a fungus that frequently grows on

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.040
rye and wheat.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.630
And sometimes that’s baked into bread that
people eat and some young girls start trippin

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.070
on the fungus and then suddenly the villagers
decide to kill a whole bunch of people for

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.070
being witches.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.000
Seriously ergot probably caused the salem
witch trials.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
ANYWAYS

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.320
in small doses, ergot was used as medicine
for centuries.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.650
It was used to aid childbirth to quicken delivery
and stop bleeding afterwards.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.200
So naturally a pharmaceutical company looked
into it’s potential benefits in the early

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.150
decades of the 20th century.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.150
One guy at the company, chemist Albert Hofmann,
was tasked with isolating the compounds and

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.689
trying to synthesize it by other means so
that maybe it wouldn’t kill you.

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.270
In 1938 he tried a few variations, but not
with much success.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.720
On a few animal experiments he noticed that
one variation, Lysergic acid diethylamide

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.799
-25 or LSD-25 had a strange effect on the
mice.

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.549
They acted excited for some reason.

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.210
But still the company didn’t think much
of the compound and mostly forgot about it.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.799
Hofmann, however, couldn't’ stop thinking
about it and those excited animals.

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.259
A few years later he tried to recreate the
compound.

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.009
But one day, while working on it, he felt
a little strange.

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.140
He went home and laid down.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.930
And well.. he tripped the heck out.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.490
But he couldn’t figure out what did it-
he knew it could be poisonous so he took extra

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.450
precautions to avoid ingestion.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.920
So he concluded that he absorbed a tiny tiny
amount of LSD through his fingertips.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.289
So well… he made the compound and proceeded
to experiment on himself.

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.020
And the rest, is history.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.420
LSD became a centerpiece of the counterculture
movement in the 60s after the patents expired.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.850
Millions saw it as a way to expand their spiritual
horizons.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.790
But soon, there was a cultural and literal
crackdown on any sort of drug and LSD became

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.560
illegal in 1968.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.200
Since then it’s been really difficult to
study in a lab because of legal restrictions,

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.290
I mean it’s hard to get funding for something
that’s technically illegal.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.140
It’s still classified by the Drug Enforcement
Administration as a Schedule I drug, labeling

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.060
it one of the "most dangerous drugs" with
"no currently accepted medical use and a high

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.440
potential for abuse."

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.460
But from early experiments and a few recent
ones, we know some things about the drug.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.740
It works in a few ways.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.490
One study published in the journal Cell Press
found that hallucinogens like LSD work on

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.140
serotonin receptors in the brain called 5-HT2A
receptors (2ARs).

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.470
While you might know serotonin as the “feel
good drug”, it actually has a number of

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.500
uses in the brain.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.000
Clare Stanford, a psychopharmacologist at
University College London thinks that "serotonin

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.330
helps keep a handle on perception and actually
stops us from hallucinating,".

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.340
So by blocking the serotonin receptors in
your brain, your brain just kind of loses

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.980
its grip on perception.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.230
Or another idea, Andrew Sewell, a Yale psychiatrist
who studies psychedelic drugs, thinks that

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.950
LSD enhances some part of your perception.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.820
That such drugs lower activity in your thalamus.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.450
It sits in the center of your brain and filters
your sensory information from all your nerves.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.760
Sewell thinks that by dampening down this
filter, you become more aware of the information

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.640
actually coming into your system.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.460
So sights and sounds become louder or brighter,
and you might start seeing things you never

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.460
noticed before.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.730
Or you might just start seeing things period.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.710
But anyways, is this mind altering drug dangerous?

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.730
Well, one study, published in the journal
Lancet found that it’s actually one of the

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.590
least harmful drugs, both to the user and
to others.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.290
I mean when people do take it, they tend to
be overly cautious, like being aware that

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.100
there’s a time and a place for it.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.710
Like festivals in the middle of a desert.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.470
And there’s no link between the drug and
mental illness, according to one study published

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.430
in the journal Psychopharmacology and in fact
it might be beneficial for those who suffer

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.650
from depression.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.260
Okay but before this sounds like a wonder
drug, there are some downsides.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.100
Like bad trips or one common charge aimed
at the drug is that it will induce “acid

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.100
flashbacks”.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.850
Or the idea that the drug changes a person’s
brain so much that days, months, or years

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.980
later, you’ll momentarily get the hallucinations
associated with the drug.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.430
Which in a recent case study published in
the Israel Journal of Psychiatry led to one

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.130
person from 'Alice in Wonderland Syndrome'.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.560
No he doesn’t keep falling down rabbit holes,
but he does keep seeing things and people

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.990
as bigger or smaller than they really are.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.030
But on the other hand one study published
in the journal Drug and Alcohol dependence

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.069
concluded that such flashbacks or Hallucinogen
persisting perception disorder as it’s formally

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:24.900
called, is incredibly rare.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.490
So either way it’s clear more research is
needed on this drug and in the past five years,

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.990
more research is being greenlit so hopefully
we’ll have more to talk about in future

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:44.159
DNews episodes.
