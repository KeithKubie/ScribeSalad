need to go much further

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800

of need you know reform political reform

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240
of need you know reform political reform
 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.680
of need you know reform political reform
that's that's much broader than just a

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690
that's that's much broader than just a
 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.810
that's that's much broader than just a
new president and I think that's going

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820
new president and I think that's going
 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.480
new president and I think that's going
to take time it's going to require

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490
to take time it's going to require
 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.870
to take time it's going to require
political campaign reform no and there

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880
political campaign reform no and there
 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.639
political campaign reform no and there
have been efforts in that direction and

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649
have been efforts in that direction and
 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.969
have been efforts in that direction and
in fact senator mccain has been a

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979
in fact senator mccain has been a
 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.240
in fact senator mccain has been a
supporter of that in the past I think

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250
supporter of that in the past I think
 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.249
supporter of that in the past I think
he's backed away from that but he was

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259
he's backed away from that but he was
 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.980
he's backed away from that but he was
once a supporter of that kind of effort

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990
once a supporter of that kind of effort
 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:12.320
once a supporter of that kind of effort
we need much more of that

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330
 
 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.390
