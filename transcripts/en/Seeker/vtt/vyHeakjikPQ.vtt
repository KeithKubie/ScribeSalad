00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.690
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Bluum.

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.790
This may be a bit of "no duh, science," but
gals, "Science says that you are JUST AS GOOD

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.840
AS GUYS!"

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.370
Yay!!!

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.670
Good day ladies and gentlemen, Trace here
for DNews.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.220
There is a lot of underlying cultural interplay
between men and women.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.070
The pay equality gap is just one example,
but a visible one.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.249
A study out of Stanford in 1998 asked women
and men to write an article, and then later

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:33.620
asked how much they would pay themselves for
the work.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.390
Women routinely asked for 18-percent less
than the men.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.081
Not because they WANTED less money, but because
they didn't compare their rates to men, but

00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:44.540
only to their fellow women.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.020
This was compounded by already existing pay
gaps.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.020
Using THAT as a starting point, why don't
people get a fair comparison?

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.020
Again, we already know it's not that women
undervalue themselves, because a study from

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.020
Cornell that removed the names and sex from
equally qualified candidates found universities

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.020
were more likely to tenure and hire men.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.390
The problem is systemic, but this MIGHT be
starting to change.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.390
Again, might.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.080
A meta-analysis in the Journal of Applied
Psychology studied tens of thousands of leaders

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.180
across a barrage of scientific papers and
found men and women are rated EQUALLY as effective

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.180
leaders.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.180
EQUALLY.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.539
As long as you don't ask them to rate themselves.

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:12.630
They found when you ask a good leader to rate
themselves: men tend to think they're EXTREMELY

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.969
effective and women thought of themselves
as less so.

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:21.729
However, when OTHER people doling the assessment,
both men and women were rated about the same.

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.830
The researchers believe the difference is
the globalization and modernization of the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.830
workforce.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.490
Women are more likely to be in positions of
power than ever, and they're CRUSHING IT.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.810
Of course, if you REALLY look back, you probably
already knew this was coming.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.049
When I was in elementary school everyone KNEW
the girls were smarter.

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:39.310
We just did.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.279
And ANOTHER study in Psychological Bulletin
analyzed the grades of boys versus girls from

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:51.649
1914 to 2011 in 30 countries and found girls
did BETTER in math and science for the ENTIRE

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:52.649
CENTURY.

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.439
The scientists who did the study were shocked.

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.729
They think somehow, we all just... weren't
looking at the data and instead assumed boys

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.249
were better at math and science because there
were MORE boys in those fields as adults.

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:09.150
So if women are equally good leaders, better
in school and graduating from high school

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.280
and college in record numbers, why is there
still inequality in the workplace?

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.280
Unfortunately that's still a mystery.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.280
But maybe with science like this, we can educate
ourselves to equality.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.280
What do you think of all this?

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.280
Tell us your thoughts on equality, leadership
and the future down below.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.980
I know that's a tall order, but I think you
can handle it.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.170
Speaking of tall orders, what about being
a Mom.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.610
Baby stuff is weird and difficult for some
to wrap their head around, so Bluum does it

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.940

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.770
