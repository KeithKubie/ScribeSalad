00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.620
Let's break down the process
of parsing JSON.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.180
JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.190
is a popular way of describing
a collection of key value pairs.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.430
The keys could be
represented as strings, and

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.280
the values can be other strings,
numbers, arrays, or even dictionaries.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.400
For the web services that we'll
interact with in this course,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.440
as well as many others, we can use JSON
to pass data to and from our apps.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.860
For now, I just want you to focus on
getting JSON data and then parsing it.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.530
We can break this process
down into three steps.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.170
First get the raw JSON data.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.120
Second, parse the JSON data into
a usable foundation object,

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.380
such as an NS dictionary or an NS array.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.320
And third, grab the data
from the foundation object.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.340
These steps will make more sense in
code, so let's demonstrate them now.
