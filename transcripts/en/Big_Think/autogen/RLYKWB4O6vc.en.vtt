do I believe in absolute truth I believe

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389
do I believe in absolute truth I believe
 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.509

an effective series let me tell you what

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519
an effective series let me tell you what
 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.419
an effective series let me tell you what
effective theory is an effective theory

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429
effective theory is an effective theory

measure something I don't have to worry

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430
measure something I don't have to worry
 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.730
measure something I don't have to worry
about it in the sense that for example

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740
about it in the sense that for example
 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.370
about it in the sense that for example
let's take newton's laws Newton's laws

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380
let's take newton's laws Newton's laws
 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.320
let's take newton's laws Newton's laws
work just fine but we know that

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330
work just fine but we know that
 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.660
work just fine but we know that
eventually we have to take into account

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670
eventually we have to take into account
 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.189
eventually we have to take into account
relativity if things were going really

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199
relativity if things were going really
 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:31.730

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.650

or we have to take into account quantum

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660
or we have to take into account quantum
 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.760
or we have to take into account quantum
mechanics if we were looking on really

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.250

tiny scales but for the scales we

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260
tiny scales but for the scales we
 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.720

observe you don't have to worry about

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730
observe you don't have to worry about
 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.940
observe you don't have to worry about
the fact that that a ball is made up of

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950
the fact that that a ball is made up of
 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.560
the fact that that a ball is made up of
atoms it's perfectly fine to think of it

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570
atoms it's perfectly fine to think of it
 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.090
atoms it's perfectly fine to think of it
as a ball with some mass because you

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100
as a ball with some mass because you
 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.290
as a ball with some mass because you
would never be able to measure the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300
would never be able to measure the
 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.410
would never be able to measure the
effects of the atoms on the ball when

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420
effects of the atoms on the ball when
 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.439
effects of the atoms on the ball when
you're just throwing the ball so I guess

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449
you're just throwing the ball so I guess
 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.360
you're just throwing the ball so I guess
I believe that we there's a truth that

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370
I believe that we there's a truth that
 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.189
I believe that we there's a truth that
we know because it applies to the world

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199
we know because it applies to the world
 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.600
we know because it applies to the world
as we've seen it as we've measured it

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610
as we've seen it as we've measured it
 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.250
as we've seen it as we've measured it
that's not to say that there can't be

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260
that's not to say that there can't be
 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.990
that's not to say that there can't be
other underlying truths that you can see

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000
other underlying truths that you can see
 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.039
other underlying truths that you can see
if you can understand better if you

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049
if you can understand better if you
 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.789
if you can understand better if you
couldn't measure them better so I think

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799
couldn't measure them better so I think
 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.160
couldn't measure them better so I think
anything we know could be upset if you'd

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170
anything we know could be upset if you'd
 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.109
anything we know could be upset if you'd
look at regimes outside of the regime of

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119
look at regimes outside of the regime of
 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.050
look at regimes outside of the regime of
which we've studied them so but that's

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060
which we've studied them so but that's
 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.789
which we've studied them so but that's
not to say the truth is an absolute it's

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799
not to say the truth is an absolute it's
 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.530
not to say the truth is an absolute it's
absolute like the scales that we've seen

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540
absolute like the scales that we've seen
 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.600
absolute like the scales that we've seen
it but it's just not absolute in the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610
it but it's just not absolute in the
 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.530
it but it's just not absolute in the
sense of applying at the most

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540
