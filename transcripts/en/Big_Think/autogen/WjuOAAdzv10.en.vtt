promising and the difference between the

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:46.870
promising and the difference between the
 

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:48.869

so truely sounds like the advice is to

00:17:55.049 --> 00:17:55.059
so truely sounds like the advice is to
 

00:17:55.059 --> 00:17:56.340
so truely sounds like the advice is to
make sure that something on resonates

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:56.350
make sure that something on resonates
 

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:59.789

more of a risk and they won't take it

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:17.100
more of a risk and they won't take it
 

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.129
more of a risk and they won't take it
because they're afraid so it's a matter

because they're afraid so it's a matter
of knowing who you are and being a

of knowing who you are and being a

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:23.830
little bit bold when you're younger you
 

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:25.470
little bit bold when you're younger you
can afford to be bolder because you

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:25.480
can afford to be bolder because you
 

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.539

don't necessarily have a family to

don't necessarily have a family to

support and all these other things going
 

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:31.619

kind of an adventure an adventurous

00:18:37.049 --> 00:18:37.059
spirit and to try different things and
 

00:18:37.059 --> 00:18:38.940
spirit and to try different things and
to see what resonates with you and what

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:38.950
to see what resonates with you and what
 

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:41.009
to see what resonates with you and what
doesn't yeah I mean if you never try

00:18:41.009 --> 00:18:41.019
doesn't yeah I mean if you never try
 

00:18:41.019 --> 00:18:43.230
doesn't yeah I mean if you never try
you'll never discover and then and then

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:43.240
you'll never discover and then and then
 

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.970
you'll never discover and then and then
my second question was you know we were

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:44.980
my second question was you know we were
 

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.529
my second question was you know we were
talking about the whole you know road to

00:18:46.529 --> 00:18:46.539
talking about the whole you know road to
 

00:18:46.539 --> 00:18:47.789
talking about the whole you know road to
mastery but then once you achieve

00:18:47.789 --> 00:18:47.799
mastery but then once you achieve
 

00:18:47.799 --> 00:18:48.359
mastery but then once you achieve
mastery

00:18:48.359 --> 00:18:48.369

I was curious are there any

00:18:49.619 --> 00:18:49.629
I was curious are there any
 

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:52.080
I was curious are there any
physiological changes you know happening

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:52.090
physiological changes you know happening
 

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:53.850
physiological changes you know happening
in the body maybe in the brain because

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:53.860
in the body maybe in the brain because
 

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.739
in the body maybe in the brain because
we we've heard a lot about rewiring for

00:18:55.739 --> 00:18:55.749
we we've heard a lot about rewiring for
 

00:18:55.749 --> 00:18:59.149
we we've heard a lot about rewiring for
example and things like these no no well

00:18:59.149 --> 00:18:59.159
example and things like these no no well
 

00:18:59.159 --> 00:19:02.820

I'm not a see the fame with the 10,000

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:02.830
I'm not a see the fame with the 10,000
 

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:05.039
I'm not a see the fame with the 10,000
hour study which is brilliant is that

00:19:05.039 --> 00:19:05.049
hour study which is brilliant is that
 

00:19:05.049 --> 00:19:08.310
hour study which is brilliant is that
they could demonstrate statistically a

they could demonstrate statistically a

change in behavior at 10,000 hours now
that's not based on anything where you

00:19:16.109 --> 00:19:16.119
that's not based on anything where you
 

00:19:16.119 --> 00:19:17.549
that's not based on anything where you
could go inside to the brain and

00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:17.559
could go inside to the brain and
 

00:19:17.559 --> 00:19:19.440
could go inside to the brain and
literally map the brain and seeing the

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:19.450
literally map the brain and seeing the
 

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.359
literally map the brain and seeing the
change because we haven't got to that

00:19:21.359 --> 00:19:21.369
change because we haven't got to that
 

00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:24.239
change because we haven't got to that
point yet it was just based on an on the

00:19:24.239 --> 00:19:24.249
point yet it was just based on an on the
 

00:19:24.249 --> 00:19:27.210
point yet it was just based on an on the
on the evidence of how many people at

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:27.220
on the evidence of how many people at
 

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:29.039
on the evidence of how many people at
10,000 hours reached this higher level

00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:29.049
10,000 hours reached this higher level
 

00:19:29.049 --> 00:19:31.499
10,000 hours reached this higher level
now subsequently people have gone back

00:19:31.499 --> 00:19:31.509
now subsequently people have gone back
 

00:19:31.509 --> 00:19:33.539
now subsequently people have gone back
and theorized what happens to the brain

00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:33.549
and theorized what happens to the brain
 

00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:36.450
and theorized what happens to the brain
after all of those hours of practice I'm

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:36.460
after all of those hours of practice I'm
 

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:40.379
after all of those hours of practice I'm
