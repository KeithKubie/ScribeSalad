&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: From the Library
of Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.610
&gt;&gt; Jackie Kookesh:
I'm Jackie Kookesh.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.820
I work for Sealaska Heritage
Institute, which is --

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.010
the mission is to perpetuate

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.980
and provide cross-cultural
communication

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.520
between Alaska Native
Haida, Tsimshian,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.720
and the Tlingit people
of Southeast Alaska.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.650
And our program is based
on community building --

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.750
using our culture and community
to provide a school readiness

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.250
and early literacy program for
birth to five years of age.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.510
We have a video clip
we'd like to play.

[ Beating Drums ]

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.060
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: In 2014, Sealaska
Heritage launched Baby Raven

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.830
Reads, an early literacy program
for Alaska Native families

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.820
with children up to age five.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.760
The goal is to promote school
readiness, language development,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.240
and early literacy because
research shows that children

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.340
who are fluent readers by the
end of third grade are likely

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.470
to do well in school and
go on to higher education.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.110
Research also has
shown the effectiveness

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.360
of using culturally relevant
teaching resources and methods

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.750
to improve academic achievement
in indigenous students.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.440
Through the program, Sealaska
Heritage sponsors monthly

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.910
culturally based family events
designed by elders, parents,

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.150
and cultural specialists.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.630
At the events, students are
immersed in traditional stories

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.930
and practices

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.230
in an intergenerational
Alaska Native community set

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.550
in a traditional clan house.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.340
There, students develop
a love of learning

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.930
through community and culture.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.350
Baby Raven families
also receive free books,

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.230
which are distributed
at the events and mailed

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.050
to families regularly.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.500
The program also funded
production of new,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.830
culturally based
children's books

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.210
that reflect the Alaska
Native world view.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.390
And as of 2017, Sealaska
Heritage had produced nearly 20

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.460
books through the program.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.650
Nine more books will be
published through 2020.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.690
This is groundbreaking
because prior

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.050
to the Baby Raven Reads program,

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.970
only a few culturally
relevant children's books

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.680
from Southeast Alaska existed.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.890
And in recent years,
schools have come under fire

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.670
for using materials that
depict native cultures

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.820
and histories inaccurately,

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.030
creating a disconnect
for native students.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.980
The program also
allowed Sealaska Heritage

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.460
to develop culturally relevant
posters, which were distributed

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.360
to schools and libraries
throughout Southeast Alaska.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.250
Since its inception, nearly
200 Alaska Native families have

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.140
enrolled in the program.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.430
And a study by Juneau's
McDowell Group in 2016 found,

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.710
among other things, that 68%

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.860
of Baby Raven Reads respondents
observed a significant

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.360
improvement in vocabulary.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.300
The study also found
that, on average,

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.270
children in the Baby Raven Reads
program were read to 160 minutes

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.510
in a typical week, compared
to children not in the program

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.620
who were read to an
average of 120 minutes.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.290
"The program has had a profound
effect on enrolled students,"

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.080
said a parent whose child
participated in the program.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.990
She was quoted in a
recent news article.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.870
Quote: "My daughter picked
up the books and said

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.420
to her little brother,
let me read these to you.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.350
I know that I didn't teach
her those letters or sounds.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.710
That's this program.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.860
The impact is huge and
it's a joy to watch."

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.730
Funding for the Juneau based
pilot program ended in 2017.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.020
And that year, Sealaska
Heritage received a second grant

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.280
to continue Baby Raven Reads
for another three years

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.970
and to take the program to
nine additional communities

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.350
throughout Southeast Alaska.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.010
In 2017, the program
was nominated

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.330
by the American Indian
Library Association

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.180
for its American Indian
Youth Literature Award.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.520
The association will
announce winners in 2018.

[ Beating Drums ]

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.740
&gt;&gt; Jackie Kookesh: We're
really proud of this program.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.760
it was a three year
pilot program in Juneau,

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.990
Alaska and the impact,
as the video suggests,

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.330
is over 200 families
in the Juneau area.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.430
What makes it unique and
what I challenge my education

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.230
department staff to look
at was: How are we going

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:52.050
to build a school readiness
early literacy program that's

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.870
rooted in place,
rooted in community,

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.500
is culturally relevant,
and responsive?

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.150
And we didn't have
to look too far.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.280
We had to just look back at
ourselves as native people

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.760
of Southeast Alaska and look
at our core values and look

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.820
at our own belief
system and look at our --

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.520
use our cultural lens in
designing our program.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.190
Engaging family.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:26.630
Engaging our own rich
history of oral tradition.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.830
As you see in some of the books,

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.430
they are taking our Raven
stories and our mythology

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.470
and re -- kind of
repackaging them for children.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.860
And also using the
family monthly events,

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.790
where we bring community
together,

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.570
where we bring families and
the children to the clan house

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.720
in the tradition
of our ancestors

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:57.420
where community came together in
the clan house and told stories

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.550
from our elders and
children listened.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:06.640
So adding that piece of
developing 20 children's books

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.400
and bringing -- and making that
more accessible to everybody

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.210
in Juneau and in the region.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.130
So if you get a chance, we
brought some books with us.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.380
They're hot off the press.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.950
We're pretty excited about that.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:27.700
The other piece that I guess
I want to focus on is to share

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:34.460
with you that any programs
you design need to be designed

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.070
in the community to be relevant

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.870
to the population
you're serving there.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.960
We're here to answer
any questions.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.400
We love this program
-- Baby Raven Reads.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.510
And I thank you so much again.
