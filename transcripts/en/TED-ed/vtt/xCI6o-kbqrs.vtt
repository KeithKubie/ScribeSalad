00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:11.174
a group of youths sneak into the woods,

00:00:11.174 --> 00:00:13.614
where they take mind-altering substances,

00:00:13.614 --> 00:00:15.204
switch it up romantically,

00:00:15.204 --> 00:00:18.494
and brush up against creatures 
from another dimension.

00:00:18.494 --> 00:00:22.074
"A Midsummer’s Night’s Dream" sees 
Shakespeare get psychedelic –

00:00:22.074 --> 00:00:26.954
and the result is a treat in the 
theatre and on the page.

00:00:26.954 --> 00:00:29.334
First performed in the 1590's,

00:00:29.334 --> 00:00:32.424
this play is one of Shakespeare’s 
friskiest works,

00:00:32.424 --> 00:00:35.884
filled with trickery, madness and magic.

00:00:35.884 --> 00:00:37.784
Set over the course of one night,

00:00:37.784 --> 00:00:40.454
Midsummer progresses at a rollicking pace.

00:00:40.454 --> 00:00:44.414
The plot is structured around patterns of 
collision and dissolution,

00:00:44.414 --> 00:00:48.804
where characters from different worlds 
are thrown together and torn apart.

00:00:48.804 --> 00:00:52.714
Shakespeare uses these patterns to mock 
the characters’ self-obsession

00:00:52.714 --> 00:00:56.144
and question authority with a comic twist.

00:00:56.144 --> 00:00:58.384
The action is set in Ancient Greece,

00:00:58.384 --> 00:01:02.814
but like many of Shakespeare’s plays 
it reflects his contemporary concerns.

00:01:02.814 --> 00:01:04.814
The magical setting of the woods at night

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:09.374
disrupts the boundaries between 
separate groups, with bizarre results.

00:01:09.374 --> 00:01:13.733
Here, the bard plays with the rigid class 
system of his own time,

00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:17.813
taking three distinct groups
and turning their society upside-down

00:01:17.813 --> 00:01:20.694
in a world where no mortal is in control.

00:01:20.694 --> 00:01:23.024
The play opens with young Hermia

00:01:23.024 --> 00:01:27.344
raging at her father Egeus and 
Theseus, the King of Athens,

00:01:27.344 --> 00:01:31.023
who have forbidden her to marry 
her lover Lysander.

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:35.343
Hermia has no interest in her father's 
choice for her of Demetrius –

00:01:35.343 --> 00:01:39.090
but her best friend Helena 
definitely does.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.160
Furious at their elders, Hermia and 
Lysander elope under cover of darkness,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.560
with Demetrius in hot pursuit.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.260
This is further complicated 
by Helena’s decision

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.460
to follow them all into the woods,
in the hope of winning Demetrius’ heart.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.095
At this point, the woods are 
getting crowded,

00:01:57.095 --> 00:02:01.105
as the lovers are sharing the space 
with a group of “rude mechanicals”—

00:02:01.105 --> 00:02:06.545
a troupe of workers drunkenly rehearsing 
a play, led by the jovial Nick Bottom.

00:02:06.545 --> 00:02:11.715
Unbeknownst to them, the humans have 
entered into the world of the fairies.

00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:15.368
Despite their magical splendor, 
Oberon and Titania,

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:19.668
the king and queen of the fairies, 
have their own romantic problems.

00:02:19.668 --> 00:02:24.048
Furious at his inability to control 
Titania, the jealous Oberon

00:02:24.048 --> 00:02:30.358
commands the trickster Puck to squeeze the
juice of a magical flower over her eyes.

00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:35.503
When she wakes up, she’ll fall in love 
with the first thing she sees.

00:02:35.503 --> 00:02:36.883
On his mission,

00:02:36.883 --> 00:02:40.763
Puck gleefully sprinkles the juice over
the eyes of the napping Demetrius

00:02:40.763 --> 00:02:46.373
and Lysander, and transforms Bottom’s head
into that of a donkey for good measure.

00:02:46.373 --> 00:02:47.919
As eyes flicker open,

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:53.629
a night of chaos commences that includes
broken hearts, mistaken identity,

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:55.539
and transformations.

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:58.879
Out of all the characters, Bottom probably
fares the best –

00:02:58.883 --> 00:03:01.284
when the bewitched Titania 
lays eyes on him,

00:03:01.284 --> 00:03:05.484
she calls on her fairies to lavish him 
with wine and treasures

00:03:05.484 --> 00:03:08.964
and sweeps the transfigured donkeyman 
off his feet:

00:03:08.964 --> 00:03:11.314
“pluck the wings from painted butterflies/

00:03:11.314 --> 00:03:14.264
To fan the moonbeams 
from his sleeping eyes.

00:03:14.264 --> 00:03:18.004
Nod to him, elves, 
and do him courtesies.”

00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:20.279
While magic is the catalyst to the action,

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:24.309
the play reflects the real drama 
of the things we do for love –

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:28.283
and the nonsensical behavior 
of the people under its spell.

00:03:28.283 --> 00:03:31.953
The moon overlooks the action 
“like a silver bow,”

00:03:31.953 --> 00:03:35.783
signifying erratic behavior, 
the dark side of love,

00:03:35.783 --> 00:03:40.973
and the bewitching allure of a world 
where the usual rules don’t apply.

00:03:40.973 --> 00:03:43.993
Although the characters eventually 
come to their senses,

00:03:43.993 --> 00:03:46.613
"A Midsummer Night's Dream" 
raises the question

00:03:46.613 --> 00:03:50.703
of how much agency we have 
over our own daily lives.

00:03:50.703 --> 00:03:54.768
But it’s not the more realistically
rendered lovers, rulers or workers

00:03:54.768 --> 00:03:56.428
who have the last word,

00:03:56.428 --> 00:04:02.338
but the impish Puck who queries whether we
can ever truly trust what we see:

00:04:02.338 --> 00:04:03.928
If we shadows have offended,

00:04:03.928 --> 00:04:06.738
Think but this and all is mended:

00:04:06.738 --> 00:04:09.048
That you have but slumbered here

00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:11.758
While these visions did appear. 

00:04:11.758 --> 00:04:13.058
And in so doing,

00:04:13.058 --> 00:04:17.698
he evokes the effect of entering into the 
magical world of great theatre

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:21.359
that plays with the boundary between 
illusion and reality –

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.359
and dramatizes the possibility 
that life is but a dream.
