00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.976
(music)

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:38.976
(music)

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.976
We live in an interconnected,
an increasingly globalized world.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.976
Thanks to international jet travel,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.976
people and the diseases they carry

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.976
can be in any city on the planet
in a matter of hours.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.976
And once a virus touches down,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.976
sometimes all it takes
is one sneeze to spread

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.976
the infection throughout the community.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.976
When humans were hunter-gatherers,
roaming the wild savannas,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.976
we were never in one place long enough,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.976
and settlements were not large enough

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.976
to sustain the transmission
of infectious microbes.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.976
But with the advent
of the agricultural revolution

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.976
10,000 years ago, and the arrival
of permanent settlements

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.143
in the Middle East, people began
living side-by-side with animals,

00:01:26.167 --> 00:01:29.976
facilitating the spread
of bacteria and viruses

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.976
between cattle and humans.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.976
Epidemics and pandemics come
in many shapes and forms.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.976
In 2010, for instance,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.976
a devastating earthquake struck Haiti,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.976
forcing thousands of people
into temporary refugee camps.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.976
Within weeks, the camps had become
breeding grounds for cholera,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.976
a bacteria spread by contaminated water,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.976
triggering a country-wide epidemic.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.976
But the most common cause
of epidemics are viruses,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.976
such as measles, influenza and HIV.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.976
And when they go global,
we call them pandemics.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.976
Pandemics have occurred
throughout human history,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.976
Some have left scars on the tissue
and bone of their victims,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.976
while evidence for others
comes from preserved DNA.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.976
For instance, scientists
have recovered DNA

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.976
from the bacteria
that transmits tuberculosis

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.976
from the remains of ancient
Egyptian mummies.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.976
And in 2011,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.976
scientists investigating a plague
pit in the city of London

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.976
were able to reconstruct
the genome of Yersinia pestis,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.976
the bacterium responsible for the Black
Death of the 14th century.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.976
It is thought the plague
originated in China

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.976
in around 1340,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.976
spreading west along the Silk Road,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.976
the caravan route running
from Mongolia to the Crimea.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.976
In 1347, the plague reached
the Mediterranean,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.976
and by 1400, it had killed in excess of

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.976
34 million Europeans,
earning it the title,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.976
the Great Mortality.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.976
It was later historians
who called it the Black Death.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.976
However, by far the greatest
pandemic killer

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.976
is influenza.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.976
Flu is constantly circulating
between the Southern and Northern Hemispheres.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.976
In North America and Europe,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.976
seasonal flus occur
every autumn and winter.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.976
As the majority of children and adults will have
been exposed to the virus in previous seasons,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.976
these illnesses are usually mild.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.976
However, every 20 to 40 years or so

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.976
the virus undergoes a dramatic mutation.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.976
Usually this occurs when a wild flu virus

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.976
circulating in ducks and farm poultry

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.976
meets a pig virus,
and they exchange genes.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.976
This process is known as antigenic shift

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.976
and has occurred throughout human history.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.976
The first recorded
pandemic occurred in 1580.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.976
The 18th and 19th centuries

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.976
saw at least six further pandemics.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.976
In terms of mortality,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.976
none can compare with the Great
Flu Pandemic of 1918.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.976
The first indication of the pandemic

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.976
came in the spring, when American
troops in northern France

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.976
began complaining of chills,
headaches and fever.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.976
Then, the following September, at a U.S.
Army barracks near Boston,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.976
soldiers started collapsing on parade,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.976
prompting their removal
to the camp infirmary.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.976
As a surgeon there recalled,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.524
two hours after admission, they had
the mahogany spots over the cheekbones

00:04:35.548 --> 00:04:37.976
and a few hours later

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.976
you can begin to see the cyanosis
extending from their ears

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.976
and spreading all over the face.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.976
It is only a matter of a few hours
then until death comes,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.976
and it is simply a struggle
for air until they suffocate.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.976
On the S.S. Leviathan,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.976
a huge American transport
en route to Bordeaux,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.976
sick men hemorrhaged
blood from their noses,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.976
turning the decks between their bunks
slick with bodily fluids.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.976
Meanwhile, British soldiers returning
from northern France on furlough

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.976
introduced the flu to Dover
and other Channel ports,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.429
from where the virus
was carried by rail to London.

00:05:13.453 --> 00:05:15.976
By the time the pandemic
had run its course

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.976
in April 1919,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.976
an estimated 675,000 Americans

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.976
and 230,000 Britons were dead.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.976
In India alone, some 10
million were killed,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.976
and worldwide the death toll
was an astonishing 50 million.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.976
But that was then.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.976
Today, planes can transport viruses

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.976
to any country on the globe

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
in a fraction of the time it took in 1918.

00:05:43.024 --> 00:05:45.976
In February 2003, for instance,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.976
a Chinese doctor arrived
at the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.976
feeling unwell.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.976
Unknown to him, he was harboring a new
animal-origin virus called SARS,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:06.976
short for Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.976
Within 24 hours of checking into Room 913,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.976
sixteen other guests had been infected,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.976
and over the following days five boarded
planes to overseas destinations,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.976
spreading the virus to Vietnam,
Singapore and Canada.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.976
Flights between Hong Kong, Toronto and other
international cities were quickly grounded

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.976
and thanks to other emergency measures,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.976
a pandemic was averted.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.976
By the time the outbreak
was over four months later,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.976
SARS had infected 29 countries worldwide

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.976
and more than 1,000 people were dead.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.976
For all that the virus
was rapidly contained, however,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.191
there was little that could be done
about the alarming news reports

00:06:49.215 --> 00:06:51.976
carried by cable news
channels and the Internet.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.976
As bloggers added to the hysteria

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.976
by spreading unfounded
conspiracy theories,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.048
tourism in Hong Kong and other
affected cities ground to a halt,

00:07:01.072 --> 00:07:05.976
costing businesses more
than 10 billion U.S. dollars.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.976
One business, however, did very well.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.976
Above all, SARS was a reminder that pandemics
have always been associated with panic.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.976
If history teaches us anything,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
it's that while pandemics may start small,

00:07:26.024 --> 00:07:29.976
their impacts can be as dramatic
as wars and natural disasters.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.976
The difference today

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.976
is that science gives us
the ability to detect pandemics

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.976
right at the very beginning

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.976
and to take action
to mitigate their impacts

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.976
before they spread too widely.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
