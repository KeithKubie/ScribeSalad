LIV WU: Hi everyone, welcome.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.760
I'm Liv, I'm on the food team,
and I don't need to say

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.280
anything but to say
Mark Bittman is in

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.978
the house, I think.

00:00:12.978 --> 00:00:18.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.230
LIV WU: So, he's columnist at
the New York Times, he wrote

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.930
about food, and for me, what's
most interesting about the man

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.890
is the trajectory of starting
with the pleasures of eating

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.780
to let me show you how to do it,
and you are all, I think,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.060
devoted followers of "How to
Cook Anything" and Everything.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.080
But then he started writing
something about food

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.500
conscience and something about
where food comes from, and

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.040
then this latest, "Vegan
Before 6:00", is a very

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.099
interesting turn in his
heart and his mind.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:12.230
So we have what I hope to hear
from today is the full man and

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.580
all of his ideas.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.830
Please welcome Mark.

00:01:21.635 --> 00:01:23.140
MARK BITTMAN: Great
to be here.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.390
Thank you for coming.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.420
So historically, well,
it's interesting.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.820
I did start--

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.270
I was extremely arrogant twice
in my life, actually.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.300
The first time was I got my
first food column by walking

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.490
into an editor's office and
saying you ought to let me

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.070
review restaurants for you, and
he said, I already have

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.740
someone reviewing restaurants
for me.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.990
And I said, I'd be better.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.260
And he said, try it, and
then he hired me.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.650
So that was--

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.930
I don't know if I feel great
about that, but it worked and

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.690
it was 35 years ago,
so I'm over it.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.170
But the interesting thing is
that led to a transformation

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.700
that was so--

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.990
I guess I have to back up a
little bit, but first I'll say

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.200
that led to a transformation
that was so important to me

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.580
and, in a way, emblematic of
what I believe that I think

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.500
it's worth talking about, even
though it goes way back.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.040
The reason I thought I was
qualified to review

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.190
restaurants was not because
I'd eaten in so many

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.040
restaurants, because I hadn't,
because I couldn't really

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.610
afford to, but because
I'd cooked so much.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.510
So at that point, I was about
30, and I had started cooking

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.030
seriously when I was about 20,
and through that period I did

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.650
many things.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.840
I was a community organizer,
I was a new father, I was a

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.520
father of a newborn.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.750
I'd gotten married before that,
I'd driven a taxi, I'd

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.920
taught high school, I'd
done a bunch of stuff.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.720
But through all of that, I
cooked, and when I decided I

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.050
wanted to be a professional
writer, a freelance writer, I

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.490
did what everybody's supposed
to do-- what everybody was

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.090
supposed to do in those days--
which was I consulted this big

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.580
fat book called "Writer's
Market" and its accompanying

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.560
magazine called "Writer's
Digest".

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.430
And it taught you how to find
an editor, write a query

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.080
letter, pitch a story, I mean,
all this thing was sort of

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.810
done was you're supposed
to learn how to do it,

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:36.810
and do it by road.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.090
So imagine you're an editor
and you get a letter from

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.310
someone you've never heard of
that says, I'm going to France

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.250
in two weeks and I really
want to write about

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.590
restaurants in Leon.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.730
Why?

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.850
But the funny thing is that no
matter what I wrote, no matter

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.760
what I tried to write about,
no one was interested.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.650
When I tried to write about
food, suddenly many people

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.630
were interested.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.810
And that's got something to do
with timing and something to

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.290
do with, evidently, that there
was more honesty there, there

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.490
was more authenticity
there coming for me.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.250
More arrogance, too.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.790
So the funny thing is that
this was in New Haven,

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.880
Connecticut, and I started
reviewing restaurants in New

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.350
Haven, Connecticut,
and guess what?

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.970
After about six restaurants,
they weren't very good.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.920
I mean, you could find you could
find a bunch of good

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.450
restaurants, but
this was 1980.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.130
So after you did the requisite
two or three pizza places and

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.980
the requisite one or two
hamburger places, and a couple

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.730
of seafood places, couple
Italian places, let's give it

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.450
the benefit of the doubt and
say 12 weeks into it, I'd

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.900
started eating at places that
were considerably worse than

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.330
what I was cooking at home
every other night.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.780
So I transitioned the column
from a restaurant reviewing

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.660
column to a cooking column, and
I did that by saying, I

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.110
went to this place and they made
me-- and I remember this

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.120
pretty well--

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.260
and they made me this pasta with
pesto, and it was kind of

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.060
bad for these reasons, but you
can make it really well at

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.670
home, and here's how.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.160
And so I transformed--

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.630
I know, it was very quite
elegant, really--

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.800
transformed this so-called
restaurant--

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.380
since they were paying me
anyway, way sort of--

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.920
so I transformed this restaurant
column into a

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.160
cooking column, and then I
continued to do cooking

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.705
columns from that point on.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:38.750
So through the--

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.710
I'm going to just do a little
chronology here--

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:48.200
through the '80s and '90s, I
wrote about food and cooking

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.700
for first publications around
New Haven, and then

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.660
Connecticut, and then
the Northeast,

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:56.540
and then the country.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.710
And then eventually I became
editor of "Cook's Magazine,"

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.440
which was a predecessor of
"Cook's Illustrated", and then

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.080
I was the first editor of
"Cook's Illustrated", with the

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.100
publisher, Chris Kimball.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.586
And then I started writing for
the "Times", so all of that

00:06:12.586 --> 00:06:15.020
sort of happened by 1990.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.830
But what was interesting then
was that the first interesting

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.030
thing was that, at the
beginning, no one was

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.040
interested in my recipes,
because they were too simple.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.410
So they wanted kind of-- this
was the '80s, there was a bit

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.560
of a food as art
scene going on.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.590
Chefs were really coming
on strong, and the more

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.880
complicated food was the
more interesting it was

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.570
seen to have been.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.450
And it was different on the east
coast than on the west

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.080
coast, because here there was
starting to be more of a focus

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.390
on ingredients, local
ingredients.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.010
But on both coasts, the
commonality was that there was

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.860
some preciousness, and that I
wasn't a part of that scene.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:04.130
In the '90s, the appeal of
simpler food became greater,

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.590
and I was kind of allowed
to do my own thing more.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.890
But a funny thing happened in my
life in the '90s and up to

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:16.970
about 2000, and in the late
'90s, three really big things

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.660
happened in my life--

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.020
they started in the mid '90s.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.750
One, I got this column with "The
New York Times" called

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.860
"The Minimalist", two, I wrote
a book with Jean-Georges

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.990
Vongerichten about his cooking,
and three, I wrote

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:31.920
"How to Cook Everything".

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.370
So by the end of the '90s, I
was a lot more established

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.795
than I had been at that
end of the '80s, say.

00:07:39.795 --> 00:07:43.710
But funny things that happened,
and I lived in and

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:50.640
around New Haven for this
entire period, and every

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.110
old-fashioned supermarket
closed.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.810
And by old-fashioned
supermarket, I mean like the

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.960
one in my neighborhood where I
originally lived in New Haven

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.370
catered to the three major
ethnic groups who lived in

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:05.840
that neighborhood, and at that
time, that was Jews, Italians,

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.010
and blacks.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.530
So you'd see tripe next
to pigs feet,

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.010
next to chicken fat.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.190
And that was--

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.915
everybody was sort of
fine with that.

00:08:14.915 --> 00:08:19.806
That closed, and first turned
into a local chain called Stop

00:08:19.806 --> 00:08:22.480
&amp; Shop, and then later turned
into what it is now, a

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.300
Walgreens, which almost
everything is.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.120
But when it became a Stop &amp;
Shop, that whole sort of

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:36.730
ethnic flavor, multiethnic
flavor was gone, and it also

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:39.710
became clear that food was
becoming more corporate tied,

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.049
less local, there was more stuff
coming-- you know how

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:47.570
you started to see meat that had
been pre-packaged in Iowa

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:51.040
at the big slaughter house,
rather than sides of meat

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.390
coming into the supermarket.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:55.810
You started to see things
like, I don't know,

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:59.710
pre-wrapped strawberries that
were packaged in Mexico,

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:02.760
whatever, instead of boxes
that came from somewhere

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.240
nearby, and so on.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.310
You all saw this, too.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:12.400
And what I saw in my own life
was that I first joined a CSA,

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:17.310
probably the first CSA in New
Haven, if not Connecticut, and

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:20.910
then started gardening quite
avidly, and then started

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:27.290
buying eggs, and dairy, and
chickens, and a big half a

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:30.490
pig, or a quarter of a
veal, or both every

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:31.790
year from nearby farmers.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.510
I didn't think that much of
this, I just thought I'm--

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.390
I don't know why
I put this on.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.420
What had happened, or what was
happening, was that I was

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.850
beginning to recognize that it
was easier for me to get

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:53.070
decent food because I had the
time and ability to work for

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:57.360
it or pay for it or whatever,
but the fact is, not only had

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.810
my standards maybe gone up a
little bit, the availability

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:04.890
of what I had been used to
had gone down a lot.

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:10.470
And so, when you look at what
happened in and around, say,

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:13.380
2000, you're looking at the
publication of "Fast Food

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:17.580
Nation", you're looking at
Morgan Spurlock doing his

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.780
thing, you're looking at Pollan
writing "Omnivore's

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.170
Dilemma", and you're looking
at these people who were

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.940
saying what's wrong with
our food system?

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.570
Which I thought was a very good
question, and one that I

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:33.200
hadn't really asked.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.190
Which was, in retrospect, a
little bit surprising, because

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:41.170
I had been pretty good, I
thought, in my life in

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:45.620
synthesizing or at least in
thinking about how things that

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:49.070
were wrong, that I perceived as
being wrong or going wrong

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:52.880
in the world, in the United
States, were tied together and

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.770
were coming from the same
kind of routes.

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.760
But I never really saw that
in food, and I think it's

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.020
probably because I never really
thought much about

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:06.550
agriculture, and that's because
I had been a, a very

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:11.960
urban person and b, someone
who wrote about cooking.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.360
So around about that time, I
started to think more about

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.890
eating in addition to cooking,
and when I thought about

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:21.050
eating, I thought one thing
that's interesting about

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.390
eating is that the writing
is on the wall.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.810
We're going to eat a more
plant-based diet.

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:28.390
This is really clear, and this
was clear to anyone I was

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:31.190
thinking about this stuff
carefully 10 or

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.670
12 or 15 years ago.

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.460
I was a little late
to the game by my

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.850
standards, but anyway.

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.920
So I decided to write a book
called "How to Cook Everything

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.850
Vegetarian", not because I
wanted to channel my inner

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:47.770
vegetarian, because my inner
vegetarian doesn't exist, but

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:52.720
because I wanted to just become
more familiar with

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.720
plants, and I was--

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.257
"How to Cook Everything",
the original, is

00:11:56.257 --> 00:11:57.380
a very honest book.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.330
There's nothing in there that I
didn't cook, there's nothing

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:01.820
in there that I don't
understand at

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.230
least pretty well.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:06.700
But there's always room to
learn, and if you mess around

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.750
with stuff in the kitchen,
everybody has this experience,

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.330
you get to know it
much better.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.370
So I thought, I'll set myself
this goal of writing "How to

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:18.150
Cook Everything Vegetarian", I
will spend a lot of time with

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:22.360
whole grains, legumes, fruits
and vegetables, of course, and

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.530
I will sort of understand
this world.

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:32.380
And as an aside I will say,
well, first I'll give myself

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.560
the pat on the back, which
is that it was seen by my

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.020
publishers to be a niche book
and it immediately sold on the

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.460
same level as "How to Cook
Everything", so that was good.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:47.700
But I will then say it seems now
to me that's it's a very

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:52.560
Moosewood-style of cookbook,
which is to say--

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.130
one third of you are nodding
your heads--

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:59.650
which is to say it has, to my
current tastes, way too much

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:02.340
dairy and eggs in it.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:06.790
So not to say you shouldn't
buy it, I mean, come on,

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:12.190
support your local cookbook
writer, but I'm going to redo

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:15.210
it and it's going to become
much more vegan-ish.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:19.460
And I think that that's part of
the discussion which we can

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.250
have or not, I'm not going to
go into it in this talk, but

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:24.730
someone can certainly
ask questions.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.690
It's part of the discussion
about the difference between a

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:32.830
heavily plant-based diet and a
so-called vegetarian diet.

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:39.960
"How to Cook Everything
Vegetarian" was published in

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:49.560
2007, I believe, or 2006, and
in the intervening period

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.690
between writing it and starting
to write it and its

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:57.810
publication, a number of very
interesting things happened.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:04.270
One is that the notion that a
plant-based diet was not only

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:08.860
desirable but inevitable
became more and more

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.010
compelling to me.

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:13.500
Two is that I started
to cook that way

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.520
much more often anyway.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.390
And then three is that--

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:22.270
well three and four, which are
the keys, actually, are one,

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.970
there was a publication of a UN
paper called "Livestock's

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:31.820
Long Shadow", which some of you
may have seen, but if not,

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.145
it's online, it's findable.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:40.800
And "Livestock's Long Shadow"
said in some 18% of greenhouse

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.310
gases are generated by
industrial livestock

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:45.850
production, and that
industrialized livestock

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:49.710
production was, in fact, the
second greatest generator of

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:52.760
greenhouse gases after
energy production.

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.240
There are people who have argued
since, by the way, that

00:14:55.240 --> 00:15:00.070
the real number associated with
agriculture in general,

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:03.790
industrial agriculture is
something closer to 50% of

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:07.920
greenhouse gases, and so it
doesn't matter what the actual

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:13.660
number is, the point is that
industrial ag and especially

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.940
industrial livestock production
is a big generator

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.190
of greenhouse gas, is a big
contributor to climate change.

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:23.530
The second thing that happened
at that time was personal, and

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:29.650
in a way, everything you talk
about, when you talk about

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:33.550
food now, everything you talk
about falls into personal--

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:35.900
that is, a sort of nutritional
realm--

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:39.310
and, you might say, political
or environmental realm.

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:42.250
And of course, they have an
effect on each other, and you

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:45.240
can talk about them together,
and there are some happy and

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:49.480
sad coincidences about these
things, but you can

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.560
separate them also.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.000
While I was thinking about
this stuff on the bigger

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.520
environmental realm, something
happened to me which happens

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.020
to many, many middle aged
people, and I was 57 at the

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:04.480
time that I'm talking about,
and that is, I had all this

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.010
health stuff sort of go wrong,
and it was all diet-related.

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:14.850
And it was being overweight by
40 pounds, which, if that

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:17.680
sounds like a lot and you're 20
years old now, think about

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.380
gaining a pound a year for 40
years, and you can see how

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.660
readily that can happen.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:27.170
Seeing my cholesterol level,
which had always been 25 or 50

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:32.000
points under 200, which is some
marker, a marker, was

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.290
suddenly 25 or 40
points over 200.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:38.270
Blood sugar level, which was
always on the good side of I

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:41.130
think it's three, whatever the
right number is, was suddenly

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.830
on the wrong side of three.

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:47.800
I had sleep apnea, and
I had bad knees.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.420
I've been a runner my whole
life, my knees never bothered

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.100
me, and now suddenly they
were bothering me.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:57.800
So I had this conventional
doctor who basically said,

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.730
yeah, we can do the apnea,
that's a little minor surgery,

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.130
or we can get you this thing
that you wear on your face at

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:09.980
night that makes you look like
Hannibal Lecter called a CPAP.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.810
And for the statins, there's a
drug for that, and the blood

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.560
sugar, well, we might be able to
control that with diet, but

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.179
if not, there's always
insulin.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.250
Well, the weight loss, we'll
have to figure something out,

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.380
and the knees, there's always
surgery for that.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.690
So I thought, all of this
stuff, this is 100%

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:29.580
diet-related.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.040
Even I could figure this out.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:38.240
So I went and talked to an older
hippie-ish, or let's say

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:44.145
more thoughtful, really,
holistic, if you want, doctor.

00:17:44.145 --> 00:17:47.710
He had been my daughter's
pediatrician and was an

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.960
iconoclastic genius,
or a brilliant

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.760
iconoclast, however you like.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.620
He became my doctor over the
years, but he lived far away,

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.510
so I couldn't see him often, so
it was almost like he had

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.610
guru status in my mind,
he did and does.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:09.910
And his name is Sid.

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:14.610
And I went to Sid, and I
said here's this stuff.

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.030
And he said, this is
interesting, because you've

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:19.200
always been on the right side of
all this, and now suddenly

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.270
you're on the wrong
side of all this.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:23.390
And I said, OK, what
do you think?

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:25.590
And he said, you should
become a vegan.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:27.480
It was really like that.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.940
And I said, you know what I do
for a living, and I'm also

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:35.060
kind of old, and at this point,
I don't think I'm ready

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.430
for such a radical change.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:38.610
I'm not even sure
I believe this.

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:41.570
But I don't know, what's
option two?

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.980
And he said, option two is,
you're a smart guy,

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.470
so figure this out.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:50.740
So I thought, OK, that's
a challenge.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:51.990
I like challenges.

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.530
And I knew something about
myself, by this point, I knew

00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:00.070
something about rules
for myself.

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:02.710
And I can give two examples
of those.

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:06.850
One is that, when I was 26, I
think, I stopped smoking.

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:12.650
And I stopped smoking by
doing this thing of--

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:16.060
I went to see this doctor,
and he said, I'm going to

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:17.840
hypnotize you and you're
going to stop smoking.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.950
And I said great.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:22.460
Go ahead.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.820
And he said, no, no,
no, we need you to

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:24.790
do some stuff first.

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:25.730
So I said, OK, what?

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.550
And he said, first thing I want
to do is smoke half as

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:30.970
many cigarettes as you're
smoking now.

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:33.640
So I said, OK, same
kind of thing.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.050
It was a challenge,
it was a rule.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:38.250
I went home I smoked half a
pack of cigarettes a day

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.700
instead of a pack of
cigarettes a day.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:44.050
I went back two weeks later,
and I said, OK, I'm ready.

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:44.720
Hypnotize me.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.060
He said, well, we have
another step here.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:47.650
I said, what's that?

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:50.270
He said, I want you to smoke
less, I don't care how much

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.930
less, I want you to smoke as
little as you can, and I want

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.190
you to write down every
cigarette that you smoke, the

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:56.770
time of day, the
blah blah blah.

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:01.260
Did that.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.430
Went back two weeks later,
he was on vacation.

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:06.840
Now, when you're young and
impressionable, you sometimes

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:10.570
think people do things for
reasons other than why they're

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:11.050
doing them.

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:13.430
And I, of course, thought he
was on vacation to trick me

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:16.820
into going another two weeks
smoking not as many cigarettes

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.320
as I wanted to smoke.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.770
But I dutifully did that, and
then he came back from

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:25.630
vacation and he never hypnotized
me, basically.

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:29.110
He said, when you want a
cigarette, I want you to go

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:32.090
into a quiet place and do
a sort of very simple

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:34.760
meditation, and think about the
fact that you want your

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:35.960
health, and that cigarettes are

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.650
robbing you of your health.

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:41.460
And imagine yourself in a
peaceful place, going down the

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.870
stairs, the whole meditation
thing.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:46.570
You're more relaxed with every
step, and blah, blah, blah,

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:49.010
and then get up and don't
smoke a cigarette.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:49.910
It worked.

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:50.690
I mean, it really worked.

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:53.290
So that's how I stopped
smoking.

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:58.135
But what I realized is that I
couldn't just smoke less.

00:20:58.135 --> 00:21:01.670
I had to get to a place where
there are rules and there was

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:02.830
this thing that would
eventually

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:05.300
get me to stop smoking.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:09.130
The second sort of instance I
had of making rules was that I

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.320
was always making rules for
myself to drink less wine.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:18.210
And alcoholism is obviously a
serious subject, but it's also

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:19.290
a spectrum.

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:21.730
So many people think they drink
more than they ought to,

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:23.680
and I'm sometimes one
of those people.

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:30.620
And I couldn't get to the place
where I drank one glass

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:31.710
of wine a night.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:33.500
Sometimes I could, but mostly
I couldn't, and I

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.620
know why that is.

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.610
It's because I like drinking,
and as soon as you have a

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:38.270
glass of wine, your
willpower--

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:39.570
this is why you drink, right?

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:42.640
You soften up, your willpower
is out the window.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.460
The rule doesn't make
any sense anymore.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.950
It's not a good rule.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:53.660
So some people can do that, and
some people can smoke two

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.930
cigarettes a day.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:57.450
So I stopped drinking
for a year.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:58.680
I just said that's it,
I'm going to stop

00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.460
drinking for a year.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.420
So needless to say, at
the end of year, I

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:03.960
started drinking again.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.600
But so when I started thinking
about this eating thing, I

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.270
thought, I need rules.

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:14.450
And I actually don't think
veganism was the right goal

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:17.260
for me or is the right goal
for very many people, and

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.110
here's why.

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:24.030
I think there's a spectrum,
and the spectrum, like all

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:26.200
spectrums, looks something
like this.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.860
Starts over here, and
it ends over here.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:34.250
And over here is Morgan
Spurlock, and over here is the

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:37.510
ideal diet, which we actually
don't know quite what that is,

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.690
and bearing in mind that vegans
can drink Coke and eat

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:45.290
fries and stuff, so it may or
may not be a vegan diet, but

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:48.560
over here is like
the ideal diet.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:53.130
Every single person we have ever
known and every person

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:57.400
who's in this room is on the
spectrum, and almost no one

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.760
has ever been on either extreme
of the spectrum.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.660
And I think what's important--

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:06.890
and this is all post-figuring
this stuff out a little bit--

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:09.790
but I think now what's important
is that we move down

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:10.800
the spectrum.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:17.990
That almost all of us have a
reason to be moving in this

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:22.180
direction, to my left, towards
the sort of plant-based diet

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:26.700
and away from the brilliant
but misfortune

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.520
Morgan Spurlock diet.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:36.030
And that if you get, say, 20%
of your calories from

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:37.850
unprocessed fruits
and vegetables--

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:41.130
which for an American these
days is actually a lot--

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:46.790
and you then, a year later,
are getting 40% of your

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:50.630
calories from unprocessed fruits
and vegetables, you may

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:54.110
not have become a vegan, but
you've improved your diet.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:58.160
And so, if you start with a sort
of typical American who

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:02.620
gets maybe 10% of his or her
calories from unprocessed

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:05.460
fruits and vegetables and
then moves to 20%,

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:06.660
that's progress too.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:09.200
And I think the important
thing--

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.910
I'm jumping ahead of my story,
but I think the summary almost

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:16.280
is that the important thing is
that we're all able to change

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:21.500
the proportion of unprocessed
plant foods in our diet to

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.210
make them be a greater
percentage

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:25.340
of our caloric intake.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:31.150
And that that's sort of almost
the bottom line, with the

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:36.910
addendum that those new calories
from plants have to

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:39.200
replace something else.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:43.930
Because what's happened, in
a way, in the history of

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:47.790
government intervention into
dietary advice in the last 30,

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:54.400
40, 50 years has been because
of the pressures of industry

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:59.160
on USDA, USDA could never have
said in the '70s, which is the

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:03.020
advice that the USDA was getting
in the '70s, was tell

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:06.150
people to eat less meat
and less sugar.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:07.400
Tell people that.

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:13.870
And USDA was unable to do
that, largely because of

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:14.850
industry pressure.

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:19.050
So instead of saying eat less
meat and less sugar, it said

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:25.170
things like eat fewer
foods that are high

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:28.100
in saturated fats.

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:33.590
So there was sort of a switch
from beef to chicken, and

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:37.980
there was sort of a switch from
food that was high in fat

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.840
to food that was low in fat, but
the food that was low in

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.740
fat was not necessarily low in
calories, and the food was low

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.660
in fat tended to be
high in processed

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:49.510
carbohydrates and sugar.

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:52.830
And as a result, we've seen the
biggest weight gain in the

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:54.890
history of the world in
this country in the

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:56.840
last 30 or 40 years.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:02.900
So to back up, I mean,
put quite simply--

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.290
and I don't want to get too
deeply into this, because I

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:08.700
know you have questions, I want
to save time for them--

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:13.010
but quite simply, in 1970, the
per capita production of high

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:16.810
fructose corn syrup in the
United States was zero.

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:21.000
Zero pounds per year, zero
pounds per ever.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.840
And now the production of high
fructose corn syrup--

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.180
per capita production of high
fructose corn syrup for

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:32.310
Americans is between 50 and 60
pounds a year, which averages

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:36.400
out to about 200 calories a day
per person in the United

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.650
States, which obviously--

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:40.030
and we're eating that.

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:43.720
It's not being thrown away,
which obviously explains, at

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:47.040
least in large part, our
collective weight gain in the

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.450
last 20 or 30 years.

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:56.620
So what I figured
out was, for me.

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:59.160
What I figured out was
not for anyone else.

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.490
What I figured out was for me,
and what I figured out was

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:04.240
there are some things
I need in my life.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:07.020
I need pleasure, I need
socializing, I need wine, I

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:12.280
need good food, I need to cook,
I need to cook, I like

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.670
good meat and other
animal products.

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:16.640
I want to keep that
stuff in my life.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.530
On the other hand, I
know Sid's right.

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.780
I need to have more
plants in my diet.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:25.660
So I invented this thing
with a friend.

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:30.540
I invented this thing of let's
be like maniacally strict

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:31.590
during the day.

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:35.010
Unprocessed fruits and
vegetables, whole grains,

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:39.640
legumes, no white flour, no
white foods, really, nuts and

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.840
seeds, nothing processed, no
sugar, blah, blah, blah.

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:49.630
We quickly adapted that to say
but we're allowed to cheat

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:52.270
some, and I'll get into that.

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:55.030
Someone will ask the question
that'll get me into that.

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:56.690
And then at night, we
kind of go back to

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:57.940
doing whatever we want.

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:01.380
We have dinner, we have wine,
and we have steak.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:05.020
Not that often, but
whatever we want.

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:09.130
So we tried it, and she lives
in Kansas City, this woman,

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:14.470
and we talk almost every day,
work together, and after some

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:17.410
period of time, a week or two,
or three, or whatever, she

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:20.710
said, so have you been
doing this VB6 thing?

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:22.670
And I said, the what thing?

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:25.130
And she said the vegan
before 6:00 thing.

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:27.070
I said, oh yeah, I actually
have been doing it.

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:27.940
She said, yeah, me too.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:28.720
It's not that hard.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.380
No it's not that hard.

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.560
And it wasn't that hard.

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:36.050
And so six weeks went by,
and I tried not to

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:36.950
think about it much.

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:39.480
I was just accepting it as
a challenge and as a

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.850
thing that I do.

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:42.580
Six weeks went by and
I weighed myself

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:44.470
and I'd lost 15 pounds.

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:48.540
So I said, well, that is real
positive reinforcement.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:50.030
And I didn't do anything else.

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:54.480
Another six weeks went by,
I lost 15 more pounds.

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:03.260
And let's see, my wife said,
well, you're not doing that

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:05.720
weird snoring thing
at night anymore.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:10.070
And then, if you look up sleep
apnea, most sources will say

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:12.910
that if you're sort of
overweight, not super obese

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:17.200
but sort of overweight, if you
lose 10 or 15% of your body

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.850
weight, your sleep apnea
will go away.

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:23.750
And I had lost precisely
15% of my body weight.

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:24.560
So that went away.

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:29.100
My running, my knees were much
better, and every time I carry

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:33.910
a 30 pound backpack, I remember
that I used to be 30

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:37.800
pounds heavier, because
my knees get tired.

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.280
My cholesterol went down 50
points, my blood sugar went

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:47.040
back into the good range, and
I was enjoying myself.

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:50.850
Sid was very happy, Sid is now
back to calling me the

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:54.270
champion of middle aged blood
levels, or something.

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:01.850
And I wrote some about this
stuff in "Food Matters", a

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:09.210
book that I published in 2009,
but it's not a coming out

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:12.270
thing, I just didn't want
to proselytize because

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:14.070
it seemed too soon.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:20.300
And now it's been six years,
and it seems right.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:25.260
And I'm just going to say why
I think it seems right, and

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:27.210
then I'll take questions,
because I've already spoken

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:30.910
for longer than I intended to.

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:33.320
It seems right because of the
proportion thing that I said

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:37.430
before, and it seems right.

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:40.160
Someone will inevitably ask the
question about why would

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:44.810
you have your biggest meal at
dinner when some data, not

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:48.540
all, but some data point to the
notion that you're better

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:51.090
off not eating your biggest
meal of the day at night.

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:55.800
And my answer to that is I
wanted to create a diet that

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.340
was not a sort of crash diet.

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:02.750
It was not a six week diet, it
was not a do this for a while

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:05.020
and then go back to eating
normally, because everybody

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:06.750
knows that doesn't work.

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:10.930
I wanted to create a diet in
the sense of what the word

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:15.180
diet originally meant, which
was style of eating.

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:17.480
I wanted to create a style being
that you could stick

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:22.080
with, and I think that many of
us, most of us, like to have

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.170
the big meal at the end of the
day because we've done

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:27.950
working, we want to take our
shoes off, we want to kick

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:31.360
back, we want to have a glass of
wine, we want to be able to

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.790
eat what we want to eat.

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:35.170
We don't want to go out with our
friends and say I'm going

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:37.640
to have the vegetable soup
and nothing else.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.010
For some people, that's fine.

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:40.610
For me, that was not fine.

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:46.170
So that's why I think it's good,
but there's a sort of

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:50.830
bigger picture here, and
I'll just say this.

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:52.520
The big picture is this--

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:56.150
there is no disputing that as a
community, as a society, we

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:59.020
need to move towards a more
plant-based diet.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.200
That's good for us as
individuals, and that's good

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.200
for us as a society, and it's
actually good for us as a

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.470
race, as the human race.

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:10.330
That is pretty much
indisputable.

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:12.860
It's also pretty much
indisputable that those plants

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:16.330
should take the place of the
foods that didn't exist 100

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:20.060
years ago-- that is, highly
processed food-like substances

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:22.300
that don't even really
meet the dictionary

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:23.600
definition of food.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:31.730
It's also true, although not
inarguably, but it's also true

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:35.730
that that plant-based diet
should decrease the amount of

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:38.010
animal products we use, because
the earth can't

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:42.860
sustain the amount of animal
products we're using now, and

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:48.230
that amount is increasing
in the developing world.

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:52.050
All of that doesn't even address
humane and ethical

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:54.820
issues of raising animals the
way that we tend to raise

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:57.760
them, which I think is
important, but we could just

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:01.830
leave that aside for a second,
because I don't want to get

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:04.010
into ethics, I want to talk
about the science.

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:07.990
The science is that we need to
be eating a diet that is more

00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:09.020
plant-based.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.930
So what's VB6?

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:12.840
VB6 is a strategy.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.980
It's a strategy to integrate
what we know, what science

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:18.630
tells us, into our own diets.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:22.100
And I don't want to leave here
without saying it's not the

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:23.860
only strategy there is.

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:27.370
It's a strategy I came up with
the works for me and has

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:31.600
worked for a number of other
people, an increasingly large

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.030
number of other people, but
a number of other people.

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:37.580
And some of you are going to
think it's completely idiotic,

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.890
and some of you were to think
it's really coolm and and some

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:43.630
of you will try doing it, and
some of you will not.

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:46.310
But if you think it's idiotic
or you don't try it, then I

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:50.770
strongly suggest you think about
what your strategy is to

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:57.040
get more plants into your diet,
because I think that

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.200
that's the important thing.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.880
The important thing is to move
towards a plant-based diet,

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:04.320
and the less important thing
is how you do it.

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:08.199
And I'm offering a strategy that
I believe works, but any

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:12.139
other strategy that you think
works is equally fine with me,

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:14.360
as long as the goal
is about the same.

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:17.900
So I think I'll stop now and
take some questions.

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:19.949
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming,
and I wanted to ask you, a

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:23.280
month or two months ago, you
wrote a column talking about a

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:27.969
study that Dr. Lustig published
that basically said

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:31.739
the link between sugar and
metabolic syndrome is as clear

00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:34.690
now as any of the science we
have about cigarettes and lung

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:37.670
cancer, and this just
needs to end.

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:40.810
And it seems like your column
was about the only place I

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:43.159
actually saw that study
mentioned, and nobody else has

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:44.199
picked it up since then.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:46.150
So I'm wondering if you could
talk about that a little bit.

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:47.400
MARK BITTMAN: I can
talk about it.

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:57.600
It's tricky, because I didn't
perhaps do what I should have

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:00.990
done at that time, which
was hedge a little bit.

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:06.090
But the fact is that what
Rob Lustig's study--

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:08.700
which was not a clinical study,
but an epidemiological

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:12.760
study-- shows a very, very
clear link between sugar

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.820
intake and metabolic syndrome,
and we know about the link

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:19.880
between metabolic syndrome
and diabetes.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.890
What I think it demonstrates
is that you

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:26.270
can get type 2 diabetes--

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:28.790
not the kind that's genetic,
but the kind that's

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:29.920
environmental--

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:33.390
you can get type 2 diabetes
without even being

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:35.190
overweight or obese.

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:38.110
You can just get type 2 diabetes
by consuming too much

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:41.810
sugar, and this study pretty
much demonstrates that.

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:48.340
His study was rejected by two
or three of the bigger

00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:56.850
journals and was accepted by
another big journal, but

00:35:56.850 --> 00:36:00.820
whether it's because it's not a
convincing enough study for

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:04.380
scientists to accept it, or it's
just too threatening, or

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:06.480
people are waiting for
more of the same

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.590
evidence, I can't say.

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:11.920
I find it incredibly convincing,
the people I'm

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:15.430
closest to in the science world
find the convincing.

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:18.770
Needless to say, you can go
online and find people who

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:20.060
think we're all idiots.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:23.450
I mean, that's easy enough,
because there are many ways of

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:26.390
interpreting this
kind of stuff.

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:28.980
But in my gut, I believe that's
right, and I believe

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:31.520
we're going to see
more of that.

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.980
AUDIENCE: My question
has to do with--

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:37.450
I appreciate what you're saying
and how you chose to

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:40.600
have dinner--

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:42.670
you want to be able to enjoy
dinner as your big meal to be

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:43.780
social, and I agree with that.

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:47.560
I also feel like, here at
Google, we have access to such

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:52.540
amazing food that I guess I'm
wondering how you feel about

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:55.510
or if you would say, do you
think most of your success is

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:59.850
also related to the consistency
of having the same

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:02.640
diet every day so your
metabolism got used to that,

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.420
or do you think that there
could also be success

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:05.540
in you mix it up?

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.830
So you have animal products one
meal a day, versus after a

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:09.670
certain time?

00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:10.960
MARK BITTMAN: Absolutely.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.550
I think the first part of your
question is did my body get

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:14.090
used to this?

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:15.080
No.

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:18.000
I think I just needed
a discipline.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.720
And I understand what it's like
here, and I understand

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:26.160
you can do that.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.430
The danger for me--

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:32.130
and I know nothing about you
or anyone else, right?

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:35.280
The danger for me would be I'd
say, oh, I'm here, it's so

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.490
great, blah, blah, I'm going to
have this big meal at lunch

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:41.590
and I'll have a very
meager dinner.

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:44.950
And then someone would call, or
my wife would come home, or

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:47.500
whatever, and we crack open a
bottle of wine, and next thing

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:50.310
I know I'm making pasta a
little piece of fish, or

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:53.220
whatever, and it becomes oh,
well now I'm having two big

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:54.710
meals a day.

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:59.290
But like I said, the goal is
the same, the strategy is

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:01.140
different, and whatever
strategy works

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.940
for you, by all means.

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:06.800
I think if I worked
in a place where--

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.750
I happen to work in a place
with really terrible food.

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:11.000
Like just--

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.120
this is going online, right?

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:20.000
So I'm on record, here.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.650
I mean, the Times cafeteria
is really--

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:26.740
I'm going to say shameful.

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:29.320
And it's not free.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.540
I mean we don't expect--

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:33.340
you don't expect every place
to have free food.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:35.490
This is unusual, right?

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:38.960
But if I could graze during
the course of the day on

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:42.240
salads, and grilled vegetables,
and stir, fries,

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.730
and whole grains, and beans,
and that stuff was out?

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:47.520
I would probably eat
a lot of that.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.170
I do eat a lot of that, but I
kind have to hunt around my

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:54.330
neighborhood, bring stuff from
home, do all kinds of things.

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.280
But if that stuff was at my
disposal, I think that this

00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:02.180
diet would be much easier to do
than it is for those of us

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:03.590
who have to kind of scramble.

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:08.180
As I have scrambled today.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:12.650
I mean I go into a hotel in the
early morning, and I had

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:15.760
oatmeal and fruit, and then I
went to an airport, and I had

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:21.210
a really, really bad salad in a
plastic clamshell container,

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:25.170
and then I went to the hotel and
I had 18 handfuls of nuts,

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:27.520
or whatever.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:28.770
And I'm starving.

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:33.450
But I think to the extent that
you have access to good food

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:37.940
all day long, this is
easier, not harder.

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:43.030
I give this talk to lots of
different kinds of people, and

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.800
everybody--

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:47.940
and those of you who travel,
who are not on this campus

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:50.480
every day know exactly what
I'm going to say--

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.190
everybody says lunch
is a bitch.

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:53.990
Lunch is really hard.

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:57.390
Lunch is hard if you don't work
in a place like this.

00:39:57.390 --> 00:40:00.980
Lunch is really hard if you're
on a plane or in a cafeteria--

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:04.290
I mean, on the road or in a
strange city or in someone

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:07.380
else's office where they're
gracious enough to provide

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:09.730
lunch, and they bring
out deli sandwiches

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:10.860
one after the other.

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:13.500
AUDIENCE: You mentioned earlier
that someone would end

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:16.680
up asking about cheating
or getting exceptions.

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.560
That's what I wanted
to ask about.

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:20.350
And just going off of your last
answer, I started VB6

00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:22.290
last week, and I think
this place is the

00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:23.120
easiest place to do it.

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.250
I've had the best lunches,
I've had--

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:26.070
MARK BITTMAN: Yeah, I'm sure.

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:28.380
AUDIENCE: But then the weekend
rolled around, and even though

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.040
I live in San Francisco, the
first place I went to for

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:33.580
brunch, the only vegetarian
option was a

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:36.000
grilled cheese sandwich.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:36.950
MARK BITTMAN: Brunch
is deadly.

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:37.610
Brunch--

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:38.946
you shouldn't have brunch.

00:40:38.946 --> 00:40:40.284
But anyway.

00:40:40.284 --> 00:40:45.840
No, but I mean, there's so
many different ways of

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:46.510
addressing this.

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:49.860
And I want to take you back
to the part of when I was

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:52.670
talking, and I said--

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:57.250
I mean, this is so elemental--
but when I said 20% is better

00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:00.500
than 10%, and 60% is better
than 40%, and so on.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.810
It's not a black and
white situation.

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:07.600
So I am on the verge of starting
this talk by saying

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.240
I'm VB6, but I put cream
and sugar in my

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:12.490
coffee, because I do.

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:15.120
And because I think I'm not
going to be perfect in any

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.790
case, but am I going to approach
this kind of goal

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:21.740
that I set out for myself, and
am I going to be better at

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:24.050
approaching it this year
than I was last year?

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:26.680
And to me that's the thing.

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:30.810
And the problem you're
describing specifically is

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:34.000
that, unlike most people, you
have an amazing place to eat

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:34.800
during the week.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.450
So that's great, but it sounds
like maybe you don't cook.

00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:41.490
I don't know whether you cook.

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:46.230
But for those of us who do cook,
this kind of style of

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:48.750
eating is dead easy
if you're home.

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:51.670
Because my home is kind
of like here.

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:54.100
Because it doesn't take me long
to cook something, and

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:56.960
it's good, and it's what I want
it to be, and if it's not

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.730
free, it's usually not
very expensive.

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:03.990
So for everyone, the answer is
a little bit different, but I

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:08.420
do think that it's for those of
you who like to cook, keep

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:09.590
doing it, do it more.

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:13.360
And for those of you who haven't
had that particular

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:16.450
come to Jesus moment,
you might try.

00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:20.850
Because cooking makes good
eating much easier.

00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:22.920
AUDIENCE: I was a vegetarian for
a very long time, and at

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:26.480
some point, I realized that
even though it was easy to

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:27.970
give you myself a pat on the
back, I was actually a very

00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:31.240
bad vegetarian, because my
vegetarian diet was just very

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:34.010
imbalanced, tons of dairy,
tons of cheap carbs,

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:35.950
and stuff like that.

00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:40.850
So my wife and I kind of in
tandem tried to kind of

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:43.200
refactor our eating
a little bit.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:49.420
We ended up moving to a very
meat-heavy diet, and it's been

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:52.750
working well for me, in the
sense that's it's helped wean

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:56.950
me off of cheap carbs, which
was like, the biggest risk

00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:59.440
factor for me.

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:01.310
But at same time, I feel kind
of conflicted about it,

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:04.527
because it's obviously moving
in the opposite direction on

00:43:04.527 --> 00:43:06.840
the spectrum, right?

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:10.330
MARK BITTMAN: Well, it's not
so simple, because if the

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:14.470
spectrum over here is animal
products and processed junk,

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:17.000
and you moved away from one but
back towards the other--

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:23.400
in a half an hour talk, I'm not
going to cover every base

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.880
that there is to be
covered, right?

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:31.570
Frankly, I think you're better
off, but I think what you need

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:32.890
to do is eat more plants.

00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:35.060
I mean, it's really simple, and
you're not going to start

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:36.070
eating more Cheetos.

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:42.090
So you clearly get that,
and you're clearly--

00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:44.880
now this is like a Car
Talk or something.

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:48.130
You're calling in to talk
about your car and I'm

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:50.100
psychoanalyzing.

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:53.500
But clearly, you've got some
ambivalence there, so just

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:57.215
grill that onion and that pepper
with the meat that

00:43:57.215 --> 00:43:59.720
you're eating, and start eating
more of that stuff.

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.480
And smaller portions, too.

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:07.520
I made a stir fry for six people
the other night and it

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:09.850
had 10 or 12 ounces of
meat in it, which is

00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:11.140
two ounces or less.

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:13.400
We didn't even finish it, so it
was less than two ounces of

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.750
meat per person, so that's a
meal with meat in it, but it's

00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:19.572
not a meal with a lot
of meat in it.

00:44:19.572 --> 00:44:20.030
AUDIENCE: Fair enough.

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:21.280
Thank you.

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:28.560
MARK BITTMAN: I am reminded of
my friend, Craig, who I lived

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:33.170
with when I was about 23 or
24, who was a vegetarian.

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:38.980
Everybody flirted, or many
people flirted with

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:43.610
vegetarianism back then-- we're
talking the early '70s.

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:47.430
My own particular flirtation
with it was because this woman

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:51.930
I was going out with only ate
brown rice and broccoli.

00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:53.920
So for like two or three
weeks, I ate

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:56.120
brown rice and broccoli.

00:44:56.120 --> 00:45:00.040
Not sustainable, by the way,
nor was the relationship.

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:03.890
But my friend Craig was a
vegetarian, and he'd sit

00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:07.010
around eating Snickers, all
the time eating Snickers.

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:09.150
And I'd say, you're
a vegetarian.

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:10.980
And he'd say, it's vegetarian.

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:15.290
I'm like, yeah, but this can't
possibly be what your intent

00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:17.500
is in being a vegetarian.

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:21.010
And he said, we all have our
little inconsistencies.

00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:22.090
And it's true.

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:25.610
We all have our little
inconsistencies.

00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:27.330
AUDIENCE: Thank you
again for coming.

00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:29.460
I'm going to take your ideas to
a little bit of a different

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:33.880
level in terms of impact on food
politics and stuff, so

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:35.370
stop me if I'm taking
it too far.

00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:35.955
MARK BITTMAN: No, no.

00:45:35.955 --> 00:45:37.550
Believe me, you're not going
to say anything I haven't

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:38.390
thought of.

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:40.850
AUDIENCE: So, you're really
advocating for a plant-based

00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:43.340
diet, and obviously, I think
some people have noted that

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.670
one difficulty of moving to
the plant-based diet, and

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:49.150
especially veganism is getting
protein and feeling full.

00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:51.940
And so I know a lot of people
have started eating more

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:55.790
protein-rich greens like quinoa,
and one big offset of

00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:58.820
this happening is that these
places where these food

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:01.990
products are made, like quinoa,
end up impacting the

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:03.790
native people who've
been growing them.

00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:07.680
And there's currently a big
issue in South America where

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:10.400
quinoa's been around for
centuries, and now they're

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:13.030
getting priced out of the
market, and so native people

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:16.095
aren't able to eat the quinoa
that they've been growing and

00:46:16.095 --> 00:46:17.910
has been sustaining
them for so long.

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:22.150
So I was just wondering what
your thoughts were on having

00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:24.530
people turn to this plant-based
diet, but also be

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:27.010
conscious of where those plants
are coming from and how

00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:29.530
that affects the local
economies.

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:32.190
MARK BITTMAN: Well, the quinoa,
I won't claim to

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:36.150
understand it fully, and with
all due respect, I don't think

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:40.075
you do either, and I mean
with all due respect.

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:47.020
My most recent understanding of
this, and I could be wrong,

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:50.120
is that the farmers who are
selling quinoa are actually

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:53.490
doing better because they're
selling it for a higher price,

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:57.050
and people around the farmers
who are used to buying quinoa

00:46:57.050 --> 00:47:00.340
at a lower price are not
doing better, are

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:02.460
less able to buy quinoa.

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:05.050
So is it an issue?

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:07.370
Yeah, I'm in total agreement
with you, is it an issue.

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:13.530
There is no no impact diet, and
there is certainly no no

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:17.440
impact diet when you're a
wealthier nation in a world of

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:18.690
less wealthy nations.

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:23.230
Almost everything we do has an
impact on other countries, on

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:24.480
people in other countries.

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:32.470
If we had more regional
agriculture, we could probably

00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:34.170
better deal with this.

00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:38.300
I think the funny thing is
that the quinoa issue--

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:40.720
it's interesting that you
bring it up, because the

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:44.670
quinoa issue is a very singular
thing, because quinoa

00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:47.960
has this reputation of
being high protein.

00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:52.580
But I think the reason people
who switch to a more

00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:56.040
plant-based diet feel hungry is
not because they're lacking

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.710
in protein, because for the most
part, they're not, but

00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:00.840
because they are
lacking in fat.

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:04.770
And that if you eat your
vegetables, and your brown

00:48:04.770 --> 00:48:08.550
rice, and your whatever else,
your beans, whatever, if you

00:48:08.550 --> 00:48:13.470
eat that stuff with a healthy
splash of olive oil--

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:16.420
and by healthy, I wasn't meaning
it's good for you, I

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:19.410
was meaning a lot--

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:20.460
you get fuller.

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:22.930
You really get fuller if you
cook those vegetables with a

00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:24.100
lot of oil.

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:28.110
And I don't mean a cup, but I
mean, this thing of let's

00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:30.970
steam everything, now
you've got no fat.

00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:34.740
You've just got no fat, and
you need fat, and you need

00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:38.490
especially fat that's high in
monosaturates and high in

00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:42.060
omega-3's, and blah, blah,
blah, and there's a whole

00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:45.460
argument about how all of that
part of our diet is completely

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:48.430
whacked out also.

00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:51.460
But you do need fat, and
I think-- and I know

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:52.660
it's true for me--

00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:55.355
that it's not about protein,
it's really about fat.

00:48:55.355 --> 00:48:57.850
It's fat that fills you up.

00:48:57.850 --> 00:48:58.180
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:58.180 --> 00:48:59.820
MARK BITTMAN: You're welcome.

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:01.810
AUDIENCE: Thanks so much
for coming today.

00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:04.080
My question is actually
to do with my parents.

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:07.740
So they tend to eat very
unhealthily, they eat lots of

00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:10.190
things that come out of
packages, and they also have a

00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:11.620
lot health problems.

00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:14.035
And my dad has always been
the sort who yo-yo diets.

00:49:14.035 --> 00:49:15.820
He tries sort of the
latest fads.

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:18.485
I was wondering if, because
you're about their age, if you

00:49:18.485 --> 00:49:20.085
could speak to your--

00:49:20.085 --> 00:49:20.580
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:22.560
--sorry.

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:23.650
MARK BITTMAN: I'm like 41.

00:49:23.650 --> 00:49:26.030
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:28.960
But I was sort of curious that
speaking from your peer group,

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:31.780
any other sort of arguments or
particularly the ones that are

00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:34.250
most important from your book
that you would find would win

00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:34.900
people over--

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:37.400
MARK BITTMAN: Well, I mean
the lifelong habits are--

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:41.380
I always cooked, so I obviously
had a head start.

00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:43.180
And I always cooked
from scratch.

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:46.750
If you look at "How to Cook
Everything", first published

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:56.110
in 1998, no blatant health
conscious stuff, none, but

00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:58.700
it's all from scratch stuff,
and it's all well-balanced,

00:49:58.700 --> 00:49:59.990
and it's all pretty
decent food.

00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:02.510
And you could cook from that
and eat pretty well.

00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:05.120
If you have a lifetime
of eating badly, then

00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:06.100
it's harder to change.

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:07.350
But again, I think--

00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:17.500
I once had the opportunity to
write a non-food book with

00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.920
three psychologists about
how people change.

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:24.360
And it was a self help book, so
of course there are seven

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.800
stages of change, or six,
I can't remember.

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:31.080
You have to go in sequence
down all these--

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:35.620
but the first important stage
of change is intent.

00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:39.900
So if they don't want to change,
they're not gonna.

00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:42.870
You're not going to convince
them and neither am I.

00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:45.770
But if they do want to change,
I think if you say, look,

00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:47.870
there are these three
or four principles--

00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:51.810
I'm sorry-- if you paid
attention to these things you

00:50:51.810 --> 00:50:52.940
could probably do OK.

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:55.540
And one is you've got stop
with the packaged stuff.

00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:58.180
Two is you have to be more
plants at the expense of the

00:50:58.180 --> 00:50:59.380
packaged stuff.

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:02.420
Three is you probably need
to eat less super

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:04.040
high fat animal products.

00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:07.210
And to my mind it always becomes
sour cream, not that

00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:10.580
people eat so much sour cream,
but that that's sort of

00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:13.330
iconic, in a way.

00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:16.750
And then, as I said, this is
a strategy for doing that.

00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:20.200
They can come up with any other
strategy they want, but

00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:25.330
if they're willing to think
about it, then that's the

00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:26.720
direction they need to go in.

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:27.600
Good luck.

00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:29.140
AUDIENCE: Hopefully they'll
listen to you.

00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:29.780
MARK BITTMAN: Good luck.

00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:31.030
They won't listen to me.

00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:35.600
AUDIENCE: So I lived in Japan
for a few years, and that's

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:38.890
supposed to be a really good
diet, and so forth, and I lost

00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:41.060
a little bit of weight, but
not a huge amount eating

00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:42.800
mainly Japanese style.

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:47.070
But it seemed to me that part of
the reason why people were

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:49.670
thinner there is you just walk
a lot more when you live

00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:52.270
there, especially if you
live in Tokyo or Osaka.

00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:53.190
And you haven't mentioned
anything

00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:57.130
about exercise in this.

00:51:57.130 --> 00:52:00.200
MARK BITTMAN: Well, exercise
is, as we say, part of a

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.090
healthy lifestyle.

00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:07.970
And it's clearly true, but it's
also not what I'm about.

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:10.400
I mean, there's nothing
to say.

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.920
I totally agree.

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.330
New Yorkers are among the least
obese people in the

00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:19.900
United States for precisely
that reason, and it makes

00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:27.610
sense, but the data show that
exercise is very good at

00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:30.370
helping you maintain weight,
it's not really great at

00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:31.640
helping you lose weight.

00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:34.990
Helping you lose weight pretty
much happens by eating the

00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:38.040
right kind of food and
fewer calories.

00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:39.910
But no argument there,

00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:41.980
certainly exercise is important.

00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:46.510
AUDIENCE: So I was glad you
brought up cooking your own

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:50.720
food as a way to control what's
going into your body.

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:54.150
I see that as a primary
way that I

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:55.980
feel like I have control.

00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:57.650
But I know a lot of people
who don't like to cook.

00:52:57.650 --> 00:53:03.570
They don't see the point, they
don't care, not interested,

00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:06.602
especially if you live in a big
city like we do, you can

00:53:06.602 --> 00:53:08.590
just walk down the street
and get something.

00:53:08.590 --> 00:53:10.770
And I saw in here, I haven't
read the book yet, but that

00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:12.990
you have a lot of recipe
recommendations.

00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:16.430
Do you have a recommendation for
like a gateway recipe that

00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:17.425
would convince somebody--

00:53:17.425 --> 00:53:17.680
MARK BITTMAN: Like
a gateway drug.

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:19.380
AUDIENCE: --who doesn't
see the point?

00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:19.980
Yeah.

00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:21.775
MARK BITTMAN: Well, that's
a really good question.

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:29.490
The cooking thing is kind of
about priorities, and I think

00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:32.100
a lot of people want control
over their lives, and they get

00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:33.130
it in different ways.

00:53:33.130 --> 00:53:36.550
But I think we can agree that
eating is a really important

00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:40.180
things in our lives, and the
way that you get control--

00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:42.510
I mean, I go out to eat all
the time, too, but I do

00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:47.040
recognize when I'm going out
to eat that I have no idea

00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:48.410
what's in the food.

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:52.410
Like the salad I had for lunch,
which had some white

00:53:52.410 --> 00:53:54.070
dressing on it, I don't
know what was--

00:53:54.070 --> 00:53:58.920
I have no clue what was
in that dressing.

00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:04.370
When you cook, you can't make
food that's as bad as the food

00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:05.650
that you buy.

00:54:05.650 --> 00:54:07.890
And that's not true of
everything that you buy when

00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:09.950
you go out.

00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:16.290
We all succumb to temptations,
and we've all got, or most of

00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:19.360
us have junk food that really
appeals to us for one reason

00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:20.560
or another.

00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:24.050
And you don't know what's in
that stuff, whereas when you

00:54:24.050 --> 00:54:28.230
cook, you really have control
and you actually do know, as

00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:30.090
someone once said, the
active ingredient

00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:33.700
in broccoli is broccoli.

00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:36.300
Things that don't have labels
on them don't have labels on

00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:40.550
them because we know what they
are by looking at them.

00:54:40.550 --> 00:54:43.800
So as for gateway recipes, I did
do a piece in "The Times"

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:48.100
a couple of years ago called--

00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:50.590
I'm only remembering two of
them-- but it was like "The

00:54:50.590 --> 00:54:53.320
Three Most Important Recipes
in the World".

00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:57.640
Oh, I know what they were,
rice and beans, which is

00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:02.210
symbolic of all legumes and all
grains, which can all be

00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:05.540
cooked the same way, and can all
be cooked in advance, and

00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:08.390
can all be cooked in quantity,
and can all be combined in

00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:09.520
different ways.

00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:10.700
So that's one thing.

00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:12.970
Chopped salad, which is
sort of self evident.

00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:16.600
There's ways to make it better
and ways to make it worse, but

00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:19.580
it is what it is, and most
people pretty much like it.

00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:23.360
And stir fry, which is addition
which you get to put,

00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:28.530
if you want to, various animal
products or high protein foods

00:55:28.530 --> 00:55:33.330
that we tend to crave, but
combine them with many, many

00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:33.950
other things.

00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:36.350
And again, infinitely
variable.

00:55:36.350 --> 00:55:40.630
And I swear, if I were to break
down every variation I

00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:43.000
could think of those three
recipes, I could write a

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.420
cookbook with 3,000
recipes in it.

00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:48.260
My style happens to be here's
how you make a stir fry, now

00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:50.650
go figure out how to make
it in different ways.

00:55:50.650 --> 00:55:53.980
But those are three really
good recipes, I think.

00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:56.550
Oatmeal is also very
important.

00:55:56.550 --> 00:55:57.720
AUDIENCE: I'll wrap it up.

00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:59.880
I have a two, almost three
part question.

00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:09.880
Other than less pain in your
knees and maybe sleeping

00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:14.220
better, were there other
benefits from your weight loss

00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:19.910
and the change in the way you
ate that kept you on the diet?

00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:22.540
Did you feel like you
thought better?

00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:25.834
Were you more productive?

00:56:25.834 --> 00:56:27.730
MARK BITTMAN: I still drink
a lot of coffee.

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:34.130
I never felt bad in the first
place, so I can't say I feel

00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:36.650
better, I have so much
more energy.

00:56:36.650 --> 00:56:40.070
I'd like to be able to say those
things, but I also like

00:56:40.070 --> 00:56:42.510
to think that I'm not a huckster
and they're not true.

00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:46.360
So I feel fine, and
I felt fine then.

00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:51.250
I mean, I am six years older
than I was then, so I'm not

00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:55.430
feeling much older, which
is nice, but I can't--

00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:59.070
in fact I don't sleep better,
but the reason I sleep badly I

00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:01.990
don't think has anything to do
with my health or my diet,

00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:04.180
it's because I'm overworked
and nervous.

00:57:07.050 --> 00:57:09.300
I'm sure no one else in this
room has ever had that

00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:11.680
experience.

00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.010
What's the second part?

00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:15.060
AUDIENCE: The second part is
what's at home in your

00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:16.300
refrigerator right now?

00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:21.850
MARK BITTMAN: Well, I'm not
there, so probably things that

00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:23.100
are going bad.

00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:29.420
When I go home, I go shopping
the next day, I figure out how

00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:32.460
many days I'm going to be in
town, which is sometimes two

00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:34.900
weeks, in which case it's
infinite, and sometimes two

00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:37.350
days, in which case, I
have to be careful.

00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:38.090
But I buy--

00:57:38.090 --> 00:57:41.370
I do believe that shopping is
a really important part of

00:57:41.370 --> 00:57:45.220
eating well, because I go, and
I go to the vegetable part

00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:47.440
first, and I try to really fill
my shopping cart with

00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:50.110
vegetables, and then I
fill in with other

00:57:50.110 --> 00:57:52.720
stuff here and there.

00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:55.650
So there's usually a couple
kinds of greens and a couple

00:57:55.650 --> 00:57:59.320
kinds of harder vegetables like
broccoli and eggplant and

00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:01.930
stuff, and tofu.

00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:07.620
Staples like potatoes, and
onions, and Parmesan and that.

00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:09.180
It's not exotic.

00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:11.600
If you're looking for
an exotic answer.

00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:13.950
AUDIENCE: Actually, I'm
looking for a ratio of

00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:15.140
plant-based to--

00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:15.660
animal product.

00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:19.400
MARK BITTMAN: Well, volume-wise,
the bags of

00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:21.420
greens take up lots of room.

00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:25.020
So volume-wise it's way,
way more vegetables.

00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:27.370
You don't need a lot of animal
products to have enough.

00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:36.510
I tend to eat much, much less
meat than I used to, and most

00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:38.760
of that's kind of in the freezer
and gets pulled out

00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:42.460
from time to time, and I might
go to the store by fish on a

00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:45.750
given day, or I might just have
pasta with vegetables for

00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:48.590
dinner or like that.

00:58:48.590 --> 00:58:49.790
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so very much.

00:58:49.790 --> 00:58:51.440
MARK BITTMAN: Well, thank
you all for coming.
