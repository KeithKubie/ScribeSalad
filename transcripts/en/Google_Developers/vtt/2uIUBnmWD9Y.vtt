DALE HUMBY: My name is Dale.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.270
I am the CTO of Nomanini Mobile.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.080
And we build Point of Sale
Terminals for emerging markets,

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.260
mostly in Africa, to sell
prepaid electricity, air time,

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.730
and water.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.270
So today I'm going to talk about
how Nomanini hires developers.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.490
Finding developers in
Cape Town is incredibly

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.760
challenging for a startup.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.200
There's a lot of big
companies around who

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.740
are snapping up all the
good, talented people.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.830
And as a startup without the
name brand of these bigger

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.150
companies, or more
established firms,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.420
it's difficult to get
people to join us.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.700
The developers are the makers
of, certainly, a technology

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.470
company.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.590
The developers and
engineers are the guys

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.710
who are building the product
that the sales team sells

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.560
and that our customers want.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.750
The way that we build
our development pipeline,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.060
or rather, the way we
build our hiring pipeline,

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.060
is-- there's two parts to it.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.760
We've got the junior
developers who

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.160
we find at the
local universities

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.240
through talent
programs, I suppose,

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.277
and internship programs.

00:01:08.277 --> 00:01:09.860
University of Cape
Town, particularly,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.960
has a program called
Break The Rules.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.890
And they invite local tech
companies to go and present

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:15.980
to the students.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.910
And then the students give us
their CVs and we hire them.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.470
And every year we take
on three developers

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.230
in the middle of the
year, the winter vacation,

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.639
and another two or three
during the summer vac.

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:29.430
And that's been very
successful in building

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.970
a pipeline for new developers.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.850
For more senior or
experienced guys,

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.730
we use our personal network.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.917
So myself and the other
guys in the company

00:01:38.917 --> 00:01:40.500
have all got friends
who are generally

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.830
within the tech space.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.990
So we put our art
and social media

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.910
that we're looking for
people to join our team.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.440
Otherwise we use
recruitment agents,

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.230
and we've had a bit of
success with that, as well.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.850
As a startup sometimes
it's difficult to convince

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.420
a developer to join a
startup, mostly because it's

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.890
less established than some
of the bigger companies

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.180
in Cape Town.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.010
So it's a little bit more risky.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.320
Or so we can't necessarily
compete on salary

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.490
that some of the bigger
corporates can pay.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.610
So what we really sell the
developers on who want to join

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.980
us is our vision.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.970
So they can join our company
and really define the product

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.000
that we're building.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.380
With a small team of six
people-- in the early days

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.260
it was just two or
three of us-- we

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
have a huge impact
on what you can do.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.960
We have a very
cross-functional team.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.780
So you don't have a
front-end developer

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.700
and a back-end developer,
or a firmware and hardware

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.410
developer.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.430
We expect the guys to be able to
develop right across the stack.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.100
So everything from
the hardware, if they

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.330
need to implement a feature,
right up to the front

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.980
end that the dashboards need.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.870
Our hiring process has
got five steps to it.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.970
The first bit is
receiving the CV.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.120
Then we have an email
screening, as well,

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.020
where I get to introduce
myself, and Nomanini,

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.020
and what we do, and ask for
a little bit of information

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.875
about the person who
would like to join us--

00:03:06.875 --> 00:03:09.250
what is their current role,
what are some of the projects

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.460
that they've worked on,
what do they really want out

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.690
of their career, why are they
looking to change jobs-- just

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.480
to get an idea of who they are
and what they want out of it

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.710
and see whether
Nomanini can offer that.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.390
The next stage is a telephone
or hang-out screening

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.400
that I do with them.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.100
Just a basic interview,
ask some general questions

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.690
about them and their history.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.900
We do a coding example,
as well, over Google Docs

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.560
so I can see what they're typing
and understand how they do It.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.085
And a little bit of a
creativity question, as well,

00:03:41.085 --> 00:03:44.430
to just kind of get an
idea of how they think.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.692
After that, I've finished my
part of the interview process

00:03:48.692 --> 00:03:50.150
and hand them over
to the dev team.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.980
And it's up to the developers
to interview their peers.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.850
And it's something we
believe very strongly,

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.927
and that it's not up to
management to do the hiring,

00:03:57.927 --> 00:03:59.510
but it's up to the
team to hire people

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.870
that they want to work with.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.141
So the developers, we invite
the candidate in to interview

00:04:04.141 --> 00:04:04.640
with us.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.100
It's two or three devs
sit in on the interview.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.810
Ask them some coding questions,
perhaps some more creativity,

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.670
some thinking questions
just to, once again,

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.467
understand the scope
of their knowledge,

00:04:15.467 --> 00:04:17.050
and also whether
they're going to make

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.940
a good fit with the team.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.420
And assuming they get
through that process,

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.930
the final step, which is
all about the cultural fit,

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.640
is inviting them to
our office to work

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.590
for a half day or a full
day with us to sit and do

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.940
pay programming on
production code,

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.930
that we can see what
it's like to have them

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.270
on the team with us.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.780
If we're going to be working
10 hours a day together,

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.320
we want to know that
they're going to fit in

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.310
well with our existing team.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.820
When we hired our first
or second employee

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.400
we were able to tap into
our personal networks.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.840
But after you've
hired those guys,

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.290
there's not a whole
lot of your friends

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.800
that are looking to change jobs.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.210
So you very quickly run out
of your personal network

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.120
to get recruits.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.550
So we've looked further
afield, and that's probably

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.480
been the biggest change is
looking up in Johannesburg

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.220
and Pretoria for
people to join us--

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.570
and trying to figure out
how you do interviews

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.340
and recruiting
without necessarily

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.070
meeting the person until
towards the end of the process.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.030
I guess we've refined
our interview process

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.706
over the last two
or three years.

00:05:25.706 --> 00:05:28.080
It started off with we're so
pleased that somebody wanted

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.580
to join us that we hired them.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.200
But that's not necessarily
the right decision.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.360
And we've been a
lot more diligent

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.830
about having a formal process,
and keeping the questions

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.774
from interview to interview the
same so we know how to gauge.

00:05:45.774 --> 00:05:47.815
The top people who'd
actually join the team, what

00:05:47.815 --> 00:05:49.440
were their sort of answers?

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.090
And now how does
this other candidate

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:58.060
stack up against some of those
answers and the way they think?

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.080
So I guess just a little
bit more experience

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.200
has helped a lot in recruiting.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.460
For us, the hiring
process can be very long.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.960
And I'm talking about, not
necessarily the recruiting

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.910
like we're looking for
someone now, but from the time

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.060
we see an intern, perhaps,
in their second year

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.391
of university.

00:06:15.391 --> 00:06:17.140
By the time they've
done their fourth year

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.889
and then they're looking
for a job, that's

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:21.790
two years have gone by
that we need to keep

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.470
them warm during that period.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.500
There's other people that
have interviewed with us who

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.390
we ultimately didn't take on.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.460
But because that interviewing
process was a good one for them

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.200
and they enjoyed it,
they recommended us

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.360
to some of their friends
who then did join us.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.040
So we've had at
least two people who

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.240
recommended one of their
friends to join our company.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.630
So building that pipeline--
although if you're recruiting

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.610
it's not immediate,
kind of always

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.050
having that on the back burner,
looking for good employees,

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.820
is important.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.350
Because it does take
years before someone

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.930
you first speak to them to
when they may be changing jobs

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.360
and they want to join you.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.430
We try and limit
the amount of people

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.420
that we onboard to one a month.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.830
That's just because
if you suddenly-- we

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.830
found, through some
of our colleagues

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.470
who've grown their companies
very fast that onboarding

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.690
more than one person a month
really disrupts the culture.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.130
And by the time you've got
that person settled in,

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.750
we've found that
the learning curve

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.660
for them is anywhere
between three

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.730
to six months until
they're fully up to speed.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.590
So getting more
than a few people

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:36.740
joining your team
during that time

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.510
takes a huge load
on the existing team

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:41.940
to up-skill these guys.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.790
When we first started
Nomanini, our CEO

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:48.290
was very keen for us to
build a development team,

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.872
build a product, and then
they would sell the product

00:07:50.872 --> 00:07:52.455
and they don't need
engineers anymore.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.840
I always have taken the
vision that we are developing

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.270
a minimum viable
product, and you

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:03.650
want to iterate on that product,
that it's never finished.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.600
So having a team is
really important.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.830
And to me that means the team
should be an internal team.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:14.030
If you're a technology
company building a product,

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.930
I don't believe you can
outsource that development,

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:20.500
either to a local company or
to, perhaps, companies in India

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.130
or the Far East.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.200
I believe if you want
to do something properly

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.740
you need to do it yourself,
and find the right people who

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.070
are sitting together in the same
room developing that product

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:33.169
that meets your vision.

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:35.919
And that's how we hire
talent at Nomanini.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:37.820
Thanks very much.
