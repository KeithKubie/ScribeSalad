00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.620
&gt;&gt;Anna: Hi, everyone.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.880
I am going to start with a question.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.150
Who here has read a Nicholas Sparks novel
or seen a Nicholas Sparks movie and cried

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.150
their eyes out?

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.150
[laughter]

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.150
OK, good.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.460
That was the human litmus test.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.210
I just wanted to make sure that we're not
all a bunch of Androids here.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.720
I'm Anna.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.910
I'm on the Google Play team.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.040
And we are so excited to be hosting Nicholas
Sparks here today for this at Authors event.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.040
[applause]

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.020
So, Nicholas Sparks is the great living American
romance novelist.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.230
He's written 16 novels and has sold over 80
million copies worldwide.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.400
And what's more fascinating is how beautifully
these novels translate to the silver screen.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.820
Everyone's heard of or seen movies such as
"The Notebook" or "A Walk to Remember" or

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.330
"Message in a Bottle."

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.460
And his latest is called "The Lucky One" and
it stars Zac Efron.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.290
So, everyone, please join me in welcoming
Nicholas Sparks to Google.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.290
[applause]

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.309
&gt;&gt;Nicholas Sparks: Thank you.

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.610
Thank you.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.009
&gt;&gt;Anna: I was hoping we could start off by
hearing a little bit about "The Lucky One."

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.640
&gt;&gt;Nicholas Sparks: Sure.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.430
"The Lucky One" is the, it's a story that
was really inspired by the place I live.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.060
I live in New Bern, North Carolina.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.650
It's a, we're literally surrounded by military
bases.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.229
So, active military personnel are part and
parcel with way of life there.

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.910
So, if you're gonna write a story with characters
who are in their 20s or something, you really

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:40.040
have to consider this as being a potential
what they do for a living job, so to speak.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.440
So, this is a story, because also, let's go
a little further, because they are part and

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.110
parcel with the town where I live, beginning
in 2003 when they began to be deployed overseas

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.320
to Iraq and Afghanistan, you would see them
both before they left and then when they came

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.320
back.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.440
And every single one of them came back changed,
different.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.220
Sometimes, it was, and the level of change
really depended upon the experiences they

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.750
went through.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.840
And so, you knew that this was a very significant
event in their life that they were going through.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.939
These were very significant events that profoundly
moved them.

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:27.939
So, I got it in my mind this picture of this
marine who finds a photograph, right?

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.659
He finds it in Iraq, buried in the sand.

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:37.159
He picks it up, and then, you have this image
that stays with you.

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:38.159
And you say, "OK.

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:43.569
He finds this photograph and then I know that
when he gets back, he's profoundly changed."

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.469
So, you begin to ask yourself, "Why?

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:47.870
What if?"

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.590
And you begin to spin a story in little ways.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.120
And you go through thousands of different
ideas and potential things you can do, but

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.969
eventually, the decision was that he begins
to regard this photograph as his lucky charm,

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.739
this talisman, so to speak, that keeps him
alive.

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.799
So, he goes to deployment one, deployment
two, deployment three.

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.430
All of his friends end up dying.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.659
Everyone in his squad, his battalion ends
up dying.

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:16.659
He's the only one left.

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.139
He's got PTSD to a certain extent.

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:20.529
He's got survivor's guilt.

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:22.040
And he's got this photograph.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.319
And he feels like he's got to heal somehow,
but he doesn't know how.

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.519
He sets off in search of the person in this
photograph.

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:35.519
And little by--.

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.029
And then, of course, it's a Nicholas Sparks
film and it's a girl in the picture and they

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:40.029
fall in love.

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:41.029
[laughter]

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:43.249
And they have the kissing and the water rain
scene, shower.

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:44.599
After that, it becomes one of my movies.

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:45.599
But there you go.

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:46.599
[clapping]

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.999
&gt;&gt;Anna: I actually saw a screening of it yesterday
and it was phenomenal.

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:53.980
So, I recommend everyone go out and see it.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.189
Something I've noticed in your movies and
novels is that printed materials are very

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:58.189
significant.

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:59.189
&gt;&gt;Nicholas Sparks: Yeah.

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:00.189
&gt;&gt;Anna: Such as like you talked about.

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.579
In "The Lucky One," you have an old photograph
or the message in a bottle or the missed letters

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.049
in the notebook.

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.349
And just in general, your novels have this
really anachronistic quality to them.

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.279
But nowadays, when we're looking for romance,
we go on OkCupid and we message a hundred

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:14.930
people and see who messages us back.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:15.930
&gt;&gt;Nicholas Sparks: Right.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.449
&gt;&gt;Anna: So, I'm wondering if you think that
love and romance can still exist in the age

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:21.490
of the internet.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:22.490
And if so, how?

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.570
&gt;&gt;Nicholas Sparks: Of course.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.870
It's very interesting.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.440
When I write these novels, I do so with the
knowledge, the full knowledge, that technology

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.600
changes very rapidly.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.760
There's no question about that.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:41.920
And yet, if technology changes fastest, than
culture itself changes more slowly.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.060
It takes a while for culture to change on
a society level.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.970
And it takes a much, much longer time for
people themselves to change.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.380
I mean, the emotions that people go through
have not changed very much at all.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.380
It's funny, right?

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.590
I write "The Notebook," right?

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:01.590
If you've seen the movie.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.040
How many people here are even like that, right?

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.220
They found it dreadfully romantic.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.510
Hey, this was set in 1946.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.480
You guys were born in what?

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.480
1990 or whatever.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.480
[laughter]

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.670
I mean, this is your grandparents that we're
talking about here, or your great grandparents.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:18.780
But it feels real.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.310
Why does it feel real?

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.820
Because when you see that person you fall
in love with, it feels the same.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:32.890
And it doesn't matter when that is, whether
it's 2012, whether it's 1946 or anything like

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:33.890
that.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:34.970
So, people change slowly.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.890
So, I write these novels with this.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.200
So, can these romantic elements exist in today's
day and age?

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.610
Of course they can.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:44.610
Why?

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.150
Because your emotions don't change.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.410
I mean, look.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.930
These go back, these don't go back hundreds
of years.

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.800
These go back a thousand years, two thousand
years.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.290
You look at something like "Romeo and Juliet,"
which was written 500 years ago.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.440
These two were passionate teenagers.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.020
And they fall in love, but oh no.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.530
Just like "The Notebook," their families don't
get along.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.840
This stuff, this works at any time at any
age.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:18.920
I put these other elements in whether it's
a letter or a photograph in there, I just

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.920
like them.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.920
I just like them.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.450
I think they add something to the novel itself.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:30.160
But at the same time, I wrote "At First Sight"
and it was a very heavy messages coming in

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.800
on email and a mystery that was really a little
bit more dependent on modern technology.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.600
So, it really goes to the story itself.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.600
Not opposed.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.600
Not against.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.600
I'll use it when it's efficient.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.890
But in the end, I'm just writing about these
unchanging human emotions, like love.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:47.890
[laughter]

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.410
&gt;&gt;Anna: Thank you.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.340
So, you yourself are clearly really tech-savvy.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.970
You're very active across a variety of social
media channels, such as Google+.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.050
And you have a lot of followers and fans.

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:04.040
I'm wondering how this has changed the way
you interact with your fan base or if you've

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.610
ever drawn any inspiration from any of your
social media channels.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.920
&gt;&gt;Nicholas Sparks: As far as, yeah.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.130
I am very active.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.750
It is something that you have to do.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.000
This is changing the world.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.500
This technology is changing the way people
interact.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.940
It certainly changes the way that someone
like me, as an author, interacts with a fan.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.090
I still get a ton of fan mail.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.500
I get, I don't know, 500 letters a week or
something like that.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.660
But I get a lot of email.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.630
I get a lot of messages on Google+.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.270
I get a lot of people posting comments.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.230
And you certainly have to be aware with them.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:49.480
And to me, this is really a, it's an interesting
phenomena in that it is a way to interact

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.730
with fans, of course, and this is wonderful,
but to what end?

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:55.260
What is the real purpose of that?

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.210
And I think we're all trying to figure that
out.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:03.470
I can certainly say that we're trying to stay
on the cutting edge as much as--.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:04.740
We're not the cutting edge.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:05.740
You guys are.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:06.740
I understand this.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.880
We're kind of riding on your cutting edge
and trying to figure out the best way to use

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.700
that to everyone's benefit, whether it would
be the fan.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.840
What is the best way to benefit the fans for
this?

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.190
And what's the best way to benefit Google?

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:23.020
Or, what's the best way to benefit my own
business, whatever that means?

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:28.040
So, we're searching just like everyone else
is for the best way and the possibilities

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.040
to use that.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:34.860
But as far as drawing inspiration from, let's
say, messages that are posted, this is a very

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.800
dangerous thing to do.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.729
It's a litigious society.

00:08:39.729 --> 00:08:42.079
People are really--.

00:08:42.079 --> 00:08:44.860
I have a pretty standard rule.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:50.600
And that is that I don't take story ideas
from others no matter where they come from.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.930
So, I don't read unsolicited manuscripts.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.430
I don't read, "Here's a story that you should
write," because you don't wanna write something

00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:00.309
and then have someone come back and say, "Oh,
I wrote you this letter three years ago and

00:09:00.309 --> 00:09:02.420
you stole this story from me."

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.170
I just don't wanna go down that road.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:08.060
So, it's just easier to say no, right across
the top.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.709
&gt;&gt;Anna: That makes sense.

00:09:09.709 --> 00:09:13.519
We, at Google, are really proud of our engineering
culture.

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:17.320
And over 50 percent of Google employees are
engineers.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.019
But sometimes, we're pretty nerdy.

00:09:19.019 --> 00:09:21.730
And we're not exactly the most romantic crowd.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:22.730
[laughter]

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:27.600
And I'm wondering if you have any advice for
those of us that want to do something romantic

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.269
for a significant other, or are just looking
for love in general.

00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:33.120
&gt;&gt;Nicholas Sparks: Looking for love.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.279
Yeah.

00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:36.600
Oh, boy.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.759
Yeah.

00:09:37.759 --> 00:09:42.170
Romantic elements, I think, are, can really
be--.

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:43.800
There's a couple of things.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.950
It really comes down to knowing who you're
with.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:51.920
And you have to know them well enough to know
kind of what they want because if you ask

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:57.019
my wife, for instance, sometimes the most
romantic thing I can do is leave with the

00:09:57.019 --> 00:09:58.839
children so she could be alone.

00:09:58.839 --> 00:09:59.839
[laughter]

00:09:59.839 --> 00:10:03.290
She thinks I am just the cat's meow for doing
something like this, right?

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:04.389
So, you have that.

00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:11.680
So, it's knowing what the other really wants
I guess.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.920
And then, as you can be nerds, but you still
gotta know some of these great cliches of

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.660
life if you're a guy.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:23.160
One of the great pieces of knowledge you must
carry with you throughout your married life

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.240
is "happy wife, happy life."

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.860
[laughter]

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.899
This is very, very, very true.

00:10:29.899 --> 00:10:32.310
And so, what does that mean?

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:37.320
It means hey, you might send flowers when
they don't expect it.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:42.220
And if you're a nerd, you can use the Google
calendar and the alarm will go off on the

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:43.390
12th of every month.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.420
And then, you don't even have to think about
it, but your significant other thinks you

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.470
are the cat's meow.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:51.421
So, you just have to maybe think about it
once a year--time to write the letter, time

00:10:51.421 --> 00:10:54.290
to buy the candy, time to buy a flower.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:57.949
Use your technology and who you are to your
advantage.

00:10:57.949 --> 00:11:01.850
And they'll think you're just, they'll think
you're the bomb.

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:02.889
You're like Noah Calhoun.

00:11:02.889 --> 00:11:03.889
You're, that's it.

00:11:03.889 --> 00:11:08.139
And then, of course, you do need to learn
to kiss romantically in the rain.

00:11:08.139 --> 00:11:12.070
It is a requirement for the ultimate romantic
element.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:13.070
[laughter]

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:16.279
Or, for instance, in "The Lucky One," you
can use an outdoor shower.

00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:21.620
But it is a skill that I would highly encourage
everyone to master.

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.230
&gt;&gt;Anna: What about as a woman?

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:28.360
Are there certain things that we can do to
be romantic for our men?

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:34.899
&gt;&gt;Nicholas Sparks: It's, it comes down to
the relationship itself.

00:11:34.899 --> 00:11:42.279
And to me, when I create female characters,
it's very funny because I generally create

00:11:42.279 --> 00:11:46.699
all these female characters--whichever novel
you read or whichever film you see--these

00:11:46.699 --> 00:11:49.320
females I create have certain characteristics.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.170
And they're the ones I find most attractive
and what are they?

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.990
Intelligence, passion, sense of humor.

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:05.399
But more than anything, it is that I don't
want a wishy-washy woman.

00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:08.869
I don't want her to be defined by me.

00:12:08.869 --> 00:12:11.490
I want her to be her what ever that means.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:15.790
For my wife, who doesn't work, she loves children.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:19.889
She was born to be a mom and she's exceptionally
good at this.

00:12:19.889 --> 00:12:24.189
But if there's a guy that defines her in her
life, I guess I'm number four, right?

00:12:24.189 --> 00:12:26.249
'Cause I have three sons.

00:12:26.249 --> 00:12:27.899
I like this, though.

00:12:27.899 --> 00:12:28.899
I like this.

00:12:28.899 --> 00:12:30.949
I want them to be who they are.

00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:37.600
So, I guess the main point I'm trying to make
from that is be who you are.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.230
Don't be defined solely by your relationship.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:45.949
Be who you are, whether it's work or family
or other friendships.

00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:53.149
Be who you are and then find the guy who appreciates
this quality in you.

00:12:53.149 --> 00:12:56.630
And then, of course, if he's doing nice things
for you, you do nice things for him.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.769
We can get back to the kissing in the rain
thing.

00:12:59.769 --> 00:13:01.160
But, there we go.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.529
&gt;&gt;Anna: Do you have an example of something
really romantic you've done for your wife?

00:13:04.529 --> 00:13:06.160
&gt;&gt;Nicholas Sparks: Oh, my goodness.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.160
Yeah.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.330
I've got all sorts of things.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:09.330
Sure.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.330
[laughter]

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:11.579
I mean, you try to do nice things.

00:13:11.579 --> 00:13:14.019
I wrote her a love letter on Valentine's Day.

00:13:14.019 --> 00:13:15.769
How's that?

00:13:15.769 --> 00:13:18.189
And it was a really good letter.

00:13:18.189 --> 00:13:19.189
[laughter]

00:13:19.189 --> 00:13:22.040
I scribbled this thing out in like, ten minutes.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.040
No.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.439
I wrote it on my computer first.

00:13:24.439 --> 00:13:25.600
I edited it.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.899
Got every word right.

00:13:26.899 --> 00:13:29.509
And then, I hand wrote it out.

00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:31.589
See, that's the way you do it, right?

00:13:31.589 --> 00:13:36.089
It's using technology with the delete key
to your advantage and then going back to the

00:13:36.089 --> 00:13:37.149
old days.

00:13:37.149 --> 00:13:38.629
&gt;&gt;Anna: Wow.

00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:40.860
It's pretty romantic.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:45.309
I read on your website that you worked a variety
of odd jobs before your novel got picked up

00:13:45.309 --> 00:13:46.309
by an agent.

00:13:46.309 --> 00:13:48.029
And it all seemed pretty lucky.

00:13:48.029 --> 00:13:54.259
I'm wondering if your life, if your life would
have been different had there been the existence

00:13:54.259 --> 00:13:58.399
of eBooks or the self-publishing revolution,
when you first started writing?

00:13:58.399 --> 00:14:03.939
&gt;&gt;Nicholas Sparks: eBook and self-publishing,
that is something certainly that we're confronting

00:14:03.939 --> 00:14:07.279
today and it is a change.

00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:13.350
I do believe that my own personal belief is
that there is something intrinsic in human

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:23.360
nature that makes people desire to hear a
good story.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:32.839
And whatever medium that comes out in, whether
it's a play or a film or a story, an oral

00:14:32.839 --> 00:14:36.879
story, just sitting around the camp fire,
someone telling a story or reading a story,

00:14:36.879 --> 00:14:41.439
I just think there's something intrinsic in
human nature that desires such a thing.

00:14:41.439 --> 00:14:47.430
If only, maybe it's because it gives us an
opportunity to escape our lives for a short

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:49.860
period of time, we can live within other characters.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:55.470
We can have super powers, like Spiderman or
whatever, if that's your cup of tea.

00:14:55.470 --> 00:15:01.290
It gives us this opportunity to really escape
into another world for a short period of time.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:07.550
So, I don't know that any of the modern technology
changes--again, it goes back to that human

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.139
nature, this slow-changing emotion.

00:15:10.139 --> 00:15:15.920
I don't know that it's really going to change
the mediums in which it's delivered will change.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:21.899
And I certainly think that, as an author,
you have to be aware of these things.

00:15:21.899 --> 00:15:26.749
And you have to be aware of them and you have
to be ready for the changes and that's why

00:15:26.749 --> 00:15:27.879
I'm here.

00:15:27.879 --> 00:15:30.269
Hey, we're trying.

00:15:30.269 --> 00:15:34.600
Look, I wrote my first novel on a typewriter.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:40.249
For you young people, that's an ancient mechanical
device they used to actually roll paper in

00:15:40.249 --> 00:15:41.410
and write.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.720
And so now, it's computers.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.790
Now, it's this.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:49.399
A few years ago, there was no Google.

00:15:49.399 --> 00:15:50.399
And so, here I am.

00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:51.819
Now, I'm heavily Googled.

00:15:51.819 --> 00:15:54.730
So, you have to be aware of all these changes.

00:15:54.730 --> 00:16:01.110
And, but in the end, from my perspective,
I just have to tell a good story and then

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:07.519
be aware and take advantage of the best medium
to deliver that story.

00:16:07.519 --> 00:16:08.519
And it changes.

00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:13.749
And look, we try our best to keep up with
these things.

00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:15.569
And we're here, really.

00:16:15.569 --> 00:16:20.100
Look, I came in with like 15 or I don't know,
ten people.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.339
These people who came with me today, they're
not here for me.

00:16:23.339 --> 00:16:24.559
They hear me all the time.

00:16:24.559 --> 00:16:25.689
They're here for you guys.

00:16:25.689 --> 00:16:27.279
They're like, "I wanna go to Google."

00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:28.279
[laughter]

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:29.279
"Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:30.279
You.

00:16:30.279 --> 00:16:31.279
Yeah, yeah, yeah."

00:16:31.279 --> 00:16:33.100
And I know that's the chink, but they're here
to learn how we can do things better.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.639
I swear, I mean, if I wasn't at Google, none
of them would be here.

00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:37.639
[laughter]

00:16:37.639 --> 00:16:38.709
They're laughing.

00:16:38.709 --> 00:16:39.709
Yes.

00:16:39.709 --> 00:16:40.709
This is true.

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:46.059
I understand this because they are here to
learn how we can do this better because we're

00:16:46.059 --> 00:16:50.339
doing our best to stay on top of these changing
trends.

00:16:50.339 --> 00:16:54.999
But in the end, my job is still just to tell
the best story that I can.

00:16:54.999 --> 00:16:57.970
And then, have it delivered to the most people
that I can.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:59.259
&gt;&gt;Anna: Thank you.

00:16:59.259 --> 00:17:01.560
So, we're gonna take a few audience questions
now.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:05.709
So, audience members, if you have anything
to ask Mr. Sparks, there's a microphone up

00:17:05.709 --> 00:17:06.709
there.

00:17:06.709 --> 00:17:07.709
And you can line up there.

00:17:07.709 --> 00:17:12.770
And also, I'll be reading a few questions
that your fans posted on your Google+ page.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:14.180
&gt;&gt;Nicholas Sparks: Great.

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:20.430
&gt;&gt;Anna: So, Jessica Nueng Faung asks, "Because
your work is so prevalent in the media world,

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:23.230
do you feel like you are shaping the way we
view love?

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:27.260
Do you think your view on love matches that
of the books you write, or is it merely a

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:28.260
fantasy?"

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:40.900
&gt;&gt;Nicholas Sparks: I don't know that I'm shaping
love at all because I think that when I fell

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:47.830
in love with my wife, it's the same way any
of you who fall in love felt when you fell

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:48.830
in love.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:50.570
Again, it goes through these slow changing
things.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.000
So, I don't think I'm shaping it.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.790
I'm perhaps reflecting it because what I do
try to do is to--.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:58.790
It's less--.

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:02.500
I don't try to manipulate you into anything,
whether it's in the film or whether it's in

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.500
the novel.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.620
I do my best to genuinely evoke the feeling.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.810
"And what is the difference?" you might ask.

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:15.190
If you reach a point in the novel where he
finally says to she, he says, "I love you,"

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:18.460
the proper response from the reader is, "Well,
duh.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.330
I knew that eight pages ago.

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:22.050
What took you so long?

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:23.880
Why did you hold it in?"

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:24.880
That's what you want.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:28.070
But if they say "I love you," and you're like,
"Really?

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:29.070
Right now?

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.210
They just met."

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:35.060
That would be manipulation, whereas I really
try to genuinely evoke.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:42.420
So, I don't think I'm reflecting it, nor do
I really think I'm making it into something

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:43.640
unrealistic, either.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:50.160
I met my wife on a Monday on Spring Break
in Florida.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.460
OK.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:54.690
And if you have any ideas in your head about
what Spring Break and Florida is like and

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:58.140
you've never been there, it's exactly what
you're imagining it to be.

00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:59.140
[laughter]

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.140
Met her on Monday.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.230
Told her we'd get married on Tuesday.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:04.610
Now we've been married 23 years.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:06.230
We've had five children.

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:07.230
Here we are.

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.230
She, oh, by the way.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.380
She laughed at me at this moment.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:12.700
She thought it was a pick-up line or something.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:13.870
But it is what it is.

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:19.710
So, I do think that these, that certainly
long-lasting love is real.

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:24.530
I think that when you fall in love, the emotions
you see on screen or in the novel, I think

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:28.560
they're pretty much what all of you have experienced
or will experience.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.040
&gt;&gt;Female #1: So, Nicholas.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.040
My name is Winnie.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.040
&gt;&gt;Nicholas Sparks: Hello, Winnie.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:36.410
&gt;&gt;Female #1: How did you feel when you watched
the movie, "The Notebook?"

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:38.660
&gt;&gt;Nicholas Sparks: Oh.

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.710
How did I feel?

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:41.710
It's interesting.

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:46.650
The first time you do it, the first time was
"Message in a Bottle."

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:48.610
My point is, it changes.

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:52.080
The first time you do it, they take you up
to the Warner Brothers set.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.470
They bring you into this big theater on the
set and you're the only one in there.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:57.100
And you turn around and say, "Hey, yeah.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.820
Go ahead and start the movie now."

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.510
And you sit there and your eyes are all boggled.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:05.800
And the whole thing is so absolutely surreal,
you barely remember the movie.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.100
You're like, "I picked that name, Garrett
Blake.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.820
I know where Moorehead City is."

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.780
It's all these things that were from your
novel.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:12.910
You're like, "Wow.

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:13.910
Wow."

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:14.980
You're like this little kid.

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:19.400
Now, you're to the point where you walk out
and you're like, "Well, I think the chemistry

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.860
was very strong, but we really need to work
on this musical score in the third act."

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:24.860
[laughter]

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.480
"Some of the editorial drifts.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.350
Did you notice how the clouds were there in
that one scene and then they were gone the

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:31.350
next?

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:32.900
We're really gonna have to talk to the editor
about that."

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:37.690
So, that's where we are now because we've
done it so many times.

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:40.560
So, you're asking right about the middle.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.050
And it was right in the middle.

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:48.600
You're not struck by the surrealism, but you're
not in tune to all of the nuances of film.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.220
So, you're probably most apt to sit back and
say, "Well, I thought they did a really nice

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:53.220
job."

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.130
I mean, that's it.

00:20:55.130 --> 00:21:02.670
Did I expect, after seeing that film, that
it would like, air on cable a hundred times

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:06.590
a year ten years later or whatever, every
year?

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:07.590
No.

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:10.140
I mean, I thought it was good.

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.840
But they have these really, really corny lines
in there.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.270
Like, "Say you're a bird."

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:18.560
"If you're a bird, I'm a bird."

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:22.880
People love this line because it was the way
it was delivered.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.650
And this is meaningful to people.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:25.930
And I understand that now.

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:30.120
But, for instance, if I'm sitting there in
the theater watching that the first time,

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.250
I don't get it at that time.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:33.250
I don't.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.250
OK?

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:38.410
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Actually, Winnie set up my question
pretty well.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:42.110
It's pretty inescapable that your books turn
into movies.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:47.800
So, I'm wondering when you write, do you start
thinking about it as a movie and do you set

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:51.150
up scenes in ways that would translate well
on screen nowadays?

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:54.780
&gt;&gt;Nicholas Sparks: That is a great question.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.280
And it's difficult to answer.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.220
The answer is yes and no.

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.380
Yes and no.

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:06.880
I am aware that there is a very high potential
that it'll be a film.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.890
But there's no guarantee.

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:09.890
There's no guarantee.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:13.200
And if there's no guarantee, in the end, I
have to write the best novel that I can.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:17.160
So essentially what happens is it just makes
the bar that much higher that you have to

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:21.250
jump over because what you're trying to do
is to write a story that works on any number

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:26.040
of levels and you want it to be original and
interesting and yet feel like it can happen

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.750
to anyone.

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:35.130
But if you're dealing with a concept like
originality, the bar is higher now because

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.360
it just can't be original for a novel.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.470
It's also gotta be original for film.

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:45.410
So, for instance, I could never write a novel
that resembled "Sweet Home Alabama."

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:50.290
I could never write a novel, a love story
set on the Titanic.

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:53.320
This sounds obvious, but see, these were never
novels.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.740
They would be original as novels.

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:59.570
But I can't do them, because I have to be
aware that they might make this into a film

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:01.700
and you want some of these images to be real.

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:06.210
So, essentially what has happened is it raises
the bar for those things.

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:09.570
It makes it, your story has to be that much
better.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:12.780
And so, it takes longer to conceive.

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:16.350
But once you conceive the novel and you say,
"OK.

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:20.510
It'll be original if it gets picked up for
film, it'll also be original there."

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:23.650
Then, the process reverts to what it always
was.

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:26.910
And that was you just try to write the best
novel that you can.

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:28.700
Again, because there's no guarantee.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.280
How's that?

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.860
&gt;&gt;Anna: Great.

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:40.280
So, Cathy Ellias asks, "What was it like working
with the amazing, unbelievably hot, Zac Efron?"

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.180
[laughter]

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:47.900
&gt;&gt;Nicholas Sparks: Well.

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.140
I like Zac.

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:55.920
I mean, I wasn't, when you're involved in
a level where I am, you look for different

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.630
things.

00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:59.830
What was I looking for when I worked with
Zac?

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:03.360
I really wanted someone who cared passionately
about the role.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.420
And he was really willing to put the work
in necessary.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:13.030
And I wanted someone who would work with the
director and just be the consummate professional

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:14.680
and really put in a strong performance.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.580
So, you're looking for that on a professional
level.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.240
And then, on a personal level, look.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.490
I bring my little girls.

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:21.490
I have daughters.

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:23.380
I have five children.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:27.030
But my daughters, they saw "High School Musical."

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:28.400
They wanted to see Zac Efron.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.900
So they're like, "Daddy.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.360
Can we go to the set?"

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.590
You're like, "Yes.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:33.590
Let's go."

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:34.590
And so, you bring them.

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:36.010
So, what would you want if they're your daughters?

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:37.830
What would you want Zac to do?

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:39.460
Be nice to them.

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:40.460
That's really what you want.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:44.600
You want them to bend down, say hi, talk to
them, take a picture with them.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.600
Just be nice.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:46.600
OK.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:47.650
He was.

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:49.530
And he's really genuinely a--.

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:50.890
Zac doesn't--.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:52.000
He's a really nice guy.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.260
He doesn't have a mean bone in his body.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.970
So, on a professional level, you get everything
you wanted.

00:24:56.970 --> 00:25:02.580
And then, on a personal level, you get what
you expect or what you hope for.

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:09.590
So, for me, the hot part didn't really play
into it as much, I guess is what I'm trying

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:10.980
to say.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.190
But these other things, it was great.

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:14.240
&gt;&gt;Anna: Unbelievably amazing.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.280
&gt;&gt;Nicholas Sparks: OK.

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.280
Yeah.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.280
Well, he was.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.000
Actually, his performance was unbelievably
amazing.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.530
When you see him, he does not look like young
Zac.

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:27.270
He looks like he's on his way to being a real
leading man in the future.

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:28.310
He plays a young man.

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:29.310
And he's 24.

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:33.900
And we wanted him because he's the same age
as the marines that live in my town.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:35.440
If you're not an officer, you're 18 to 25.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.650
So, he was perfect.

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:38.000
&gt;&gt;Anna: Thank you.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.430
&gt;&gt;Female #3: I have a quick question for you.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:43.260
Obviously, you've written quite a number of
books.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:44.260
Which one is your favorite?

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:45.820
&gt;&gt;Nicholas Sparks: Ooh.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.930
Which one is my favorite?

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:49.530
A couple ways to answer that.

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:56.410
I think the one that was my favorite was "Three
Weeks With My Brother."

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:59.070
That's a memoir.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:01.590
And I liked that story.

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:05.300
It was a story about a trip that my brother
and I took around the world.

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:10.480
And this trip took three weeks, hence the
highly original title "Three Weeks With My

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:14.180
Brother."

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:15.530
And you what this is about though?

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:17.120
It tells a story of--.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.680
You'll learn a little bit about me in all
this stuff.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.460
But really, it's a story about brotherhood.

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:27.600
And it's about family because my brother and
I, we went, we lost, we had a very challenging

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.930
period for a while.

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:34.450
I lost my mother and my father and my younger
sister in a relatively short period of time,

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:38.280
so that the only ones left in our family were
my brother and I.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.370
We were the only ones left.

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:44.240
But how do you get beyond the death of your
family?

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.360
How do you do that?

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.580
You gotta have someone there.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.320
And for me, it was my brother.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:55.400
So, it's a story about brotherhood, but it's
a story about the power of family.

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.670
It's a story about healing.

00:26:57.670 --> 00:26:59.320
It'll make you laugh.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.320
It'll make you cry.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.880
And you learn a little bit about the world.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.910
So, to me, that is the book I recommend.

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:07.000
Hey, you've never read me?

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Try this one.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.330
I can't you'll like exactly the novels that,
every novel.

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:17.820
Everyone has different opinions on novels
and what kind they like to read.

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:19.620
But this is a memoir of sorts.

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:24.940
And it's really a memoir that I think will
make you closer to your own family.

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:30.740
And that, I think, is, or hopefully will inspire
you to be as close to your family as you possibly

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:31.740
can be.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:38.450
&gt;&gt;Anna: So, you may have just answered this
question, but Dustioni Pinkham asks, "If you

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:43.110
could live your life out as any one of the
characters from your book, which one would

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:44.580
you choose to be?"

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:47.620
&gt;&gt;Nicholas Sparks: I don't know.

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:50.900
That's a tough question.

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.230
[pause]

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:55.030
I could be any of the guys.

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:56.040
[laughter]

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.310
Do you know why?

00:27:57.310 --> 00:28:01.880
Because when I create these female characters,
they're all the woman that I married in a

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.070
way.

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:04.070
That's why.

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:05.530
And I mean that.

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:09.240
Oh, that’s such a cheap answer.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.240
[laughter]

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.280
I hear you.

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.940
I can hear the wheels spinning, engineers
and all.

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.280
Put some oil in the wheels.

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.470
They're squeaking.

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:22.770
No, really, that's true because when I create
these female characters, they're all a little

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:24.100
bit, they're like my wife.

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:26.570
They're intelligent, passionate, sense of
humor.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:27.570
They're loyal.

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:28.570
They love deeply.

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:30.440
They've got all these great qualities.

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:35.020
And the guys, literally in all these novels,
have to prove themselves worthy of having

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.190
a girl like this.

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:39.020
I've done it over and over and it's what I
find most attractive.

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:42.880
So, it doesn't matter whether you're Landon
or whether you're Logan or whether you're

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:45.640
Noah or whether you're John.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.730
In the end, do you know what you're getting?

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:49.860
You're getting the girl.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:50.860
And she's a good girl.

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:51.860
So, there you go.

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:52.860
&gt;&gt;Anna: Thanks.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:55.790
&gt;&gt;Female #4: "Three Weeks With My Brother"
was one of my favorite books.

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:59.750
And so, I was wondering if you were going
to write something different like that again

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:01.210
and if you enjoyed writing that.

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:02.210
&gt;&gt;Nicholas Sparks: Yeah.

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:03.260
That was "Three Weeks With My Brother."

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:04.860
I have been debating.

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:09.910
I have--it's in my contract--I can write another
non-fiction book.

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:11.270
And so, my choice--.

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:14.180
So, I'm debating it.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:19.870
If I was to do it and go that route, I would
do something like, it's called "Ten Days With

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:20.870
My Son."

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:24.000
It would be a book about fatherhood.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.420
Because my son and I, we had this, he was
a track runner and I was his coach.

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:33.730
It's a very interesting relationship if you
coach your son.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:38.651
And especially if you are as immensely talented
as my son was.

00:29:38.651 --> 00:29:41.510
My son holds the junior world record in track
and field.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:43.360
He's very immensely talented.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.160
And yet, he didn't much care about running.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.860
And so, it was a very interesting relationship.

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:53.330
And he's such a nice young man.

00:29:53.330 --> 00:30:01.640
And so, I would write something about that--the
lessons you learn in trying to be the best

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:02.850
father you can be.

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:04.031
And I'm not claiming I was.

00:30:04.031 --> 00:30:07.250
I was just saying there's a lot of things
you learn on the way.

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.500
Parenting is hard.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:10.500
Parenting is hard.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.500
Marriage is hard.

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:12.620
These relationships are challenging.

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:16.050
And all you can do is try to do your best.

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:22.350
&gt;&gt;Anna: So, September Grace asks, "What is
the number one piece of advice you would give

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:23.690
to an unknown writer?

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:26.110
I would love this chance because I admire
your ability.

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:28.240
I dream of writing for a living."

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:35.870
&gt;&gt;Nicholas Sparks: The number one piece of
advice you can have and I have given this

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:37.080
advice over and over and over.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.250
And I don't know how many people ever follow
it.

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:40.750
I mean, that's the thing about advice.

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:42.090
They don't want advice.

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:43.720
They want it to be handed to them.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:48.260
But really, if you wanna do anything well,
you have to learn from people who do it well.

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:50.740
This is just, this is the best way to do it.

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:53.720
So, you have to read a lot.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.750
You have to read.

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:56.520
If you wanna be a writer, you have to read.

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.020
You have to read across a variety of genres.

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:06.020
If you wanna write like me, you can't only
read me because my ability to write like me

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:09.860
comes from the fact that I've read a lot of
suspense novels because some of my novels

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.050
have suspense in them.

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:14.820
I've read a lot of horror novels because some
of my novels can get scary.

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:20.060
I've read a lot of novels about just family
matters 'cause I deal with father/daughter

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.870
stories, or mother/son stories.

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:26.100
So, you have to read across a variety of things.

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:32.970
And then, you have to read with an eye toward
what authors do well and then how they do

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:33.970
it well.

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:39.410
Like, if you are reading a novel and you say
to yourself, "Wow, I really like this character."

00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:43.500
Well, take a moment to figure out why, if
you wanna be a writer.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:44.500
Why?

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:45.500
Why do I like this character?

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.620
Was it her voice or his voice?

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:49.450
How many pages did that take?

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:53.670
Was it primarily narrative or dialogue or
did something happen and it was some event

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:56.309
that she did that really made me like her?

00:31:56.309 --> 00:31:58.120
How long did it take me for like her?

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:01.610
Did I like her ten pages ago or did it come
on suddenly?

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:03.030
Why did it come on suddenly?

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:04.620
Was there a build-up to this?

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:10.970
So, if you really read with an eye toward
learning what works and what doesn't work,

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:15.240
well, little by little, you'll accumulate
the knowledge you need to write these kinds

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.240
of scenes in novel.

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:20.700
If you learn how to make a great character
you like, well, now you know how to do it.

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:21.700
So, that's what you have to do.

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:25.470
You have to read with that and then, of course,
you have to start putting it down on paper.

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:27.870
&gt;&gt;Anna: So, who and what do you read?

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:30.340
&gt;&gt;Nicholas Sparks: I read everything.

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:33.910
I read about 120 books a year.

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:36.030
I read all the time.

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:39.100
It's probably 40 percent non-fiction.

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:43.670
And non-fiction is history, economics, and
biographies.

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:46.990
But if they're biographies, they're not celebrities
or politicians.

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:48.430
So, any other biography.

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:53.500
You have to be dead before I'll read about
you, essentially.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:57.550
And as far as the other 60 percent, it's a
lot of commercial fiction.

00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:58.550
That's what I write.

00:32:58.550 --> 00:32:59.550
You can learn from this.

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:01.020
It's, I've read the classics.

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:05.510
I read if I'm going to a foreign country to
tour, I'll read something from one of their

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:06.840
well-known authors.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.520
I'll read selected literary fiction.

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.980
Anything.

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:13.300
If it's good, I'll read it.

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:14.300
There you go.

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.990
And in the end, that's really what I want.

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:19.000
I want it to be good for what it's supposed
to be.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.260
If it's gonna be literary fiction, I want
it to be good literary fiction or I don't

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:24.260
like it.

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:28.100
If it's a horror novel, well, you better scare
me or I don't like it.

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:29.540
&gt;&gt;Anna: Thank you.

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:30.540
All right.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.640
I have one final question.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:33.970
It's from Mary Smith.

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:38.250
"My question is, how do you get inside the
heads of women so well?

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:42.220
You often write from a woman's perspective
and it is always so accurate."

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.370
&gt;&gt;Nicholas Sparks: Yes.

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:50.640
You see, the secret is I'm from Venus.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.890
[laughter]

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:53.890
I don't know.

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:54.890
I had a great mom.

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:56.600
I married well.

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.020
My agent is a female.

00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:02.040
My editor is a female.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:06.590
And in the end, I just try to create real
people.

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:14.231
And I think that if you're male or female,
when you're sad, it feels the same, but your

00:34:14.231 --> 00:34:19.650
reaction to that might be a little bit different
because I don't know.

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:20.650
I don't know.

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:22.570
I just do.

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:24.270
Maybe it's just 'cause I really like women.

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:25.620
I like women.

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:27.310
I try to understand them.

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:28.669
But we'll see.

00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:33.410
I just, you try and put in how they would
relate to what you do I guess.

00:34:33.410 --> 00:34:34.410
&gt;&gt;Anna: All right.

00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:36.620
Thank you so much for joining us today.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:37.620
It was a pleasure.

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:38.620
&gt;&gt;Nicholas Sparks: Thanks.

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.620
Thank you.

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:39.621
[applause]
