00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:06.660
 Such as the "Arush conflict" "West World" is a complex 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.660
 An epic mystery box of production that ends up discovering something much smaller 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.480
 And more important are: personal 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.400
 For this reason, despite the overwhelming prospect, that makes everything coherent is talks 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:27.420
 How they were written and how they were applied. Today, I want to look at a conversation featuring the great "Anthony Hopkins". 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.880
 Specifically, I want to see how Anthony Hopkins represents the scene and how each line of dialogue emerges in a fun way. 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.440
 Imagine that I had gotten mad, 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.850
 is not it ? 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.340
 Lost my way? 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.560
 We are simply concerned about how much changes you are making. 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.250
 We want to preserve your heritage. 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.210
 Heritage? 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:56.400
 Well, for your information on the scene is that "Teresa Cullen" is the director of the operations of the park "West World" trying to stop 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.480
 Or at least trying to disrupt the creation of "Anthony Hopkins" which is "Ford" for new stories for visitors, 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.300
 Those stories that are generally going to hurt the park financiers. 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.900
 It is clear that "Teresa" feels that the Ford project is a serious risk, 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.740
 But instead of saying frankly to him, she said her words with kindness. 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.100
 We want to preserve your heritage. 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.800
 Heritage? 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.340
 Well, that stand took seven seconds and it was fantastic. Following the response to the denial comment on her blunt kindness. 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.160
 "Hopkins" in silence, passed through several feelings. 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.180
 First, "deny" and then "discuss" the words in a fraction of a second. It is clear from the expression of his face. 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.250
 Perhaps he should have protected his heritage. He may not have to be ambitious at this age. 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.740
 Then "his smile and the scene highlights many different smiles and this smile" kindness " 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.000
 He shows up in his face when he considers himself an attacker or someone who is insulting his intelligence. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.400
 As he laughs, his chuckle laughs like a fury. 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:12.419
 He can only bear to look at her quick looks as though he is collecting his remains, and then he turns into a remarkable enemy. 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.389
 You do not like that place so much. is not it ? 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.509
 I've seen a lot of you come and come back over the years. 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:23.180
 I can say who is enjoying the time here and who do not enjoy it. 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.820
 What is amazing here is how the dialogue emerges as written. 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:34.680
 In television interviews, Hopkins described how to read the script 200 times or more until he reaches the point of stability of dialogue in his mind, 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.798
 Then they step away, let it grow in his mind, and when the scene arrives, relax 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.059
 "Let the role play through you" 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:45.179
 By controlling the ferries, 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.216
 "Hopkins" is able to adapt the rhythm of words to get its efficiency 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.100
 This phrase, for example, passed like this. 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.360
 "I've seen a lot of you come and come back over the years." As is the first part of the following sentence even stand after "from" 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.880
 The word "enjoy" that lies directly in an urgent performance slips over words, 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.870
 Even the last two phrases, which are accompanied by communication with the eyes, and slower to be filled as a charge. 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:17.320
 I've seen a lot of you come and come back over the years. I can say that those who enjoy the time here and those who do not enjoy it. 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.700
 I like it. 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.320
 By its own management. 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.090
 A small objection 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:31.950
 But you see how it opens like a rose that was curved, how to release a little tension to receive congratulations. Great touch. 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.630
 I came here once when I was a child with my parents. I think we also sat at this table. 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.220
 When I started working here, I realized that this place was not something to enjoy 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:50.520
 Then we get a second of the objection when the accusation is confirmed followed by a bend again, and a shrunk neck. 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.000
 Then, from this situation, Hopkins launched the key to talk 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.109
 At first I imagined that things would become 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.410
 Perfectly balanced. 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.360
 I also had a bet with my partner "Arnold" on this effect 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.160
 He made hundreds of successful scenarios. Of course, almost no one brings us up to them. She lost the bet. 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.179
 Arnold always took a dim view of people. He favored the hosts. 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.100
 He begged me not to make you money men involved with us. 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.080
 "Deloth" 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.300
 Well, "we are about to know that the interview is all a threat arranged by" Hopkins " 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.920
 And the sign that, gradually summoned the threat through three terms and clarified who is threatening them. 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.580
 "you are" 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.280
 Listen to it again. He begged me not to make you participate with us. 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.290
 Money men. 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.700
 "Deloth" 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.899
 I told him it was good that you did not understand what you were paying for. 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.959
 It is not a commercial enterprise, not a theme park, 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.380
 But a whole world. 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.740
 We designed every inch of it 

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:01.499
 All leaf grass. 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.850
 Here we were the gods 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.680
 And you. 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.820
 You were just visitors. 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:18.469
 Watching this for the first time surprised me. How vital is the character of "Ford" in the serial performance. 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.600
 I mean, "Westworld" in many ways is a ridiculous idea as a theme park and a chain. 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:33.140
 To work, vanity must be a clear and justified scheme in the complex desires and ambitions of the originators. 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.960
 The authors achieved this in the character of "Ford" 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.095
 But he is "Hopkins" who went beyond those things to life. 

00:05:38.095 --> 00:05:40.160
 And how this was done with Arnold 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.450
 Sadly, 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.450
 He lost his perspective. 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.790
 Go mad. 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.669
 I have not become mad, you all know, I always see things. 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.530
 Very clearly 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.940
 The threat is now very clear, Hopkins is painting the rest of the scene with a sinister tone 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.500
 This table I sat on with my parents. 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.340
 We know all about Zer, do not we? As we all know about our staff. 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:15.160
 From here to the outside stands his pros, without guo but with satisfaction accompanied by his smile 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.320
 There is no other need to convince Teresa of his compulsion 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:24.040
 Hopkins passes through different directions in a few seconds before returning to that smile. 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.631
 Just like here, about the truth 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.400
 We know everything about visitors, do not we? As we all know about our staff. 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.439
 Or here he is asking. 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.720
 I hope you are careful with "Bernard" 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.280
 Or here he cares sincerely and his eyes disdain for moments as well 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.940
 He has a conscious disposition. 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.389
 The serial producers are smart as they have set the camera on their face 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:58.409
 His ability, learned through the decades to connect a network of emotions and to show 

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.580
 A world of emotions through whose personality we know little 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:08.939
 And with the expansion of the scope and strength of the whole series and the power of persuading him as a piece of art 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.240
 This is what the great actor can do 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:19.320
 He can give words and fantasies or a short scene like this volcano of energy with a quiet look. 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:26.440
 In the eyes and hands of "Hopkins" that "West World" is not lost the reflection of the personality of their makers 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:32.437
 It's a self-image. You can say that the authors will finish writing in time 

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:37.620
 And it will not be as retroactive as you are afraid 

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.760
 I am not an emotional type. 

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.899
 Hi all, here is a video every Wednesday special "writer obsessed" 

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.290
 If you click here you will subscribe to the channel to get all the videos 

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.799
 Sorry I was a regular bug with the recent publication. I was in Italy. 

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.310
 It was a crazy trip. 

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:13.179
 But I also write after the speeches for the party that I will be in two weeks 

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:18.520
 So take me a lot of time and there is another channel I love her name "wisecrak" 

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:23.950
 They make gay but somewhat philosophical videos and made a video about "Bogak Horsman" 

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.970
 It's a series I love and the video was great and I will put the video down. Check it out 

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:32.109
 Thanks for watching. I'll see you all next Wednesday
