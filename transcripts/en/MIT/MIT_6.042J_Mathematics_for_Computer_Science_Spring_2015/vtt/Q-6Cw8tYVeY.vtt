00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.320
Now let's work out
an example that

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.130
shows how to use the
pairwise independent sampling

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.020
theorem to actually do some
sampling and estimation.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.160
So let's remember that
our basic theorem says

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.000
that if we have n independent
random variables--

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.490
pairwise independent, with
the same mean and variance--

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.320
and we look at their
average, the probability

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.210
that their average differs
from the mean by more than a

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.890
given tolerance delta is less
than or equal to this formula

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.270
here.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.110
Which is the standard deviation
over delta squared times 1

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.960
over n.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.520
Now we're just going to be
plugging into this formula,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.270
but I want to state
it here for the record

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.686
to remember that this is the
pairwise independent sampling

00:00:46.686 --> 00:00:47.890
theorem that we're given.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.320
Which is, what we've
seen in general,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.190
allows us to calculate
the degree of confidence

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.990
we can have, the probability
that we have given n

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.460
or the n that we need given
how confident we want to be.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.590
So let's go ahead
and do the example.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.240
And I want to think about what
is the possibility of swimming

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.460
in the Charles.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.280
Now, Charles has
a coliform count.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.850
Coliform are some rather
undesirable bacteria

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.140
that are associated
with fecal matter.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.010
And we want to know whether it's
safe to swim in the Charles.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.430
That's a Petri dish showing
a kind of sample of bacteria

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.060
that you might grow, cultured
to see what's going on.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.670
The Environmental
Protection Agency

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.570
requires that the average CMD,
the coliform microbial density,

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.920
on the dish is less than 200.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.020
And what we want
to do is figure out

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.420
whether, when we do a sample
of CMDs around the river,

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.140
and we get some numbers
out, whether, in fact, we

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.800
will conclude that the
average CMD is less than 200.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.880
We need to convince
the EPA of that.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.864
Now, we're never
going to be certain.

00:01:59.864 --> 00:02:01.280
But what we're
going to do is take

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.640
32 measurements at random times
and locations around the river.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.800
And we're going to collect
these 32 measurements of CMD.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.230
And it's going to turn out
that, although a few of them

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.290
are over 200, the average
is well under 200.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.860
The average of the 32 samples
that we've taken is 180.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.170
And our task now is to convince
the Environmental Protection

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.320
Agency that, on the
basis of our data,

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.741
that the average in the whole
river is really less than 200.

00:02:33.741 --> 00:02:35.240
Even though where
a couple of places

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.440
it was over 100, but
on average it was 180,

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.370
can we convince the EPA
that the actual average

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.500
is less than 200?

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.200
And so we're trying
to convince them

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.160
that our estimate
based on the sample

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.460
is within 20 of
the actual average.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.530
We got 180, so if our estimate
is within 20 of the truth,

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.316
then in fact, the
average is less than 200.

00:03:02.316 --> 00:03:03.690
Well how are we
going to do that?

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.106
Well, let's look
at the parameters

00:03:05.106 --> 00:03:08.200
in the same pairwise
independent sampling theorem

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.400
and see what we have.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.780
So c is the actual
average CMD in the river.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.210
That's what we don't know.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.290
We're trying to estimate it.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.260
So our samples correspond
to a random variable.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.440
We're taking a
measurement of the CMD

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.620
at random time and place.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.410
And that defines a random
variable whose expectation

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.360
is the unknown city.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.600
So we've defined, by
our sampling process,

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.700
a random variable with mean u.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.190
In fact, we've done
it with 32 variables.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.330
So n samples mean n mutually
independent random variables.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.900
All with mean
equal to the number

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.820
that I'm trying to estimate.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.910
And A n is the average
of the n CMD samples.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.640
So we have an A32 that
we're trying to understand.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.980
So here's the independent
sampling theorem formula.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.450
And let's see what
I know already.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.350
I'm going to plug in the knowns.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.560
What I know is that n is
32, mu is the unknown, c,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.180
that we're trying to estimate.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.160
And the delta that
matters to us is 20.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.419
Because we want to argue
that if our average of 180,

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.410
our measurement of 180,
was within 20 of the truth,

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.150
then in fact, we're under the
200 that the EPA specifies.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.225
So let's plug in our
known parameters, 32 for n

00:04:31.225 --> 00:04:33.700
and 20 for the tolerance.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.720
And they plug in here.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.550
And that leaves me with
the standard deviation,

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.800
which the formula requires
and I have to plug in.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.640
And that is a problem,
because we don't know

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.270
what the standard deviation is.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.520
Now, sometimes you
can kind of argue

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.650
that you can figure out what
the standard deviation is

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.060
because you have a theory of
what the random distribution is

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.080
of these measurements.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.110
And therefore, you can calculate
what its standard deviation

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.700
should be.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.450
Other times you
can actually take

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.720
a sample of the
deviation of your sample

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.440
and use that as an
estimate of the sample

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.470
of the actual
standard deviation.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.490
But that's kind of circular,
and we're not going to go there.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.200
But another way
to do it is to say

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.160
that if you had some bounds
on the maximum possible

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.950
discrepancy of
your measurements,

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.790
if you had done these kinds
of sampling testings of CMDs

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.020
for a long time and you
had never observed two that

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.860
were more than 50 apart,
then what you could argue

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.460
is that the range
of measurements

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.870
is going to be only 50.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.400
So what we can do
is if we say that L

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.210
is the maximum possible
difference that we'll ever

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.570
measure among samples, that
in fact, what you can say

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.910
is that the worst possible
standard deviation when

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.310
your random variable is ranging
over an interval l is l over 2.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.190
And you can check
that algebraically,

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.120
but for now let's just
take that as a fact.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.170
If you know that
your measurements are

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.960
going to differ by at most
l between max and min,

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.280
the standard deviation
can't be more than l over 2.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.820
And if we know that l is 50,
then I got a number finally

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:20.770
to plug in.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.530
Because now I can
plug in 25 for sigma.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.840
So let's do that.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.770
And when I do that, I come
out with this calculation that

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.070
says that the probability
that my average,

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:37.780
minus c, was greater than
20, that my A32, which

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.500
we said was 180, was more
than 20 away from the truth

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.810
is less than 0.05.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.670
Or, flipping it
around, the probability

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.250
that my average is
within 20 of the truth

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.700
is greater than 0.095.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.350
And so we would like
to be able to say, now,

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.090
that the probability
that the unknown c is

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.410
the 180 that we measured
for A32, plus or minus 20,

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:07.970
is at least 95%.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.170
That seems to be what
the theorem told us.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.850
Let's go back.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.580
The theorem says that
the probability that A32,

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.340
which we measured to be
180, minus c is less than

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.930
or equal to 20, is
greater than 0.95.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.250
So we should go back
and tell the EPA

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:27.510
that the probability is
that c is less than 200

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.030
with probability 0.95.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.070
And we'd be pretty
tempted to say that.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:33.450
But it's not right.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.150
It's technically the
wrong thing to say.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.550
And why is that?

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.810
Well, it's an
important idea, which

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.470
is that we're talking
about something

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.280
other than probability here.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.690
We're talking about
confidence, not probability.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.020
And let's explain that
a little bit more.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.440
Here's the issue.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.550
The number c is a number
in the real world.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.320
It's an actual physical
quantity which is

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.310
the average CMD in the river.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.590
We don't know what it is.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:04.230
But that does not make
it a random variable.

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:08.080
It is or it isn't within less
than 200 or more than 200

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.380
and so on.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:14.430
What's going on is that we have
created a probabilistic model

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:21.810
of sampling that is designed to
have in our probabilistic model

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:23.340
this unknown constant.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.560
There's nothing probabilistic
about the constant.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.700
We've introduced the
probability by thinking

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.260
of our random sampling
as random variables.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.740
We control the randomness.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.650
We can't say that c is random.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.090
Our measurements are random.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:42.620
So the right thing we can say
is that the possible outcomes

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.820
of our sampling process
can persuasively be

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.980
modeled as a random variable.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.730
So what we can say is
that the probability

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.130
that our sampling
process will yield

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.810
an average that's within
20 of the true average

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:58.420
is at least 0.95.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.410
So that's a funny thing to say.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.700
What you do is you go tell
the EPA that says, look.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.740
We don't know what
the real average is.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:11.090
But we have a process that
gets the right answer 95%

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.770
of the time to within
plus or minus 20.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.000
And we measured it.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.100
And our process that we
right 95% of the time

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:24.720
came in with an answer that
said it's less than 200.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.320
OK?

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.590
Now that's the
right thing to say.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:28.640
That's the truth.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.620
We're making a
probabilistic statement

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:35.520
about the general properties
of our sampling process,

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.350
and saying, OK.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.570
Our sampling process
is usually right.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.870
The sampling process
said less than 200.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.602
So we think that's
probably right.

00:09:43.602 --> 00:09:45.560
But we can't say it is
right, and we can't even

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.220
say it's right with
any probability.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.420
It's just the way that our
mostly reliable process

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.500
yielded an answer.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.730
And that's an important
idea to distinguish.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:05.200
So it's our estimate that that's
correct with probability 0.95.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.590
Now this is a long
thing to say to the EPA.

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:10.950
And what we'd like to
go back is language

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:15.410
that says that we think
that the real average, c, is

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:20.650
within 20 of 180 is
probably within 20 of 180.

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:22.736
Because that's what
our tests seem to say.

00:10:22.736 --> 00:10:24.860
But we're not allowed to
talk about the probability

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.660
that c has some value or other.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.430
So instead we
summarize the story

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:32.540
about how we measured c using
a probabilistic process that's

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.220
right 95% of the
time by saying that c

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:42.710
is 180 plus or minus 20 at
the 95% confidence level.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.900
And that is that's
a shorthand way

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.900
of saying we've got this
process that we believe

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.220
in that measured
this unknown quantity

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.255
and told us what it was.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.540
So the moral here that we'll
wrap up this little video with

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.450
is that when you're told
that some fact holds

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.060
at a high confidence
level because

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:07.460
of some tester, or some random
experiment, or some pollster,

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.630
you have to remember
that what that implies

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:14.760
is that somebody designed
a random experiment to try

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.550
to get an estimate of reality.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:21.540
And you can always question
whether you believe

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.006
in that random experiment.

00:11:23.006 --> 00:11:24.630
It's important to
understand that there

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:26.740
is some random
experiment back there.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.220
And you should be
wondering about what is it?

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.460
And do I believe in it?

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.060
And even more important
question to ask

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:38.460
is why are you hearing about
this particular experiment?

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.880
How many other experiments
were tried and not reported?

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.960
The point is that
people can perform

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:50.060
various kinds of tests at the
95% or higher confidence level.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.500
But when the tests don't come
up with an interesting result,

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.100
they don't bother to publish
them or announce them.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.120
And of course, when they come up
with a surprising result which

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.940
is going to be wrong
one out of 20 times,

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.750
those are the results
that they publish

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:05.680
and submit and advertise.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.720
Because they sound good.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.530
In fact, the major drug
company Glaxo SmithKline,

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:15.600
after paying $3 billion
as a judgment against them

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.200
in 2012 for suppressing
the negative results

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.380
of clinical trials,
just agreed to now

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:25.050
make public in February 2013
all of the clinical trials

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:25.970
that they perform.

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:27.700
So that you're not
just learning about

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.460
the cherry picked
positive results,

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.040
but about the
negative ones as well.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:43.530
And in fact, [AUDIO OUT[
to get this point home,

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:47.330
you might want to look
at the cartoon at XKCD,

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:50.060
which explains how it is that
when there's a problem with

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:55.350
green jelly beans at the
95% confidence level.
