00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress
in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:14.430
[ Pause ]

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.230
&gt;&gt; Let me introduce tonight's
presenter, presenters,

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.000 position:67%
and then I'll mute myself so they can talk.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.510 position:67%
So we have Christy Feinfield, a reference
librarian in the Library of Congress Prints

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.930 position:75%
and Photographs Division, specializing in visual
materials relating to the concept of place.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.410 position:63%
Christy has a bachelor's of architecture
from Virginia Tech, and an [inaudible]

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.930 position:63%
from the Catholic University of America.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.740 position:72%
She writes for the Library's Picture This blog

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.190
and also helps moderate the
Library's Flickr account.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.020 position:59%
Her recent video series with historian
Sam Waters, "Every Photo is a Story",

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.410
discusses strategies for
researching photographs.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.480
Joining Christy is Tom Bober.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.120
Tom serves as the Library of
Congress 2015 and '16 teacher

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.050 position:63%
in residence for audio/visual materials.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:12.750 position:72%
A librarian at R. M. Campton Elementary School
in Clayton, Missouri, Tom has used a variety

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.530 position:72%
of primary sources on historical and
scientific topics from the Library of Congress

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.080 position:58%
to help students construct knowledge.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.780
Tom and Christy, take it away.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.390
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Cheryl.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.870 position:63%
As you've just heard, my name is Christy
Feinfield, and I'm a reference librarian

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.620 position:61%
in the Prints and Photographs Division,
or P and P, at the Library of Congress.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.970
Being a reference librarian in
P and P means my job focuses

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.370 position:73%
on connecting researchers and visual materials.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.830 position:66%
I do that work in person in the Prints and
Photographs Reading Room, over the phone,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.900 position:73%
and through our Ask A Librarian e-mail service.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.260 position:66%
And today Tom and I will be connecting you
with visual materials with a focus on how

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.700
to explore photos and the
stories around them as well

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.950
as make them a part of your
classroom experience.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.900 position:58%
The Prints and Photographs Division
holds the national picture collection

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.860
of the United States.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.200
While international in scope, the
collections are particularly rich

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.480 position:69%
in materials either produced in the US or
documenting the history of lives, interests,

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.450 position:63%
and achievements of the American people.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.170 position:59%
The 15.6 million collection, images
in the collection include photographs,

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.750
by far the most common format, fine
and popular prints and drawings,

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.080
posters and architectural
and engineering drawings.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.700 position:63%
Every year on average, the
collections grow by about 300,000 items,

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.210
and we digitize about 50,000 images
to add to our online catalog.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.810 position:73%
More than 1.2 million images are available
online through the Library of Congress website,

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.890
and we'll start by talking about
how you can find those images.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.090 position:70%
Be aware that guidance and help with our
questions is available on site at the Library

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.620 position:64%
of Congress in the Prints and
Photographs Reading Room and from offsite

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.800 position:56%
through the Ask a Librarian service.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.390 position:59%
On the Library of Congress website,
there are many places to find visuals.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.880 position:67%
We will include a few slides at the end of
our presentation today to help you find all

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.800
of the online sources for images
through the Library of Congress.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.410 position:73%
While the bulk of the images at the Library are
found in the Prints and Photographs Division,

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.310 position:58%
with the Library of Congress search
system, you can find visual materials

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.810
from throughout the Library's
divisions on our website.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.330 position:73%
There are search tips specific to each catalog
and search system available through the Library

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.900
of Congress, but today I'm going
to offer a few quick tips on how

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.500
to achieve better results
when looking for images.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.660 position:63%
The first primary tip is think visually.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.400
Use words to describe what
you hope to see in an image.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.400 position:56%
For example, instead of trying World
War II home front as your search,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.790
try victory garden, women
factory, scrap aluminum.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.820
Use fewer words.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.120 position:69%
Many records in our catalogs are
transcriptions of a caption or caption card.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.250 position:69%
So, for instance, an individual's first name
may not be included or fully spelled out.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.880
Be sure to check the spelling
and spacing of your search words.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.770
Are there alternate spellings?

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.530 position:61%
Could two words have been combined into
one or vice versa in image caption?

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.390 position:64%
For example, street car versus streetcar.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.050
Have you used abbreviations
that can be spelled out?

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.580
This is especially important
when searching for addresses.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.990 position:64%
Avenue versus at A-V-E or street for S-T.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.950 position:67%
Read descriptions of individual collections
to zero in on those relevant collections,

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.120 position:61%
and browse the items within collections
to see how images are described

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.600 position:58%
and for ideas of search terms to try.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.310
While all types of visuals
can be useful in teaching,

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.500
today I'm going to talk primarily
about photographs.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.520 position:58%
Recently, I worked with architectural
and landscape historian Sam Waters

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.510
to create a five-part video series
entitled "Every Photo is a Story".

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.580 position:69%
In this series, one of our goals was to both
share the stories captured in photos as well

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.560
as offer tips and tools for viewers
to use when studying photographs

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.520 position:63%
and learning directly from those images.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.490 position:67%
The collection featured in the video series
contains 1,100 largely hand colored lantern

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.780 position:61%
slides of gardens created by
photographer Francis Benjamin Johnston.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.200
The photos were created between
the 1910's and the 1930's.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.010 position:75%
To accompany the videos, I also created try it
yourself exercises which allow you to apply some

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.310 position:56%
of the tips suggested in the videos
to other photographs and collections

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.410 position:61%
in the Prints and Photographs Division.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.490 position:63%
I hope you'll explore the videos and the
exercises for more hands-on practice.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.530 position:73%
Today I will walk us through the five sections
of the video and how they can offer a structure

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:57.070 position:56%
to guide you in getting more from a
photo than just a good illustration.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.330 position:58%
Part One, start to read a photograph,
suggests questions to the viewer

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.940 position:59%
and potential researcher, starting
from perhaps the most patently obvious

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.030
and then digging a little deeper.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.480 position:56%
The top tip suggests looking closely
at the image, front and back.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.200
We suggests you ask questions and
make no assumptions about an image

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.660 position:59%
or its description, title, or caption.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:25.200 position:72%
Describe what you see, look for related photos
to put the image in context, and, finally,

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.090 position:72%
ask how the photographer is shaping the scene.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.700 position:73%
In this part, we introduced viewers to the idea

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.090 position:56%
that photographs are not necessarily
a mechanical recording of fact

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.510 position:63%
and should be studied with that in mind.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:43.060 position:63%
In the time provided, we'll only be able
to touch on a few of the tips suggested

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.360
in each part, but I hope to give
a hint at what can be learned

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.370 position:64%
about a photograph with some exploration.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:54.880 position:72%
Let's start with a brief exercise based on the
tips for Part One, start to read a photograph.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.250 position:69%
Feel free to click on the link below the
image to view a larger version of the photo.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.280 position:66%
I've selected a photograph from the Prints
and Photographs Division's collection.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.280 position:66%
This photo is also featured in one of the
Try it Yourself exercises available on the

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.890
"Every Photo is a Story" website.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.900
Take a moment to look closely
at this photograph.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.570
Do you see details that might offer
clues to what is going on here?

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.350
What stands out to you as unusual?

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.520 position:75%
What observations can you make about the people?

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.510
I'll let you look for a moment
before we continue.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:55.250
[ Pause ]

00:07:55.250 --> 00:08:00.620 position:63%
OK. I'm going to now give some examples
of what can be gathered by close looking

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.870
at the high resolution file
of these, of this image.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:09.160
I always look for anything
with text on it in an image.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.060 position:72%
A street sign, an address, name of a business,

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:18.470 position:64%
etc. Finding text within a photograph is
a great way to find out concrete details.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.640
Let's look together at some of
the details I was able to observe

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.040
by zooming in on the digital image.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.360
Here we have the text of an oath
of allegiance to the United States.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.770 position:56%
It is also a renouncement of loyalty
to a previous foreign country.

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:40.200 position:73%
Looking closely at the people in the
classroom, at least two observations stand out.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.670 position:67%
All of the people here have the appearance
of being students by virtue of being seated

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:50.700 position:72%
at desks with books in front of them, but many
look older than the average college student.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.720 position:66%
Also, the people seated would appear to be

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.210
of different ethnicities based
on facial characteristics.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:00.520 position:59%
Combined with the oath, this starts to
suggest a reason they are in the room.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:05.130
Let's keep looking.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.850 position:73%
More text can be found on the other chalkboard.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:12.820 position:64%
This one has the English alphabet as
well as an assignment to write sentences.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.120
Taken on its own, this would
seem more appropriate

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.250 position:63%
to students in a grade school classroom.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.430
So is this, in fact, a classroom?

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.720 position:59%
The two women standing in the
classroom, including this one in front

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.820 position:58%
of the assignment, could be teachers.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:29.870
They don't appear to have
recently vacated a student desk.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:34.870 position:70%
A really close look at the book in one of the
men's hands reveals an image of the Statue

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:41.290 position:67%
of Liberty, a very strong symbol of America
and one often associated with immigrants.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:44.450
At this point, I try to speculate
what the photo is showing.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.150
Who are these people?

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.910
Why are they in a classroom?

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.390
Asking questions is the best
way to elicit answers.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:56.130 position:72%
It's also a good way to check your assumptions
and see if you have evidence to back them.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.540
I can assume this a classroom at
first glance, but it's important

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:03.100 position:75%
to then find reasons to support that assumption.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.860 position:75%
With your observations and speculations in hand,

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:10.160
let's turn to the accompanying
information in the online catalog.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:17.980 position:75%
The catalog records, which accompany images from
the Prints and Photographs Division vary widely

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.550
in the amount of detail and
type of information provided.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:25.270 position:59%
This is often a function of what level
of cataloging was completed as well

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.280 position:69%
as what the source for the descriptions was.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.400 position:56%
A caption card file, the information
found on the object itself,

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.860 position:75%
a title divides by a visual materials cataloger.

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:39.620 position:59%
Different items in collections come
with different amounts of information.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.010 position:66%
So you have to work with what is provided.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:50.060 position:59%
In this case, we are provided a very
simple title of Americanization class.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:55.410 position:72%
If you go to the notes area of the catalog
description, you will see that the title comes

00:10:55.410 --> 00:11:00.100
from quote unverified data provided
by the National Photo Company

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.300
on the negative or negative sleeve.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.510
This tells you a few things.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:09.380 position:63%
The information, including the title,
have not been checked by a staff person,

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.650 position:59%
and that the words used came directly
from the time the photograph was taken

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.320
and from the source of the photo.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.620 position:70%
What does the word Americanization mean here?

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:23.180 position:64%
This is when it's helpful to compare your
observations and conclusions gathered

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:27.940 position:63%
by looking closely with what is
provided in written form with the photo.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.760
How well did they match up?

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.590
What were the differences?

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:35.070 position:61%
When you know the data is
unverified, it can pay to be skeptical,

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:38.000
and see if you can find visual
evidence to support

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.080 position:64%
or dispute the provided title or caption.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:48.760 position:61%
Another tip we offer in Part One of the
webcast is to search for related photos

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:53.140
in the same collection as well as
outside that specific collection.

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:57.810 position:59%
I can start the search by typing the
title I was given into a search blank.

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:02.290 position:64%
A search for Americanization class in the
same collection offers a close variant

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.340
to the photo we started with.

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:10.040 position:70%
Studying this image offers additional
insight and likely stimulates more questions.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.150 position:61%
Explore other photos in the collection.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.780
What kind of photos are they?

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.380
What kinds of topics do they cover?

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.890 position:75%
Searching elsewhere in the collection could also
offer different perspectives on the photograph,

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.070
and place it within a new context.

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:28.200
I'm going to turn it over
to Tom for a few slides now.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.770 position:56%
&gt;&gt; As you're preparing to use images
with students, you'll want to think

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:35.730 position:73%
about how students will access the image files.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:39.680 position:67%
They may be looking at the image on a
projector screen or interactive whiteboard.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.220
They may be looking at the image on
their own device or on a desktop,

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.580
laptop, or tablet in a small group.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.450 position:73%
They may be looking at a printout of the image.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.560 position:59%
A lot of this will have to do with
the technology that's available to you

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.910
and your students, and some of
this may be based on the level

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.860 position:64%
and detail you want your students to see.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:02.110 position:66%
Printing the image will not allow, usually
allow you to see some of the details

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:06.040 position:66%
that Christy just pointed out in the photo
we were looking at, and in that case,

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.490 position:61%
you'll want to view the file digitally,

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:11.290 position:61%
and you'll want to download the
highest resolution tif file if you can.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:16.210 position:75%
Just like any large file, if you have the
opportunity, download these files ahead of time.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:19.250
It can save you from any Internet
hiccups or long download times

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:20.900 position:61%
that you can experience in your school.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.390 position:66%
If the image doesn't contain fine details,

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:28.560
the largest jpeg file could be
acceptable for viewing on a screen.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.780 position:75%
When printing, I usually do a test print to make
sure that I'm able to see the level of detail

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:38.340
and sharpness that will allow my
students to analyze the image.

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:42.400
Speaking of analyzing, the Library
of Congress has a teachers' page

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:48.550 position:64%
at loc dot gov slash teachers that has a
primary source analysis tool for students

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:51.980
and teacher question prompts
to help with image analysis.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.460
Here, I'm on the Library
of Congress teachers' page.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:59.440 position:75%
On the left, I clicked on using primary sources,

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.660
then I clicked on teachers'
guide and analysis tool.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.290 position:56%
The primary source analysis tool can
be filled out and printed online,

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.460
or there's a link to a pdf version.

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:13.160
I'll show that you in a, an
example of that in just a moment.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.580
The teachers' guide is a pdf.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:19.240
Here's the teachers' guide.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:24.910 position:64%
You'll notice that it's organized in four
categories - observe, reflect, question,

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:28.460 position:64%
and at the bottom, further investigation.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:32.560 position:64%
These are the steps that we want students
to go through when analyzing an image.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.950 position:58%
Observations are going to be specific
things that can be seen in the photo.

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:41.960 position:61%
So you may ask what did you notice
first, or what is the physical setting?

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.780 position:61%
Making observations are what we've done
in the first step of Christy's analysis

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.770 position:64%
of this photo, of the photo from earlier.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:52.410
Reflections ask students to infer
based on their observations as well

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.260 position:63%
as their own understanding of the world.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.690 position:70%
So I might ask what's happening in the image.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:02.470 position:69%
They will bring in their observations of the
photo and what they know about classrooms

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:07.440 position:58%
to make it reflections in their
analysis, and questions are just that

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.430 position:63%
but can sometimes be difficult, a
difficult part of analysis for students.

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:13.730 position:67%
What does this photo make you wonder about?

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:15.600
What is still a mystery to you?

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.770 position:56%
What do you want to know more about?

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:23.100 position:63%
Those questions that students ask can
help guide next steps in their thinking.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.510 position:56%
At the bottom are suggestions for
how students can show their learning

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.980
from their photo analysis.

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:35.590 position:56%
This is mockup of the primary source
analysis tool that students may use.

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:39.110
You'll notice it has the same
categories as the teachers' guide.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:42.860 position:64%
I want to point out a few things that I
encourage when my students are analyzing.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:46.540
First, I don't ask them to
write in complete sentences.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:47.940
Some do naturally.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.510 position:56%
Others like to list things,
especially when making observations.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:55.990
Second, you might notice the arrows
drawn between the categories.

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:59.970 position:59%
I sometimes ask my students to do this
to help them explain their thinking.

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:04.290
Students' reflections and questions
should naturally connect to one

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.160 position:58%
or more things they saw in the image.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:11.550 position:73%
So, for example, if a student in the reflection
writes that they think this is a classroom,

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:16.180 position:58%
but in their observations has nothing
written that relates to a classroom,

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.540 position:75%
they haven't really made their thinking visible.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.990
That, of course, doesn't mean that
they aren't thinking about it,

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:26.170 position:70%
but making those thoughts visible through the
primary source analysis tool can help them

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:32.030 position:75%
when they're sharing their ideas or taking that
analysis into a larger aspect of their learning.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.970 position:75%
Also, and you can't see it through this example,

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:41.520 position:59%
but a student analyzing an image using
this tool is not a linear process.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.970
They don't fill out all of
their observations and then all

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.650
of their reflections and
then all of their questions.

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:48.630
I'm expecting them to jump around.

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:51.000 position:72%
Many of them start with an observation or two.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.170 position:73%
It's a natural starting point, but then they'll
move between the three columns from there.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:17:01.450 position:73%
And, finally, my recommendation, if you have
students who have never read an image before is

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:04.790
to model this with them as a whole
group, much like Christy did,

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:07.490 position:59%
started to do with the previous image.

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:11.840 position:58%
No matter how old they are, have them
do another in pairs or small groups.

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:17.140 position:72%
You'll be surprised how that collaboration can
help students see things or think about things

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.520
that they would not on their own.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.110
With that base knowledge of the
tools, students and teachers have

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:29.720 position:63%
at their disposal let's dive deeper into
the analysis of our image with Christy.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.880
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Tom.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:36.700 position:69%
Those were all great points, and those tools
must come in extremely handy in a classroom.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.260
Let's move on to Part Two.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:43.820 position:66%
In Part Two, get to know the photographer,
we look to the person behind the camera

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:50.030 position:73%
and ask viewers to apply basic research skills,
much as one might with any research topic.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:55.300 position:67%
The researcher should consult secondary
reference sources, both printed and online,

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:59.490
track down primary sources such
as magazine and newspaper articles

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:04.740 position:73%
from the photographer's lifetime, and if you're
lucky, locate the papers and the photographer.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:10.750 position:75%
Use these sources to establish a chronology of
key dates and places in the photographer's life.

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:17.240 position:59%
As with title and caption
information, the information available

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:21.880 position:58%
about the photographer can vary
widely, and understanding that is key

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.980 position:58%
to working with archival collections.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:27.700
In some cases, we not only know the
photographer but know a great deal

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:31.890
about the photographer's
life, influences, and career.

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:35.830 position:66%
In other cases, we know the
photographer's name but little about them.

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:40.190 position:64%
And as in this case, we sometimes do not
know the name of the photographer at all.

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:44.810
As you can see, there's no creator
listed in our catalog record.

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:49.250 position:73%
When we do not know the photographer, and even
when we do, it's good to turn to the collection

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:52.190 position:64%
which the photo is part of to learn more.

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:55.200
That information is provided
in the record itself as well

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.670 position:61%
as at the top right in the part of box.

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:02.290
Clicking the link there takes you
to the home page of the collection.

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:09.880 position:75%
On this home page for the collection, there will
away be an about this collection entry as well

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:14.440
as sometimes articles and
essays about the collection.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:19.580 position:64%
In many cases, these include biographical
information, the scope of the collection,

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:25.550 position:72%
explanations of how the collection was
acquired, cataloged, digitized, and organized.

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:30.390 position:64%
Learning this information places the
single photograph into a telling context.

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:36.090 position:59%
In Part Three, consider how the photos
were made, we shift our attention

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:38.630 position:56%
from the photographer to the object.

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:43.180 position:56%
In the case of the video series, the
photo and the colored lantern slide.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.610
Consider the original photograph.

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:46.720
What size is it?

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.740
What format?

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.170
What camera was used to create it?

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:53.660
How does this influence your
understanding of the image?

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:57.610
Take into consider what happens
after the shutter snaps.

00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:00.820
What changes or manipulations
may have been made?

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:04.090
Consider the photographer's time
involved in making the image.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:10.010 position:72%
Consider the client, the purpose of the
photo, the audience for which it was intended.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:13.150
Today we're going to focus on
how thinking about the audience

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:17.930
for a photograph affects how
we view and understand it.

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:22.160 position:59%
Let's return to the information about
the National Photo Company collection.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:26.800 position:59%
This photo of an Americanization class
was taken by a photographer working

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:31.240 position:61%
for the National Photo Company, but who
was the target audience for the photo?

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.350
Why was this photo taken?

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:38.190 position:67%
There are a few places this information can
be gleaned for the collection as a whole.

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:43.780 position:70%
One is the about this collection and the
supporting documents I mentioned in Part Two.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.420 position:70%
The other is what is known as a guide record.

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:50.040 position:61%
These can be found in the Library of
Congress online catalog for collections

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.810 position:64%
from the Prints and Photographs Division.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:56.180
They are compact summaries
of creator, date, subject,

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:59.570
and historical information
for an entire collection.

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:03.920 position:59%
You can see part of what such a record
looks like at the right of the slide.

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:10.580 position:75%
By reading over the about this collection and
the guide record for the National Photo Company,

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:14.680
I find information about different
audiences for the photographs.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:20.960 position:73%
According to these two documents, photographers
for the NPCC undertook photographic assignments

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:26.740 position:75%
for local businesses and government agencies,
and they also took photos to sell to newspapers,

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:30.870 position:69%
news distributors, and other photo agencies.

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:35.920 position:64%
We don't know at this time why this
photograph was taken or for what purpose.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:40.350 position:58%
How do you think the audience for the
photo would affect how it was framed?

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:43.090
What would be included or left out?

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:48.780 position:59%
The photographer has control over when
and how he or she takes the photo.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:53.910 position:72%
For example, a photographer working for a
news agency might be thinking about the market

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:56.650 position:70%
for this photo while the photographer working

00:21:56.650 --> 00:22:00.110
for a government agency sponsoring
this class might want

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:03.340 position:70%
to show the class in the best possible light.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:07.340
Can you guess the audience just
by looking at the photograph?

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:10.510 position:63%
What evidence supports your speculation?

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:15.890
[ Background Sounds ]

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:21.180 position:70%
Part Four takes a broader view by
suggesting we explore the photographer's era.

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:26.450
Like any art form, photographs
are not created in a vacuum.

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:29.290
We discuss the time period
during which the work was made.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:33.110 position:59%
In the case of the videos, Johnston's
work was taking place during the heart

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:36.120
of the progressive era and
the city beautiful movement,

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:40.390
and that certainly influenced her
choices and the work she received.

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:46.490 position:73%
Aesthetic preferences, art movements, landscape
design, composition, all of these had an impact

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:51.490
on the work Johnston did as
well as how it was received.

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:56.950 position:73%
One way to learn about the photographer's era
is to turn to published sources like newspapers

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:59.320
and magazines of the time period.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:03.660 position:61%
"Chronically in America" on the Library
of Congress website offers free access

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.810
to digitized newspapers dating
from 1836 to 1922.

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:12.680 position:61%
To try and answer my own question about
audience for the photograph as well

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:18.090 position:70%
as what the term Americanization meant at the
time of the photo, I tried a simple search

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:21.230
for the phrase Americanization
class and was lucky enough

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:24.410 position:75%
to get the page on the right as my first result.

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:28.230 position:56%
At lower right, I find the exact
photograph we've been talking about.

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:30.130
Let's look a little closer.

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:37.480 position:66%
As you can see at lower right, this search
gave me several new pieces of information.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:41.450
A more complete caption,
where the photo was taken,

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:44.320 position:66%
what nationalities the students represent,

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:49.050 position:56%
confirmation that the women standing
are the teachers, and their names.

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:54.020 position:75%
We also now have more information about the
date as this photo was featured in the August 8,

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.860
1920, edition of the "Sunday Star".

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:02.440 position:73%
I also know that at least one audience for this
photograph was this newspaper in Washington,

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:08.780 position:73%
D.C. By reading the rest of the page to see
what other photos were featured in this section

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:12.860 position:66%
as well as pursuing the other results from
my search in "Chronically in America",

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:18.660 position:75%
I can also start to glean more information about
this photo and the time period it belongs to.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:23.380
I can find more hints about the
term Americanization as well.

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.880
The fifth and final part is where
we pull the threads together

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.880 position:61%
to interpret the stories we discovered.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:35.750 position:56%
In the top tips for this section, we
reinforce the themes of each part.

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:41.180 position:69%
We encouraged viewers to look closely at the
photographs to study who took the picture,

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:47.760 position:72%
to search for related written information, and
to ask lots of questions and to ask for help.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:52.110 position:58%
As always, we encourage you to seek
out reference librarians like myself,

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:55.270 position:66%
archivists, historians, and other experts.

00:24:55.270 --> 00:25:02.440
So keeping all that in mind, what
is the story of this photograph?

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.790
We know a bit more about the
circumstances of the photo now.

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:10.570
We have the who, what, when,
where, and how of the image.

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:15.070 position:70%
This is a good point to think about the photo
itself, and then to step outside the photo

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:20.860 position:56%
and ask how this photo fits into
the bigger story of America in 1920.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:24.470
And I'm going to turn things over
to Tom, and he'll tell you how

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:27.350 position:67%
to bring these strategies to the classroom.

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:28.250
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Christy.

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:32.680
The final step that Christy asked
us to do here, and if I can,

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.530 position:63%
I'm going to go back to these questions.

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:40.070 position:66%
They are really the further investigations
that we would ask students to do.

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:42.040 position:56%
What's the story of this photograph?

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:47.410
How does this story fit into the
story of America in the 1920's?

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:50.440
How does a student then share
what he or she knows?

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:56.240 position:69%
How do they fit it into the larger context
of a time period or an event or a biography?

00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:01.740 position:63%
This is truly where analysis and images
fits into student thinking and learning.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:07.750 position:61%
A final few things to think about when
including images into student learning.

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:10.770 position:70%
How do you want students to access the image?

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:13.970 position:72%
Are they given to the students by the teacher?

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:18.790 position:70%
Are the students going to be searching for
images on their own, and what kind of time is

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:22.810 position:67%
that going to take and skill on their part?

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:25.040 position:56%
Regarding bibliographic information.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:28.210 position:69%
Do you want students to have it all at once?

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:29.390
When should they have it?

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:34.730 position:63%
Sometimes like in our example today, you
want them just thinking about the photo

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:40.540 position:70%
and asking questions before they have any of
the bibliographic information that gives some

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:44.810
of those answers, but may lead
to other questions and searches

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.770
like we saw with our image today.

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:50.190 position:61%
Don't forget about the creator's voice.

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:54.560 position:58%
It's very easy to focus so much on
what the camera caught that we forget

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:59.910 position:73%
that the person behind it was taking that photo
for a reason, and that reason reveals some

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:03.860 position:72%
of the story that he or she is trying to tell.

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:09.380 position:70%
Be thinking before your students even ask for
it about other sources that can be brought

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:13.800 position:59%
in to complement the image, both
primary sources and secondary sources,

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.250 position:63%
and this happens for one of two reasons.

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:20.860 position:61%
Either the other resource is
informing the students about the photo,

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:24.430
or the photo is informing the
students about the other resource.

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:30.870 position:69%
So thinking about how all of those resources
fit together and playing with those ideas

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:36.570 position:56%
as a teacher can really lead to deep
layered learning on students' parts.

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:41.380 position:61%
And, finally, from personal experience,
this may look messy the first time.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:45.980
Students may not get to where you
want them to be in their thinking.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:50.880 position:69%
While extremely beneficial, it's not always
intuitive for students to learn in this way,

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.350
and it wasn't intuitive for
me to teach in this way.

00:27:53.350 --> 00:28:00.800 position:59%
I had to try it, reflect on the steps,
what I said, the results, make changes

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.970
and try it again, and I know
that sounds like a lot of work,

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:08.350
and if the amazing student thinking
didn't happen the more I did this,

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:10.800 position:69%
I wouldn't be talking to you about it today.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:19.180 position:58%
I want to share a few additional
resources with our last three slides,

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:24.540 position:73%
and I'm not going to go deeply into all of
these, but just point a few things out quickly.

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:30.090 position:72%
These are all additional related resources for
you to explore, and Christy and my idea was

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:34.560 position:61%
to give you things that you could go
back to later and look at more closely.

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:39.890 position:69%
They're all linked, and they'll be available
in the archive of this presentation.

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:45.270 position:66%
I'll mention on this page in particular
the Ask a Prints and Photograph librarian.

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:47.320
It is an incredible resource.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:52.090 position:64%
When you feel like you are getting stuck,
and you don't know where else to go,

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:55.390
this is a great place where you
can go and ask your question

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:58.530
of an actual individual, and
they'll get back with you.

00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:03.140
It's wonderful, and I've used it,
and had great results from it.

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:11.500 position:59%
Here are several links that start to
make the million plus images available

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.390
through the Library of Congress
much more manageable.

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:19.850 position:73%
I won't point everything out to you, but I will
point out the interesting things, I'm sorry,

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:23.600 position:69%
it won't point everything out to you, but
it will point to interesting things that you

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.520
or a colleague may be able
to use in your classroom.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.870 position:61%
I'm a big fan of the Picture This blog.

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:29.750
I subscribe to it.

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:34.870 position:67%
So I just receive e-mails anytime there are
new posts, and even if it isn't an image

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:39.860 position:70%
that I may be interested in right away, often
I tuck it back, and I found myself going back

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:45.490 position:63%
to that blog time and time again to pull
something for myself or a colleague.

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:51.840
And these are teacher resources
from the Library of Congress.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:56.980 position:72%
The teacher page that I mentioned earlier is
here as well as the blog which not only points

00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:01.460 position:58%
to resources but to teaching
strategies for using those resources.

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:02.600
I think it's amazing.

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:12.320 position:66%
And at this point, I'm going to hand it
over to Cheryl for some final information.

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.010
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Tom.

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:18.530 position:61%
Thanks, Christy, and thanks to all the
participants for the lively discussion,

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:22.150
and we have quite a few questions
waiting for you.

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:26.350
So the first question I think
is probably for Tom, although,

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:28.150
Christy, you might have ideas, too.

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:29.950
Let's let Tom start.

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:38.620 position:66%
The question is can some tips for using
photograph analysis with younger students.

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:41.900
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:48.570 position:69%
So I am in an elementary school before I was
here with the Library for this school year,

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:52.430
and we did quite a bit of
analysis as early as kindergarten.

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:55.040
So five years, six years old.

00:30:55.040 --> 00:31:01.200 position:66%
And I would say the first thing is that if
you can, actually having that print copy

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.410
of the image is really beneficial.

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:05.040
They are tactile.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.010
They want to touch it.

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:10.420 position:59%
They want to point to it, and they
want to kind of get their hands on it.

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:16.990 position:70%
If they can have a pencil or a crayon and
circle, mark on the image, that is wonderful.

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:20.430 position:64%
Now if you work with the little ones, you
know they're going to be talking anyway.

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:23.400
So you might as well make it
as collaborative as possible.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.670
Give them a couple of minutes
to talk to a partner.

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:28.520
Then bring it back and talk
with the whole group.

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:33.950 position:75%
You're going to really start to tease out ideas
and get this wonderful collective thinking going

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:39.050
on when you have all of that, all
of those ideas thrown out together.

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:47.820 position:70%
And have an idea of what you think, where you
think, excuse me, students are going to go,

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:51.020 position:58%
but also be open for different ideas.

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:56.770 position:63%
I know that when we work with older
students or when we do this with adults,

00:31:56.770 --> 00:32:00.480 position:66%
we have a really strong idea of where
they're going to go because we are adults.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:06.150 position:72%
So we're closer in age, but I've always find
myself surprised what students find important,

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:10.600 position:64%
and on that note, sometimes I also really
target those observations with questions

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:14.710 position:67%
like what do you think is important in this
image, or what do you think is interesting

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:18.680 position:63%
in this image, and I might need to ask
them follow-up questions to really start

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:22.980 position:66%
to understand their thinking because they
may not be able to initially verbalize it.

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:29.660 position:56%
So those are a few ideas for working
with images with younger students.

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:34.140 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tom, a follow-up question to that
is what has surprised you in working

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:37.810
with students on, using pictures.

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:44.460 position:70%
&gt;&gt; I'd say simply that I try to think through
every direction that they are going to go

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:50.010 position:67%
with their observations, their reflections,
and their questions, and, inevitably,

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:56.940 position:61%
even when I've done a, an analysis with
a group of five, six, seven year olds,

00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:03.180 position:70%
and since I'm in the Library, I'll do it with
three classes, I can come back the next year,

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:08.560 position:75%
and I can have a student bring back up something
that not only did I not think of but those 60,

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:11.510 position:69%
70, 80 kids the year before didn't think of.

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:15.790 position:63%
And so it's just being open to all those
directions, and I find myself having

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:22.160 position:66%
to really step back and make sure that I'm
not guiding that image analysis too much.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:27.110 position:64%
That I'm listening to what they're saying
and then asking them clarifying questions

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:31.860
to let them lead the analysis so
I don't shut down that thinking.

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:36.930 position:59%
&gt;&gt; Could you talk a little bit about
the kinds of the items that excite you

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:45.490 position:66%
as teacher/librarian or that your students
have responded particularly well to?

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:50.120
&gt;&gt; I think the key thing that
I like to do is two things.

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:54.570
First of all, bring in images
that have other children in them.

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:57.390 position:73%
My students seem to react really well to those.

00:33:57.390 --> 00:34:01.590
They feel like they're in a place
where they can speak to that.

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:04.830
It could be images at school,
at home, on the street.

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:06.930
It doesn't seem to matter.

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:09.590
They react to images of children.

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:12.830 position:59%
And then the other thing, and this has
to do with when you bring the image

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:21.480 position:59%
in to do the analysis, bringing it in
before, I've had less success bringing

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:26.880 position:59%
that in before students are, have any
exposure with their classroom teacher.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:30.400 position:66%
More often, once they have a little bit of
background with their classroom teacher,

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:36.510 position:72%
maybe not too much, but that's a great time to
bring in a photo to start to look at that idea

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:40.240 position:70%
in a different way or in a deeper way because
they'll have a little bit of a grounding,

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:44.870 position:59%
and they'll feel like they can really
contribute something to that analysis.

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:52.440
&gt;&gt; So, Tom, go ahead, and there's
another follow-up question for you.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.510
Do you ever use props related
to what's in the photograph

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:58.630 position:66%
to make the experience more multi-sensory?

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:04.760
&gt;&gt; I'm trying to think of an
example where I have done that,

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:08.070 position:75%
and to be completely honest with you, I haven't.

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:15.710 position:66%
I think probably the closest we've done is
we've had some images of school settings

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:19.740 position:64%
that we've analyzed, and we have walked
around the school to clarify some things.

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:23.880
Sometimes a group will, and this
is where things get interesting

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:26.300
when students have disagreements.

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:29.220
So how do you resolve that
dis, those disagreements,

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:33.360 position:59%
and the place where you can resolve
disagreements are in the observations.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.380 position:75%
You should be able to agree on the observations.

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:41.470 position:59%
You may not agree on the reflections,
but you can agree on the observations.

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:45.810
So when students are trying
to bring in their own context,

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.590 position:69%
and we can get quick access to that context.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:52.990 position:66%
So we can get quick access to those school
settings, then take advantage of that,

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:58.780
and so I think in that sense, those
props, those, that may be related

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:04.090
to the photograph would be a great
way to [inaudible] that context

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:07.060 position:70%
and give them another way that they can bring

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:11.340
in their own knowledge to
then reflect on the photo.

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:17.110 position:64%
&gt;&gt; One point I was going to make is that
the same photo can offer different levels

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:19.850 position:61%
of information for different audiences.

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:25.400 position:73%
So even though our "Every Photo is a Story"
series is kind of geared towards older students

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.770 position:73%
or adults, it's possible to take the same photo

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:31.940
and change the kind of questions
you're asking to.

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:36.340 position:56%
If you take, for an example, we have
photographs of Civil War soldiers.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:41.740 position:66%
So if you show some, a young student a
photograph of an African American soldier,

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:46.180
it will definitely give them
questions about what was the role

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:48.400 position:59%
of African Americans in the Civil War.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.570
They may or may not know that.

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:54.790
They can look at the person
and observe how old they are.

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:56.540 position:73%
You know, does that person look older than you?

00:36:56.540 --> 00:37:01.010
Things like that, and then
you can take that same photo

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:03.870
to a different level with
different interest groups.

00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:05.600 position:64%
So some people are studying the uniforms.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:09.180
Some people are determining
what states they fought for.

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:11.720 position:66%
What state, what kind of soldier they are.

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:15.680 position:59%
So it's just a point to make that,
just because you see a photograph used

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:19.610 position:59%
for a certain age group, it's possible
that you can look at it a different,

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:24.320
from a different angle and offer
it to a younger audience as well.

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:32.450 position:63%
&gt;&gt; Excellent points, Christy, and you've
generated some additional conversation.

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:36.640 position:56%
We have time for just a couple more
questions, but before we take those,

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:42.660 position:70%
let me just point out some ending
housekeeping in case people need to duck out.

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:45.790
That we would appreciate your
feedback on this session.

00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:48.390
We have a three-question survey.

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:51.850
So it'd be great if you could
click through that.

00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:57.550
It's on the slide, and I also
pasted it into the chat box.

00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:02.610 position:67%
For completing this session, you can earn a
certificate, you have earned a certificate

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:07.150 position:67%
for one instructional hour, and you'll
receive an e-mail within five business days

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:11.710 position:63%
with instructions on how to access that.

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:15.750
So a question for Christy.

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:20.260 position:59%
Christy, what are the most interesting
kinds of questions that you fielded,

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:23.330 position:69%
or if you have a single one that stands out?

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:29.960 position:73%
A little insight into your life as a
reference librarian, and what gets you excited?

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.060
&gt;&gt; I, you know, one of the
things that's exciting for me is

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:34.990
that I get a different kind
of question every day.

00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:37.060 position:59%
There's certainly recurring questions.

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:43.630 position:75%
We have people, since we're in DC, people often
come in and ask for help finding historic photos

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:48.780 position:59%
of the place they live, or an area
they know in DC, and that's always fun

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:54.330 position:75%
because it is definitely a treasure hunt through
our collections to find that exact location

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:56.840 position:64%
at the time period they're interested in.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:02.720 position:73%
But something I find interesting as when a user
comes to me and wants to use visual materials

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.310 position:56%
in a way I hadn't thought of before.

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:12.380 position:69%
I had a researcher come in who was actually
looking at some of our 18th century drawings

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:15.570
for a modern purpose, and,
typically, folks who are looking

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:19.180
at those older drawings,
it's are an academic reason.

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:23.850 position:66%
And this gentleman was actually part of
an archeological dig, and they were trying

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:30.620 position:58%
to find artifacts from the French and
Indian War, if I remember correctly,

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:37.320 position:72%
and he was able to use drawings done in 1760
to actually pinpoint an area that he was going

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:43.100 position:66%
to go back and look into and try to find a
structure of a fort from that time period.

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:47.420 position:63%
So it was a use for that particular
drawing I had not occurred to me before.

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:51.830 position:58%
And I try to, you know, a lot of the
questions that come to mind I feature

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:57.240 position:69%
in our Picture This blog, which is a fun
way for me to explore them or share the kind

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:59.700
of discoveries I make day by day.

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:05.920 position:69%
I wanted to go back to quickly to an earlier
mention of students who love mysteries,

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:10.540 position:67%
and one thing I would point out that if you
go back to the Picture This blog as well

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:13.050
as the Flickr account for
the Library of Congress,

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:19.570 position:69%
you'll see that recently we've actually been
posting what we call our mystery photos.

00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:25.050 position:69%
We have collections for which there are no
captions on the photos, and we are selecting

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:29.810 position:66%
out groups of them, ones that we think are
solvable mysteries, and we're posting them

00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:34.010
on our Flickr account and asking
people to try to figure it out.

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:37.660
So we don't actually know
the answer in many cases.

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:42.720 position:66%
So it is a true challenge for people, and
we do get a really good response for that,

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:47.110 position:59%
and I think it would be an interesting
lesson for perhaps older students,

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:49.740
some of them are tricky, but
there's certainly clues there

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:52.360 position:58%
that would appeal to many age groups.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:57.660 position:75%
So that's something that we try to do and
engage people with our photos in different ways.

00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:04.730 position:67%
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Christy, and there were a number
of comments earlier in your presentation

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:12.140 position:73%
in the chat about the value of engaging
students in mysteries, and what's more exciting

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:16.420
than a real mystery that
even the experts don't know.

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:23.400 position:58%
Students so infrequently get a chance
to explore that, to experience that.

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:27.600
I'm going to wrap this up.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.740
I think we've answered all
the questions that came in.

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:34.340
Again, thanks to Tom and Christy
for a rich and lively conversation,

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:37.780 position:64%
and thanks to everybody who participated.

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:41.050 position:70%
This works because you come and make it work.

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:46.660
So, again, it would help us if you
would take this very short survey.

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:53.730
The link is on the slide,
and, ah, thank you, Dana.

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:59.400 position:64%
Dana Bell has posted in the exact link
to the blog post that I was reaching for.

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.100
So thanks for that.

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:05.330
This will be, I'll be closing
this off in about thirty seconds.

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:08.400 position:70%
So grab that survey link, and thanks so much.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:15.370 position:56%
I'm going to stop the recording now.

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:19.030
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
