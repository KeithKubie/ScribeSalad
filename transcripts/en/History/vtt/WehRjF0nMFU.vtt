00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:07.500
SAM: I've yet to prove
myself in the protein realm.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.370
I need to get a fish out of
that river and into my belly.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.700
First thing I'm gonna do
today is check my fish trap

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.030
that's way out in the lagoon.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.400
So it's a long walk.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.530
Hopefully there's
something in there.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.530
Anything.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.430
Literally one
crawdad, I'd be happy.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.770
[music playing]

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.430
[laughing weakly]

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.400
OK, well.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.630
[laughing weakly]

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.200
I'm gonna show you what we got.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.470
[laughing weakly]

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.830
So if I'm being honest, I don't
know exactly what this is,

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.400
but it looks an awful
lot like a leech.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.130
Oh my gosh.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.230
[laughing weakly]

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.730
Yeah, it's definitely
they're leeches.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.430
It appears they've been
sucking on this mouse blood.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.730
That's about the grossest
thing you can eat,

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.570
is a leech who's been
feeding off of mouse blood.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.300
Bombs away.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.070
I don't even know if
you can eat leeches.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.670
That's probably like the last
thing I would want to eat.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.830
All right, back to camp.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.930
I guess we can haul 'em back
home and use them for, uh--

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:48.570
something.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.430
No fish.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.130
Pretty pathetic.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.300
Another day in paradise, right?

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.870
I don't feel super good about
my situation at the moment.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.370
You know, I feel
like what am I doing

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.530
wrong if I can't get a
stinking fish out of my river.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.000
Honestly, I feel very down
about not being able to score

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.430
more protein at this point.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.030
I thought that
there would be more

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.430
stuff out here for me to get.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.300
It looks like fishing is kind
of off the menu for the moment.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.770
And I'm literally starving.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.900
When your wife and kids look
at you, what kind of man

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.330
do they see?

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.930
Don't want them to
see someone who gives

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.830
up as soon as things get tough.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.970
I don't want that.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.600
And so I feel, at this point,
that I will eat anything.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.930
So what we're doing tonight is
we are cooking up the leeches

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.130
that we got in the
fish trap that I had

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.830
put over in the lagoon area.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.030
Gonna do this even
though I'm not 100% sure

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.030
if you even can eat leeches.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.900
Oh, it smells bad.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.030
Oh, I don't like it.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.900
I don't like it at all.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.500
One leech.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.400
So we've got nine
leeches and a snail.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.170
I'm gonna boil 'em for,
like, five full minutes.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.330
I do not want this to be,
like, slightly undercooked

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.400
and get some kind of
crazy worm thing in me.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.900
What are the odds
that this tastes good?

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.230
Like, I wonder what the odds are
that I pop these into my mouth

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.800
and I'm like, whoa, man,
what a tasty, delicious meal.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.030
I'm gonna put a wire
through 'em and roast 'em.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.830
Oh, if this was smell-a-vision,
you guys would be getting it.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.070
All righty, one leech
kebab coming right up.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.730
Bon appetit.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.870
[music playing]

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.300
Oh, what the heck.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.600
Let's get these all
four all at once.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.900
I'm still, like, deciding if
I'm gonna throw up or not.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.330
Wow.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.370
[gagging]

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.800
Gross.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.970
Gross.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.970
Ooh, gross.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:47.800
Yuck.
