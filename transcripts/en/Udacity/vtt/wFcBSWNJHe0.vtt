All right. Now we're back to interacting
with our ContentProvider,

00:00:03.271 --> 00:00:05.291
so it's time to have another exercise.

00:00:05.315 --> 00:00:07.397
Use the ContentProvider to insert

00:00:07.397 --> 00:00:10.821
the vector of ContentValue objects
into the database. (laughs)

00:00:10.821 --> 00:00:13.724
Don't worry, we're really almost done
with inserting data.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.649
Next is the fun part
that makes this all worth it.
