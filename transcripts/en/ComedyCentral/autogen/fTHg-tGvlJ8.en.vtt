00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.570 align:start position:0%
vaccine in that someone sneezes on it
and<00:04:41.450><c> then</c><00:04:42.440><c> you</c><00:04:42.530><c> have</c><00:04:42.740><c> the</c><00:04:42.920><c> tissue</c><00:04:43.100><c> someone</c>

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 align:start position:0%

and then you have the tissue someone

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
success is do people believe it will
 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.809 align:start position:0%

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:02.819 align:start position:0%
people use it and do people like it so
 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:04.670 align:start position:0%

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 align:start position:0%
I used the haagen-dazs method how can I

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
miss it if you don't know is where you
 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.339 align:start position:0%
miss it if you don't know is where you
take<00:05:08.759><c> a</c><00:05:08.939><c> product</c><00:05:09.210><c> that's</c><00:05:09.449><c> not</c><00:05:09.599><c> Danish</c><00:05:10.050><c> at</c><00:05:10.199><c> all</c>

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 align:start position:0%
take a product that's not Danish at all
 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
take a product that's not Danish at all
but<00:05:10.680><c> you</c><00:05:10.740><c> give</c><00:05:10.889><c> it</c><00:05:10.979><c> a</c><00:05:11.009><c> Danish</c><00:05:11.339><c> name</c><00:05:11.550><c> so</c><00:05:11.759><c> it</c>

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 align:start position:0%
but you give it a Danish name so it
 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:12.969 align:start position:0%
but you give it a Danish name so it
seems<00:05:12.059><c> fuller</c>

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 align:start position:0%
seems fuller
 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.589 align:start position:0%
