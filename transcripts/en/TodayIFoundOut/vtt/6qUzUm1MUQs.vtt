00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:13.990
We’ve all seen them, and 
unfortunately most of us have had one.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.200
Those painful, pockets of goo that form because
some over exercised, over caffeinated, happy

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.550
to be living life, outdoors-man decides to
include you in their daily torture fest that

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.900
is a hike up mount agony!

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.420
So what exactly is going on here that causes
the formation of a blister?

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.370
Let’s start off with the anatomy involved.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.320
For the most part, there are three layers
of tissue that surround our bones and organs.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.570
The first layer is called the epidermis.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.430
This is the outer most layer of the skin.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.950
The second, or middle layer, is called the
dermis.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.750
The third layer is called the subcutis, also
known as the subcutaneous.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.030
Together, these three layers make up the largest
organ in the body, our skin!

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.620
The epidermis itself has 4-5 layers.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.420
Most areas of the skin have four.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.940
In regions such as the fingertips, palms of
your hands and soles of your feet, where the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.240
skin is exposed to greater friction forces,
there are five.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.340
Starting from the deepest layer and working
out, there is the Stratum Basale, the Stratum

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.780
Spinosum, the Stratum Granulosum, the Stratum
Lucidum and the Stratum Corneum.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.640
The Stratum Lucidum is that extra friction
induced layer that helps make your skin thick

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.310
in those areas that require it.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.140
Friction blisters are just that, the result
of friction.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.900
What’s going on under the surface is that
repeated rubbing over one area of your skin

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.070
will create forces that cause mechanical fatigue
of the epidermis.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.780
This fatigue causes a split in the epidermis
that usually resides at the layer of the Stratum

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.780
Spinosum.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.729
When these cells separate, hydrostatic pressure
allows a plasma-like blister fluid to form

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:47.890
in this space.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.189
This fluid is similar to blood plasma in that
it has the same electrolyte concentration,

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.890
but with a much lower protein level.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.979
Should you continue the sadistic massage of
your skin, the outer 3 layers of your puss

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.930
pocket will break open, your salty fluid will
leak out, and this portion of your epidermis

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.229
will slough off.

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.009
The resulting exposure to the last layer of
the epidermis and the dermis itself (where

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.590
your nerves are) is the red area that hurts
like hell should you want to poke it with

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.670
a stick!

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.430
The recovery of your exposed blister will
begin after approximately 6 hours, as the

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.129
remaining cells under your blister begin the
process of healing.

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:30.590
24 hours into your rehabilitation, the cells
are dividing like a mid-1990’s Microsoft

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.590
stock.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.260
One day later, around 48 hours in to the restoration
of your epidermis, a new Granular layer (Stratum

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.209
Granulosum) can be seen.

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.680
After approximately 5 days, this surge of
cellular growth begins to slow down and a

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.280
shiny new Stratum Corneum layer begins to
show itself.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.569
Your new skin is ready!

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.370
Most blisters caused by friction do not require
a doctor’s care.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.720
If the blister doesn’t pop, new skin will
form underneath the affected area and the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.460
fluid is simply absorbed.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.560
Try not to puncture a blister unless it is
large, painful, or likely to be further irritated.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.290
The fluid-filled blister keeps the underlying
skin clean, which prevents infection and promotes

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.290
healing.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.400
Should you need to burst your bubble, it might
behoove you to follow a few simple techniques.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.230
Use a sterilized needle or razor blade (to
sterilize it, put the point or edge in a flame

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.930
until it is red hot, or rinse it in alcohol).

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.080
Wash the area thoroughly, then make a small
hole and gently squeeze out the clear fluid.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.629
If the fluid is white or yellow, the blister
may be infected and needs medical attention.

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.580
Do not remove the skin over a broken blister.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.879
The new skin underneath will benefit from
this protective layer.

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:41.769
Look for signs of infection to develop.

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.799
These include pus drainage, red or warm skin
surrounding the blister, or red streaks leading

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:59.780
away from the blister.
