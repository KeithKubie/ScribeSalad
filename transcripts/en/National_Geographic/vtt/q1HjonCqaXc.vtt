00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:01.633
[music playing]

00:00:01.633 --> 00:00:02.734
FRANCESCA FIORENTINI
(VOICEOVER):

00:00:02.734 --> 00:00:04.333
Here in the Japanese
countryside,

00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.467
some of Japan's most
eligible bachelors

00:00:06.467 --> 00:00:09.567
are waiting to meet their mates.

00:00:09.567 --> 00:00:11.533
The mayor is here.

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.533
Parents are here.

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.633
Eligible bachelors and
bachelorettes are here.

00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:16.967
FRANCESCA FIORENTINI
(VOICEOVER):

00:00:16.967 --> 00:00:19.667
They've even summoned the city's
mascots, the great warrior

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:22.567
Masamitsu and his wife.

00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:30.266
[speaking japanese]

00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:36.100
[speaking japanese]

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.266
FRANCESCA FIORENTINI
(VOICEOVER):

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.567
This is one of many
events organized each year

00:00:39.567 --> 00:00:42.900
by the Japanese government
to get young people to hook

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.400
up, shack up, and make babies.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.066
Japan's overall
population is dropping

00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.433
and the government is panicked.

00:00:51.433 --> 00:00:54.000
Without young people to shore
up the country's tax base,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.600
the coming decades
could see Japan spin

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.233
into an economic death spiral.

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:02.133
Emma, a 29-year-old
bachelorette,

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.433
traveled two hours
from the city of Tokyo

00:01:04.433 --> 00:01:07.300
with the hope of meeting
the farm boy of her dreams.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:27.700
[speaking japanese]

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.800
FRANCESCA FIORENTINI
(VOICEOVER):

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.066
Emma has one hour
to play the field,

00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:33.700
but comes up empty-handed.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.066
FRANCESCA FIORENTINI: So
what's next for you, Osaka?

00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:39.133
Maybe start from
close to where

00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:42.333
I live, like Tokyo, maybe.

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:43.433
- Well--
- Yeah.

00:01:43.433 --> 00:01:44.700
Well, keep trying.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.000
Yeah.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.800
See ya.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.500
See ya.
