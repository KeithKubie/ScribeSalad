SPEAKER 1: Welcome everybody.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.990
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.880
We have a wonderful
agenda planned

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.850
packed with viewings, and
a wonderful discussion

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.110
with our panel here from
all around the world, mostly

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:16.860
Alaska.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.580
But I know you didn't come
here to listen to me talk.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.730
So I think we're
gonna go ahead and get

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.240
started with our first film.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.665
And then, go from there.

00:00:27.665 --> 00:00:29.485
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:29.485 --> 00:00:30.930
-What's the best fisherman?

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.080
Is the best freshman the one
that makes the most money?

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.970
Is the best fisherman the one
that catches the most fish?

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.830
Is the best fisherman the one
that catches the biggest fish?

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.530
To me, the best fisherman is
the one that has the best fish.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.430
It's a stunning landscape.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.560
The watershed is one of the
most healthy salmon watersheds

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.530
in all of North America.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.160
Most watersheds can only handle
one or two species of salmon.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.115
But Taku has all five
species of salmon.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.420
What that means
for our fishery is

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.810
that we can provide commercially
viable salmon sustainably

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.130
harvested for five to six
months out of the year.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.330
There's almost no other river
system that you can do that.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.065
The inlet itself is stunning.

00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:46.490
Absolutely stunning.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.320
I love the quote, the
silence is deafening.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.260
You want people
to taste the smell

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.380
of Alaska, the fresh
ocean air, the stillness.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.954
To be humbled by the
quality of what is here.

00:02:10.724 --> 00:02:12.390
What Taku River Red
had done differently

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:20.310
on the boats is everything to
the fish by proper handling,

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.760
making sure that
the fish are not

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.760
bound by gravity, rapid
chilling, getting the blood out

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.870
is key, and we do that
with a hypodermic needle.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.110
And we actually pump the
blood out within moments

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.160
of the fish coming on board.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.270
It's the blood that
makes fish taste fishy.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.020
It's not the meat.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.290
It's just the blood.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.750
So we want to get the blood
out before it coagulates deep

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.970
inside the capillaries.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.810
I want you to taste a sockeye.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.240
I want you to taste a coho.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.150
I want you to taste a king
and know the difference.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.410
And you can tell that
by removing the blood.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.460
-We've always felt like our
fish is of the highest quality

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.410
because we're doing
everything we know of

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.660
to preserve that quality.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.490
But that's all subjective.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.060
To have a scientist use a
machine that objectively

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.570
tells us those numbers
and says, yes, you're

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.745
doing the right thing with
this fish is really very cool.

00:03:20.745 --> 00:03:23.070
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.524
-Everything else we do is for
the health of salmon fisheries.

00:03:28.524 --> 00:03:32.130
-Over the years, our
habitat conservation efforts

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.340
at Taku River Reds have
become just as important

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.290
as the fishing,
and the processing,

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.736
and the handling of the fish.

00:03:40.736 --> 00:03:44.460
-Nobody here wants to
catch the last fish.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.560
It's too scary to think
of the other options.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.090
That what we have
today might not

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.345
be around in a very near future
if you don't take care of it

00:03:53.345 --> 00:03:55.940
and protect it.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.920
There are no employees.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.070
Just the six of us.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.230
-We're a group of fishermen
and fishing families.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.790
What it means to us
is not just being

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.540
able to eat the finest
fish on the planet.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.810
But when you fish
for your family,

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.300
the goal isn't really
to the pocketbook.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.810
It's about fishing
for the future.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.920
-It is not making a living.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.640
We're doing things that
touch people in a certain way

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.740
because they're getting
a piece of Alaska.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.770
They're getting
something that they

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:23.990
know is the highest quality.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.410
They're supporting
our way of life,

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.540
our fisherman's way of life.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.710
There's a lot more beyond
just going to the store

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.688
and buying something to eat.

00:04:32.688 --> 00:04:34.170

[END PLAYBACK]

JILL WEITZ-SALMON: Thank you
everybody for showing up today.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.500
Thank you especially
to Auggi and Vicki

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.060
who have been working with me
for the last couple of months

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.900
to put this together.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.730
We're really excited to be here.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:22.820
Again, my name is Jill.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.060
And I'm here from
Juneau, Alaska today

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.910
on behalf of Salmon
Beyond Borders, which

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.940
is a campaign that
is a collective group

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.410
of different interests ranging
from commercial and sport

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.490
fishermen to tribes, and First
Nations to municipal leaders

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.360
throughout the region, business
owners to operators that

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.270
are all working to raise
awareness for this resource

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.100
that we're here today that
brings us together today

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.310
and in different components,
kind of, unites our work.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.540
And that resource
is wild salmon.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.260
And that resource is currently
threatened in Southeast Alaska

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.960
by development upstream
in British Columbia.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.340
So I think it's
important to mention

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.360
at the forefront of
this presentation,

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.100
and I do this in
all my talks, but I

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.880
want to suggest that this is
not an anti-mining campaign.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.070
In fact, on my flight
down here-- and

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.516
I've certainly had quite a
few interesting conversations

00:06:22.516 --> 00:06:23.890
in all of my
travels from Juneau.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.556
You know, people say
where are you from.

00:06:25.556 --> 00:06:27.900
And it, kind of, goes
on its own course.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.000
But when you tell them
you're from Alaska

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.030
and that you work for
a salmon conservation,

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.630
they say, what are you against?

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:34.570
This is common.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.740
And it just happened on my
way down here, actually.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.140
This woman said-- she was
a planner from Seattle--

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.250
she said, what are you
campaigning against?

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.190
And we like to say that we're
campaigning or advocating

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.790
for salmon.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.220
But it's not just salmon.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.620
It's a livelihood.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.480
It's something that allows
fishermen, and families,

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.970
and traditional lifestyles
to maintain and continue.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.430
And what I get to
do is work with all

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.320
these different interest
groups to ensure

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.150
that that system, and that
cycle, and that lifestyle

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.270
can continue for the present
and generations to come.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.430
So I'm just gonna give
you a quick background

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.630
of the issue itself.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.430
And we, as a campaign--
the Salmon Beyond Borders

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.170
campaign-- produced
a six minute film,

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.020
which will show again
before we break out

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.370
into a panel discussion.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.460
But feel free.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.820
This is really informal.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.164
If you have a question
along the way, please, just

00:07:32.164 --> 00:07:32.830
raise your hand.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:33.420
Let me know.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.545
Otherwise, we'll have plenty
of time for a question

00:07:35.545 --> 00:07:38.130
and answer afterwards.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:42.250
So starting from, kind
of, the beginning rather.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.290
In 2014, there was a
Northwest transmission line

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.940
completed in British Columbia.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.400
Northwest British
Columbia is an area

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.037
that has about 2,000 people.

00:07:53.037 --> 00:07:55.120
So it's, kind of, in the
middle of nowhere, right.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.960
And so when this power
line was completed,

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.150
it created this
chaotic craze, rather,

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:06.370
to start development to start
any type of project that

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.310
could be started.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.200
73% of the world's
mining companies

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.600
are based in Vancouver.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.220
So that's just one start
of this flow and momentum.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.810
And then also, the former
prime minister of Canada,

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.040
Harper, under his
administration,

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:27.170
all federal environmental
regulations were deregulated.

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:30.680
And this created, kind of, a
free for all, more or less,

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.330
for exploration of development.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:39.480
And if you look at different
websites and different maps,

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:43.770
I think that-- can
we go to the map?

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.240
It's just a slew.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.210
There's a plethora of
different projects ranging.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:53.580
Different types of mining
all throughout the region.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.140
But we, the Salmon
Beyond Borders campaign,

00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:00.400
is primarily focused on this
Northwest, British Columbia,

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.950
Southeast, Alaska region.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:04.950
And again, I'm
from Juneau, which

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.490
is on this side of the map.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:08.780
It's the capital of Alaska.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.030
We have about 30,000 people.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:15.040
And in Southeast Alaska, there's
about 75,000 people total.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.230
On that side of the other
side of the border in British

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.070
Columbia, there's 2,000.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:27.100
So again, it's not a
heavily populated area.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.190
And the size itself
is similar to that

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.700
of the country of France.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.817
So it's this gigantic region.

00:09:33.817 --> 00:09:34.650
Not a lot of people.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.580
Not a lot of people
know about it.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.790
And there are these different
mines that we're focusing on.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:44.160
Again, 10 because of their
size, scale, and scope,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.420
and their proximity
to Alaska that we're

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.680
highlighting and working to
raise awareness for because we

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.820
don't have any say.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.060
As downstream interests, those
of us in Southeast Alaska,

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.140
there are no established
protections for us

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.970
to protect and ensure long-term
water quality and enforceable

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.850
protections to our fisheries
and the industries that

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.850
keep Alaska going in Southeast.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:13.050
So again, I'll give
you a quick example.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:17.300
The KSM Project, which is down
here in the Unuk watershed,

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.400
that project was approved by
the provincial and federal

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.520
governments in Canada.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.840
It would be the largest open
pit mine in North America

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.570
and the fifth
largest in the world.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:32.940
That's 19 miles
upstream from Alaska.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.760
And it runs into
Misty Fjords National

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.740
Monument, which is a federally
protected area, obviously.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:42.590
And I'll mention also that all
of Southeast Alaska-- this area

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.860
through here-- is under
protection of the Tongass

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.420
National Forest, which is
the largest National Forest

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.860
in the United States.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:52.940
So on our side, the United
States side of these rivers,

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.300
you have the largest
or the highest level

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.840
of federal protections.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.640
And on the BC side,
it's under development.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.380
The current premier of British
Columbia, Christy Clark,

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.260
wanted her legacy to
be in this region.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.730
10 mines in 10 years.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:12.140
And she's exceeded that as far
as what stages of development

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.490
these mines are in.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:17.400
So again, our main
ask is that we're

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.260
raising awareness to this
issue, to this region that

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.350
is unpopulated.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:24.490
That we're giving a voice
to the commercial fishermen,

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.950
to the tribal governments,
to the tour operators that

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:31.000
rely on healthy
fisheries and clean water

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.540
to continue to draw tourists and
fishermen in for sport fishing.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.210
So we, over the years,
have been trying

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:43.850
to figure out what type
of enforceable mechanisms,

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.990
different policies,
international policies,

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:49.290
are out there and available to
influence these standards that

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:53.000
will guarantee protections
for generations to come.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.310
And really, that's our target.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:58.440
That's our ask is that under the
Boundary Waters Treaty, which

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.740
was signed by both
countries in 1909,

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:06.140
we have the authority to have
a say as United States citizens

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:08.800
and downstream
stakeholders in Alaska

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.790
to determine how these globally
significant watersheds are

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.430
developed.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.930
So again, just trying to
get that seat at the table.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:22.350
It's a complex,
convoluted issue involving

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:26.760
different international laws
and different interests.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.360
But it's been an
incredible issue

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.420
in that it has brought together
all sectors of Southeast

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.720
Alaska ranging from the tribal
governments to the business

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.220
owners to our
congressional delegation.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:44.190
Alaska's congressional
delegation, which are all ours,

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:47.270
very strong conservatives
have supported us

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.680
through this effort
in a sense that this

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.630
is our way of life
in Southeast Alaska

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.350
and the majority of the state.

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:54.950
Salmon is our way of life.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:58.910
In Southeast Alaska alone,
there's a $2 billion industry.

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:01.960
Commercial fishing,
$1 billion annually.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.490
Tourism, $1 billion annually.

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:08.150
These industries are dependent
upon these clean waters.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:12.470
And we maintain that we should
have a say in how these shared

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:14.480
watersheds are developed.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.190
So getting back to the
fact that it is clunky

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:19.350
and before I continue
to ramble, we

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:21.480
have explored
different ways in which

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.270
we can help tell our story.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.390
How do we raise awareness?

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:28.390
How do we get someone in the
middle of the United States

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:31.330
or a Bay Area of California
to really care or be

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.770
aware of this issue?

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:39.110
And through that, we have had
great contacts with filmmakers,

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:43.880
and brother-in-laws working
for Google, and chefs.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:47.230
Throughout the country,
it's been extraordinary.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:50.000
And last summer in
particular, a very good friend

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.700
of mine in Juneau is gaining
momentum and attention

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:56.450
as a chef.

00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:00.510
He, last year, was a
James Beard nominee.

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:04.820
He was also awarded
America's Greatest Seafood

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:09.410
Chef at a seafood
cook-off in New Orleans.

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.090
So he's gained a
lot of attention

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:14.150
and is utilizing that attention
to help raise awareness

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:18.230
to the importance of sustainable
fisheries throughout Alaska.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:21.940
Last summer, we hosted this
small, sustainable seafood

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.320
dinner in Juneau that
was mostly local folks.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.470
And it had a great return.

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:31.190
It got media attention that was
syndicated all the way from San

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.730
Francisco to Miami.

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:35.690
We had a chef from the Bay Area.

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:38.630
Ritchie, who was supposed to
be here today, unfortunately,

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.810
had to deal with some
restaurant issues

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:41.860
and is unable to join us.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.020
But he was here last year.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:47.289
We had a chef from Houston
and a chef from Seattle.

00:14:47.289 --> 00:14:48.080
And that was great.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.750
And so Chef Bo and
I wanted to just

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.160
make this bigger and better.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:57.395
And through the utilization
of products like Kirk's Fish,

00:14:57.395 --> 00:15:01.250
he has continued to just
have great attention.

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:04.370
And chefs throughout the country
have been drawn to his work

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.390
and what he is
trying to accomplish.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:10.100
And so this summer,
we-- just in July--

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.340
put together the first
inaugural southeast feast,

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.560
which was an event
to raise awareness

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.370
for the bounty of
Southeast Alaska

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:22.150
and the importance of
sustainable fisheries.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.940
That event brought up
chef Trevor and Tim

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:26.325
who are here with us today.

00:15:26.325 --> 00:15:28.450
And we'll get to hear from
them a little bit later.

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:31.900
But it was an
incredible success.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:35.990
And we had 400 people show
up to this event to just eat

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.330
wild Alaskan seafood.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.970
And so through that, through
the film you're about to see,

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:44.160
we've been able to attract
a different attention

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.610
and a different care or
concern for this issue

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:50.820
as it relates to how we
connect with people, like what

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.810
we're eating, right.

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:55.940
So with that, I think we'll
go into our short film.

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:59.220
And then, we'll be here
to answer any questions.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.574
So thank you.

00:16:00.574 --> 00:16:02.056
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:17.864 --> 00:16:19.840
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:35.648 --> 00:16:39.340
-Our natural surroundings
here really define

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:43.216
how we live our lives and
how we relate to each other.

00:16:43.216 --> 00:16:44.518
-There's energy.

00:16:44.518 --> 00:16:45.601
There's a pulse, you know.

00:16:45.601 --> 00:16:48.754
It's almost like being in a
big city or the stock market,

00:16:48.754 --> 00:16:49.253
you know.

00:16:49.253 --> 00:16:50.060
You're wheeling.

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.440
You're dealing.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.380
Things are moving.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:56.652
-These wild Alaskan
salmon, or maybe they're

00:16:56.652 --> 00:16:57.948
wild Canadian salmon.

00:16:57.948 --> 00:16:59.535
You know, they're
feeding the world!

00:16:59.535 --> 00:17:01.500
-I saw a piece of
Alaska's fishery.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.950
It's over a billion dollars.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:06.182
Tourism is over a
billion in the industry.

00:17:06.182 --> 00:17:08.250
-I can't think of
much money that I've

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:12.109
made in my life that
wasn't because of fish.

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:14.731
-Four words, man.

00:17:14.731 --> 00:17:17.568
Humpies pay the bills.

00:17:17.568 --> 00:17:18.819
-Huge, huge, huge.

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:20.859
I mean, it doesn't
get any bigger.

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:21.770
This is it.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.500
It's like the farmer depends
on rain for his crops.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.319
You know, we depend on our
environment for these fisheries

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:29.656
that we're all involved in.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.070
-Yes, that's British Columbia.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:39.520
And yes, this is Alaska.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.120
But as far as the
fish, and the nature,

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:48.760
and the essence of the
river, there's no line there.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.850
-The bulk of these fish are
coming back to these three

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:53.050
big trans-boundary rivers.

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:54.950
The Taku, Stikine, and Unuk.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:57.100
And if you see impacts
to the fish in there,

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.471
those impacts are gonna
cascade across southeast Alaska

00:17:59.471 --> 00:18:01.095
through the different
economic sectors.

00:18:05.335 --> 00:18:07.210
No matter where you fish
in Southeast Alaska,

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:08.480
you're probably
at risk from some

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.729
of the effects of these mines.

00:18:14.814 --> 00:18:16.840
-All this mining.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.950
Proposed mines are taking place
across the border in Canada.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:24.730
So we're not going to see
any kind of economic benefit.

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:28.146
The only thing we're going
to see in this region

00:18:28.146 --> 00:18:29.270
is the environmental risks.

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:36.580
-I mean, when I became aware of
this scale the mines proposed.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.700
-The tailings dams
up there are gonna

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:47.530
have to contain several billion
tons of acid generating rock.

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:49.870
That stuff has to be kept
out of the waters forever.

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:53.460
Forever is a hell
of a long time.

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:57.330
-I haven't seen data
that convinces me

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:03.180
that we have that capability
in those kind of rugged places.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.890
And I'm not even
entirely convinced

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:07.625
that that's their highest goal.

00:19:07.625 --> 00:19:11.140
-There has been a
lot of deregulation

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.950
for environmental
protection in Canada

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:17.570
and in BC with the very
transparent agenda of pushing

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:19.230
as many new mines
through as possible.

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:22.640
-You know, when our people
asked about the tailings

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:27.160
and whether they were safe,
the answer was always the same.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.240
It's the exact same
structure as Mount Polley.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:30.960
And it's safe.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.310
It's perfectly safe.

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:33.900
It's a perfectly safe.

00:19:37.644 --> 00:19:41.320
-The area is
really, really lush.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.800
Lots of clean water and
lots of cedar trees.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.596
And it's this really
special place.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.910
And this happened right
before the salmon were coming.

00:20:01.371 --> 00:20:04.370
-Maybe the worst
environmental disaster

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:06.155
in British Columbia's history.

00:20:06.155 --> 00:20:10.590
10 million cubic meters
of waste water containing

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:13.929
dangerous chemicals poured
into local waterways

00:20:13.929 --> 00:20:16.791
when the earthland dam
surrounding a tailings

00:20:16.791 --> 00:20:18.222
[INAUDIBLE] collapsed.

00:20:18.222 --> 00:20:21.770
-The technologies,
the experts, everybody

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:24.006
was on deck when they
built Mount Polley

00:20:24.006 --> 00:20:27.580
Mine as the shiny example of
new mining in British Columbia.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:30.040
And it failed in
less than 20 years.

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:36.154
This disaster, what happened
down in Quesnel Lake,

00:20:36.154 --> 00:20:37.570
that's our children's
inheritance.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.450
This is what we're leaving them.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.880
-Is there any sense
of how much cost it

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.900
would be to put the dam back?

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.162
And what kind of insurance
coverage do you have?

00:20:52.162 --> 00:20:52.662
-Um.

00:20:58.785 --> 00:21:02.080
-Seeing is believing, yep.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.755
But try it on a scale
seven times bigger.

00:21:04.755 --> 00:21:05.670
-Tribes.

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:06.990
Commercial and sport fishermen.

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:08.600
Subsistence fisherman.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.350
A lot of the local governments.

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:12.560
Right now, you've got almost
all sectors of Southeast

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.410
in agreement that these
BC mines are a threat

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:16.990
to our interest over here.

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:18.770
There's not enough
controls on them.

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:20.690
And we want more
engagement from the state

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.160
of Alaska and the US Feds.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.240
-What would you say
to Secretary Kerry?

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.390
-I would say that he
has a responsibility

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:33.560
to protect, probably, the last
pristine piece of the United

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.650
States, and do it with
everything he has.

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:38.150
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:16.380
[END PLAYBACK]

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.450
JILL WEITZ-SALMON: So thank you.

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:22.250
I think we'll just
introduce ourselves.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:25.550
And then, I think Audrey has
a couple questions that she

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.400
can help get the ball rolling.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.310
But again, Jill Weitz.

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:32.150
I am down here from
Juneau, Alaska.

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:35.280
My background is in
environmental policy.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.420
Prior to working on the Salmon
Beyond Borders campaign,

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.880
I was a compliance and
enforcement officer

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:42.880
for the state of Alaska.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.910
And I traveled around the state
inspecting mines and seafood

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:50.960
processing plants,
actually before I decided

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.910
that I wanted to be
on the other side

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:58.040
and help ensure that these
companies are held accountable,

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.210
and their permits are enforced.

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:05.880
And this journey has
been quite fantastic

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.210
just being able to work
with different folks

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:11.980
throughout the British
Columbia and Alaskan region.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.720
And I've learned a
ton along the way, so.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.050
KIRK HARDCASTLE: Cool.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:16.840
Hi.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.070
Kirk Hardcastle.

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:21.950
I'm up and down from here in
that I'm a [INAUDIBLE] cowboy

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:24.600
born and raised here
in Sonoma County.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:29.560
And I, pretty much,
followed my palate in life.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.780
And it led me to
finding the finest

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:34.270
seafood in the entire
planet that I could eat.

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:35.970
And that led me up
into Alaska to become

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:37.360
a commercial fisherman.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.660
I've been working in the-- if
you grew up in Sonoma County,

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.170
you either make wine or you
work in the food industry.

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:44.910
And I worked in
the food industry.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:48.030
So I really just kept
chasing food all my life.

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:52.570
And it led me up there to really
just trying to find the finest

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:53.790
fish that I could.

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:56.390
Coincidentally, I
came from-- anybody

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:58.260
who knows where the
Russian River is.

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:01.140
And it's a big part is that,
just a couple generations

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:04.320
before me, it was said
that salmon were stacked

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:08.180
like cordwood on the river banks
before the industries had come

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.370
in and decimated the habitat.

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:12.300
How many salmon
did I grow up with?

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:13.185
I'm almost 50.

00:24:13.185 --> 00:24:15.310
How many salmon did I grow
up with in my generation

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:16.860
on the river banks?

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.230
Zero.

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:21.020
So to think that if the
generations in the past

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.720
had the wherewithal to engage
themselves in an industry

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.470
like you to show that you
can vote with your fork

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:28.610
by voting for salmon,
even though it's

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:32.310
a long distance away
but as a concept

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:34.830
to understand that when you
go to these guy's restaurants

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:37.100
and you ask for a wild
fish, you're not only

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.650
supporting fisherman's
way of life, once again.

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:42.320
But also management practice,
and environmental conservation,

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.030
and natural resource
extraction industries that

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:47.870
promotes for sustainable,
resilient practices

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:52.360
that maintain primary economic
drivers within the region.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:56.640
Pulling away wild salmon
fisheries in Alaska,

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.290
since fisheries are a
primary economic driver,

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:02.400
it would be like pulling
Google out of here.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.567
That's a big deal.

00:25:03.567 --> 00:25:05.400
Up there, that's who
we are and what we are.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.607
And how do you maintain
these primary economics

00:25:07.607 --> 00:25:09.940
within that region that are
important to the people that

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:10.890
live there?

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:15.500
And we want to be able to
maintain our way of life.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.680
I want to know that generations
from now that salmon

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.250
will be on the riverbanks.

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:23.400
If the generations before me, my
great, great grandparents ever

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.370
knew or thought that
I would not grow up

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:27.610
with salmon on
the banks, I think

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:30.570
they would have thought
twice about what they did.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:33.370
And it led me to go up to
Alaska because, darn it, I

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:35.247
wanted to eat some salmon.

00:25:35.247 --> 00:25:37.080
So I became a commercial
fisherman up there.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.320
I now have a company.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.880
And I move fish across
the entire United States.

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:44.322
And as you saw in our video,
I'm not about abundance.

00:25:44.322 --> 00:25:45.280
I'm not about quantity.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.450
I'm about quality.

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.000
The quality of
life, the feeling,

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.120
the passion that the
fish can bring to you,

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.620
and I hope you get to taste it,
especially in the sushi here

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:53.574
today.

00:25:53.574 --> 00:25:54.740
So thank you for being here.

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.980
I'm honored that you even
think of seafood and salmon.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.700
And these chefs make it
impossible to bring it

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.990
as a vehicle to you.

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:04.530
And it's ever essential.

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:06.509
We do what we do in Alaska.

00:26:06.509 --> 00:26:08.300
And you consume what
you consume down here.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:12.382
But having the chefs involved
is paramount and their awareness

00:26:12.382 --> 00:26:14.340
of what they're doing
and how they're moving it

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.548
to you to make sure that
you have the best experience

00:26:16.548 --> 00:26:20.620
so that you get to taste the
feeling, the air, the passion

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:21.710
of Alaska.

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:24.060
So thanks to the
chefs, primarily

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.231
because they make
it so we can eat.

00:26:26.231 --> 00:26:27.300
TREVOR KUNK: Awesome.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.630
My name's Trevor Kunk.

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:32.140
Most recently, I was
cooking in the Napa Valley.

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:33.800
But I am actually
departing this week

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:37.240
to go back to the East Coast
back to Brooklyn, New York.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.960
Not nearly as old as Kirk.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:39.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:43.010
But I have-- well maybe.

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:46.630
I mean, I've been chasing
perfect food, as well,

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:48.400
ever since I discovered
it when I was

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.640
seven, eight, nine years old.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.717
I was always in the kitchen.

00:26:51.717 --> 00:26:53.050
But I'm from Florida originally.

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:55.620
And as a child
growing up in Florida,

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.140
you would go to a restaurant.

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.020
And they would call
it Florida seafood.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:00.374
And there was the scallops.

00:27:00.374 --> 00:27:01.040
It was a shrimp.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.880
But scallops don't
really come from Florida.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.180
And the oysters that
they were serving

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.305
were much larger than you
would actually get there.

00:27:06.305 --> 00:27:10.350
So over the years, I've
had different revelations

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:11.510
in regards to seafood.

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:13.897
And it's something that
I'm obsessed with, just

00:27:13.897 --> 00:27:15.730
like everybody that's
sitting here right now

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:18.590
and the chefs that were
up in Alaska with us.

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:22.100
And it goes back to being
a chef, being a consumer,

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:22.980
and being a father.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.047
Like, I want to
know where my food's

00:27:25.047 --> 00:27:27.630
coming from because I'm going
to be serving that to my family.

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:29.255
I'm gonna be serving
that to the guess.

00:27:29.255 --> 00:27:31.100
I'm gonna be serving
it to the friends.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:34.550
And being able to go to Alaska,
and connect with somebody

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:37.370
like Kirk, and see where
that fish is coming from

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:38.070
was amazing.

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:41.764
And that's really what I was
looking for on that trip.

00:27:41.764 --> 00:27:43.680
And I'm just very thankful
that got to happen.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.460
KIRK HARDCASTLE: Thank you.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:44.910
TREVOR KUNK: Yes.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:46.450
KIRK HARDCASTLE: Appreciate it.

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:48.870
TIM ARCHULETA: Hi,
I'm Tim Archuleta.

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:54.750
I'm the owner and executive chef
of Ichi Sushi in San Francisco.

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:57.950
I've been making
sushi for 21 years.

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:01.804
And it's on the forefront of our
website or on our menu at Ichi.

00:28:01.804 --> 00:28:03.970
But we consider ourself
self-sustainable sustainable

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:06.090
restaurant.

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:07.590
I don't like-- you
know, there was

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:08.960
a big fad there for a while.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:13.150
A lot of restaurants opened
up sustainable restaurants.

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:15.130
Carrying a limited amount
of fish because these

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:17.659
were sustainable fish.

00:28:17.659 --> 00:28:18.950
We don't put that in the front.

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:20.510
I want you to taste
the food before I

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:22.800
want you to taste a gimmick.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:26.730
But the sustainability
is very important to me

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:28.360
not only because
of what I'm gonna

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:31.950
leave for the next generation,
but also it's job security.

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:32.780
I'm a sushi chef.

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.100
That's what I do.

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.160
If I don't have
fish, I'm screwed.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:40.425
Veggie sushi is
only so delicious.

00:28:40.425 --> 00:28:41.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:44.070
So it really is.

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:45.470
I think about it all the time.

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:48.600
I think about what
is happening and what

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:52.800
we see in the industry for
being there for 21 years.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.810
You see eel, fresh water eel.

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:57.270
First of all, it's
a weird thing.

00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.920
They don't serve fresh water
eel in Japanese restaurants

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:02.000
or Japanese sushi bars in Japan.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.792
You go to an unagi
place that serves it,

00:29:03.792 --> 00:29:05.250
they grill it, they
put it on rice,

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:06.780
bowl, and that's how you eat it.

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.910
You would never eat it
in a sushi restaurant.

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:10.732
Here in America, we
love it because it's

00:29:10.732 --> 00:29:12.190
one of the five
things you can get,

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:15.120
pretty much, at every sushi
restaurant in America.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.921
Salmon, tuna,
hamachi, eel, shrimp.

00:29:18.921 --> 00:29:19.420
Right?

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:21.030
Every restaurant has that.

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:23.320
You come to ours, you're
gonna see things you've never

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.580
seen in your entire life.

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.220
You'll see some of
those things also.

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:30.875
But with how they're caught
and-- I know this is going

00:29:30.875 --> 00:29:33.500
to be a little [INAUDIBLE]-- we
do carry some farm raised fish.

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:37.390
But it's raised in a way
that I feel is sustainable,

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:41.120
and you're using practices
that we agree with.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.510
Sustainability.

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:47.320
This thing of sustainability
is interesting

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:51.090
because you think
about it of, like, OK,

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:54.150
how is it being caught?

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:56.660
I know you probably get this
also, being sustainable.

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:57.826
But it's coming from Alaska.

00:29:57.826 --> 00:29:59.550
It's so far away.

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:02.460
We get most of our
fish from Japan.

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:06.510
And there's planes coming
every day from Japan

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:09.760
that they have a special little
holder that hold our fish that

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.040
come in from there.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.080
So it's not like a special
flight coming down.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.350
It's the same thing with
the way that the salmons

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:18.350
being shipped down here.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:21.870
This is all coming in
on commercial airplanes.

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:27.930
So you can do a lot of
research on sustainability.

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:32.720
And you can do as much
homework as you can and still

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:37.120
not really know if something
is 100% sustainable.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.760
So for us, we try to
learn as much as we can.

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.040
We go with that.

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:45.320
But with issues like
polluting the water and stuff

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.460
like this-- going
up to Alaska, we

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.740
went out for a day on the boats.

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:52.700
And got to see the
different types of fishing

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:54.290
that they did up there.

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:57.100
And it was incredible
to actually see

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:59.890
the people who are-- I mean,
this is their livelihood.

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:06.140
And the whole town of Juneau,
pretty much, is salmon crazy.

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:08.245
I mean, Trevor got
a salmon tattoo.

00:31:08.245 --> 00:31:08.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:09.545 --> 00:31:12.779
Actually, three of those
chefs got salmon tattoos.

00:31:12.779 --> 00:31:13.570
TREVOR KUNK: Right.

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:14.490
Maybe the year before.

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:14.973
JILL WEITZ-SALMON: Yeah.

00:31:14.973 --> 00:31:15.326
TIM ARCHULETA: Right.

00:31:15.326 --> 00:31:15.910
JILL WEITZ-SALMON: Yeah.

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:16.470
TREVOR KUNK: Yeah.

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:18.850
TIM ARCHULETA: So like, this
is like how ingrained it is.

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:27.670
Like, there is an actual tribal
picture for a salmon up there.

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:28.870
It's part of their lives.

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:30.911
It's, kind of, like how
I go with the sustainably

00:31:30.911 --> 00:31:31.525
[INAUDIBLE].

00:31:31.525 --> 00:31:32.400
It's part of my life.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.275
It's important to me.

00:31:33.275 --> 00:31:35.030
It's how I make a living.

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:37.670
It's how I pay the bills.

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:40.370
So going up there and being
able to see the process

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:44.366
to be able to talk to the people
to see how it's processed,

00:31:44.366 --> 00:31:47.440
you know, we get all of our
salmon roe comes from Alaska.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.650
And to be able to go to
the actual processing plant

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:53.110
and see how it's
actually done, and see

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:56.470
it is there before it comes to
my restaurant was incredible.

00:31:56.470 --> 00:32:00.250
And you know, Kirk said
something about voting

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:00.940
with your fork.

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:04.650
I think that's something that's
very, very, very important.

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:09.135
Voting with your fork is--
you know, if you love salmon,

00:32:09.135 --> 00:32:10.510
and you're not
quite sure if it's

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:15.160
from a farm from
somewhere that's

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:18.890
not using sustainable
practices, don't buy it

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:19.760
if you're not sure.

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:22.630
If the fishermen can't tell you,
or the guy at the meat counter

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:25.980
can't tell you where it's
from or not quite sure,

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:29.030
it's better not to get
it, to be honest with you

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:31.170
because it's affecting
that greatly.

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:34.340
Again, 21 years, eel.

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:36.550
Eel, you used to be able
to get in abundance.

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:38.240
Now it's really hard to get.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.280
Why?

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.030
Because they are fishing
it unsustainably.

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:44.112
Bluefin tuna.

00:32:44.112 --> 00:32:46.028
We don't carry bluefin
tuna at the restaurant.

00:32:46.028 --> 00:32:47.050
People lose their minds.

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:48.891
They get so mad at me.

00:32:48.891 --> 00:32:49.890
Why don't you have toro?

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:51.940
And I said because it
comes from bluefin tuna.

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:53.330
Oh, but the stocks are back up.

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:56.240
Yeah, you can research that,
and look on the internet.

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.306
But are you sure
they're really back up?

00:32:58.306 --> 00:33:03.075
I mean, Japan has
warehouses beyond warehouses

00:33:03.075 --> 00:33:06.455
beyond warehouses
full of frozen tuna

00:33:06.455 --> 00:33:07.830
because they know,
at some point,

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:10.250
it's not going to be around.

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:12.960
And they have stockpiles
of it because they

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.780
know it's gonna be
worth a lot of money

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.710
because people want it.

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:18.280
We don't carry it.

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.030
It's not sustainable.

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:22.470
I don't want to decimate
a fish off the planet

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:26.570
because I want to serve--
because it tastes delicious.

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:29.070
Voting with your fork, I think,
is one of the coolest things

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:30.660
that I've heard at this panel.

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:34.277
And I think it's something that
we need to take very seriously.

00:33:34.277 --> 00:33:36.360
KIRK HARDCASTLE: I'd like
to add on to that really

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:40.650
quick in regards to
Alaska is that the way we

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:44.220
manage our fisheries is a
sustainable management system.

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:45.680
And yes, they do
have to get flown.

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.600
And so that's
where you, kind of,

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.100
go through the
compromise of flying.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:51.750
You realize, wow, there's
a big carbon footprint.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:53.721
Is this, like, truly
on the whole gamut

00:33:53.721 --> 00:33:54.970
of the word of sustainability.

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:57.362
It's a really green-washed
word these days.

00:33:57.362 --> 00:33:59.570
Unless you really get in
the specifics of what you're

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:01.770
looking at, you
can pick and pull

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:05.900
the definition of sustainability
out in a lot of funny ways.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:10.300
But what we mean by voting with
your fork is saying, when you

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.730
say I want to eat that
and voting with your fork,

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:16.150
I'm putting money towards
this economic resource that's

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:20.260
a management system that is
making sure that there will be

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:24.841
that fish, not for
you, not for your kids,

00:34:24.841 --> 00:34:26.215
for the great,
great grandparents

00:34:26.215 --> 00:34:28.480
and the great, great grandkids.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.639
And that's the main
goal is to make sure

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:32.770
that those fish can still
be in the river systems

00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:33.525
on your plate.

00:34:33.525 --> 00:34:34.900
And when you vote
with your fork,

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:37.760
you're saying I approve of this
system that will, hopefully,

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.949
be around much longer
than I will be.

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:46.179
And so I just ask for the
most sustainable, most wild,

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:48.389
as far as a management system
or harvesting practices

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:49.460
that you can possibly find.

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.626
That was a question that
came up in our other panel.

00:34:51.626 --> 00:34:53.040
How do we know?

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.540
How do we know
what we're buying?

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:56.139
If you, basically,
just really focus

00:34:56.139 --> 00:34:57.620
on sustainability
of the harvest,

00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:00.090
as well as if you can ask
for wild as much as you can,

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:03.050
but it does come with the
depleted stocks, as well.

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:05.490
As a gross generalization,
wild from Alaska,

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:08.040
you're doing pretty
darn well cause

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.549
it's in article eight of
the Alaska constitution.

00:35:10.549 --> 00:35:12.840
It's part of who we are, like
the American Constitution

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.550
of freedom of speech and
many other of these rights

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:18.340
that are just core to the
being of the United States

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:19.790
that are very
unique in the world.

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:22.866
Core to the being of
Alaska is in Article eight

00:35:22.866 --> 00:35:23.990
of the Alaska constitution.

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:27.980
And that is to maintain
sustainable fisheries forever.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:29.964
So that's key for us, as well.

00:35:29.964 --> 00:35:32.356
So thank you.

00:35:32.356 --> 00:35:34.340
AUDIENCE: It's really
hurting me more.

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:38.440
You can imagine what I saw with
the mining and the accidents

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:38.960
and all.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.230
British Columbia is home for us.

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:44.830
We became a family there.

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:46.330
All these things
were very important

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:47.538
when we lived there, as well.

00:35:47.538 --> 00:35:49.700
They remain important.

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:52.870
But before we get this
into, kind of, the bashing,

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:58.210
I just would like to point
out two things that, I'm sure,

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:00.690
that in the States there
are a lot of bad things

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:03.850
like this happen,
as well elsewhere.

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:07.100
And the other thing is
that I know for a fact

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:10.410
that there are a lot
of people in Canada

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:14.300
who feel the same way
and a lot of people

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:17.749
who fight really hard like
the [INAUDIBLE] Foundation.

00:36:17.749 --> 00:36:19.290
I'm sure you're in
contact with them.

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:19.940
JILL WEITZ-SALMON: Absolutely.

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:21.421
AUDIENCE: Huge respect to them.

00:36:21.421 --> 00:36:25.454
I used to work for
them on their website.

00:36:25.454 --> 00:36:27.620
But it's really, really
important what you're doing.

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:28.660
And I fully support it.

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.710
And you know, voting
with the fork,

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:34.750
we've been doing it for
the last 15 years probably.

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:38.892
Super important And
raising awareness, as well.

00:36:38.892 --> 00:36:40.100
So thank you for what you do.

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:41.308
JILL WEITZ-SALMON: Thank you.

00:36:41.308 --> 00:36:42.820
KIRK HARDCASTLE: Thank you.

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:47.260
The native groups and people
in the video are from Canada.

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:49.310
It's a big proponent
on that side.

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:51.190
It's very, very
important to us, as well.

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:55.410
And hey, you know, I got
to tell you, I love mining.

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:57.310
Are you kidding?

00:36:57.310 --> 00:36:58.680
I have this.

00:36:58.680 --> 00:36:59.320
I drive a car.

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.469
I drive a boat.

00:37:00.469 --> 00:37:01.760
And my boat is a diesel engine.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.220
And operates with
metals and copper.

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.090
And I use all the
things from mining.

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:09.260
I love mining.

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.972
Irresponsible mining is
a very different story.

00:37:11.972 --> 00:37:13.930
And it's kind of like
driving down the highway.

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:17.030
Everybody abides by
the rules of 50 to 55.

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:21.380
And anyone driving a semi
truck at 120 miles an hour,

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:23.770
that's not abiding by
the general common sense

00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:26.660
rules of safety and awareness
for a lot of other people.

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:29.450
And there are a lot of Canadians
who support that, as well.

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:32.070
It's mostly just making
sure that everybody

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:34.590
abides by the social
contract that we all

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:36.970
have with each other and
our emotional contract

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:40.264
that we have with the salmon,
as well, to live in unison.

00:37:40.264 --> 00:37:41.930
And the giving and
the receiving of what

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:46.700
salmon do for the people
is really important.

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:49.400
AUDIENCE: Yes, and just to say
that the Harper government has

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.860
done so much damage.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:54.529
And I want to end it on a
very positive note that Mr.

00:37:54.529 --> 00:37:55.320
Trudeau, like our--

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.000
KIRK HARDCASTLE: Trudeau!

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:56.810
AUDIENCE: --prime minister.

00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:57.310
Woo hoo.

00:37:57.310 --> 00:37:59.620
I'm so, hopeful.

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:02.050
And I really want it to
be a very positive thing.

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:04.760
And I'm really hoping
that he's gonna

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.490
pull off what needs to pull
off after what Harper did.

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:08.740
JILL WEITZ-SALMON: Absolutely.

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:12.990
We've been fortunate enough to
work with an incredible group

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:15.870
of folks from British Columbia,
but also with lawmakers

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:16.890
in Ottawa.

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:19.760
We've had great
meetings that have

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:23.330
folks that are filled with
that same hope, especially

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:27.550
for the region that
we're speaking to.

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:31.510
Last fall, President Obama
and Prime Minister Trudeau

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:34.380
signed the strategic
leadership agreement

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:38.560
for the Arctic region,
which incorporated

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:41.750
the awareness for
indigenous rights

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:44.690
and putting that at the
forefront of decision making,

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:48.570
especially as it relates
to environmental issues

00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:49.990
around climate and development.

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:55.530
So there are huge steps
taking place just post-Harper,

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:56.759
which are incredible.

00:38:56.759 --> 00:38:57.800
We have a long way to go.

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:01.000
But we know that
we're not gonna get

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.490
anywhere without the support
from British Columbia

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:04.120
and Canada.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.590
So we absolutely
don't intend to bash.

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:09.050
We only intend to raise
awareness for the fact

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:11.680
that business can't
continue as usual.

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:15.150
We're not under any illusion
that we're gonna stop mining.

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:18.590
But how can we ensure that the
best available technologies

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:20.910
and practices are
implemented and adhered to?

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:21.826
AUDIENCE: Fully agree.

00:39:21.826 --> 00:39:22.230
JILL WEITZ-SALMON: Yeah.

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.680
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:23.010
JILL WEITZ-SALMON: Yeah.

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:23.926
KIRK HARDCASTLE: Yeah.

00:39:23.926 --> 00:39:26.510
AUDIENCE: Can you speak a little
bit more to the relationship

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:27.880
that you guys have?

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:31.280
And I don't know if it's
specifically your campaign,

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:36.310
but the government
side of things.

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:41.190
Like, how is that relationship
with British Columbia

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:46.970
and with the future
of these mines?

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:49.990
Do you see them
all moving forward?

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:53.490
Or is there some slowdown
because of Trudeau

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:57.130
and because there is
this increased awareness.

00:39:57.130 --> 00:40:00.540
JILL WEITZ-SALMON: Yeah,
that's a really good question.

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.000
That's my sister, by the way.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:02.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:08.220
So it is a good question.

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:14.090
And I think that has been
the biggest dynamic feature

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:16.580
of our campaign efforts
is focusing primarily

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:20.200
with the state of Alaska
and the province of BC.

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.930
And some of you
may know or may not

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:25.920
know that authority lies
within the province in Canada.

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:29.300
The federal government has
authority over their fisheries.

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:31.730
But all natural resource
development and management

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:33.340
is managed at the
provincial level.

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:38.309
So there's been headway in the
sense that the state of Alaska

00:40:38.309 --> 00:40:40.850
is working really close with
the province of British Columbia

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:44.690
to, kind of, improve
transparency,

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:47.700
and correspondence,
and provide opportunity

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:52.380
for involvement, and
for the state of Alaska

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:54.950
to be involved in the
permitting process.

00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:57.280
But again, you know,
Canada, they only

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:02.330
have to listen if
they want to, rather.

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:06.117
But at the same time
while this is happening,

00:41:06.117 --> 00:41:07.700
we have different
agreements happening

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:10.810
at the federal level and
different regulatory agencies

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:13.210
saying, well, we could do
this, and we could do that.

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:16.590
And again, people
are talking about it.

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:19.410
We have to remind ourselves
not to be discouraged

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:21.600
because this is part
of a conversation that

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.950
wasn't two years ago.

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:25.430
So people are talking about it.

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:27.940
And as we know in
bureaucratic systems,

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:30.150
it takes awhile to
get things going.

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:34.120
But on the other side
to that, while we're

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.360
having these conversations,
British Columbia

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:40.000
is continuing to permit
and develop these projects.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.700
For example, you
guys saw in that film

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:44.420
the Mount Polley
mine disaster that

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:46.810
happened in Central
British Columbia

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:49.620
into the Fraser River Watershed.

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:53.820
That same mine proprietor,
Imperial Metals,

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:58.080
was authorized three
days after expert panel

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.720
review had suggested that
business can't go on as usual.

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.640
You can't have wet tailings.

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:03.720
You have to do this.

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:06.380
You have to do that.

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:09.120
And the BC government
said, OK, we're gonna stop.

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:13.290
We're going to try to improve
our practices and enforcement.

00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:15.580
But under the table,
three days later,

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:18.650
authorized Imperial Metals
to open a much bigger mine

00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:20.930
in the headwaters of
transboundary river,

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:23.000
the Stikine River.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.940
And so its practices
such as that

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:28.930
that make us weary of while
we're doing all these things

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:30.930
and making headways
in certain areas,

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:33.990
they're still pushing
straight ahead.

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:37.040
So it's just continuing
to raise awareness.

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:40.110
It's continuing to
target elected leaders

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:44.250
to write your elected leaders
and suggest that it's not

00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:45.340
just about salmon.

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:47.540
It's if we're gonna
do this, if we're

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:52.140
gonna continue to develop and
extract natural resources,

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:53.410
we're in the 21st century.

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:54.620
We have to do it right.

00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:59.414
We have to ensure that that
is going into consideration.

00:42:59.414 --> 00:43:00.830
KIRK HARDCASTLE:
An add-on to that

00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:05.930
one is that when that dam
collapsed and broke free,

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:10.000
that same structural engineer
company style of making dams

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.330
is what my thing is
that, OK, we know this.

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:16.420
We don't drive pintos
anymore, people, you know.

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.470
Let's stop putting gas
tanks in the back of cars

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:21.390
because rear ends can explode
a car with a family in it.

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:23.920
Those same types of
engineering disasters

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:25.580
aren't being
mitigated and changed

00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:28.910
for the next stage of mining
production and development.

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:30.930
Like I said, I'm
all for the mines.

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:36.880
But why build a mining dam that
we know that style breaks free?

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:40.040
And they're permitting to
proceed with that same style

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:43.990
into multiple different
mines across North America.

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:48.300
Why not build a dam that you
know is like the Hoover Dam?

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:50.680
Well it's gonna hold
for a long time.

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:53.080
You know, and just mitigate
that type of thing.

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.240
Like Google, you don't
put out a product

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:57.960
that fails in a couple
of months and grossly.

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.190
Like, it makes big
time headlines.

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:00.830
Right?

00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:02.246
You want to put
out something that

00:44:02.246 --> 00:44:05.060
can maintain it's resiliency
in the marketplace,

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:07.550
or structural engineering, or
electrical engineering that

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:10.370
can last for a long, long,
long time, not just something

00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:12.710
that you really know
it's gonna break.

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:14.620
And oh, it broke last week.

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:17.570
So let's fix it, and
try and improve upon it.

00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:19.660
So that's one of the main
parts with these dams

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:22.370
is that they want to build
the same style of dam

00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:26.020
and just say, hey, let's make
a better integrated network

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:28.890
matrix built in the
superstructure of the dam

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:30.571
itself.

00:44:30.571 --> 00:44:33.130
AUDIENCE: Is their
model for success

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:37.890
or any sort of
measure or negotiation

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:40.070
that you're really
optimistic about that you can

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:43.464
see as being a real solution?

00:44:43.464 --> 00:44:44.880
JILL WEITZ-SALMON:
Yeah, like what

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:47.040
does winning look like to us?

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.426
Yeah, absolutely.

00:44:48.426 --> 00:44:51.510
My boss asks me
that all the time.

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:54.580
I think that,
first and foremost,

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:57.940
like Kirk was just
mentioning, this wet tailings

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:01.540
design that they've been
operating and approving

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:04.450
throughout British Columbia,
we know that it won't last.

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:06.696
I mean, some of these
pictures might suggest,

00:45:06.696 --> 00:45:08.070
but for any of
you that have been

00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:10.940
to southeast Alaska or
British Columbia, it's rugged,

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:11.830
steep mountains.

00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:12.840
And it's wet.

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:16.150
It's a temperate rain forest.

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:20.050
You're just setting yourself
up for failure in that regard.

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:23.661
So as far as engineering and
structure of the mining goes,

00:45:23.661 --> 00:45:26.160
it's been recommended that they
do dry stack tailings, which

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.140
is a different type
of tailing storage,

00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:33.110
which, seemingly,
it's more contained.

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:36.380
And you don't have this
big, man-made, earthen dam

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:41.430
that is set to fail
and flood and break.

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:43.190
So that's one component of it.

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:49.300
But again, as I
mentioned earlier,

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:52.420
we want to have a
part in determining

00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:56.380
what the development
looks like moving forward,

00:45:56.380 --> 00:46:00.170
and how these environmental
regulations are strengthened

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:04.310
again, and how indigenous
rights and how indigenous

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:08.990
governments take a huge part
and contribute a huge part

00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:11.800
to that process.

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:14.920
And so I think it's, kind
of, all encompassing as far

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:16.060
as what it looks like.

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:18.580
It's ensuring that
this region that

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:21.030
is rich in natural
resources, including salmon,

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:27.050
including minerals, is developed
in as sustainable a way

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:27.870
as we can do.

00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:32.310
So without getting
too specific, that's

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:35.027
just the broad landscape.

00:46:35.027 --> 00:46:36.860
You know, there have
been a bunch of reports

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:39.109
that have come out, especially
in the last six months,

00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:42.050
from British Columbia's own
auditor general suggesting

00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:44.200
that British Columbia is
failing on all accounts

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:48.970
to enforce their permits and
protect their environment.

00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:51.290
You know, their own auditor
general is suggesting that.

00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:53.831
There have been economists that
have done financial assurance

00:46:53.831 --> 00:46:57.750
reports that are suggesting
tax payers are liable.

00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:03.010
$1.5 million in debt
as far as taxpayers

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:05.690
accountability to pay off
fines for mining companies.

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:08.280
And that's just in this
region, just this region

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.800
of British Columbia, not the
entire province as a whole.

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:14.090
So it's things like that where
building awareness to that

00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:16.760
and ensuring that these
practices are going to continue

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:20.040
or this industry is
going to continue.

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.860
But let's make sure that these
best practices are actually

00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:24.300
adhered to.

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:25.356
Yep.

00:47:25.356 --> 00:47:27.790
AUDIENCE: For Taku
River Reds, is

00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:30.230
mining one of the biggest
issues you see going forward?

00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:32.720
Or could you speak to other
problems you might have,

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:34.960
like climate change
in warmer waters?

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:37.870
KIRK HARDCASTLE: Oh, you
ask awesome questions.

00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:40.550
Can I be here for
a couple hours?

00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:47.030
I would say for
Taku River Reds, I

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:49.090
would say our greatest
hurdle that's coming up

00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:52.100
is hoping that all of
you vote with your fork.

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:55.100
To me, it's about
marginalization of an industry.

00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:57.898
I would like to see all
of you vote with your fork

00:47:57.898 --> 00:47:59.356
rather than sitting
back going, oh,

00:47:59.356 --> 00:48:00.400
what are the
government's doing here?

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:02.233
What are the conservation
groups doing here?

00:48:02.233 --> 00:48:04.970
You are more powerful than
any government out there.

00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:08.110
You are more powerful than any
conservation group out there.

00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:11.880
You saying I support salmon,
I support wild seafood,

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:15.280
I support sustainability
is the most powerful thing

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.900
anyone can ever do.

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:19.577
And that is by voting with
your fork in those directions.

00:48:19.577 --> 00:48:21.910
My example that I used up in
the wine country last night

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:23.684
is, so I grew up
in Sonoma County.

00:48:23.684 --> 00:48:25.600
For those of you who
don't know, Sonoma County

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:27.270
built San Francisco.

00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:28.870
The natural resources
that were there,

00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:30.330
it was the redwoods,
the timber industry.

00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:31.440
You could drop one
tree, and you could

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:33.290
build an entire
neighborhood with one tree.

00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:35.373
So the timber industry and
the pebble mines there.

00:48:35.373 --> 00:48:38.240
The gravel there built the
streets of San Francisco.

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:40.800
The trees built the
buildings of San Francisco.

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:43.020
And the cobblestone
streets, the cobblestones

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:44.570
came from my backyards.

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:48.950
So those places were zoned for
natural resource extraction

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:51.070
at the cost of salmon habitat.

00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:53.130
What happened was
the marginalization

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:57.280
of those industries, those
kind of deregulated industries,

00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.590
those industries
became marginalized

00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:01.550
because another industry
came in and said

00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:04.480
it's more important to us
to have this new industry.

00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:05.890
Guess what that is?

00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:07.740
Wine.

00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:09.820
You voted with your cork.

00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:11.120
You voted with your fork.

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:14.140
You chose something else
out there that you think,

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:16.410
as a people, not waiting
for the government

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:18.950
to decide, not for tree huggers
to say quit cutting down

00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:20.610
the redwoods, but
you, as a people,

00:49:20.610 --> 00:49:23.700
decided that we want to support
another style of industry

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:25.070
that's in the exact same place.

00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:27.287
I grew up in a timber
town in families.

00:49:27.287 --> 00:49:29.620
I mean, my friends families
were all part of the timber.

00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:32.700
And they had the skill set of
industrial, zoned industrial,

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:34.740
truck drivers, and all
of a sudden someone

00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:37.350
says, well, you can cut down
a tree, and get $20 an hour.

00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:39.677
Or you can work for the wine
industry for $60 an hour

00:49:39.677 --> 00:49:42.010
because people are willing
to vote with their fork, vote

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:43.140
with a cork.

00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:45.310
You can marginalize
an industry by you

00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:48.587
as individuals out there on what
you buy, and what you support,

00:49:48.587 --> 00:49:50.170
and the emotions and
passions that you

00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:52.044
bring to it by going to
restaurants like this

00:49:52.044 --> 00:49:53.600
and making those requests.

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.210
So that's what I
see is our greatest

00:49:55.210 --> 00:50:04.080
hurdle is to empower the public
with the seafood consumption.

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:09.400
Let's see, in
regards to the mines,

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:12.060
I try to think
positive in other ways.

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:14.190
But yes, mines are
definitely, without a doubt,

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:16.700
there's an issue in
some of those regards.

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:19.180
The Taku is-- you probably
saw in the video--

00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:23.420
it is one of the largest,
most healthy, diverse

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:26.524
watershed ecosystems in all
of North America because

00:50:26.524 --> 00:50:27.940
of the genetic
structures that are

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:30.440
built within the salmon
and other species habitats

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:31.140
in there.

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:33.700
AUDIENCE: i understand the
voting with your fork part.

00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:35.158
And I think that's
super important.

00:50:35.158 --> 00:50:37.646
But I have friends who
are fishermen in Alaska.

00:50:37.646 --> 00:50:40.020
And a lot of them haven't been
catching as much as usual.

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:42.260
And so it doesn't matter
if we vote for our fork

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:43.220
if there aren't anymore salmon.

00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:43.820
KIRK HARDCASTLE: Right.

00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:45.570
There will always be
salmon in the future.

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:47.050
They will shut
our fisheries down

00:50:47.050 --> 00:50:49.500
before they extirpate
the species itself.

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:50.850
That's unique in Alaska.

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:53.520
They do not manage their
fisheries for my pocketbook

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.270
or for your restaurants.

00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:58.020
They manage the fisheries
in Alaska-- under Article 8,

00:50:58.020 --> 00:50:59.760
we manage the fisheries
for the future.

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:01.160
We fish for the future.

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:03.990
You will never in theory,
unless something dramatically

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:07.160
happens weird, but you
can't extirpate and exhaust

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:10.130
the resource there through
the management system.

00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:12.930
So under climate change,
if the fish do decline,

00:51:12.930 --> 00:51:14.480
they shut down our fishing days.

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:17.259
So in the Taku
system, I only fish

00:51:17.259 --> 00:51:19.300
Sunday, Monday and Tuesday,
sometimes Wednesdays.

00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:22.340
If you're a smart fish,
and you're a Taku salmon,

00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:26.060
you only swim up there on
Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:27.650
Also, they manage
our gear for when we

00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:28.910
do put our gear in the water.

00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:31.710
They manage our gear
to not catch fish.

00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:38.930
So King salmon typically
swim 40 feet and under.

00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:40.840
So guess how
shallow our gear is?

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:42.400
30 feet.

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.300
Our gear is also designed
so that king salmon

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:45.482
will bounce off the net.

00:51:45.482 --> 00:51:46.690
Pardon me, it's not designed.

00:51:46.690 --> 00:51:49.780
It's managed to allow these
fish to hit it, and bounce off

00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:50.280
and swim.

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.070
If there's a
specific run of fish,

00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:55.040
they will manage it so they can
actually swim through or gear.

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:57.234
So we're targeting
a specific person.

00:51:57.234 --> 00:51:58.900
Like for instance,
if I were to do this,

00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:00.441
I would say I'm
gonna set my gear out

00:52:00.441 --> 00:52:02.860
to only catch people
in pink dresses, OK,

00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:04.180
or guys with beards.

00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:05.000
It's that targeted.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.940
Our bycatch in an entire
year, an entire season,

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:09.230
is maybe one bird.

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:10.690
One bird.

00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:12.770
That's how targeted
the way we fish.

00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:15.439
So fishermen, by nature,
you have some friends.

00:52:15.439 --> 00:52:16.730
I'm not your typical fisherman.

00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:18.970
Fisherman, I'm supposed
to complain a lot.

00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:21.460
You know, I'm supposed to be
like damn this and damn that.

00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:23.840
I try to see the more positive
side of how fortunate I

00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:26.970
am to be able to have
an abundance of seafood

00:52:26.970 --> 00:52:29.480
to be able to harvest and
share with other people.

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:31.730
So the management system
will keep it so that we still

00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:32.920
do have fish there.

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:35.730
Climate change is a
big issue, for sure.

00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:38.760
The biggest difference I have
on that with climate change

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:41.640
has been the meat quality,
and the fluctuations

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.407
in meat quality, and the
changes in the styles of runs.

00:52:44.407 --> 00:52:46.490
But the abundance of species
that have the ability

00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:48.198
to reproduce and stay
within the carrying

00:52:48.198 --> 00:52:50.970
capacity of a
harvestable allotment,

00:52:50.970 --> 00:52:53.060
I think we're doing
really well in that.

00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:57.030
Climate change is
changing, obviously,

00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:59.285
the meat quality more
than anything else, as far

00:52:59.285 --> 00:52:59.910
as a big thing.

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:04.104
So climate change is an
issue, but not too much.

00:53:04.104 --> 00:53:05.520
AUDIENCE: Following
up on that, do

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:08.580
we need to reframe
this conversation

00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:13.040
as a need for regenerative
practices versus sustainable

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:13.860
practices?

00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:15.339
Or are we not there yet?

00:53:15.339 --> 00:53:16.880
KIRK HARDCASTLE:
Resilient practices.

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:20.310
So one of the key
things is that you

00:53:20.310 --> 00:53:23.050
need to have a
sustainable management

00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:26.630
bureaucratic system to allow
for resilient business practices

00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:27.250
to exist.

00:53:27.250 --> 00:53:29.270
Resiliency in business
or management--

00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:31.390
any kind of management
system-- resiliency

00:53:31.390 --> 00:53:34.250
can't happen at the large
level bureaucratic system

00:53:34.250 --> 00:53:36.530
because those types
of systems can't

00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:38.170
move in more fast
enough from climate

00:53:38.170 --> 00:53:39.870
change, economic
change, volatility

00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:42.740
in distribution of
natural resources.

00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:44.190
So you have to
have the stability

00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:47.370
in a bureaucratic system
of sustainable management

00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:51.010
to allow for private
businesses to work resiliency.

00:53:51.010 --> 00:53:53.950
So as we were mentioned
about sustainability,

00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:55.840
there's market driven
sustainability and

00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:57.860
institutionalized
sustainability.

00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:00.290
Alaska is not market
driven sustainability,

00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:01.450
as Tim was saying.

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:03.970
We are not market driven
sustainability in Alaska.

00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:06.527
We are institutionalized
sustainability.

00:54:06.527 --> 00:54:08.360
It's not a green watch
stamp to put on there

00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:10.910
for selling a product.

00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:14.400
So the sustainable layer
of our bureaucratic system

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:18.280
and institutionalized system
allows for resilient business

00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:20.740
practices to happen and move
in more for the fluctuations

00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:22.370
of the marketplace.

00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:23.870
So I agree with
what you had to say.

00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:26.160
But that's one of the
unique parts of what Alaska

00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:29.250
has over the rest of the world.

00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:30.170
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:32.140
I'm gonna go back to the mining.

00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:37.390
My question is,
have the innovations

00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:42.300
been developed-- engineering,
technology, whatever-- for what

00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:45.060
you would trust in
a mining operation?

00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:48.631
Or are we still
trying to invent that?

00:54:48.631 --> 00:54:50.550
JILL WEITZ-SALMON: Absolutely.

00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:54.260
I think that there
are-- I mean, that's

00:54:54.260 --> 00:54:56.790
kind of a hard question
to answer in the sense

00:54:56.790 --> 00:55:00.940
that there are so many different
scales of mines, right.

00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:03.890
And we're talking about
large scale, open pit mines.

00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:06.740
We're not talking about
smaller scale mines

00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:08.450
like we have throughout
southeast Alaska

00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:13.030
that have dry stacked
tailings, have

00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:15.630
different mining
life in the sense

00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:18.460
that some are 15 to 20 years.

00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:21.430
Some are 30 to 40 years, where
these large scale mines are

00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:24.400
failing at 14 to
17 years, you know,

00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:28.580
and set for longer lifespans.

00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:32.540
I think that there is
the technology out there.

00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:34.820
And it comes down
to the government

00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:38.230
requiring that these
companies implement that.

00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:41.910
And it's an economic choice.

00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:44.500
It's these mining companies
deciding whether or not

00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:48.350
they want to put forth
the money to ensure

00:55:48.350 --> 00:55:53.610
that health and safety come
first prior to economic profit.

00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:56.520
And so yeah, I can
say confidently

00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:00.620
that those
technologies do exist.

00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:03.920
And that's what we're advocating
for, that they are implemented.

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:06.470
And at this point, it's kind
of up to the mining company

00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:12.094
whether or not they want to
follow through with that, yep.

00:56:12.094 --> 00:56:15.169
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] example
of large scale [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:19.161 --> 00:56:22.800
JILL WEITZ-SALMON: Not to the
scale of these mines, yeah.

00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:25.370
KIRK HARDCASTLE: But we have
some very small scale mines

00:56:25.370 --> 00:56:28.480
that are very successful
within salmon habitat that

00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:29.895
do a fantastic job, for sure.

00:56:29.895 --> 00:56:31.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
scale that?

00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:32.560
KIRK HARDCASTLE: What
does winning look like?

00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:34.550
We have plenty of
winning mines, for sure,

00:56:34.550 --> 00:56:35.872
in Alaska that do very well.

00:56:35.872 --> 00:56:36.830
JILL WEITZ-SALMON: Yep.

00:56:36.830 --> 00:56:39.460
And the fact that these
mines have to be large scale

00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:42.200
is the fact that the ore
quality in these regions, it's

00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:44.300
really low grade ore.

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:47.610
So they have to extract
a ton of the earth

00:56:47.610 --> 00:56:49.500
in order to get profit.

00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:53.154
So that's what makes it a
lot messier than practices

00:56:53.154 --> 00:56:55.570
that we have throughout Alaska,
for example, that are done

00:56:55.570 --> 00:56:57.520
on a smaller operation scale.

00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:00.520
Yeah, so she was
asking is it dependent

00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:02.850
upon the scale of those mines.

00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:09.570
Is it messier, or is it harder
to implement those better

00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:12.540
practices because of the scale
as opposed to the smaller

00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:18.000
operations and, thus, it's
more affordable for them

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.420
to implement best technologies.

00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:21.960
Is that, kind of,
what you were asking?

00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:24.282
Or did I answer it, kind
of, within another question?

00:57:24.282 --> 00:57:25.656
AUDIENCE: Well
I'm just wondering

00:57:25.656 --> 00:57:28.087
if they don't do it because they
can't or because they wouldn't

00:57:28.087 --> 00:57:29.000
be making as much money.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.140
JILL WEITZ-SALMON:
Yeah, they wouldn't

00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:32.431
be doing it because they
won't be making as much money.

00:57:32.431 --> 00:57:33.240
Absolutely right.

00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:34.840
They absolutely can afford it.

00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:37.800
You know, these smaller,
like, junior companies

00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:41.940
are adhering to these better
available technologies

00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:43.510
than these larger
operations that

00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:46.590
want to extract as much as they
can, pull as much as they can,

00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:47.465
and get out of there.

00:57:47.465 --> 00:57:49.807
AUDIENCE: So as a
chef because you're

00:57:49.807 --> 00:57:51.390
kind of working with
the end consumer,

00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:53.389
right, like ourselves
going to your restaurants,

00:57:53.389 --> 00:57:54.057
enjoying food.

00:57:54.057 --> 00:57:55.890
I think you alluded a
little bit like people

00:57:55.890 --> 00:57:59.180
going to a restaurant looking
for a sustainable restaurant.

00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:01.100
But that message
may not necessarily

00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:03.540
be what true
sustainability means.

00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:07.850
So how is the chef community is
working with someone like Jill,

00:58:07.850 --> 00:58:09.280
like the fishermen, Kirk?

00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:11.710
Like, how do you guys do
that within your community?

00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:15.620
And also, how do you
translate or educate and share

00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:17.880
that knowledge with
your consumer that comes

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:20.420
to your restaurant, et cetera?

00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:21.844
TREVOR KUNK: So
can I talk first?

00:58:21.844 --> 00:58:22.760
TIM ARCHULETA: Please.

00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:24.740
TREVOR KUNK: So I think what you
just said was very important.

00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:26.730
You said educate
because we never want

00:58:26.730 --> 00:58:28.330
to tell a guest how to eat.

00:58:28.330 --> 00:58:31.430
We're never gonna tell
them to do x, y, and z.

00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:33.610
But what we can do
is we can educate.

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:36.410
And we can train our
staff, inform them,

00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:40.120
and have them then relay that
information to the guest.

00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:41.760
Sometimes it's
really, really easy.

00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:43.780
Sometimes it's very,
very difficult.

00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:47.530
And it really also
depends where you are.

00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:49.280
I mean, whether you're
in the Napa Valley,

00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:51.238
whether you're in San
Francisco, whether you're

00:58:51.238 --> 00:58:53.930
in New York, or New Orleans.

00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:55.526
It takes time.

00:58:55.526 --> 00:58:57.600
And something that I've
been, kind of, thinking

00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:59.190
about even before
I went to Alaska

00:58:59.190 --> 00:59:03.371
is-- and this, kind of,
goes back to my childhood--

00:59:03.371 --> 00:59:04.870
don't get mad at
me when I say this,

00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:06.970
but I don't like salmon, OK.

00:59:06.970 --> 00:59:08.350
I don't like salmon.

00:59:08.350 --> 00:59:08.380
KIRK HARDCASTLE:
Totally understand.

00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:09.540
TREVOR KUNK: But listen.

00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:12.570
So the reason I don't like
it is because, for me, I've

00:59:12.570 --> 00:59:16.400
been eating the wrong thing
for the past 20, 25, 30 years.

00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:19.310
And it's farmed raised garbage.

00:59:19.310 --> 00:59:22.250
And over the years-- and when
I say over the years, starting

00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:24.034
about eight, nine, 10
years ago, and this

00:59:24.034 --> 00:59:25.950
happened to be where I
was working in New York

00:59:25.950 --> 00:59:28.160
City-- that's when we started.

00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:31.782
We didn't carry salmon unless
it was wild king salmon.

00:59:31.782 --> 00:59:33.490
And if wild king salmon
wasn't available,

00:59:33.490 --> 00:59:35.610
then we would bring
in sockeye or coho.

00:59:35.610 --> 00:59:38.810
But that salmon is a lot
different than the farm salmon

00:59:38.810 --> 00:59:41.310
that we're all used to eating.

00:59:41.310 --> 00:59:44.140
So I love salmon if it's wild.

00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:45.940
If it's the other
notion that people

00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:49.050
have of what salmon is,
which is super fatty, super

00:59:49.050 --> 00:59:56.052
thick, and just, kind of, odd in
color, I don't like that stuff.

00:59:56.052 --> 00:59:58.190
But going back to
the educational part,

00:59:58.190 --> 00:59:59.909
like if you have a
guest that's coming in

00:59:59.909 --> 01:00:02.200
and they've been coming in
for five years, or 10 years,

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:04.325
and they've been ordering
that same kind of salmon,

01:00:04.325 --> 01:00:06.625
it's really hard
to wean them away.

01:00:06.625 --> 01:00:08.500
So you just have to,
kind of, take it slowly.

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:11.600
And that's when, again, you
have a very well-informed staff

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:14.170
being able to share with
the guests, like, well,

01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:17.800
why don't you have salmon
like you did six months ago?

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:20.380
And the reason is, well,
we're sourcing locally.

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:22.410
We're sourcing seasonally.

01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:24.230
We don't want to buy
it from South America.

01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:25.938
We don't want to buy
it from New Zealand.

01:00:25.938 --> 01:00:27.680
We want to support
the Alaskan fishery.

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:30.420
And right now, what is available
in five or six months out

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:32.310
of the year is gonna
be sockeye or coho,

01:00:32.310 --> 01:00:35.010
and on a more seldom
occasion, king.

01:00:35.010 --> 01:00:36.888
AUDIENCE: Anything to add?

01:00:36.888 --> 01:00:38.665
TIM ARCHULETA: I
don't know if anybody

01:00:38.665 --> 01:00:39.560
have been to my restaurant.

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:39.840
KIRK HARDCASTLE: Woo hoo.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:40.680
JILL WEITZ SALMON:
I have, woo hoo.

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:41.971
KIRK HARDCASTLE: Mind boggling!

01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:43.057
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:43.057 --> 01:00:44.140
Just putting it out there.

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:46.060
TIM ARCHULETA: We're the exact
opposite of what Trevor said.

01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:47.606
We do tell people how to eat.

01:00:47.606 --> 01:00:49.430
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:52.020
I have a whole mural, actually,
in the restaurant dedicated

01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:54.117
to how to eat sushi properly.

01:00:54.117 --> 01:00:56.860
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:56.860 --> 01:01:00.090
Yes, I am a control freak,
A. But B, also, it's

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:03.780
to help you enjoy the
product the best way.

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:11.760
For us at our restaurant, if you
mix a bunch of wasabi, and soy

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.900
sauce, and completely,
you know, don't

01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:18.180
drown your food-- [INAUDIBLE]
or the commercials used

01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:20.660
to have-- you're
not going to taste

01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:25.380
the hard work that this guy
does when he fishes and does

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:30.150
everything he does to keep the
salmon as awesome as possible.

01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:34.350
So for us, we do
educate you, regardless

01:01:34.350 --> 01:01:36.790
if you want to or not.

01:01:36.790 --> 01:01:38.370
You're gonna get educated.

01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:40.540
You know, I fight
with customers.

01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:43.040
I've throw customers
out of the restaurant

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:47.620
for arguing with soy
sauce and wasabi.

01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:49.760
There's a proper amount.

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.465
But again, it's all
about education.

01:01:55.465 --> 01:01:57.340
Something I wanted to
mention earlier-- this,

01:01:57.340 --> 01:02:00.380
kind of, goes with it too
in educating-- seafood

01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:02.956
shouldn't be cheap.

01:02:02.956 --> 01:02:04.740
You know, we have
this thing we're

01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:06.890
we want to be able to provide.

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:11.260
Everybody should have access
to everything, right, which

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:12.810
a lot of the stuff, it's true.

01:02:12.810 --> 01:02:15.220
We should have access
to certain things.

01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:17.660
But seafood is one
of those things where

01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:21.370
I don't know if it should
be accessible to everybody,

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:25.520
and especially at a low price.

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:28.210
It should be more expensive
because the more expensive

01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:31.690
it is, then we're not
actually consuming as much.

01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:35.620
We're thinking twice about
what we're actually eating.

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:40.730
If we all of a sudden stop
eating chicken and everyone

01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:42.670
goes to a seafood
diet, it's gonna

01:02:42.670 --> 01:02:45.230
be really hard to be able
to sustain that to be

01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:47.530
able to keep up with that.

01:02:47.530 --> 01:02:50.319
And we're on the
more expensive side.

01:02:50.319 --> 01:02:52.110
I think we're a great
value for what we do.

01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:54.270
We carry very high end product.

01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:56.400
People complain how expensive
we are all the time.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.415
And for me, it's
educating and saying,

01:02:58.415 --> 01:03:00.150
yeah, that's true
because I'm paying

01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:03.837
top dollar for my seafood.

01:03:03.837 --> 01:03:04.920
I'm paying a lot of money.

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:08.280
If you actually knew how much,
per pound, my fish cost me,

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:11.780
it would blow your mind.

01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:14.960
It shouldn't be something that
everybody should have access

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:15.460
to.

01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:17.590
It shouldn't be out
there for $1.99.

01:03:17.590 --> 01:03:22.370
You shouldn't be eating sushi
that costs, you know, $2 a roll

01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:24.620
because we're wiping
it off the planet

01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:26.684
with that kind of mentality.

01:03:26.684 --> 01:03:27.850
It should be more expensive.

01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:30.115
This guy should get
more per pound for his--

01:03:30.115 --> 01:03:31.240
KIRK HARDCASTLE: Thank you.

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:36.644
TIM ARCHULETA: --salmon that he
sells because, as you can see,

01:03:36.644 --> 01:03:38.560
the abundance is not
there what it used to be.

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:42.120
In California here, we
had three or four years

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:47.740
where the commercial
salmon allotment was

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:51.120
a month or two because
we are decimating

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:53.494
these fish out of the water.

01:03:53.494 --> 01:03:54.660
We need to raise our prices.

01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:57.910
We need to be really
thinking about what

01:03:57.910 --> 01:04:02.810
we're doing to the oceans
because it's a great resource.

01:04:02.810 --> 01:04:06.759
But there's not that much fish
out there for the whole world.

01:04:06.759 --> 01:04:08.550
I mean, it's also this
weird thing too now.

01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:11.347
Like, my wife's from
Flint, Michigan.

01:04:11.347 --> 01:04:12.930
When we go to Flint,
Michigan, there's

01:04:12.930 --> 01:04:16.150
four sushi restaurant
Flint, Michigan.

01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:17.910
Not that the fish isn't fresh.

01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:22.122
But just, all of a
sudden, it's everywhere.

01:04:22.122 --> 01:04:23.205
KIRK HARDCASTLE: In Flint?

01:04:23.205 --> 01:04:24.741
Yeah, I was like, of all places.

01:04:24.741 --> 01:04:26.515
TIM ARCHULETA: You
know, so we need

01:04:26.515 --> 01:04:29.030
to think about what
we're paying for it.

01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:32.221
I think that's something that
we did not talk about here.

01:04:32.221 --> 01:04:33.720
Again, it should
be something that's

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:35.906
much more expensive than it is.

01:04:35.906 --> 01:04:38.152
AUDIENCE: OK, I have been
googling your restaurant

01:04:38.152 --> 01:04:39.110
as you've been talking.

01:04:39.110 --> 01:04:40.530
And I cannot get a reservation.

01:04:40.530 --> 01:04:43.155
So what is the key to getting a
reservation at your restaurant?

01:04:43.155 --> 01:04:44.188
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:46.074 --> 01:04:47.032
TIM ARCHULETA: Oh, wow.

01:04:47.032 --> 01:04:47.830
JILL WEITZ-SALMON: You
got to go in there.

01:04:47.830 --> 01:04:48.685
I had to go in there.

01:04:48.685 --> 01:04:49.300
TIM ARCHULETA: Under the bus.

01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:50.254
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:54.679
Walk in.

01:04:54.679 --> 01:04:55.720
JILL WEITZ-SALMON: It's--

01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:58.105
TIM ARCHULETA: You might
have to wait a little bit.

01:04:58.105 --> 01:05:01.875
But we serve everything in
the whole entire restaurant.

01:05:01.875 --> 01:05:04.250
JILL WEITZ-SALMON: And they
yell at you when you walk in.

01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:04.800
It's fantastic.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.100
TIM ARCHULETA: That's
a positive yell.

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:06.600
Not a--

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:09.322
JILL WEITZ-SALMON:
Yeah, it's a welcome.

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:11.290
KIRK HARDCASTLE:
Food is my life.

01:05:11.290 --> 01:05:12.520
That's what I do.

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.260
And primarily, seafood.

01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:16.700
And I'm, kind of, picky.

01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:19.460
That's why I have some of the
finest seafood in the planet,

01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:21.280
specifically on the salmon side.

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:24.540
And I was thoroughly impressed
and didn't even flinch

01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:27.240
at the dollar signs that
was-- the greatest thing

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:29.890
that we sat down and I hope he
enjoyed it as well is, well,

01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:30.750
what would you like?

01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:33.680
And we all looked and
said chef's choice.

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.900
If you go in, please, all of you
go in at sometime in your life,

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:39.270
and request chef's choice.

01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:43.220
And just don't even think about
what you're-- it will be a life

01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:47.734
changing experience in regards
to how you approach seafood.

01:05:47.734 --> 01:05:48.900
It will change your palette.

01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:49.941
It'll change your dreams.

01:05:49.941 --> 01:05:52.640
JILL WEITZ-SALMON: Chefs are
social media addicts, I think,

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:55.610
where people are addicted
to following their lives.

01:05:55.610 --> 01:05:59.050
Taku River Reds, they
have a great website.

01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:00.980
salmonbeyondborders.org,
our website,

01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:03.160
there's a ton of
information on there.

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:06.100
Ways in which you can take
action, donate, and our film's

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:06.600
on there.

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:07.870
Share the film, et cetera.

01:06:07.870 --> 01:06:10.710
Just feel free to
scope us out further.

01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:12.210
And we'll be around
here for awhile

01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:14.240
if you guys have
questions later on.

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:15.290
Thank you.

01:06:15.290 --> 01:06:19.750
KIRK HARDCASTLE: For
me, vote with your fork.

01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:21.100
Vote with your cork.

01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:24.310
You know, and it doesn't
just go with your food.

01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:26.000
Whatever you do in
life, if you support

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.420
that style of management
system, that business,

01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:32.020
or whatever it is,
vote with your dollar.

01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:34.267
It really means a lot.

01:06:34.267 --> 01:06:36.350
Government reg-- I'm a
fisherman, so I'm like, ah,

01:06:36.350 --> 01:06:37.759
got my regulations, [GRUMBLING].

01:06:37.759 --> 01:06:39.800
Hey, in Alaska, there's
barely a single fisherman

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:42.300
that doesn't love
heavy regulations

01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:46.130
because if we extirpated and
wasted our resource in five

01:06:46.130 --> 01:06:48.110
years-- I don't
know about you guys.

01:06:48.110 --> 01:06:50.020
My mortgage is 30.

01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:51.900
And if I ran out
of money in five,

01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:53.790
I can't pay my
mortgage on anything.

01:06:53.790 --> 01:06:57.650
So to know that that resource
is out there long enough

01:06:57.650 --> 01:07:00.000
to pay my mortgage
and pay my other bills

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.200
is because people like
you vote with your fork.

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:04.030
You say, I want to
support the management

01:07:04.030 --> 01:07:06.370
system for sustainable
management systems

01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:09.290
as a governmental
institutionalized policy, not

01:07:09.290 --> 01:07:11.750
as a market driven, which a
market driven sustainability

01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:12.660
is great.

01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:15.590
But the way you can set your
government up in regulations

01:07:15.590 --> 01:07:19.020
and say we approve
of this style.

01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:21.520
You think of Alaskan
fishermen hating government,

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:22.337
hating regulations.

01:07:22.337 --> 01:07:22.920
You know what?

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:23.711
We don't hate that.

01:07:23.711 --> 01:07:25.560
We love it because it
means we can have it

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:27.560
for our great, great,
great grandchildren.

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:29.470
And we can pay our
bills, as well.

01:07:29.470 --> 01:07:31.160
And it's fantastic
for the palate.

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.320
And it tastes great.

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:35.445
TREVOR KUNK: Thank you all
very much for having us.

01:07:35.445 --> 01:07:37.184
That's it for me.

01:07:37.184 --> 01:07:38.892
TIM ARCHULETA: And
don't eat cheap sushi.

01:07:38.892 --> 01:07:40.114
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:40.114 --> 01:07:41.155
TREVOR KUNK: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:07:41.155 --> 01:07:41.904
TIM ARCHULETA: No.

01:07:41.904 --> 01:07:42.792
TREVOR KUNK: No?

01:07:42.792 --> 01:07:45.169
TIM ARCHULETA: No
buffets, please.

01:07:45.169 --> 01:07:47.460
KIRK HARDCASTLE: Oh, and
there's-- is there still more?

01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:48.330
JILL WEITZ-SALMON: Yeah,
we got a ton of salmon.

01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:48.960
TIM ARCHULETA:
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.600
KIRK HARDCASTLE: So this is
my fish that are brought here.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:52.620
It's all the pressure
bled sockeye.

01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:55.830
It's not gonna be that
bright, fatty stuff.

01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:58.560
You're gonna let the
fish speak for itself.

01:07:58.560 --> 01:07:59.630
Please, try it out.

01:07:59.630 --> 01:08:02.470
It will not taste what you
expect it to taste like.

01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:05.310
It's gonna taste like when your
feet are in the ocean beach

01:08:05.310 --> 01:08:06.070
out here.

01:08:06.070 --> 01:08:07.340
Your toes are in the
sand, and the waves

01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:08.840
are hitting and
that fresh ocean air

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:11.750
that passes through
your palate, that's

01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:13.200
what we want you to taste.

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:15.670
So please, you'll probably
never-- well hopefully,

01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:17.910
you guys will have this
as a regular menu item.

01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:19.880
But right now, it's there.

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:20.910
Please, try it out.

01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:23.360
[APPLAUSE]
