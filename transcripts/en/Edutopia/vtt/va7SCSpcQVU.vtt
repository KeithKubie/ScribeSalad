00:00:10.196 --> 00:00:13.246
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Alaska's natural
wonders have captivated visitors

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:14.426
from around the world.

00:00:15.126 --> 00:00:15.726
&gt;&gt;Whale watcher: Oh, wow!

00:00:17.196 --> 00:00:21.076
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But this spectacular last
frontier has also become center stage

00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:24.156
for the escalating drama
of global climate change.

00:00:24.246 --> 00:00:25.856
&gt;&gt;Drew: On the whole,
the world's warming up.

00:00:26.076 --> 00:00:27.416
It's warming up most in Alaska.

00:00:27.836 --> 00:00:29.856
Alaska summertime temperatures
have risen by three

00:00:29.856 --> 00:00:32.506
to five degrees Fahrenheit, and
wintertime temperatures have risen

00:00:32.506 --> 00:00:33.966
from eight to ten degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:34.046 --> 00:00:37.926
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The facts are stunning
and particularly relevant to seventh

00:00:37.926 --> 00:00:40.716
and eighth graders in this
climate change elective class

00:00:41.026 --> 00:00:43.316
at Central Middle School
in Anchorage.

00:00:43.696 --> 00:00:45.596
&gt;&gt;Drew: So one thing is, it's
really troubling our forests.

00:00:45.596 --> 00:00:47.096
It's troubling our forests for
a couple of different reasons.

00:00:47.096 --> 00:00:48.726
As you can see in this graph,

00:00:49.356 --> 00:00:52.536
forests tend to build
up dead wood and stuff--

00:00:52.536 --> 00:00:53.826
&gt;&gt;Narrator: As a junior
in high school,

00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:57.636
Drew Cason joined Alaska Youth
for Environmental Action,

00:00:57.946 --> 00:01:01.586
and co wrote the presentation he
gives to schools and other groups.

00:01:01.736 --> 00:01:05.446
&gt;&gt;Drew: This is a truly kind
of unique, in a really bad way,

00:01:05.776 --> 00:01:08.936
experience for Alaskan forests,
is to have them burn at this rate.

00:01:09.356 --> 00:01:12.426
&gt;&gt;Around the same time that Vice
President Gore was giving his

00:01:12.476 --> 00:01:15.636
presentation the movie "An
Inconvenient Truth" is based upon,

00:01:15.786 --> 00:01:19.066
we were going around Alaska and
giving a very similar presentation,

00:01:19.286 --> 00:01:21.806
focused on Alaska, to
Alaska high school students.

00:01:22.206 --> 00:01:25.266
&gt;&gt;Seventeen hundred miles of Alaska
highways are built on permafrost.

00:01:25.546 --> 00:01:27.526
As we see warming, the
permafrost is melting,

00:01:27.986 --> 00:01:30.126
and that's causing the
ground to open up holes.

00:01:30.126 --> 00:01:32.856
As we can see, some of these
roads, it costs a lot of money

00:01:33.106 --> 00:01:34.716
to fix roads all around Alaska.

00:01:34.946 --> 00:01:37.676
&gt;&gt;The idea was to get
signatures for petition,

00:01:37.676 --> 00:01:41.156
as well as to inform Alaskan
youth about this issue,

00:01:41.156 --> 00:01:42.486
and that it was important to them.

00:01:42.756 --> 00:01:43.356
&gt;&gt;All right, next slide.

00:01:44.036 --> 00:01:44.526
&gt;&gt;Ryan: The Alaska Youth

00:01:44.526 --> 00:01:47.276
for Environmental Action program
actually provides an avenue

00:01:47.276 --> 00:01:50.716
for teens not only to take the lead
on certain issues, but also do a lot

00:01:50.716 --> 00:01:54.246
of peer to peer training,
leadership and facilitation.

00:01:54.426 --> 00:01:57.746
&gt;&gt;I think the district submits
their budget in January, maybe.

00:01:58.326 --> 00:02:01.056
I heard that was the deadline, so
we're gonna try to get them to take

00:02:01.146 --> 00:02:02.696
on the institutionalized recycling.

00:02:02.696 --> 00:02:04.676
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Having a youth
led organization

00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:07.946
to really empower teenagers
to take issues

00:02:07.946 --> 00:02:10.286
into their own hands I
think is pretty remarkable.

00:02:10.466 --> 00:02:13.586
&gt;&gt;Narrator: After gathering more
than five thousand signatures

00:02:13.586 --> 00:02:18.256
from Alaska youth, Drew and
other members of AYEA traveled

00:02:18.256 --> 00:02:21.636
to Washington to express their
concerns about climate change

00:02:21.676 --> 00:02:23.086
to Senator Lisa Murkowski.

00:02:23.786 --> 00:02:26.196
&gt;&gt;Drew: We had an official
meeting with Senator Murkowski,

00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:29.436
and then directly after that,
she came out and publicly said

00:02:29.736 --> 00:02:35.626
that she thought that perhaps
there was some need for carbon tax.

00:02:35.626 --> 00:02:38.716
And of course, now she's
actually endorsed a bill

00:02:38.906 --> 00:02:40.676
that involves a cap and trade system.

00:02:41.016 --> 00:02:43.526
&gt;&gt;And so we felt very proud of
ourselves for that, 'cause we felt

00:02:43.526 --> 00:02:47.956
like it was a tangible influence on
our senator's position in Congress.

00:02:47.956 --> 00:02:50.126
I mean, that was a very
big deal for a bunch

00:02:50.126 --> 00:02:51.626
of high school kids to have done.

00:02:51.936 --> 00:02:54.656
&gt;&gt;It's tough to say, "This
was caused by global warming,"

00:02:54.656 --> 00:02:58.686
but what we can say is that the
storms have generally been stronger.

00:02:58.976 --> 00:03:00.656
&gt;&gt;Mark: They have been very active

00:03:00.806 --> 00:03:04.286
in educating not only young
people, but also adults.

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:08.496
So not only does the program talk
about the environmental issues,

00:03:09.046 --> 00:03:11.706
they talk about leadership skills,
how to build leadership skills,

00:03:11.706 --> 00:03:13.716
how to involve young
people, how to engage them.

00:03:14.116 --> 00:03:15.676
So it's a well rounded program.

00:03:15.676 --> 00:03:18.636
&gt;&gt;I encourage you guys to take the
pledge yourselves, but you can--

00:03:18.636 --> 00:03:20.986
&gt;&gt;Narrator: During each
presentation, students are invited

00:03:20.986 --> 00:03:25.496
to take personal action to combat
global warming by signing the three,

00:03:25.606 --> 00:03:28.766
two, one pledge, and doing
simple things, like switching

00:03:28.766 --> 00:03:29.956
to fluorescent light bulbs.

00:03:30.556 --> 00:03:33.106
&gt;&gt;The plan was to get six
thousand of these pledges.

00:03:33.106 --> 00:03:34.096
We're still working on it.

00:03:34.096 --> 00:03:35.866
Were up to about four
thousand right now.

00:03:35.976 --> 00:03:39.366
&gt;&gt;Brian: I'm working with some really
bright and really motivated kids

00:03:39.366 --> 00:03:42.296
in this climate change elective,
but to be able to have Drew

00:03:42.296 --> 00:03:45.166
and his brother Wiley come
and present is the difference

00:03:45.166 --> 00:03:46.786
between talking about
it and doing it.

00:03:46.786 --> 00:03:48.276
And these guys are
out there doing it.

00:03:48.276 --> 00:03:49.036
They're on the front lines.

00:03:49.216 --> 00:03:51.076
&gt;&gt;Student: Wouldn't the
rising prices of gasoline,

00:03:51.626 --> 00:03:54.416
wouldn't that make it more
efficient to like transfer

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:58.386
to more gasoline efficient
cars, such as hybrids?

00:03:58.696 --> 00:03:59.706
&gt;&gt;Brian: My students recognize

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:01.836
that these guys are just a
little bit older than them,

00:04:01.836 --> 00:04:04.886
and they're already making an impact
and effecting positive change.

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:09.066
&gt;&gt;Student: We could do something
to catch those droplets of oil

00:04:09.066 --> 00:04:10.956
that you take when
you fill up your car.

00:04:10.956 --> 00:04:12.406
&gt;&gt;Drew: So I mean,
that's a great idea.

00:04:12.846 --> 00:04:16.156
If you could make a pump that
wouldn't drip any gasoline--

00:04:16.156 --> 00:04:17.936
&gt;&gt;I think it's a problem a
lot of young people have,

00:04:17.936 --> 00:04:20.306
is they feel like maybe
their opinions don't count,

00:04:20.306 --> 00:04:21.676
or they're too young to really new.

00:04:22.076 --> 00:04:24.656
But AYEA organization offers
a lot of opportunities

00:04:24.716 --> 00:04:26.626
to get young people's voice heard.

00:04:26.626 --> 00:04:29.906
It really gives them the tools as
far as writing, as far as speaking,

00:04:29.906 --> 00:04:34.316
as far as understanding that they
matter, that they can sit in meetings

00:04:34.316 --> 00:04:38.326
with senators of the United States,
and impact them, and, you know,

00:04:38.326 --> 00:04:40.676
make a difference in whatever
they feel passionately about.

00:04:41.246 --> 00:04:43.486
&gt;&gt;Student: Maybe if we
got people to charge extra

00:04:43.486 --> 00:04:45.026
for more trashcans they put out,

00:04:45.126 --> 00:04:48.306
that maybe they would start
recycling more because of the money.

00:04:48.546 --> 00:04:50.176
&gt;&gt;Drew: Recycling,
that would be awesome.

00:04:51.616 --> 00:04:53.766
