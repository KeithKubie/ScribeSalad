&gt;&gt; From The Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.510
&gt;&gt; Please give a warm
welcome to Michael Buckley.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:31.040
[ Applause ]

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.130
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Hey.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.430
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.860
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Where
is my beanbag chair?

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.300
[laughter] This is not cool.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.290
Thanks. My name is Mike.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.800
Thank you so much for coming
out here on a rainy day and also

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.070
for sticking around until the end
for the very part of it, me, yay.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.120
[ Applause ]

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.600
You guys are so lucky.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.320
My name is Mike, and I have
written a bunch of books.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.060
One of them is called
The Sisters Grimm,

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.460
and I wrote a series called
Nerds, and I wrote a book

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.360
for teenagers called Undertow,
and I wrote a book for little,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.660
little kids called Kel
Gilligan's Daredevil Stunt Show.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.950
And I might tell you a
little bit about those books,

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.390
but first I thought I might tell
you about how I became an author.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.050
Does anyone here want to
know how I became an author?

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.480
It's a very exciting
story, it has ninjas in it.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.000
[laughter] It doesn't,
I'm just kidding.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.070
I just want you guys to like me.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.890
Like she said, I was born in
a town called Akron, Ohio.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.680
Has anyone here ever
been to Akron, Ohio?

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.560
It is the most boring
place in the whole world.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.480
The only exciting thing that ever
happened there is we invented

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.200
the zipper.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.320
Yeah, that's huge, it's huge.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.410 position:56%
We also have a race there called the
Soapbox Derby, and this is a race

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.810
where we take a small
child, put them in a box

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.850
and shove them down a steep hill.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.820
[laughter] So Akron
is fun on that day.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.610
Now when I was 16 something
really exciting happened to me,

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.260
I was reading a magazine
called Mad Magazine.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.540
Has anyone here ever
heard of Mad Magazine?

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.240
If you don't know that
magazine ask your parents.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.260
It's a very silly magazine,
lots of jokes.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.080
In the back of the magazine
there was a contest,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.290
it was a joke writing contest and
they promised a very big prize.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.070
And I thought I'd like
a very big prize.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.700
So I decided to write a
joke and I mailed it in,

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.490
and about two months
later I got a letter back

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.870
and they told me I
had won the prize.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.950
Would you guys like
to hear the joke?

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.250
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.160 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: All right, why
did the monkey fall out of the tree?

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.510
Because it was dead.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:02.310
[ Laughter ]

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.710 position:56%
I don't know, and I won the contest.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.640
No one else saw the ad, I guess.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.980
But I did win the contest and I got
-- I did get a really big prize,

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.870 position:56%
but it didn't come in a box, it came
on a plane because it was a person.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.060
They actually sent me a very
funny person to hang out with

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.770
for a whole day and his
name was Eddie Murphy.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.700
Now you guys might know Eddie,
he's the donkey in Shrek

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.020
and he's the dragon in Mulan,
and he's the dad in a lot

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.920
of very embarrassing movies.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.100
And he's in a lot of movies, I'm
hoping your parents are good enough

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.150
to never have let you see.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.250
But when I was a kid he was on a
show called Saturday Night Live

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.390
and I was a very big fan.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.340 position:56%
So Eddie came to Akron, like I
said, and we hung out the whole day,

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.210
but we were in Akron so
there was nothing to do.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.940
So we went to the mall and we
made fun of people all day long.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.830 position:56%
[laughter] It was the best day ever.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.630 position:56%
And then we went to the Olive Garden
and we had spaghetti and meatballs.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.830
And Eddie looked at me and he said,
you know, you're pretty funny,

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.650
you know when I was 16 I
started doing standup comedy

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.090
in New York City, maybe
you should do that, too.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.990
And I thought, that
sounds interesting.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.270
So when Eddie went back to
New York City I went to all

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.530
of the comedy clubs in
Akron, which was one.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.780 position:56%
And I said I want to be a comedian,
and they said, son, how old are you,

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.200
you've got to be 18
to be a comedian?

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.470
And I thought about
my mom and my grandma

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.790
and how they'd always
told me never to lie,

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.450
never to tell a fib,
especially to an adult.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:01.960
So I looked at the man and I
said I'm 18, and he believed it.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.930
Because I think it's
okay to lie to people

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:11.070
if they're too dumb
to know the truth.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.480
[laughter] That's not a very
nice thing, don't repeat that.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.380
I give bad advice.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.280
I'm not a very good role
model for children or adults.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.810 position:56%
So I started doing standup, and
this is where I learned how to write

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:31.160
because a joke is a lot like a
little story, there's a set-up

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.170
like a premise to the joke, and
then there's a rising tension

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.640
where you don't know
what's going to happen,

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.620
and then if you've written a good
joke there's a surprise twist

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.680
ending, just like in a story.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.090
And that is when I began

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.020
to understand books I
think a little bit more.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.900 position:56%
So I started writing my own jokes
and I performed all over the country

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.840
with a bunch of comedians that
hopefully you have never heard

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.460
of because they are naughty.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.730
And then I went to college
and I studied writing,

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.040
and I did some other things.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.810
I was in a punk rock band,

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.220
I had really long hair,
it went down to here.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.570
I was hot, yeah.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.980
[laughter] I was.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.630
Afterwards I went to --
I graduated from college,

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.300
I went to a place called New York
City, maybe you've heard of it.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.110 position:56%
And I was an intern on a
television show called The Late Show

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:34.050
with David Letterman, and I was
one of David Letterman's interns.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.750
Now if you've never seen that
show it was a talk show and lots

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.020
of famous people came on all the
time, lots of glamorous people,

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.780
like the first day I was
there I got to meet Beyonce.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.080
She's pretty.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:52.770
And then the next day
I met George Clooney.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.460
He's pretty, too.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.760
[laughter] But my job
was not very glamorous.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.260
One of the things I had to
do on the show was take care

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.130
of David Letterman's dog.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.690
Dave brought his big Golden
Retriever to work every day.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:15.090
And Golden Retrievers are usually
happy animals, but not Dave's.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.200
Dave's dog was a big fat
yellow meatball of rage.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:26.730
It would bite me, it would bite
old people, it would bite children,

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:33.990
it would bite trees,
it would bite itself.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.400
[laughter] You know you're
angry if you bite yourself.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:42.140
But every once in awhile
if I wasn't being murdered

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.950
by that dog they would let
me write a joke for the show,

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:50.080
and I would write my joke on a
piece of paper and I'd hand it

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.640
to David Letterman and
then I'd go up on the stage

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.880
and I'd hide behind the curtain
and I would watch the audience.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.310
Now I had been telling jokes in
front of audiences for a long time

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.110
by then, but for some reason
this would make me very nervous

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:06.180
and I think it was because this
audience was really, really big.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:10.570
Like we had about 500 people in the
studio audience, but we also had

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:14.710
about 10 million people watching at
home, so it would make me nervous

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.830
and I would hide behind the stage.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.480
And I would hear Dave tell
the joke and I would look out

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.230
and I would see a reaction
come over people.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:28.200
If it got a big laugh their
eyes would get really big

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:35.240
and their mouths would open and
their faces would turn pink,

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:41.490
and they would rock back and forth
in their chairs, and they'd go, ha,

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:52.460
ha, ha, ha, ah, oh,
that hurt, oh, oh, ow,

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.420
ooh, I wet myself, I'm sorry.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:09:03.170
[laughter] And I would look out
there and I'd go, I did that,

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:08.100
I made those people do that,
I'm funny joke writer man.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:13.140
The worst superhero ever, but
it still felt really cool.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:16.710
I think that was the first time
when I truly understood the power

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:19.360
of words and what you
can do with them.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.250
If you write the right words
you can change somebody's mood,

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:27.610 position:56%
and if you write the really right
words you can change somebody's day,

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.990
and if you write the
really, really, really,

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.510 position:56%
really right words you might be able
to change somebody's whole life.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:37.310
And, to me, that sounded
like a pretty good job.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:41.140
And that's what I've been
doing now for about 13 years.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:45.270
The first book I ever wrote is this
one, it's called The Sisters Grimm.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.500
Has anybody read this book?

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.720
The cool people in the
audience, all right,

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.270
thank you very much,
I appreciate it.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.730
Thank you for the royalty check.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:59.640
A few years ago our publisher
came to me and said, you know,

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.090
this book is still really
popular, we're thinking

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:04.480
about doing a tenth
anniversary edition.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.780 position:56%
And that's what I've got in my hand,

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.800
this is the tenth anniversary
edition.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.110
It has all new art, it
has a brand-new design,

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:17.260 position:56%
and it has new words because I
decided to rewrite every single one.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.740
And I'll read a little
bit of it for you.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.920
They told me not to read to
you guys, did you hear that?

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.330
I'm not supposed to do this.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.490
You guys feel brave?

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.040
I don't want the police
coming in here.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.540
You guys are going to have
to stop them if they charge.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:38.890
They're after everybody
now, nurses, who knows?

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:43.130
[laughter] The parents know
what I'm talking about.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:47.000
All right, some of these
jokes are just for me, folks.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.920
In the distance a thunderous
bellow rang out,

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.090
followed by the terrible
sound of falling trees

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:57.940 position:56%
and a stampede of terrified animals.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.260
It was coming and there
was no way to outrun it.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.820 position:56%
Still Sabrina and Daphne had to try.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.610 position:56%
They sprinted as fast as they could,

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:09.900
fighting with every step
the dense forest branches

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.100
that snatched at their
faces and arms.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:17.080
We have to find a way to stop
it, Daphne cried between gasps.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.710
Sabrina knew her little
sister was right, but how?

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:23.320
They were two children
versus a vicious monster.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.950
I'll think of something, she said,

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:28.140
dragging her sister
behind an enormous oak tree

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.990
for a much needed rest.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.830
Sabrina squeezed Daphne's hand to
reassure her while she forced air

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.890
into her own burning lungs.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:38.080 position:56%
Her words sounded empty in her ears.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.800
She didn't have a plan, and even

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.680
if she did it wouldn't
make a difference.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.960
The creature was on top
of them, splintering wood

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.280
and damp soil rained from the sky

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.010
as the tree they crouched
behind was violently uprooted.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:53.660
The two girls looked up into
the horrible face above them

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:57.240
and felt scorching breath
blow through their hair.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.080
What was happening to their lives?

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.800
Sabrina wondered, when did the
world become unrecognizable

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.920
and what had happened to
her, the 11-year-old girl

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:12.110
who had only two days prior
had been an orphan on a train?

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:15.430
Bum, bum, bum.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:19.150
Now you're all like
what was that about?

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.210
Because I should have
told you that before,

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:22.700
but I'm going to tell you now.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.720
The Sisters Grimm is about these
two girls who move to a town

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.640
where everyone is a
fairytale character,

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.850
like Prince Charming is the Mayor,

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.760
and the Three Little Pigs
run the Police Department,

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.210
and the Big Bad Wolf
is the yoga instructor.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:42.040
[laughter] And they discovered that
all the fairytales that we read

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:46.450
to our children aren't really
stories, but they're case files

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:49.300
because the people who wrote
them were a couple of guys known

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.840
as The Brothers Grimm and
they were actually detectives.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.400
And all these stories we've
been reading are real stories.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:02.170 position:56%
And the girls encounter a bunch of
these stories throughout nine books.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:07.390
They meet characters from The
Wizard of Oz and Rumpelstiltskin

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:10.700
and Snow White, and they
meet The Little Mermaid,

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:15.810 position:56%
and pretty much anything you could
ever imagine, Robin Hood, Pinocchio.

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:18.260
I just crammed them all in there

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.770
because they're public
domain and no one can sue me.

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:27.610
So does anybody have any
questions about the book?

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.940
We have some microphones here

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.130
and if you have a question
I would love to hear it.

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:36.270
If you do not ask questions
I have been known

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:42.880
to ask you deeply personal
ones, let that motivate you.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:48.390
Okay, all right, sir,
tell us your name?

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:49.690
&gt;&gt; Finn.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:51.430
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Finn,
that's my son's name.

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:54.040
All right, that's lucky.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.000
I'm going to take that as lucky.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.810
&gt;&gt; Why did you create
The Sisters Grimm?

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:01.310
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Oh, there's
money in children's books.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:02.610
[laughter]

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.260
&gt;&gt; Are you kidding me?

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.560
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: No.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.090
You know, there's two reasons why.

00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:12.350
I was reading a book
about the Brothers Grimm,

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:15.240
whose names were Jacob and
Wilhelm, and I discovered

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.560
that the brothers had
actually came from a big family

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.300
and that they had sisters.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.490
And I couldn't really stop
thinking about what those sisters,

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.950
what it must have been like to
have such creepy older brothers.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.820
And then I went to a bookstore
just to see what was out there

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.250
and like there's lots
of children's books now,

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.440
but at the time there
really weren't that many

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:38.540
and I discovered this fact, there
are two kinds of children's books.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:42.480
There's books for boys where
the boy rides a dragon or goes

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.840
to wizarding school or fights
monsters, and then there's books

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.180
for girls where the girl
takes care of a pony.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:56.020 position:56%
[laughter] And I thought that was
lame because I didn't know any women

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:59.680
in my life who would take
a pony over a dragon ride.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:05.520
So I decided to write
the book for that.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.300
[applause] Yes, thank you.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.860
He's so woke, yeah.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.890
All right, who is next?

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:18.090
&gt;&gt; What was your favorite
book in the series?

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:23.130
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Oh, I loved
them all, they're like my children.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:28.050 position:56%
Does your mother ever tell you that
she loves you children all the same?

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:29.350
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:30.650
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: She's lying.

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:35.260
[laughter] She has a favorite,
but it's not good for you to know,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.850
even if you're the favorite.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.130
It might even be worse
for you to know that.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:44.930
You know, I think that my
favorite one was the fifth one,

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:46.970
it's called Magic and
Other Misdemeanors.

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:50.070
My favorite movie of all
time is Back to the Future,

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:53.160
and I wanted to write
a time travel story.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:57.320
So the girls get to go into the
future and see how they turn

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:01.470
out when they're in their 20s and
they do not like it so they have

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:05.800
to go back and change the past
so the future never happens.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.650
And I had a great time
writing that one, yes,

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:11.580
that's probably my favorite one.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.530
&gt;&gt; Back to the Future
is a good movie.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:17.130
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: I
agree, even the sequels,

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:20.560
and that's how much I like it.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:21.860
Yes?

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.210
&gt;&gt; Hello. I just wanted to say

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:26.640
that I read The Sisters
Grimm in elementary school.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:27.940
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley:
Don't tell me that.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.240
How old are you?

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.540
&gt;&gt; I'm 16.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.330
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Ah, that
means I'm getting older, too.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.120
&gt;&gt; But I love those books so much.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.420
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Thank you.

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:40.930 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And they really inspired me, like
the stories and the sisters and how

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:43.540
like -- they were really good.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.840
I loved them.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.140
So thank you for that.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:47.440
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Ah, thanks.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.010
&gt;&gt; What was your inspiration for
the sisters, Daphne and Sabrina?

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.810
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: There's a few,

00:16:52.810 --> 00:17:01.810
but I would say before I met my
wife I had a girlfriend named Renee

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:04.670
and she had an older
sister named Danielle,

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:08.790
and they looked a little bit
like the Sisters Grimm in a way.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:12.880
They were -- they fought
like cats and dogs,

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:17.370
I mean they would literally
fistfight in front of me,

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:21.270
but if somebody else
were to like attack them

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:26.470
or insult them then they would team
up and beat that person up, too.

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:29.860
They were from New Jersey,
which explains a lot.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:36.130
I'm sorry to New Jersey,
it's just a joke.

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:41.610
But, yeah, they were probably
the biggest inspirations, yeah.

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:42.910
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:44.210
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Hi.

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:45.510
&gt;&gt; I have two questions.

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:46.810
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Okay.

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:48.110
&gt;&gt; How did you write your books?

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:49.410
Do you write them in chunks

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:53.350
or did you write them all
at once, well, one book?

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:56.260
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Well, the
first book honestly was sort

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.790
of already there in my head
when I sat down to write it.

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.990
It was pretty simple, it
just kind of flew out.

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:08.890
But later on I began to realize
that I would change the method

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:11.500
of how I wrote, so that
sometimes if I was stuck

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:17.990
on one thing I would just
stop and move to a chapter

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:20.210
that I could see in my head.

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:23.870
I usually don't write anything
until I can actually see it.

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.130
It almost plays out like a movie

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.410
and then I just write
down what I'm seeing.

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:33.080
So now I tend to write
pretty linearly,

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.600
like the beginning to the end.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.980
I've found that when I
skip too far ahead I wind

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:42.450
up not using the stuff
I wrote later.

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:47.160
But, yeah, it's sort of
all over the place, yeah.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.220
That doesn't answer
any question, sorry.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:54.360
&gt;&gt; Also, what time is it when
an elephant sits on a fence?

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.500
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley:
Time to get a new fence.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:57.830
&gt;&gt; That's correct.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.850
[laughter]

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:01.510
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley:
Professional comedian.

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:03.190
[applause]

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:08.040
&gt;&gt; Sorry for anyone who
hasn't read the books,

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.620
this includes a spoiler alert.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:10.920
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Oh, oh.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.220
&gt;&gt; Have you ever thought
of writing a book

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:17.630
like after Sabrina has her
children and marries Puck?

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:19.520
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Spoiler.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.880
Boy, you just dropped a bomb.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.510 position:56%
No, that's okay, I think most people
probably could figure that out.

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:30.110
But, yeah, at the end of the
last book I wrote a little sort

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:35.980
of an epilogue where you see
Sabrina and she's in her early 40s

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:40.170
and she has two teenaged
daughters, Allison and Emma.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:45.230
And at the end of the book
Allison screams and Sabrina runs

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:48.000
up the stairs to find
out what's wrong,

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.280
and Allison has grown fairy wings.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.710
And I thought that it
would be interesting

00:19:53.710 --> 00:20:00.090
to write maybe a few books about
a girl who is a fairy princess,

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:01.430
but lives in New York City

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.960
and doesn't really want
to be a fairy princess.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:09.380
And maybe someday I'll write
that, but right now I'm kind of --

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:13.290
I'm busy writing a
different thing for kids,

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:15.970
so someday I'll probably
go back to it.

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:21.680
It does keep calling me, yeah.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:28.870
&gt;&gt; Why did you use fairytale
characters for like adult jobs?

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:33.060 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Well, one of the
things people always ask me is like,

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:37.610
you know, why are the characters so
different than how I remember them?

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:41.850
For instance, like Snow White
teaches self-defense classes

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:46.310
in the book, she has a
class called the Bad Apples

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:48.150
and she's very independent,

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.460
and that's not how you
remember the story.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:55.530 position:56%
But, you know, these characters have
been around for hundreds of years

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:59.600
and I'm not the same
person I was 10 years ago

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.830
and you won't be the same person

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.800
that you are now 10
years from today.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.620
So people needed to
be able to change,

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:09.830
and I thought it would
be fun to see what kind

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:11.500
of jobs they would be doing.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:15.690
So, you know, Snow White is
really good with little people

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:21.490
so she's a teacher and, you know,
the Three Little Pigs have had

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:26.250
so much trauma in their lives that
they decide to grow up and try

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:31.880
to rescue and be heroes for others,
which is usually the case of a lot

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.580
of people who do heroic jobs.

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:38.270
And then, you know, the
Scarecrow was a librarian

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:40.330
because he's got his brain now.

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:42.940
And some of them just
seemed pretty obvious,

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:46.590
like but then there was
the Witch from Hansel

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:48.240
and Gretel is now dentist.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:54.980
And so there were some that I
had a really fun time coming

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.280
up with the jobs.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:57.580
Yes?

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:01.360
&gt;&gt; What happened to their parents?

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.890
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: I
can't tell you that.

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:06.960
I won't sell any books today.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:14.380
I will tell you that you discover
something happens with the parents

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.330
in the third book, I will say that.

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:17.630
Yes?

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:20.410
&gt;&gt; From the first time
you started writing

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:24.500
and drafting your book
how long did it take

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.480
for your first book
to get published?

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.230
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley:
Oh, this is a story

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.510
that makes a lot of people angry.

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:35.290
[laughter] I didn't actually have
a book when I got it published.

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:40.920
I had about 30 pages and
a very loose outline.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.380
I just got very lucky.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.780
See, I'd been working in
television for a long time

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:51.680
and in TV what you do is you write
a little bit and then you try

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.810
to go get somebody
to pay you to finish.

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:56.770
So I did the same thing,
I thought, well,

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.630
I'm not going to give them
the whole book, you know,

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.720
I'm like let them pay
me to finish the book.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.150
And my agent was like that's the
dumbest thing I have ever heard.

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:08.210
And I said let's just try it.

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:14.960
And so she sent it out and we had
three offers within like two weeks.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:21.850 position:56%
And the editor who actually signed
the book said the reason she read it

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:24.610
in the first place is that
she knew she could finish it

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:28.690
on the subway on the way home.

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:31.980
And so that's basically how
I've done it ever since,

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:33.280
I just give them a little bit

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:37.010
and then say you want
to know how it ends?

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:39.260
You got to write me a check.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.100
[laughter] Yes?

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.700
&gt;&gt; Who is your favorite character?

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.650
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Oh,
my favorite character?

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:50.770
Oh, well, it changes so
much, but I would say

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:54.340
that the character I have grown to
love was the one I didn't even want

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:57.480
to use in the first place,
which was Prince Charming.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:02.590
I just thought this was a
character I had seen way too much,

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:09.480
but he was so interesting to me
and he surprised me all the time.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:14.520
And he's sort of a reluctant
hero, maybe like a rusty hero,

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.910
somebody who has decided to
take care of himself now more

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:20.520
than look out for other people.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:25.340
And the book series is really as
much about him as it is anybody,

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:29.910
it's his journey back
to being a good person.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:32.580
And so I think Prince
Charming turned

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.690
out to be the one I loved the most.

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:36.990
Yes?

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:38.710
&gt;&gt; I have two questions.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.010
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Okay.

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:44.120
&gt;&gt; First, have you ever thought
about a Sisters Grimm movie?

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:48.030
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Yeah,
yeah, I've thought about it.

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:50.730
I'm not supposed to
tell anybody this,

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:56.600
but we actually signed a
deal like two weeks ago.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.400
[applause] Shush, don't
tell anybody.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:02.300
It's not going to be a movie,

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:07.530
it's going to be an animated
show on Amazon Prime.

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:13.410
So if you get Amazon don't
buy any books off of it,

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:18.330
but get Amazon Prime and then
you can watch it for free.

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:23.510
&gt;&gt; Also, they said
that, somebody said

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:28.110
that you wrote a TV show
for a cartoon network?

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:32.620
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Uh-huh, it
was called Robotomy and it was

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:37.880
about two teenaged robots who
go to a high school on a planet

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:42.780
where everyone is a killer robot,
but they're the sensitive ones.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:48.760
So they keep having to hide like
their love of poetry and bunnies

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:53.330
and it was -- don't let the
children watch this show,

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:55.520
it's super offensive.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:00.130
But it was on Monday
nights, it was on right

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:03.220
after Adventure Time for a year.

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:07.930
And I just couldn't do it
anymore, it was so much work

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:12.310
and so we decided to stop doing it.

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:16.960 position:56%
I might -- I don't actually have any
creative or like any real job title

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.650
on The Sisters Grimm cartoon, which
I have no problem with at all,

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:23.660
but I would like to do some
TV shows in the future.

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:27.020
But this one was just an
insane amount of work.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.410
Yes?

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:32.060 position:56%
&gt;&gt; First of all, my name is Sabrina.

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:33.960
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Whoa.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:38.090
&gt;&gt; And what is your favorite book?

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:40.550
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: My
favorite book of all time?

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:44.330
You know, it would
have to be the book

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:45.740
that I read in the fourth grade.

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:51.830
I was what they called, well, they
called them reluctant readers now,

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:56.010
back then they just called
us a pain in the butt.

00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:58.560
[laughter] I didn't like to read
because there really weren't a lot

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.550
of kids' books out there and
the ones that there were were

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:04.790
like about a kid who
had to shoot a pet.

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:07.410
So I wasn't super excited about it.

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:10.760
There were like 400
books about children

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.500
with firearms, blowing a dog away.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:21.730
I don't understand this theme,
it was very popular at one time.

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:25.210
Maybe dogs were different
back then, I don't know.

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:27.850
Mine is wonderful.

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:33.620 position:56%
But I didn't really like to read,
and luckily I had a librarian notice

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:36.700
that I had never checked a
book out of the school library.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.960
And she grabbed me and
dragged me into the library

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:43.100
and grabbed a book off the
shelf and shoved it in my hands

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.060
and told me I had to
read it and I had

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.280
to tell her all about
it in two weeks.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.990
And that book was called The
Mouse and the Motorcycle,

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:54.020
and it's by Beverly Cleary.

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:58.080 position:56%
If you've never read it, it's great,
especially if you're a little boy

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.610
because it has the three things
a little boy wants in a book.

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:07.480
It's a big adventure, it's funny,
and it's absolutely pointless.

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:12.850 position:56%
I was not supposed to learn anything
from The Mouse on the Motorcycle.

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:16.170
I wasn't going to be a
better person afterwards.

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:20.230
But it was just a fun
sort of rainy day book,

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:22.970
and I thought after I finished
it it was like I wonder

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:25.300
if there are more like this?

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:30.440
And then she introduced me to
tons more of these silly books

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.100
that didn't have any
dead dogs in them.

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:38.410
And so I would say that's probably
still my favorite book, yeah.

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:41.590
Yes, ma'am?

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:44.790 position:56%
&gt;&gt; How long have you been an author?

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:51.870
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Well, I would
say it's like 12, 13 years now.

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:53.990
Before that I had a
bunch of different jobs.

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:58.280
Like I said, I worked in TV,
I worked for an advertising,

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:02.250
I used to work for a
company called Macy's.

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:05.920
And like if you've ever
bought like linen from Macy's,

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:12.760 position:56%
my job was to write the tag, I
wrote the tag on the bed in the bag.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:17.500
So I know more about thread
counts and the damask stripe

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:18.980
than any man ever should.

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:20.280
[laughter]

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:36.390
&gt;&gt; How did you get your inspiration
for all the characters in Nerds?

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:37.690
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: In Nerds?

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:38.990
He's asking about the
other series I write,

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:42.460
which is about nerdy secret
agents who are in the fifth grade

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:45.960
and each one of them has
kind of a nerdy superpower.

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:49.500
And those kids are based
on real kids that I knew.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:54.690
There's a kid in the book, his name
is Duncan Dewey and he's inspired

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:58.880
by a kid that I knew
named Avery Dortch.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:04.880
And in the book Duncan's code name
is glue stick because he can stick

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:10.190
to walls, and but the real Avery
Dortch used to do this thing,

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:15.950
he would take Elmer's Glue and
he would smear it on his hands

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:21.500
and then he'd walk through the
halls like this until it dried

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:27.290 position:56%
and then he'd find a group of pretty
girls and he would peel it off

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:30.450
and eat it right in front of them.

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:33.230
Avery had a way with the ladies.

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:40.360
[laughter] So the kids are all
based on real people that I knew.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.330
I'm not even sure Avery
is still alive.

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:47.360
I don't think you should
be eating paste

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.970
in the mass quantities that he did.

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.510
Don't eat the paste, kids.

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:56.810
Thank you.

00:30:56.810 --> 00:31:00.780
I think we have time for
one more, how about you?

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.080
Sorry.

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.570
&gt;&gt; Have you written any joke books?

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:08.060
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Oh,
no, you don't want that.

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:10.920
Publishing doesn't want that.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:14.280
They will never bring me
back here if I do that.

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:22.000
But my son reads this book called
The Absolute Best Joke Book

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.550
in the World, and it's pretty
good evidence of how you can lie

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:30.330
as a title because these
are the worst jokes ever.

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:33.850
But my son does write, has written
a few that I think are funny,

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:35.290
and I'll tell you my favorite joke.

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:39.570
His jokes are very meta, they're
like really kind of surreal.

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:43.640
Here's one, it's like what do
you call a tiger wearing glasses?

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.250
Scientist tiger.

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:50.150
[laughter] He's only nine, so.

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:54.620
And then he's like why did
the taco cross the road?

00:31:54.620 --> 00:32:00.450
Because there was an ATM over
there and he needed money.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:04.280
[laughter] These are actual
jokes from Finn Buckley, yeah.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:06.930
Guys, thank you so much for coming.

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:11.130
[applause] I'm going to be
doing a signing at six o'clock.

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:14.010
And while I still have
your attention I just want

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:19.530
to tell you this hurricane down
in Texas has really been terrible.

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:23.700
One of the things that Texas is
desperately going to need is books.

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:27.910
Schools, libraries were completely
decimated, water has gotten

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:31.130
into those buildings and
destroyed entire libraries.

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:34.570
If you have any extra books put
them in a box and find a place

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:36.240
to send them to in Houston.

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.170
And if you can't do that
I'd recommend that you go

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:45.960
on your old phone and you
send a text message to 909-99

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:49.210
