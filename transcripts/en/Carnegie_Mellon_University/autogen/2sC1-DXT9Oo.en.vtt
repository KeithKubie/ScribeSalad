I find very fascinating about pi is that

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260
I find very fascinating about pi is that

I find very fascinating about pi is that
it can be used to show people how

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960
it can be used to show people how
 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.840
it can be used to show people how
unusual numbers can be because for

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850
unusual numbers can be because for
 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.729
unusual numbers can be because for
example when we're small we start

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739
example when we're small we start
 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.829
example when we're small we start
counting so we could say there are two

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839
counting so we could say there are two
 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.630
counting so we could say there are two
plates if I were to put two plates down

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640
plates if I were to put two plates down
 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.719
plates if I were to put two plates down
okay well the distance from this side of

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729
okay well the distance from this side of
 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.910
okay well the distance from this side of
that side is like two I mean if this is

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920
that side is like two I mean if this is
 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.920
that side is like two I mean if this is
one that's two similarly with forks I

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930
one that's two similarly with forks I
 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.209
one that's two similarly with forks I
could say well if I were to put them

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219
could say well if I were to put them
 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.060
could say well if I were to put them
side by side here I just got two forks

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070
side by side here I just got two forks
 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.399
side by side here I just got two forks
with a distance but these are very nice

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409
with a distance but these are very nice
 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.440
with a distance but these are very nice
numbers and actually it turns out that

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450
numbers and actually it turns out that
 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.539
numbers and actually it turns out that
you can get a very strange number very

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549
you can get a very strange number very
 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:25.980
you can get a very strange number very
easily and that's what piqued somebody's

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990
easily and that's what piqued somebody's
 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.990
easily and that's what piqued somebody's
people's imagination suppose I wanted to

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000
people's imagination suppose I wanted to
 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.550
people's imagination suppose I wanted to
be an ant going all the way around and

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560
be an ant going all the way around and
 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.380
be an ant going all the way around and
see how far that is compared to going

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390
see how far that is compared to going
 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.749
see how far that is compared to going
straight across you find out that ratio

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759
straight across you find out that ratio
 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.639
straight across you find out that ratio
the fraction it becomes something that

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649
the fraction it becomes something that
 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.260
the fraction it becomes something that
you can't just write simply it's not -

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270
you can't just write simply it's not -
 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.300
you can't just write simply it's not -
it's not even a simple number like

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310
it's not even a simple number like
 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.980
it's not even a simple number like
square root of 2 it's actually simply

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990
square root of 2 it's actually simply
 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.200
square root of 2 it's actually simply
called transcendental and we see numbers

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210
called transcendental and we see numbers
 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.539
called transcendental and we see numbers
like this written across across the

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549
like this written across across the
 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.489
like this written across across the
decorations in schools all the time and

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:47.499
decorations in schools all the time and
 

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:48.929
decorations in schools all the time and
so I think it's one of these fascinating

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939
so I think it's one of these fascinating
 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:50.340
so I think it's one of these fascinating
numbers that people can very easily

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350
numbers that people can very easily
 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.620
numbers that people can very easily
explain but then maybe it's a bit hard

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630
explain but then maybe it's a bit hard
 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.480
explain but then maybe it's a bit hard
to wrap your head around at the same

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490
to wrap your head around at the same
 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.039
to wrap your head around at the same
time but something else I like to say

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049
time but something else I like to say
 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.539
time but something else I like to say
also is that this is the first thing

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549
also is that this is the first thing
 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:58.620
also is that this is the first thing
that people think about when they think

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630
that people think about when they think
 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.419
that people think about when they think
about pie but the amazing thing about

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429
about pie but the amazing thing about
 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.340
about pie but the amazing thing about
pie is actually it comes in many other

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350
pie is actually it comes in many other
 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.739
pie is actually it comes in many other
ways as well pie can appear in another

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:04.749
ways as well pie can appear in another
 

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:06.419
ways as well pie can appear in another
area of mathematics where actually what

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429
area of mathematics where actually what
 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.730
area of mathematics where actually what
you're doing is maybe let me give an

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740
you're doing is maybe let me give an
 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.770
you're doing is maybe let me give an
example this way if you're saying I have

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780
example this way if you're saying I have
 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.810
example this way if you're saying I have
a line of people like a hundred people

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820
a line of people like a hundred people
 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.370
a line of people like a hundred people
and I wasn't know how many different

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380
and I wasn't know how many different
 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.470
and I wasn't know how many different
ways can I line up those people this is

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480
ways can I line up those people this is
 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.270
ways can I line up those people this is
a

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280
a
 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.650
a
factorial it's like hundred with this

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660
factorial it's like hundred with this
 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.240
factorial it's like hundred with this
exclamation point which we often teach

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250
exclamation point which we often teach
 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.280
exclamation point which we often teach
in combinatorics class here at CMU and

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290
in combinatorics class here at CMU and
 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.410
in combinatorics class here at CMU and
many people see in high school and so it

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420
many people see in high school and so it
 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.180
many people see in high school and so it
turns out that you can approximate this

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190
turns out that you can approximate this
 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.130
turns out that you can approximate this
with a formula and that formula is

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140
with a formula and that formula is
 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.780
with a formula and that formula is
called Sterling's approximation it has a

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790
called Sterling's approximation it has a
 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.000
called Sterling's approximation it has a
PI inside it as well so now that's

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010
PI inside it as well so now that's
 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.220
PI inside it as well so now that's
that's that's like a way where pi

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230
that's that's like a way where pi
 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.690
that's that's like a way where pi
appears when you're even thinking about

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700
appears when you're even thinking about
 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.809
appears when you're even thinking about
how to rearrange people in a line so you

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819
how to rearrange people in a line so you
 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.940
how to rearrange people in a line so you
have this marvelous PI here I'm curious

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950
have this marvelous PI here I'm curious
 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.220
have this marvelous PI here I'm curious
what got you into the PI for pi day well

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230
what got you into the PI for pi day well
 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.710
what got you into the PI for pi day well
I was a CMU student and I looked forward

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720
I was a CMU student and I looked forward
 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.270
I was a CMU student and I looked forward
to the tradition every year of the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280
to the tradition every year of the
 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.130
to the tradition every year of the
numbers being chalked all over campus

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140
numbers being chalked all over campus
 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.380
numbers being chalked all over campus
and then I graduated and went into the

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390
and then I graduated and went into the
 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.900
and then I graduated and went into the
world and found that not everyone shared

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910
world and found that not everyone shared
 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.009
world and found that not everyone shared
that same punny allegiance to 2pi but I

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019
that same punny allegiance to 2pi but I
 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.110
that same punny allegiance to 2pi but I
did so I did an art project called the

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120
did so I did an art project called the
 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.930
did so I did an art project called the
cutie pie project and my initials are QT

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940
cutie pie project and my initials are QT
 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.240
cutie pie project and my initials are QT
and I made pies from all local

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250
and I made pies from all local
 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.430
and I made pies from all local
ingredients and then I boxed them in a

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440
ingredients and then I boxed them in a
 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.920
ingredients and then I boxed them in a
little recipe boxes and delivered them

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930
little recipe boxes and delivered them
 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.290
little recipe boxes and delivered them
the ax by sickle to Holmes with 3 1 4

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300
the ax by sickle to Holmes with 3 1 4
 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.130
the ax by sickle to Holmes with 3 1 4
addresses on pi day so pi on pi and pi

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140
addresses on pi day so pi on pi and pi
 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.910
addresses on pi day so pi on pi and pi
the artist statement essentially so what

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920
the artist statement essentially so what
 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.770
the artist statement essentially so what
exactly are we gonna do with this pi now

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780
exactly are we gonna do with this pi now
 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.610
exactly are we gonna do with this pi now
we're definitely gonna eat that pie oh

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620
we're definitely gonna eat that pie oh
 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.600
we're definitely gonna eat that pie oh
this sounds great
