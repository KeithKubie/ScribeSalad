00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:21.289
In short, yes, a man can test positive if
he pees on a pregnancy tester.

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:22.410
How?

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.159
What a pregnancy test looks for is the presence
of elevated levels of the hormone beta human

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:29.890
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.660
There are certain types of testicular cancers
that also release this hormone.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.980
Thus, if a man has elevated levels of hCG,
he could have testicular cancer resulting

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.890
in a positive pregnancy test.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.480
The opposite is not true; just because you’re
a guy and you test negative on a pregnancy

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.309
test, it doesn’t mean you’re cancer free
as not all testicular tumors secrete this

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:50.309
hormone.

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.769
Interestingly, several other types of tumors
also secrete hCG.

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.320
So sit back, read on, and find out everything
you didn’t think you needed to know about

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.320
hCG.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.600
Human chorionic gonadotropins main purpose
in pregnancy is to keep the lining of the

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.400
uterus (endometrium) thick during the first
trimester.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.670
It does this by promoting the secretion of
another hormone, progesterone, by the ovaries.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.619
Just prior to ovulation, the ovaries naturally
produce progesterone.

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.280
This does several things- it slightly elevates
the body temperature; it makes the uterus

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.100
muscles less likely to contract; and it helps
create more mucus in the vagina.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.149
This all helps keep the sperm alive and more
likely to reach the egg.

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.420
If progesterone levels were to drop off, the
lining of the uterus is thinned by shedding.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.260
After around week 20 of pregnancy, the placenta
produces steroid hormones to diminish the

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.229
role of hCG and thereby progesterone.

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.280
the-role-of-recombinant-hcg-in-ivf-3-638So
what about hCG and cancer?

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.530
It can be released by several types of cancer
tumors such as cancers involving the ovaries,

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.109
stomach, lungs, and testes.

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:57.270
Cancers involving the liver, mutated epithelial
cells, and those involving the endocrine (hormonal)

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.899
system and nervous system are also associated
with hCG release.

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.670
Finally, this hormone is typically found in
extremely high levels in patients suffering

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.960
kidney failure.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.750
As mentioned before, a negative pregnancy
test doesn’t mean one is cancer free.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.490
There are several types of testicular cancers
and not all produce elevated levels of hCG.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.600
Lumped into two categories, they’re known
as seminomas and non-seminomas.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.610
These types of cancers also produce other
markers that aren’t picked up by pregnancy

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.630
tests, such as alpha-fetaprotein and lactate
dehydrogenase.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.480
The only type that always gives off hCG is
known as Choriocarcinoma.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:43.150
In fact, only 20%-40% of seminomas and 40%-50%
of non-seminomas give off elevated levels

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.220
of hCG.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.300
HCG has many other uses than testing for pregnancy.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.780
Since it’s been known to cause ovulation
within 48 hours after injection, some doctors

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.020
use this method of hormone therapy prior to
attempting in vitro fertilization.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.520
Beyond this, because it can help produce testosterone,
bodybuilders who take steroids have been known

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.820
to take hCG as a supplement.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.570
This also helps prevent some of certain steroids’
long term side effects, like shrinking testicles.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.470
You will also often read that hCG therapy
will help with weight loss, but numerous studies

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.370
have shown this notion to be absolutely false.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.260
shutterstock_229502134So to sum up- yes, men
can test positive on pregnancy tests and if

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.350
you do, you should immediately head on down
to your local clinic and find out if you have

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.350
cancer.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.690
Beyond pregnancy tests, common signs and symptoms
of testicular cancer include: any lump felt

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.820
on the testicle; any testicle enlargement,
change in shape, or size irregularities; pain

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.410
or discomfort in the scrotum or testicle;
a dull ache or sense of pressure in the lower

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.180
back or abdomen; a feeling of heaviness or
fullness in the scrotum; and enlargement or

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.120
tenderness of the breasts.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.760
The good news for those who are particularly
vigilant about such signs is that testicular

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.020
cancer is one of the most curable forms of
cancer there is.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.840
The 5 year survival rates are 99% if localized,
meaning the cancer is still only in the testicle;

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.000
96% if regional, meaning the cancer is found
in the testicle and surrounding lymph nodes

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.900
or tissues; and 73% if the cancer has spread
to the organs or lymph nodes away from the

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.900
tumor.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:51.620
While 73% isn’t bad, relatively speaking,
99 out of 100 is much better, so be sure to

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.240
check often!
