00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.707
Background voice: Let's
think about how we would

00:00:02.707 --> 00:00:04.030
have accounted for things,

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.123
if instead of renting our
building for $200,000,

00:00:07.123 --> 00:00:10.137
instead we bought the
building for $2,000,000,

00:00:10.137 --> 00:00:11.605
how would that showed up …

00:00:11.605 --> 00:00:13.541
how would that have shown up

00:00:13.541 --> 00:00:15.457
from an accounting profit point of view

00:00:15.457 --> 00:00:18.290
and an economic profit point of view?

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.939
We're going to buy our
building for $2,000,000.

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.137
That is the market value of our building

00:00:25.137 --> 00:00:26.963
at the beginning of our period,

00:00:26.963 --> 00:00:29.271
at the beginning of year 1.

00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:31.404
Let's say, at the end of year 1,

00:00:31.404 --> 00:00:34.935
so this is year 1 right
over here, that occurs.

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:35.936
Maybe, to a large degree,

00:00:35.936 --> 00:00:37.627
this is because I used the building,

00:00:37.627 --> 00:00:39.545
there was a lot of traffic in there.

00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:40.805
Maybe it was a brand new building before

00:00:40.805 --> 00:00:42.004
and now it's essentially kind of ...

00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:44.544
the building itself has
taken some wear and tear.

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:47.404
Because of that, the market
value of the building

00:00:47.404 --> 00:00:51.295
is now, 1.9 million dollars.

00:00:51.295 --> 00:00:53.045
Essentially, through this year,

00:00:53.045 --> 00:00:59.338
the building's value has
depreciated by $100,000.

00:00:59.338 --> 00:01:03.805
We'll say the depreciation is $100,000.

00:01:03.805 --> 00:01:06.963
Notice, I didn't pay anyone that $100,000.

00:01:06.963 --> 00:01:11.405
It was not an explicit opportunity cost,

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:13.378
but this really is an opportunity cost,

00:01:13.378 --> 00:01:18.071
because this $100,000
is the opportunity cost

00:01:18.071 --> 00:01:20.404
of not selling the building a year ago.

00:01:20.404 --> 00:01:21.938
Instead, using that building,

00:01:21.938 --> 00:01:25.295
I have essentially lost out on $100,000.

00:01:25.295 --> 00:01:27.963
That's not all that I have lost out on.

00:01:27.963 --> 00:01:31.558
I have also lost out on
the ability to invest

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:33.869
this $2,000,000 in other things.

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.877
Maybe I could have
invested the $2,000,000

00:01:36.877 --> 00:01:41.270
at a 5% rate and gotten
some interest on it.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.004
I also have the opportunity cost,

00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:46.472
opportunity cost

00:01:46.472 --> 00:01:51.110
of capital, of not
investing that $2,000,000

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.804
some place else.

00:01:52.804 --> 00:01:54.337
The opportunity cost of capital,

00:01:54.337 --> 00:01:58.737
let's say I could have
gotten 5% on my $2,000,000.

00:01:58.737 --> 00:02:03.137
5% of 2,000,000 is $100,000.

00:02:03.137 --> 00:02:07.360
My opportunity cost of
capital is $100,000.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.337
Another way to think about it is,

00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:11.026
let's just say that I buy the building

00:02:11.026 --> 00:02:12.805
and I sell it at the end of the year.

00:02:12.805 --> 00:02:15.360
Then, I would have literally lost $100,000

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.870
on that transaction

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.610
and although I might have used it,

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.694
so I got some value out of it,

00:02:20.694 --> 00:02:23.360
and I would have lost another $100,000

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.276
by not having that money
invested in some other use

00:02:26.276 --> 00:02:27.804
during that period.

00:02:27.804 --> 00:02:30.026
These are the 2 non-explicit cost

00:02:30.026 --> 00:02:32.203
that will come into ...

00:02:32.203 --> 00:02:34.610
that would show up in
our profit statements.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.803
Now, depreciation is something
that is accounted for

00:02:39.803 --> 00:02:41.137
by accountants.

00:02:41.137 --> 00:02:42.610
When you look at a company's financials,

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.070
you will see something
called a depreciation.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.610
Which is a measure of, how are you ...

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.693
You're kind of using
up your capital goods,

00:02:49.693 --> 00:02:51.403
you are using up your building,

00:02:51.403 --> 00:02:52.777
you are using up your equipment,

00:02:52.777 --> 00:02:55.275
you are using up your vehicles,

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:57.275
or whatever else you might have.

00:02:57.275 --> 00:02:59.526
Economist are very pure
about depreciation.

00:02:59.526 --> 00:03:01.138
They say, what was the market value

00:03:01.138 --> 00:03:01.871
at the beginning of the period,

00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:03.806
what is the market value at the end,

00:03:03.806 --> 00:03:05.943
the difference is how
much it has depreciated.

00:03:05.943 --> 00:03:07.203
This is kind of ...

00:03:07.203 --> 00:03:08.776
it's actually almost a more natural way.

00:03:08.776 --> 00:03:10.361
In accounting, and I
won't go into the details,

00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:12.402
there are many ways to
depreciate something.

00:03:12.402 --> 00:03:13.403
You might be able to say,

00:03:13.403 --> 00:03:15.442
"Well, if the thing is worth $2,000,000"

00:03:15.442 --> 00:03:18.026
"and if it's going to last me 10 years,"

00:03:18.026 --> 00:03:21.138
"I can depreciate $100,000 a year,"

00:03:21.138 --> 00:03:22.536
"or actually $200,000 a year."

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:25.070
2,000,000 divided by 10 years.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.870
There is different incentives based on

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.870
if you are the owner of a firm,

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.276
of how you depreciate.

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:31.203
You might want to actually want to have

00:03:31.203 --> 00:03:33.070
a lot of depreciation for tax purposes,

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.942
so that you can somehow
hide a profit or whatever.

00:03:36.942 --> 00:03:38.610
For the sake of this video,
we're going to assume

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.671
that both the accountants
and the economist

00:03:40.671 --> 00:03:45.274
will mark off $100,000 of depreciation,

00:03:45.274 --> 00:03:47.609
if we were to buy the building.

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.276
Let's redo our 2 financial statements,

00:03:50.276 --> 00:03:53.525
the accounting version
and the economic version.

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:54.804
In the accounting version ...

00:03:54.804 --> 00:03:59.360
Let me copy and paste all of this.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.943
Copy and let me go down here and paste it.

00:04:03.943 --> 00:04:06.070
Let me paste it.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.270
Now, we don't have any rent expense.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.204
Instead of renting the building,

00:04:10.204 --> 00:04:11.943
we've gone off and we've
bought the building.

00:04:11.943 --> 00:04:13.736
Let me get rid of that.

00:04:13.736 --> 00:04:18.537
Our rent expense is now going to be 0,

00:04:18.537 --> 00:04:20.471
is now going to be 0.

00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:22.609
We do have a depreciation expense.

00:04:22.609 --> 00:04:24.204
I'll write that in another color.

00:04:24.204 --> 00:04:30.942
We do have a depreciation
expense of $100,000.

00:04:30.942 --> 00:04:33.443
We don't think about the
opportunity cost of capital.

00:04:33.443 --> 00:04:35.471
What we could have done ...

00:04:35.471 --> 00:04:37.204
This is opportunity cost of capital.

00:04:37.204 --> 00:04:38.942
What we could have done
with that $2,000,000

00:04:38.942 --> 00:04:41.805
that we used to buy the building.

00:04:41.805 --> 00:04:44.026
Our pretax profit,

00:04:44.026 --> 00:04:46.941
our pretax accounting profit,

00:04:46.941 --> 00:04:50.941
pretax profit from an
accounting point of view,

00:04:50.941 --> 00:04:54.609
is going to be … Let's see, 50 minus 200

00:04:54.609 --> 00:04:58.290
is 300, minus another ...

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.443
Let me make sure that I get this right.

00:04:59.443 --> 00:05:00.943
I have …

00:05:00.943 --> 00:05:01.942
Actually, it's gotten better,

00:05:01.942 --> 00:05:03.337
because my rent was 200

00:05:03.337 --> 00:05:05.203
and now I only have a depreciation of 100.

00:05:05.203 --> 00:05:13.622
It's 50 minus 350 gives me
a pretax profit of $150,000.

00:05:13.622 --> 00:05:16.204
That was because I was renting it for more

00:05:16.204 --> 00:05:18.609
and now my depreciation, based on how ...

00:05:18.609 --> 00:05:19.860
what happened with the market rate,

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.072
actually changed less

00:05:21.072 --> 00:05:22.609
than what my rent would have been.

00:05:22.609 --> 00:05:23.681
The economic profit,

00:05:23.681 --> 00:05:25.529
at least based on the way
we've done the numbers here

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:26.794
it will actually come out neutral.

00:05:26.794 --> 00:05:27.724
Which it should,

00:05:27.724 --> 00:05:29.029
because really economic profit,

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:30.113
we're just trying to decide,

00:05:30.113 --> 00:05:33.458
does it make sense for us to
run this business in this way.

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:35.792
When we look at the economic profit ...

00:05:35.792 --> 00:05:39.980
Let's copy and paste this again.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.425
Let me copy just this part.

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:46.991
Copy and paste.

00:05:46.991 --> 00:05:48.759
Maybe if things actually did improve,

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:52.192
when we actually changed
whether we owned or rent,

00:05:52.192 --> 00:05:54.663
then that would say that's the
more economic way to do it.

00:05:54.663 --> 00:05:59.060
Let's say that it's year
2 or this is year 1 again.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.859
Now we're doing, this is
economic profit, year 1.

00:06:02.859 --> 00:06:03.747
Our food is the same.

00:06:03.747 --> 00:06:04.723
Our labor is the same.

00:06:04.723 --> 00:06:06.792
Our rent disappears.

00:06:06.792 --> 00:06:08.997
Let me get rid of that.

00:06:08.997 --> 00:06:10.125
Let me get rid of the rent.

00:06:10.125 --> 00:06:12.192
The rent is now going to be 0.

00:06:12.192 --> 00:06:13.997
We now own our building.

00:06:13.997 --> 00:06:15.330
Rent is 0.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.095
These are all our explicit cost.

00:06:17.095 --> 00:06:22.193
These are direct payments
of money to someone else.

00:06:22.193 --> 00:06:24.758
Now, let's think about our implicit cost.

00:06:24.758 --> 00:06:27.728
Implicit cost.

00:06:27.728 --> 00:06:29.457
We still have the same implicit cost

00:06:29.457 --> 00:06:30.527
that we had up here.

00:06:30.527 --> 00:06:32.007
We have the wages foregone.

00:06:32.007 --> 00:06:33.524
We talked about maybe I was a doctor

00:06:33.524 --> 00:06:35.992
and I'm not working as a
doctor to run this restaurant,

00:06:35.992 --> 00:06:39.256
so my wages foregone are $150,000.

00:06:39.256 --> 00:06:46.773
Wages foregone are $150,000.

00:06:46.773 --> 00:06:47.857
Actually, I think ...

00:06:47.857 --> 00:06:54.189
Wages lost are $150,000.

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:57.457
Now, we have the
depreciation on top of that.

00:06:57.457 --> 00:06:59.857
I'll do this in magenta
to show what is new.

00:06:59.857 --> 00:07:03.925
We have the depreciation of $100,000.

00:07:03.925 --> 00:07:04.939
On top of that,

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:07.024
we have the opportunity cost of capital.

00:07:07.024 --> 00:07:09.260
The return we could have
gotten on that $2,000,000,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.607
that instead we used to buy the building.

00:07:11.607 --> 00:07:16.792
I'll call it OCC,
opportunity cost of capital,

00:07:16.792 --> 00:07:20.458
in this situation was
the 5% of $2,000,000,

00:07:20.458 --> 00:07:24.940
another $100,000.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.993
The way that I've worked
out the numbers here,

00:07:26.993 --> 00:07:29.273
we didn't have to spend 200,000 on rent,

00:07:29.273 --> 00:07:32.392
but we increased our implicit
cost by owning the building,

00:07:32.392 --> 00:07:35.356
by 200,000, so it all comes out the same.

00:07:35.356 --> 00:07:38.106
We still get what we
got in the previous one,

00:07:38.106 --> 00:07:41.992
of an economic profit
of negative $100,000.

00:07:41.992 --> 00:07:48.124
Negative 100,000 of economic profit.

00:07:48.124 --> 00:07:50.122
Economic profit.

00:07:50.122 --> 00:07:54.392
This of course was accounting profit.

00:07:54.392 --> 00:07:56.025
I wanted to really just highlight in this,

00:07:56.025 --> 00:07:57.773
is that you don't get kind of a freebie

00:07:57.773 --> 00:08:00.811
on the economic profit
when you decide to buy

00:08:00.811 --> 00:08:03.348
instead of rent, or rent verses buy.

00:08:03.348 --> 00:08:05.059
There are still ways of accounting for,

00:08:05.059 --> 00:08:06.939
essentially, the opportunity cost

00:08:06.939 --> 00:08:10.000
of doing any of these actions.
