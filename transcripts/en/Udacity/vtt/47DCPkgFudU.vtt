00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The first thing I want to do when I solve this problem

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is to solve for the acceleration of the proton in this electric field.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We know that the force on the proton is equal to the strength

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
of the electric field E times its charge q.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And we also know that the force is equal to the mass times acceleration.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We get this equation here.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And solving for a, I get that the acceleration is equal to

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the electric field strength times the charge of the proton over the proton's mass--awesome.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now that I have the acceleration, this problem just becomes a kinematics problem.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I chose to use this kinematics equation here and we know that the proton

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
has no initial velocity so this term drops out, and now I just want to solve for the time here.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And doing some algebra here, I find that the time it takes for the proton to move

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
from here to here is equal to the square root of 2 times the separation

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
between the plates d over the acceleration a.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And I know what the acceleration is. We just found it up here.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Plugging in that value for acceleration, I get this equation for the time here.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And putting in my numbers, I find that the time it takes for the proton to move

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
from left to the right side of the plate is equal to 4.57x10⁻⁷ seconds,

00:01:03.000 --> 09:59:59.000
which is equal to 457 ns--good work.
