00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:13.146
 Hi, Giura 

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.472
 Hi, Oded 

00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:15.225
 how are you? 

00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:16.600
 I'm fine 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.190
 I'm on my way to you now 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.234
 The team will join us later for lunch 

00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:22.070
 We'll show you a great new feature 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.240
 You will like it 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.251
 I am waiting for you 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.000
 Sesame started about five years ago 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.730
 I did not know I would work in this area 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.382
 And appeared on TV to display the game 

00:00:37.382 --> 00:00:39.670
 Developed and controlled by head gestures 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.830
 You move your head to chase the character 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.220
 A day later, I received a phone call 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.910
 The caller told me he was helpless 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.180
 About moving his hands or legs 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.480
 He asked me to make a smart phone that he could use 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.249
 He came and looked at me to tell me 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:57.300
 That he founded a new company 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.554
 And that it was not ready for change at the moment. 

00:00:59.554 --> 00:01:04.570
 I told him that this would be a lot better 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.060
 To help the world 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.120
 I was convinced by my point of view. 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.130
 My company has provided a new perspective 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.070
 About what technology can do 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.600
 And their ability to change lives 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.020
 Allows me to modify the Android operating system 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.640
 Make more innovations than I imagined at first 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.470
 The first time I used this phone was more like magic 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.834
 I almost jumped out of the seat 

00:01:29.834 --> 00:01:31.500
 You have to say "open sesame" 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.537
 Open sesame 

00:01:33.537 --> 00:01:35.370
 This is how the phone is opened 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.112
 From here, you can run any application 

00:01:38.112 --> 00:01:39.320
 Just move your head 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.420
 I was frequently asked to introduce the self-image feature 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.700
 I think it's fun 

00:02:01.635 --> 00:02:03.650
 It is not a normal company 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.110
 You will encounter days when you cry of happiness 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.910
 Because you have made a great known for the life of someone who needs to help you 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.880
 The app is now available on Google Play 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.440
 Everyone can download it all over the world, and that's what happens 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.260
 One of our great application users, Alex Friedman 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.110
 I met him when one of the acquaintances was 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.350
 At this time a campaign is beginning in Israel 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.940
 To raise awareness about people with disabilities 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.085
 Sesame was used distinctly 

00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:32.706
 There are things I do that I could not have done before 

00:02:32.706 --> 00:02:37.166
 I could not handle my smartphone 

00:02:37.166 --> 00:02:40.166
 My life changed completely 

00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:47.456
 The app helps me work and in my personal life 

00:02:47.456 --> 00:02:52.032
 The app is fun because it allows us to communicate throughout the day 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.480
 Google Play Console gives us many tools 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.640
 To better meet our users' needs 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.892
 We know appropriate and inappropriate applications 

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:05.350
 And through assessments and reviews 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.150
 We can actually communicate with users 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.900
 And take advantage of all the wonderful features 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.930
 Provided by the Play Store 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.850
 The most important feature provided by Sesame 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.350
 Is to enjoy life and communicate 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.960
 User success is not just a number 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.070
 Success is the fruit of a full life with its various details and events 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.110
 These successful people join us in supporting our continued success.
