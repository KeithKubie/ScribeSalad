00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.670
Besides the need for routing tables, the most important

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.750
thing to understand about the Internet is that it is

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.880
not run by any single entity, but by a

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.860
collection of thousands of autonomous systems that share information. Examples

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.890
of these autonomous systems or AS's for short include

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.320
Google, MIT, Georgia Tech, Comcast, and so forth. Each of

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.540
these autonomous systems is responsible for routing traffic within itself.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.880
This is called intra-domain routing. And as you might imagine,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.330
there are some interesting algorithmic problems here, that have the

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.570
shortest path-like character. You can explore this further by taking

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.170
a networking class, or consulting the links in the instructor

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.540
notes. Inter-domain routing, which is

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.290
essential to connecting these often regional

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.120
AS's together, gets a little more complex because of the

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.780
various business interests among these entities. They don't share all of

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.520
their routing information with each other, but they do advertise

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.960
their ability to reach public IPs with a protocol called BGP,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.990
for Border Gateway Protocol. The essentials of such an

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.830
advertisement are the IP address that they're advertising that they

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.940
can reach. The Next Hop or the address of

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.690
the entry point into the advertising AS. And the AS

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.290
Path, which captures the sequence of AS's that a

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.225
packet along the route would need to travel through. And

00:01:11.225 --> 00:01:14.670
AS receiving such a message would incorporate the information

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.980
into its own routing tables, so that it knows where

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.300
to forward packets. To take an example, suppose Comcast

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.590
wanted to advertise my IP address. Then it would

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.620
send an advertisement to its partners, which would include

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.560
let's say a level 3. The AS path on the

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.860
advertisement would just be Comcast's own AS number. And

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.350
the next hop would be the desired entry point, or

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.160
gateway, into the Comcast network. One of Comcast's partners,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.050
let's say level 3, then might want to advertise my IP

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.060
address to say, the Apple AS. And so it

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.930
would send another BGP packet, with my IP address,

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.040
their gateway as the next hop, and the AS

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.360
path of level 3 and then Comcast. That's where all

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.080
this information has been incorporated into the routing tables.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.810
All the routers in the Apple network know how

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.600
to send the data back to my machine. They

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.240
have their own internal routing before sending it to layer

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.790
3, who does its own internal routing, before sending it to Comcast, who

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.780
then does its own internal routing to get the message to my house.
