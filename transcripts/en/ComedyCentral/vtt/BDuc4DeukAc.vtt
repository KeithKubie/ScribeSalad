YOU SAVED
THIS FINE FAMILY.

00:00:10.976 --> 00:00:12.311
- THANKS FOR LETTING ME
BE THE HERO,

00:00:12.344 --> 00:00:13.980

00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:16.115
- YEAH, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S ONE OTHER TINY THING

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:17.617
I SHOULD TELL YOU
BEFORE I GET DRUNKER

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.651
THAN YOU EVER COULD.

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:19.204
- MM?

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.125
- I'M NOT ACTUALLY YOUR FATHER.
- WHAT?

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:29.896
- SON,
I'M YOUR BROTHER, BRO.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.531
DAD TOOK OFF,

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:33.699
AND ME AND MOM FIGURED
THE MOST LOGICAL THING TO DO

00:00:33.732 --> 00:00:36.002
WOULD BE TO LIE
TO YOUR FACE FOREVER.

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:37.203
- THAT'S COOL.

00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:38.638
- YEAH?

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.307
- 'CAUSE YOU WERE
A HORRIBLE DAD.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.875
- YEAH.

00:00:42.908 --> 00:00:44.710
- YOU'D PROBABLY MAKE
AN AWESOME BROTHER.

00:00:44.743 --> 00:00:45.945
YOU LIED TO ME
MY WHOLE LIFE!

00:00:45.978 --> 00:00:48.147
THAT'S HILARIOUS.
- YEAH!

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.650

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:51.784
- ADAM, WHAT'S UP, DUDE?

00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:52.985
I'M A KNIGHT.

00:00:53.018 --> 00:00:54.921
HOW'S--HOW'S THIS ALL GOING?

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:55.955
- I COULD'VE KILLED MYSELF.

00:00:55.988 --> 00:00:57.490
IT WAS REALLY DANGEROUS.

00:00:57.523 --> 00:00:58.991
SO IT WAS AWESOME.

00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:02.462
HEY, I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE
MY BROTHER, DAD.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:05.832
- WHAT?
- I BELIEVE THIS MAKES US EVEN.

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:07.800
- UH, I BELIEVE I ASKED YOU

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:09.669
FOR A LIFETIME SUBSCRIPTION
TO PIZZA, SO...

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:10.937
- WELL, THEN
I WILL JUST GO AHEAD

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.672
AND TAKE THIS TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:13.973
- NO, NO, WE'RE COOL.
WE'RE GOOD.

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:14.974
WE'RE GOOD.
WE'RE EVEN.

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:16.442
- OKAY?
HEY, GUYS.

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:18.644
I JUST WANTED TO LET
YOU KNOW THAT I GET IT.

00:01:18.677 --> 00:01:20.446
I TOTALLY GET IT
ABOUT THE DEMAMPS.

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.249
THEY DO EVERYTHING JUST A LITTLE
DIFFERENT, AND SO DID GRAMPS,

00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:25.585
I'M SURE YOU KNOW--
THE SCULPTURES.

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:27.453
YOU HAVEN'T SEE--
HAVE YOU SEEN THE SCULPTURES?

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:29.489
YEAH, BECAUSE
I HAD THEM DESTROYED.

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:30.656
IT'S VERY DARK STUFF,

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.258
EXTREMELY DISTURBING.

00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:34.260
ANYHOO, I GUESS IT'S ABOUT TIME
TO, YOU KNOW,

00:01:34.293 --> 00:01:36.929
GET THIS BITCH-ASS PARTY
STARTED!

00:01:36.962 --> 00:01:38.197
