00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.004
( intro music )

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.509
<i> Most people, when you
 say Arabia, they think</i>

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:11.678
<i> camels, terrorism,</i>

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:12.912
<i> pirates?</i>

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:14.214
<i> Oil and gas.</i>

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:16.615
<i> They don't think
 coral reefs.</i>

00:00:16.615 --> 00:00:18.784
<i> Or sharks.</i>

00:00:18.784 --> 00:00:21.054
<i> So, I proposed a story to</i>
National Geographic<i> magazine</i>

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:22.355
<i> to kind of change that.</i>

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:25.124 line:0%
You know, 'cause Arabia
is home to some of the most

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:28.227 line:0%
incredible marine
ecosystems on our planet.

00:00:28.594 --> 00:00:30.497 line:0%
You know, fortunately
the story was approved

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:31.697
and off I went.

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:35.601
And at the same time as
the Arab Spring was going on.

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:38.438
So, my timing on these
stories is not ideal.

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:41.541
But, nonetheless, you know,
the Arabian Peninsula

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:43.342
<i> and we covered parts of
 the African coast as well</i>

00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:44.978
<i> the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden,</i>

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:47.080
<i> the Arabian Sea and
 then the Persian Gulf.</i>

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.449
<i> We began in the Gulf of Aden
 on the Somali-Djibouti border.</i>

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:51.985
<i> Sandwiched between pirates and</i>

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:54.420
<i> the Western Naval forces
 hunting the pirates</i>

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.488
<i> there is an aggregation
 of whale sharks.</i>

00:00:56.488 --> 00:00:58.858
<i> Which nobody knows
 about and every year</i>

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:00.393
<i> these young, juvenile
 whale sharks</i>

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:01.561
<i> aggregate to feed.</i>

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:04.096
<i> Whale sharks have finger
 prints, just like us.</i>

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:05.397
<i> And you can identify them</i>

00:01:05.397 --> 00:01:08.067
<i> by looking at the
 spot pattern on them.</i>

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:10.369
<i> And each whale shark
 is completely unique</i>

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:11.404
<i> with the spot pattern.</i>

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:13.940
<i>So, after a week or two, I think
 there was almost more than</i>

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.342
<i> a 100 different whale sharks
 feeding in that larger area.</i>

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:18.577
<i> The biggest danger for
 a photographer here</i>

00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:20.345
<i> is becoming a whale
 shark's sandwich.</i>

00:01:20.345 --> 00:01:21.447
<i> And then you get this sort of</i>

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.617
<i> you know, these guys
 actually suck the water in.</i>

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:27.653
<i> It's an incredible stationary
 feeding-gulping behavior.</i>

00:01:28.053 --> 00:01:31.457
I also spent a lot of time
with the local
Somali Afari fishermen.

00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:32.491
<i> 'Cause I wanted
 to document their</i>

00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:33.726
<i> relationship with the ocean.</i>

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:35.661
<i> I spent many nights
 out at sea with them</i>

00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:37.230
<i> and then one night after
 midnight, they go</i>

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.998
"Hey, you know,
we sometimes have

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:40.733
lots of whale sharks
around our boat at night."

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.902
And I go, "Whale sharks
don't feed at night."

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:44.137
They go, "Yes, they do."

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:46.739
<i> These guys have these sort
 of lights on their boats</i>

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:48.574
<i> and with those lights they
 attract small plankton</i>

00:01:48.574 --> 00:01:49.809
<i> which attracts bait fish.</i>

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:52.111
And they catch these
bait fish with nets.

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:53.979
And then they use
the bait to catch

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.581
on a hook to catch larger fish.

00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:59.285
And the whale sharks love
the free meal of plankton.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.919
<i> And they rub up against
 the boats and I'm going</i>

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:02.655
<i> "I have to take this picture."</i>

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:04.523
<i> No one had actually
 documented this before.</i>

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:07.093
So, I go in the water and
I'm using my flashes

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:09.629
and they ruin the complete
night time ambience.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.963
And the whale sharks
don't like it.

00:02:10.963 --> 00:02:12.198
And then I shoot without them

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:14.734
but the lights on these boats
are just way, way too dim.

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:18.404
You know, luckily,
I come prepared.

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:21.540
<i> And you know, at night, you
 know, we park the big boat</i>

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.776
<i>next to the small fishing boats
 and we turn on the light.</i>

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:25.978
<i> And the light attracts
 little plankton</i>

00:02:25.978 --> 00:02:27.447
<i> which attracts big plankton</i>

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:30.616
<i> which attracts little fish,
 which attracts bigger fish.</i>

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:32.384
<i> And then after an hour
 or two it attracted</i>

00:02:32.384 --> 00:02:33.853
<i> the world's biggest fish.</i>

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:37.357
<i> It's kind of weird because
 it's hard to, you know</i>

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:39.658
<i> get a perspective of
 size with whale sharks.</i>

00:02:39.658 --> 00:02:41.060
<i> But these are
 actually juveniles.</i>

00:02:41.527 --> 00:02:43.829
<i> This is an aggregation
 of sub-adults.</i>

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.130
<i>Now at first I was disappointed.</i>

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.599
"Oh, they are just
small whale sharks

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:47.967
just a hundred of them.
That sucks.

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:49.101
I wish they were bigger."

00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:50.369
( audience laughter )

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:52.105
When I was taking the images,

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:54.207
having them small actually
made all the difference.

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:55.542
Because you know,
you're under water,

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:58.644
<i> all you have is this
 very thin cone of light</i>

00:02:58.644 --> 00:03:00.246
<i> and you're in the dark
 and all you can see is</i>

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:01.914
<i> these whale sharks moving
 in and out of the light</i>

00:03:01.914 --> 00:03:04.049
<i> like ships, you know, looming
 in and out of the fog.</i>

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.317
<i> And then you get pictures like</i>

00:03:05.317 --> 00:03:06.385
<i> this.</i>

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.055
<i> You know, just kinda just
 coming out of the gloom.</i>

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:12.024
But I really wanted a
picture of the whale shark

00:03:12.024 --> 00:03:13.693
more interacting with the light.

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:15.661
I did this for day after
day and at the end I got

00:03:15.661 --> 00:03:16.696
this frame.

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:17.896
( audience captivated )

00:03:17.896 --> 00:03:20.165
<i> You know, the whale shark was
 vertically suction feeding</i>

00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:21.968
<i> for about half an hour
 in that position.</i>

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:24.236
<i>So, this was, you know, anybody
 could have taken that picture</i>

00:03:24.236 --> 00:03:25.671
<i> because he stood
 there for that long.</i>

00:03:25.671 --> 00:03:26.706
( audience laughter )

00:03:26.772 --> 00:03:30.008
Not much to point and shoot,
not much skill to bear.

00:03:30.008 --> 00:03:31.844
But with a larger whale shark

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:33.312
I would have gotten a
fin or half a head.

00:03:33.312 --> 00:03:35.314
So, it's only 'cause these
guys are juveniles.

00:03:35.647 --> 00:03:37.983
That is the only reason I was
able to get this picture.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.853
You know, from the Gulf
of Aden, Saudi Arabia.

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:43.756
<i> You know, my interest
 was mainly up on the</i>

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:46.959
<i> Iraq-Iran-Kuwait border.
 My mother despairs.</i>

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.561
<i> Every time she finds out
 where my next assignment is.</i>

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:52.898
<i> And, of course, armed guards
 wherever I went, you know.</i>

00:03:52.898 --> 00:03:54.700
And, this is a world of mud.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.602
Mud, mud and more mud.

00:03:56.602 --> 00:03:58.004
And we had to use a hovercraft.

00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:00.339
Star Wars,<i> right?
 I mean, come on!</i>

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.975
<i> In a hovercraft, it was
 just like the crazy...</i>

00:04:02.975 --> 00:04:04.010
<i> And why did I go there?</i>

00:04:04.176 --> 00:04:06.579
Well, I wanted to photograph
the animal that made these.

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.582
Now these are very,
very tiny mud walls.

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:12.852
<i> But, in a desert environment
like this, they are life savers.</i>

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:14.720
<i> Because basically
 they retain water.</i>

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.389
<i> And the animal that made them</i>

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:17.423
<i> are mud skippers.</i>

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:18.491
( audience gasps )

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:20.960
<i> Not your normal garden
 variety mudskipper.</i>

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.061
<i> Arabian mudskippers.</i>

00:04:22.394 --> 00:04:24.697
That big and this thick.

00:04:24.697 --> 00:04:27.065
<i> And they do these incredible
 courtship displays.</i>

00:04:27.065 --> 00:04:28.300
<i> They leap as high as they can</i>

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.104
<i>whichever male leaps the highest
 gets the female, I think.</i>

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.405
<i> They also have these
 cool fighting displays.</i>

00:04:33.405 --> 00:04:34.673
( audience surprised )

00:04:34.673 --> 00:04:37.376
<i> They puff each other up and
 they raise the dorsal</i>

00:04:37.376 --> 00:04:39.812
<i> and then they just stare at
 each other and they do all
 these sort of...</i>

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:43.148
<i> You know for these pictures,
 you lie in the mud for an hour</i>

00:04:43.148 --> 00:04:44.716
<i> before these fish
 come out of the hole.</i>

00:04:44.716 --> 00:04:47.686
So, you are stationary
for days to get

00:04:47.686 --> 00:04:48.720
you know, these little glimpses.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.989
But, yeah, I love these guys.

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:53.125
Like, "Oy!"
You can hear him
screaming right?

00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:56.061
"That's my female mudskipper,
or whatever."

00:04:56.061 --> 00:04:57.363
( audience laughter )

00:04:57.363 --> 00:04:58.630
Anyway, let's move on.

00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:01.901
You know, I moved on to
turtles on the Arabian Sea.

00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:03.603
And as I was shooting all
this great bio-diversity

00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:06.372
I'm going, "Hang on, I'm
not seeing any sharks."

00:05:06.805 --> 00:05:08.674
After the whale sharks, I hadn't
seen a single other shark.

00:05:08.674 --> 00:05:10.043
I'm like, what's going on here.

00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:13.379
And I figured it out when
I was you know, in Oman,

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:14.781
<i> photographing seasonal
 kelp forest communities</i>

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:15.815
<i> at Salalah.</i>

00:05:16.048 --> 00:05:19.118
<i> And one evening I was in this
 little place called Mirbat.</i>

00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:21.019
<i> It's this place that
 kind of time forgot.</i>

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:23.823
<i> It's this sort of old school
 Arab fishing village.</i>

00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:26.225
And there's this wall
of people at the port.

00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:28.627
And I kind of, you know gently
elbow my way through, you know.

00:05:28.627 --> 00:05:29.795
And as the crowd parts

00:05:29.795 --> 00:05:30.830
I see this.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.064
( audience sighing )

00:05:32.064 --> 00:05:33.966
<i> This is about 93 silky sharks.</i>

00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:35.701
<i> This is one boat's load.</i>

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:37.136
<i> And every hour
 another boat arrives</i>

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:39.237
<i> and offloads exactly the
 same number of sharks.</i>

00:05:39.237 --> 00:05:40.539
<i> So, the one night I was there</i>

00:05:40.706 --> 00:05:42.608
<i> I think there must've
 been a 1,000 silky sharks.</i>

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:44.210
<i> And then they auction
 everything off.</i>

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.578
<i> And at the end of the auction</i>

00:05:45.711 --> 00:05:47.546
<i> all the sharks are loaded
 into these freezer trucks.</i>

00:05:47.546 --> 00:05:48.881
<i> And they're taken away.</i>

00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:50.249
<i> And I wanted to know where</i>

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:51.950
<i> so I started following
 these trucks.</i>

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.452
<i>I ended up in these ice-houses.</i>

00:05:53.452 --> 00:05:54.954
<i> Now these trucks are
 not freezer trucks.</i>

00:05:54.954 --> 00:05:56.856
<i> They are insulated but
 they are badly insulated.</i>

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:58.490
<i> So, every, you know,
 few hundred kilometres</i>

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.992
<i> they have to restock with ice.</i>

00:05:59.992 --> 00:06:01.427
<i> And that's where they
 kind of, you know</i>

00:06:01.427 --> 00:06:03.262
<i> barter the sharks
 and resell them.</i>

00:06:03.262 --> 00:06:04.797
<i> And there I found out,
 and an actual fact</i>

00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:07.066
<i> all these sharks are going
 to Dubai. So...</i>

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.868
<i> I went to Dubai.</i>

00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:11.504
<i> And there I saw, you know</i>

00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:13.939
<i> dozens of Omani
 trucks offloading</i>

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:15.775
<i> large Arabian Sea sharks.</i>

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:18.243
<i> And you know, fins are
 only cut off there.</i>

00:06:18.243 --> 00:06:20.813
<i> And the meat goes to
 Bangladesh, goes to Pakistan,</i>

00:06:20.813 --> 00:06:22.648
<i> it goes to Sri Lanka
 for consumption.</i>

00:06:22.648 --> 00:06:24.950
<i> It's the cheapest sort of
 meat protein there is.</i>

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.418
<i> And the fins are
 exported to Asia</i>

00:06:26.418 --> 00:06:28.187
<i> for royal sums and
 princely sums.</i>

00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:30.155
And it appears that, over
the last couple of years

00:06:30.155 --> 00:06:32.858
Dubai has become the
fourth largest exporter

00:06:32.858 --> 00:06:34.594
of shark fins to
Hong Kong in the world.

00:06:34.594 --> 00:06:36.662
<i> And that is, you know, had
 really sort of bypassed</i>

00:06:36.662 --> 00:06:38.564
<i> most of the scientific
literature that I had reviewed.</i>

00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:40.399
<i>So, this was a massive surprise
 to actually be able to</i>

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:42.868
<i>document this trade route across
 the great Arabian Desert.</i>

00:06:43.535 --> 00:06:45.671
<i> And, you know, went to
 Hong Kong afterwards</i>

00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:47.672

<i> I think it was 140 different

<i> And that's where I found

00:06:58.183 --> 00:07:00.386
<i> You know the article
 was published 2012.</i>

00:07:00.386 --> 00:07:02.521
<i> A lot of conservation issues
 were addressed in it and</i>

00:07:02.521 --> 00:07:03.923
<i> you know, it kind
 of really began</i>

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:06.292
<i> a conversation in the
 Middle East as well about</i>

00:07:06.292 --> 00:07:08.361
