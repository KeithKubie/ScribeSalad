00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.460
 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.820
Watching movies and reading books about our favorite wizards

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.400
is already amazing and fun in its own right,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.000
but there's actually a lot of psychology found within the Harry Potter stories.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.840
Psychology is everywhere, even at Hogwarts.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.760
Here's 10 psychological lessons from Harry Potter.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.880
 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.040
One: the Hogwarts house system can enhance the social tribal effect.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.600
When groups face prejudice, their bond may become stronger,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.600
though this isn't always a good thing.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.740
There's quite a bit of prejudice against some of the houses, Slytherin in particular.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.720
If they feel the psychological weight of it,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.500
they're more likely to stick together and create an "us versus them" atmosphere,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.500
making them very loyal to their group.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.780
Two: Dobby inspired a psychological concept.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.360
The beloved Dobby actually has a concept named after him.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.180
The Dobby effect, coined by Nellisen and Zeelenberg in 2009,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.240
is when people over correct themselves, rightfully or not.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.880
After committing a wrong, guilt can be a good thing, as it encourages us to be moral,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.640
but the Dobby effect shows that it can be harmful too

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.700
when experienced in overly large proportions, causing people to invoke self punishment.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.420
Three: Harry Potter shows signs of PTSD.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.100
Post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, occurs after experiencing a traumatic event.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.900
Such as witnessing a terrorist attack, getting kidnapped,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.900
or suffering from childhood abuse.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.080
When you think about what Harry has to go through in the Dursley household

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.540
and during the second wizarding war,

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.500
it's not surprising for him to exhibit traits of PTSD.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.000
Some of the symptoms he displays include

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.480
reliving events through nightmares or flashbacks,

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.980
having difficulty talking about the traumatic events,

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.000
and feeling irritable and jittery.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.240
Four: Rita Skeeter is a metaphor for anxiety.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.680
Anxiety often turns relatively simple things into large scary problems.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.660
Rita Skeeter, the gossip columnist, does the same.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.600
Twisting tiny details into massive, over exaggerated headline stories

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.480
that have no truthful basis.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.480
Five: Ron Weasley suffers from arachnophobia.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.540
As spiders continuously show up through the series,

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.280
Ron confesses that he'd rather follow the butterflies.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.460
Six: Voldemort starts showing serial killer tropes from a young age.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.780
There's an entire arc of the series dedicated to building a psychological profile of Voldemort.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.320
During Harry's private lessons with Dumbledore,

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.300
they sift through memories of people who are connected to Voldemort.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.820
Some criminal stereotypes they find include

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.400
his loner nature, bullying tendencies,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.200
strong sense of superiority, and lack of empathy for living things.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.660
Seven: Draco's journey shows that nurture isn't everything.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.280
We don't always turn out the way we expect to.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.360
Draco, undoubtedly, has done some nasty things,

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.000
but who would have guessed that the childhood bully would turn out to be quite mature.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.920
He manages to move beyond the prejudice he grew up with,

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.220
and throws Harry the wands at the end of the series.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.360
It's a very interesting character arc, and you can't help but feel a little emotional.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.060
Eight: cognitive dissonance can put a whole society in danger.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.560
When Cornelius Fudge denies Voldemort's return as a result of cognitive dissonance,

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.560
the wizarding community is put in danger.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.020
Cognitive dissonance is when someone has two lines of thought that contradict each other.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.860
In this case, Fudge has been working tirelessly towards peace and safety,

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.960
yet there are signs of Voldemort's return,

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.380
causing him to come to hysterical conclusions.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.840
Consequently, the community loses valuable time they could have used

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.120
to prepare for confrontation with Voldemort.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.160
Nine: Sybill Trelawney exhibits signs of generalized anxiety disorder.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.800
Divination professor, Sybill Trelawney, is always jittery,

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.060
thinking of disasterous scenarios, and in fear of being judged.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.840
All red flags of generalized anxiety disorder.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.580
Ten: parasocial, or one way interaction with fictional characters, can help a healing process.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.020
People often state how the deaths, and subsequent grief throughout the Harry Potter series

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.020
have helped them deal with their own grief.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.120
Others can describe the series as relatable, comforting, and empowering,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.080
especially with the support of various character quotes.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.840
