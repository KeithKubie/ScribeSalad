<i> The first step to being buried
 alive turned out to be</i>

00:00:04.737 --> 00:00:06.873
<i> bribing a cemetery
 groundskeeper,</i>

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:07.840
<i> who was insane.</i>

00:00:07.873 --> 00:00:09.976 align:end position:100%
- You out here looking
for zombies?

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:11.811
- Beg your pardon?

00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:15.481
- Sometimes we get these meth-
head idiots lookin' for zombies.

00:00:15.514 --> 00:00:18.451 align:start position:0%
- Yeah, no, no, I'm just sad
about a dead person.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.356 align:end position:100%
- You masturbate on
the tombstones,

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:26.192 align:end position:100%
make sure you clean up
after your mess.

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:28.261 align:start position:0%
- Goes without saying.

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:31.330
<i> After that, my intern,
his girlfriend, and I were free</i>

00:00:31.363 --> 00:00:33.933
<i> to put our flimsy homemade
 coffin anywhere we wanted.</i>

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:38.538
My casket is equipped with an
air tube and a little light.

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:40.306
It is now 1:15 a.m.

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:43.242
At exactly 1:15 a.m. tomorrow,
you will dig me up.

00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:44.477
Ugh!

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.813 size:78% position:39%
- Rest in peace, Forrest.

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:49.015 align:start size:72% position:28%
- This part's more fun.

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:52.618
- As the sound of dirt piling
atop this coffin grows softer,

00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:55.721
I just find myself wanting
to call out,

00:00:55.754 --> 00:01:01.194
"Stop! I'm still alive!
Don't go!" You know?

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.429
Maybe the only thing more
terrifying than that sound

00:01:03.462 --> 00:01:05.631
is gonna be the moment
that it stops.

00:01:05.664 --> 00:01:09.735
[shoveling stops]

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:13.673
Yep.
That is more terrifying.

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:16.342
- Bye, Mr. MacNeil.
- Good luck.

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:19.712
-<i> I soon discovered that as
 morbid as this was,</i>

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:21.681
<i> and as lonely as it was,</i>

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:25.051
<i> it was mostly horrifically,
 oppressively boring.</i>

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:26.819
[snoring]

00:01:26.852 --> 00:01:29.622
<i> I slept for a very refreshing
 nine hours,</i>

00:01:29.655 --> 00:01:31.491
<i> but then I was bored again.</i>

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:36.129
<i> [video game beeping]</i>

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:38.631
I never get to play the games
on my phone, you know.

00:01:38.664 --> 00:01:39.966
I'm always so busy, but now--

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:44.137
<i> [phone rings]</i>
Oh! Suzanne.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.573
<i> I had not spoken with my
ex-wife Suzanne since my review</i>

00:01:47.606 --> 00:01:48.708
<i> of making our son's
 wish come true...</i>

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:51.244 align:start position:0%
- For mom and me to move in
with Joe Dale, Jr.

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.946
-<i> Sadly forced me to convince
 her to move in</i>

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.249
<i> with her frequently unfaithful
 boyfriend,</i>

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.017
<i> and now she was calling me.</i>

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.753
<i> Perhaps she had finally come
 to her senses.</i>

00:02:00.786 --> 00:02:03.556
<i> Maybe she was even willing to
 give us another chance.</i>

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:05.124
Hey!
How's it going?

00:02:05.157 --> 00:02:06.325
<i> - [phone cuts out]
 Trouble hearing you.</i>

00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:07.627
<i> Are you there?</i>

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.462
- Yes, I'm here.
I'm here, what's up?

00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:11.364
-<i> Very important news.
 So--</i>

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:12.765
- Okay, stop, stop, stop.

00:02:12.798 --> 00:02:15.935
All I heard was that you have
important news.

00:02:15.968 --> 00:02:18.304
-<i> [garbled]</i>
- I can't hear you.

00:02:18.337 --> 00:02:21.241
-<i> I-I'm getting married,
is what I'm trying to tell you.</i>

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:25.811
- Okay.

00:02:25.844 --> 00:02:26.913
<i> Far from coming to her senses,</i>

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:30.183
<i> she had now taken full leave
 of them.</i>

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:33.352
<i> What could I possibly say
 to this horrible news?</i>

00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:34.820
Uh, that's great.

00:02:34.853 --> 00:02:38.558
-<i> What?
 I can't hear you.</i>

00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:40.126
- That is great.

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.062
<i> Any hope I had ever had
 of being with Suzanne again,</i>

00:02:43.095 --> 00:02:45.264
<i> of putting our family back
 together,</i>

00:02:45.297 --> 00:02:48.034
<i> was now shut tighter than this
 cheap wooden box.</i>

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:49.402
-<i> Really, really hap--
 We're so happy.</i>

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:52.138
[phone beeps]
- Oh.

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:54.607
<i> Before that phone call,
 I felt completely</i>

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.509
<i> out of my element
 in this coffin.</i>

00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:58.342
<i> Now, I felt right at home.</i>
