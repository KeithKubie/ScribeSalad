00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.040
Here I have a chair. Which affords

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.090
sitting. This affordance exists, because of the

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:10.810
shape of the chair. Combined with the abilities and shape of the human body. The

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.370
same chair does not afford sitting for

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.330
an elephant. An affordance is the relationship between

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.970
an object, such as a chair. And

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.610
a person. Affordances enable particular kind of interaction

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.430
between people and objects. And the presence of

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.220
an affordance, is jointly determined by the properties

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.700
of the object. And of the abilities of

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.180
the person who is interacting with the object.
