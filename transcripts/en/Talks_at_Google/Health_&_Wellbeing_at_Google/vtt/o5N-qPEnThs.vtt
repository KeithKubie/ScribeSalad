[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.092 --> 00:00:09.702
DAVE: Good morning.

00:00:09.702 --> 00:00:12.360
AUDIENCE: Good morning.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.960
DAVE: So today's a
very exciting day.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.050
It marks the launch of our
Talks at Google Friendly Debate

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.800
Series, where we
bring together people

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.060
who take different
positions on key issues,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.060
with the hopes that
through their dialogue,

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.000
we're able to better understand
questions whose answers are

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
less clear cut.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.100
So today the question
we'll be exploring

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.970
is, what is the ideal diet?

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.940
And so I'd like to begin by
introducing our, moderator

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.907
Google's very own
Jesse Michael's.

00:00:47.907 --> 00:00:50.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.000
Jesse, Jesse is
a program manager

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.810
on machine intelligence,
with a particular affinity

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.952
towards dietary habits.

00:00:59.952 --> 00:01:02.285
Please join me in welcoming
to the stage Jesse Michaels.

00:01:02.285 --> 00:01:03.618
JESSE MICHAELS: Thank you, Dave.

00:01:03.618 --> 00:01:05.300
I really appreciate it.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.340
Yes, I do have a
particular affinity

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.670
towards dietary habits, mainly--

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.470
like Kip, actually,
I'm a hypochondriac,

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.170
so I'm always kind of thinking
about what is the ideal diet.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.160
And I think like a lot of
you, you read articles,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.310
you read press, you look
at what's out there,

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.500
and there are a lot
of experts saying

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.120
completely conflicting things.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.230
There's no kind of apparent
consensus on this issue.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.620
And so what I'm hoping
to get out of this

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.760
is kind of a rational
elucidation and dissection

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.610
of what is the ideal
diet from people

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.575
who have different viewpoints.

00:01:43.575 --> 00:01:45.450
But hopefully, we can
find some common ground

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.350
and we can give you some
resources to kind of look this

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.040
up for yourself as well.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.760
So I want to introduce
my panelists.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.650
So Dave Asprey.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.510
He's a businessman,
an author, a blogger.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.890
He's a biohacker.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.340
He's tried everything
on himself.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.040
He's a human guinea pig.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.680
He recently wrote
"Headstrong," which

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.979
is all about mental clarity and
peak performance and what diet

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.410
is conducive to that.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.520
And then famously, his
kind of foundational work

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.910
is "The Bulletproof
Diet," which involves

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.250
allocating 50% of your
diet to healthy fat.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.070
After him, we have we have Kip.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.130
Kip just came out with a
bombshell of a documentary

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.230
on Netflix.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.550
Kip Anderson, by the way.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.960
And it basically has
caused a lot of people

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.360
around the world to go vegan.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.760
And it talks about
all of the dangers

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.050
of eating meats, processed
meats, and dairy,

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.520
and it exposes a
lot, and I think

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.410
it's a really good documentary,
and you guys should definitely

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.430
check it out.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.650
Before that, he actually
had a documentary

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.190
called "Cowspiracy," which talks
about the environmental dangers

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.072
of eating meat.

00:02:57.072 --> 00:02:59.030
So I think that work kind
of speaks for itself,

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.330
and you guys should definitely
watch it if you haven't.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.090
And then we have Dr. Joel
Kahn, last but not least.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.100
You guys should go
on drjoelkahn.com.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.800
That really kind of is the
best kind of resource for him

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.844
in terms of his work.

00:03:13.844 --> 00:03:15.260
He'll give you
weekly health tips.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.330
So maybe you watch
Kip's documentary

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.980
and you want to go
vegan, Dr. Joel Kahn's

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.390
a great kind of practical
way to go vegan.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.070
He gives you a lot of
really helpful tips.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.950
He's been vegan for
25 years himself.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:36.140
He is a cardiologist, and he
focuses on preventative care

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.850
importantly.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.250
And then finally,
he has an actually

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.630
an Amazon best-selling book
called "The Whole Heart"

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.380
that you guys should
definitely check out.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.300
So without further
ado, I kind of

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.030
want to get into just
individually your backgrounds

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.810
and the kind of trajectory
of your thought.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.980
So, how you came to believe
what you currently believe

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.380
is the ideal diet through
your own personal experiences.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.156
We can start with you, Dave.

00:04:02.156 --> 00:04:04.040
DAVE ASPREY: I've
been a Silicon Valley

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.950
guy for most of my career.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.840
I used weigh 300 pounds.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.590
And I couldn't really see my
feet, much less touch them.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.320
As my career was taking
off, I was a co-founder

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.200
of a part of the company that
held Google's first server when

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.310
it was two guys from
Stanford and one server,

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.770
before Google built
its own data centers.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.550
And I started to have
really serious brain fog.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.740
So my career's taking
off, and I just

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.480
found I couldn't
really pay attention.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.570
My emotions were
all over the place.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.960
And I decided, well, I could
work out six days a week.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.610
In fact, I can cut my
calories to 1,800 calories.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.960
I could go vegan
before it was cool.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.010
And all I got was
fatter and more tired.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.980
After 18 months of
working out, I could bench

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.414
press all of my friends.

00:04:53.414 --> 00:04:54.830
And they didn't
work out, and they

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.246
were all thinner than I was,
and I ate less than they did.

00:04:57.246 --> 00:04:59.210
And at a certain point
I'm like, I'm trying,

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.751
but maybe I'm not
trying hard enough,

00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:02.810
and I thought it
was a moral failing.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.360
And eventually, I
said, you know what?

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.310
I'm a hacker.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.000
In fact, I can take the stuff
we use to manage the internet,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.920
and I can turn it
back on myself,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.960
and I can look at
things we know,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.554
understanding there's a lot
of things we don't know.

00:05:17.554 --> 00:05:19.220
When we work on
infrastructure, you only

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.803
know the stuff you
control, but you're

00:05:20.803 --> 00:05:23.210
going out across all the stuff
that other people control,

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.910
yet somehow you can still
make the results you want.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.940
We still don't know a huge
amount about our own biology,

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.210
but it's very easy for
us to say, all right,

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.260
here is a bunch of data
points, rather than

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.050
epidemiological studies
saying, some people eat this,

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.570
and not controlling for
millions of variables

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.840
that might matter, and sort
of make a conclusion there,

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.559
I could actually go out and say,
what am I testing right now,

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:46.100
is there a plausible
reason for this,

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.800
and do I see and feel
results that I can measure?

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.070
And I lost 100 pounds.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.240
I turned my brain back on.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.190
I'm younger and more
energetic on every level.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.930
I can.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.690
And it turns out there is
enormous amounts of data

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.840
that everyone listening to
this can go out and Google for.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.630
And you can find, oh, wait,
there are studies on PubMed

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.476
that say the exact opposite of
what things like the American

00:06:09.476 --> 00:06:11.100
Heart Association
and the recent attack

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.310
on coconut oil,
things like that--

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.950
oh, wait, you stopped looking
at all data after 1974

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.670
in order to make
those conclusions?

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.320
Well, what about the new data?

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.730
So it's becoming increasingly
hard to fool people,

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.670
but increasingly easy
to just simplify things.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.000
When I look at my favorite
animal protein product,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.604
it's spider venom.

00:06:31.604 --> 00:06:34.020
Wait, that's an animal protein
that's clearly bad for you.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.060
And my favorite
plant based protein

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.670
is ricin, the nerve gas.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.270
So anytime someone tells you
plant-based or animal-based,

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:43.510
those are meaningless terms.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.510
It's like a liquid diet.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.260
Well, was it gasoline,
or was it water?

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.750
Because they do different
things to your biology.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:49.840
And how is it prepared?

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:50.950
All these things matter.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.826
And I ended up with this
basic algorithm that works.

00:06:53.826 --> 00:06:55.200
And the algorithm
goes like this.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.031
Stop doing the things
that make you weak.

00:06:57.031 --> 00:06:58.530
You probably don't
know all of them,

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.250
but at least find some of them.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.250
Then do the things
that make you strong.

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.590
And most nutrition
research focuses

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.720
on just doing stuff
that makes you strong,

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.630
or these very broad
platitude-based things that

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.580
are so broad that
they caused you

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.490
to do things that make you weak
even if there is value in them.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.670
So it's a question of
having precision for you.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:21.210
And prime examples would be
if you eat processed meats,

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.670
they do one thing to you because
of a bacteria in your gut.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:26.170
If you eat unprocessed meats
that are fed a different thing,

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.020
it's actually a
different outcome.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.657
It even has different
environmental costs.

00:07:30.657 --> 00:07:32.490
So you look at the
system of the human body.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:33.810
You look at all the
things that are going in

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.310
that you can
measure, you realize

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.184
you're not measuring
almost everything that's

00:07:37.184 --> 00:07:39.900
going on in the world around
you that affects your biology.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.000
And then you start
course correcting.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.910
And for me, it led to
profound improvements

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:47.400
in cognitive
function, as well as

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.590
sort of effortlessly
maintaining the weight

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.840
that I wanted without
ever experiencing

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.160
hunger and cravings.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.810
And I quit being a raw vegan.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.340
In fact, it made me really sick.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.080
And a lot of people have
had problems with that.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.020
And there are other
people, like Joel

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.780
here, who have been
vegan for 25 years

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.860
and are still walking around.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.386
So I will say one
thing that I learned

00:08:08.386 --> 00:08:10.260
through the course of
all this, if you're not

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.630
covering your plate
with vegetables first,

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.172
you're doing it wrong.

00:08:14.172 --> 00:08:16.380
However, not all vegetables
do the same things to you

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.160
either, so you might want
to pay some attention there.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.800
So you have to get
the details for what

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.440
works for you, because
your ultimate diet may not

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.562
be the same as mine.

00:08:23.562 --> 00:08:25.020
But I guarantee
you, if you do less

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.650
of the stuff that makes you weak
with your genetics, your biome,

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.175
your mitochondrial DNA,
you're going to like it.

00:08:31.175 --> 00:08:32.549
And there's a list
of things that

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:34.331
make large swaths of
the population weak.

00:08:34.331 --> 00:08:35.789
So you just have
to figure out what

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:38.376
your own personal kryptonite
is, avoid that, and then

00:08:38.376 --> 00:08:40.500
play around with other
things, like macronutrients.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.458
JESSE MICHAELS: Got ya.

00:08:41.458 --> 00:08:44.420
Kip, I'm sure you have
a lot to say to that.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:48.150
KIP ANDERSEN: I'll keep it
a little shorter than that.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.250
So basically, it's really
started out as similar.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.810
I think our backgrounds
are similar as really truth

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:53.310
seekers.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.920
We're really trying to
find out what the truth is,

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.730
what the truth is.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:57.900
And I was a hypochondriac.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.550
I was a hardcore hypochondriac.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:03.660
I took, at 18 years old,
Metamucil every day for fiber.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:08.080
And my both sides were
diabetes and all these things.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.164
So I was really
hardcore into genetics.

00:09:10.164 --> 00:09:10.830
Like, oh my god.

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:11.556
I'm going to die.

00:09:11.556 --> 00:09:13.680
And then, I guess this is
the part where we differ,

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.510
where what my
decision was, what I

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:21.130
was trying to do under my
own experiments on myself

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.130
is I want to take other
things in consideration,

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:23.940
not just myself.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.156
A lot of people think of
health as just me, me, me.

00:09:26.156 --> 00:09:28.530
And I was getting to the point
where I was starting to do

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:32.280
a little bit of yoga, still
starting to see the bigger

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.520
picture of now that we're--

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.145
if anyone's seen the
film "Cowspiracy,"

00:09:35.145 --> 00:09:37.610
it goes into this
a little bit more.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.774
We're 7 billion
humans on this planet.

00:09:39.774 --> 00:09:41.190
When I think of
holistic health, I

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.530
don't think of holistic
health as my own body,

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.270
this physical being.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.890
Not only do I think of
health as mind/body,

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:51.390
but I sort started thinking
more of spiritual health, spirit

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.580
health, mind, body, spirit,
and then taking health

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.990
into consideration
of the entire planet,

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:58.520
and then taking health
in also consideration

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.500
of my personal moral compass.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.250
And then that's what
I said, rather than--

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.370
I guess you'd say
biohacking, I guess

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:07.770
I would call it bioharmonizing.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.900
Like, my whole thing is
about harmonizing myself

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.340
within this greater
picture of this planet,

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.030
especially at the
time we live in.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.369
Rather than Bulletproof
Coffee or Bulletproof Diet,

00:10:16.369 --> 00:10:18.035
you know we have
enough bullets arounds.

00:10:18.035 --> 00:10:19.243
It sounds like a Trump thing.

00:10:19.243 --> 00:10:22.250
I'd say more of something
like a harmony diet,

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.480
to incorporate myself
within the bigger picture.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.000
So that's why I started
experimenting different things,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.625
looking into the
environmental impacts.

00:10:29.625 --> 00:10:32.640
As you see with "Cowspiracy,"
interviewing different doctors.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.145
By no means is it
cherry picking,

00:10:34.145 --> 00:10:36.270
if anyone says that "What
the Health?" if anything,

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:42.170
it's finding gold flakes of
this murky industry-funded river

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:43.330
and finding out the truth.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:44.530
And then the other
thing I say is choose,

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:46.238
really-- there's one
thing about learning

00:10:46.238 --> 00:10:48.926
the truth, the
feeling the truth,

00:10:48.926 --> 00:10:51.300
and that's where you go to a
place like True North Health

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.760
Center, and you see
those four case studies

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.310
that people think are fake
in "What the Health?",

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.772
where they've reversed
their illnesses where

00:10:58.772 --> 00:11:01.230
they thought they were going
to die within weeks or months.

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:04.230
In three weeks, they're
off all the medications.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.190
And that is truth.

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.180
And I think it's one
other thing too, though--

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:08.910
this is kind of going
another question,

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.700
but we're at a time of
history we're people

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.080
are looking at this time.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:13.770
This time.

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:15.499
And there is only,
essentially, you

00:11:15.499 --> 00:11:17.790
look at different periods of
time, different movements,

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.210
whatever you call it, civil
rights, women's rights.

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:24.210
You know, more recently, gay
rights and transgender rights.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:25.230
They're all still going.

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.110
They're all still happening.

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:27.443
We've not resolved any of these.

00:11:27.443 --> 00:11:28.890
And the next one
is animal rights.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.050
And the next one is
about encompassing all,

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:32.395
that we are all equal.

00:11:32.395 --> 00:11:34.020
And that's where the
mind, body, spirit

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.780
comes in, and not only spiritual
health, but spiritual health

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.260
for the entire planet.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.600
And I think that's the
thing that people who get

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.683
lost in "What the Health?"

00:11:40.683 --> 00:11:44.646
is when we go to North Carolina,
regardless of four or five

00:11:44.646 --> 00:11:46.020
facts that we can
debate all day,

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.686
whether it's right
or wrong, because you

00:11:47.686 --> 00:11:49.500
can manipulate
nutritional studies,

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.200
but go to North Carolina
and see "I Love Bacon,"

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.520
or "I love meat."

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.320
Do you really?

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.217
Do you really?

00:11:56.217 --> 00:11:58.050
I know where my meat
comes from, so it's OK.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.190
Do you know the
animal was killed?

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:00.600
What slaughterhouse was that?

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.502
And would you really
kill your own animal?

00:12:02.502 --> 00:12:03.960
So that's a part
too, that you have

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.290
to look into consideration
of complete total health.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.000
And I think that's
where my journey leads

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.150
to "Cowspiracy" that goes
into "What the Health?"

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:15.870
is health is much bigger
than just me, I, and that's

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.070
all that matters.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.604
It's more about
harmonizing yourself

00:12:18.604 --> 00:12:20.520
with something that's
much greater, especially

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.960
with 7 billion people.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.335
JESSE MICHAELS: Doctor?

00:12:23.335 --> 00:12:25.560
JOEL KAHN: So my journey
to sit in the chair

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.800
today began when I was actually
18, and Jesse it's cool.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.110
But actually, I walked into
the dormitory cafeteria

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:34.890
at University of Michigan,
1977, and I became a plant eater

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:37.380
because the salad bar
attracted me and nothing else.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.420
So I've not had a
burger in 40 years.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.110
I'm 58 and a 1/2 years old.

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.930
Never taken a prescription drug.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:43.757
Quite stable.

00:12:43.757 --> 00:12:45.840
And I actually have more
energy than all my peers,

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.590
and they know that.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.798
And it irritates them,
because they like their burger

00:12:48.798 --> 00:12:49.890
and fries still.

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:52.264
But as I entered
medical training--

00:12:52.264 --> 00:12:54.430
and you know, I don't want
to talk anymore about me.

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.080
It doesn't really matter.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.740
We're all truth
seekers, but I do it

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.780
in a medical office,
where I feel completely

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.940
obligated to give
people direction

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.444
to maintain their health,
prevent disease, or reverse

00:13:05.444 --> 00:13:06.360
the disease they have.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.180
I think it's a very
high moral obligation,

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.240
and it's caused me to
be a constant student.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.570
If there was data
that I found that said

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:17.820
that patient with heart
disease eating meat

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.370
would improve their health,
I would recommend that

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.310
and routinely prescribe it,
because my moral obligation.

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:25.200
It doesn't matter what
I eat in my own home.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.033
It matters what's going
to be right for you.

00:13:27.033 --> 00:13:31.050
So I've had to seek that out
and try and synthesize and guide

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:31.900
people.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.450
There's some really
important people

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:34.950
in this town that
have dropped dead

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:36.270
of the disease I take care of.

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:37.728
I've been up at
3:00 in the morning

00:13:37.728 --> 00:13:39.690
taking care of heart
attacks for 30 years now.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:42.064
But I mean, a good friend of
mine, Dean [INAUDIBLE],, who

00:13:42.064 --> 00:13:45.150
was a big project manager
at Apple, 2013, playing

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.360
hockey dropped dead of a
90% blocked artery, unknown.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.000
Kirk Krikorian-- some you may
know that name, maybe not.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.650
Big time Silicon Valley
investor and such.

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:56.489
Surfing last year.

00:13:56.489 --> 00:13:58.530
Walking to his car, drops
dead of a heart attack.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.363
You guys might not know
this, the former CEO

00:14:00.363 --> 00:14:04.067
of Intel, Paul Otellini, four
weeks ago dropped dead at 66.

00:14:04.067 --> 00:14:05.400
I mean, these are tragic things.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.858
That's what I've
been dealing with.

00:14:06.858 --> 00:14:10.230
So I mean, the focus
is health promotion

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:14.220
I do believe there's a uniform
diet we could agree with,

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.840
the three of us sitting up here.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.060
There is a group called True
Health Initiative, which

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.980
has over 400 health
and nutrition experts

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.770
all over the world, very
different opinions, who've

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:26.624
agreed to come up with a core
kind of nutritional philosophy

00:14:26.624 --> 00:14:29.040
no matter where they are and
what they personally at home.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.650
And I'll leave it to Jesse to
maybe ask a few more questions,

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:33.070
and I'll share that with it.

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.850
But this is a relevant
conversation for you

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.280
in your 20's, because
we know from studies,

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.525
I am not here to really
fight with anybody.

00:14:40.525 --> 00:14:42.150
Dave kind of threw
out something called

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:45.060
PubMed, which is a National
Library of Medicine, 26 million

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.470
peer-reviewed medical articles.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.620
I live in PubMed, because if we
don't base our recommendations

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.910
on science, recognizing the
flaws, funding conflicts,

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:58.380
that there's more associations
and actual randomized trials.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.570
Nutrition trials are tough.

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:00.720
Let's get a million
people to eat

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.640
one way and a million
people to eat the other.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.470
Do that for 20 years
and solve these things.

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:05.261
It ain't happening.

00:15:05.261 --> 00:15:06.840
So we've got to
go with, you know,

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.680
eating too much x is
associated with y,

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.480
or we have nothing to stand on.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.150
But I think there
is a commonality.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.350
And in fact, none
of us here eat crap.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.350
None of us here pull into
fast food restaurants.

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:22.620
None of us here add sugar
in our food on purpose.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.140
You know, none of us here
barbecue things to a crisp

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.061
and eat all the toxic components
that come out of barbecuing

00:15:28.061 --> 00:15:30.560
called advanced glycation end
products, heterocyclic amines,

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.300
and such.

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.922
So there's a lot in common here.

00:15:32.922 --> 00:15:35.130
And I think that's important
as you walk out of here.

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:35.820
You know?

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.000
Don't go on your way home,
pick up bucket of KFC,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.910
even if it has a Susan G.
Komen Breast Cancer Prevention

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:44.004
symbol on it.

00:15:44.004 --> 00:15:45.420
And don't go buy
Fruit Loops if it

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.920
has the American
Heart Association

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:47.970
symbol for whole grains.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:48.880
Eat whole grains.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.700
In my world, just
don't do it in a way

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.490
that's perverse to your health.

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:53.430
JESSE MICHAELS: Cool.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:58.020
I want to kind of establish
where the commonalities are,

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.130
and then where the kind
of sticking points are.

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:03.240
So I think everybody
on this panel

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.075
is pretty against like,
processed meats, for example.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.320
You're a proponent of grass fed.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.320
JOEL KAHN: I like grass.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.070
JESSE MICHAELS: You like grass.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:14.810
Exactly.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:17.680
You're full vegan.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.750
Correct.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:21.600
And so is that
really-- like, I want

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.300
to establish a framework for
what we actually disagree on.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.724
Is that it, or do you guys
disagree on more than that?

00:16:26.724 --> 00:16:28.140
DAVE ASPREY: I
actually calculated

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.200
the deaths per calorie
of The Bulletproof Diet.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.300
I was in Tibet,
where I discovered

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.270
yak butter tea that was the
genesis for Bulletproof Coffee.

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:38.820
And I was vegetarian
at the time.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.340
And I said, hey,
Mr. Llama, the guy

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.550
who leads the monastery
at 15,000 feet.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:47.091
And I said, that's a yak
skin on your prayer pole,

00:16:47.091 --> 00:16:48.840
and your sign over
there says "No killing,

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.340
no lying, no drugs."

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.381
So you're a hypocrite.

00:16:51.381 --> 00:16:52.380
And he started laughing.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:56.130
He goes, well, one
death feeds everyone.

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:58.500
And we talked about
it for about an hour.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.080
And I live on an organic farm.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.370
We raise our own sheep.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:03.750
I've been to the slaughterhouse.

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:05.974
I haven't had a grain-fed
animal in 10 years.

00:17:05.974 --> 00:17:07.890
And if you're eating
grain-fed meat right now,

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:08.817
you're doing it wrong.

00:17:08.817 --> 00:17:09.900
You're harming the planet.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.130
You're harming yourself.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.800
Bottom line is when you
feed that stuff to a cow,

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.930
especially if it's
not even organic,

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:17.960
and you're getting
glyphosate in there,

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.650
you're getting
antibiotic residues

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:21.930
that cause your gut bacteria
to change, which makes

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:24.329
them create toxic compounds.

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:27.420
So I think for me, soil
integrity and ocean integrity

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.850
is at the root of the
recommendations that I make,

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:33.420
because you will not be a high
performance human if you live

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.300
in a world full of crap around
you that's a result of the diet

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.300
you make.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.260
And that's an area where
I think all of us agree,

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:41.830
it's not just about us.

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:44.120
It's about how we feel.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.620
And I also think that all of
us are in alignment on the fact

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:47.880
that we want to feel
a lot of energy.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.050
Because if you make it
about everything around you,

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:52.377
and you like crap all the
time, and you're struggling,

00:17:52.377 --> 00:17:53.960
and your brain doesn't
work very well,

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.445
you are wasting all the
calories you put into your body

00:17:56.445 --> 00:17:58.320
because you're not
getting a return on those.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.310
And that's something
that happened

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:00.310
to me in a lot of my life.

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:02.018
And like, I will not
allow that to happen

00:18:02.018 --> 00:18:04.542
to anyone that I help today.

00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:05.375
JESSE MICHAELS: Kip?

00:18:05.375 --> 00:18:08.010
KIP ANDERSEN: Just one
thing on the grass-fed beef.

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:09.900
If anyone's watched
"Cowspiracy,"

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.720
we don't even talk about
factory-farmed beef.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.289
We go straight
into, OK, everybody

00:18:14.289 --> 00:18:15.330
knows that's bad for you.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:18.600
Grass-fed beef as
according to land

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.670
use-- these are things
that are not debatable.

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:23.910
Land use-- and you have sheep--

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:27.614
for a grass-fed cow takes
five to 10 times as much land.

00:18:27.614 --> 00:18:29.280
So the part that's
debatable, greenhouse

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.810
gases, that's debatable.

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:32.310
What's not debatable
is land use.

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:33.726
We have a part in
"Cowpiracy" that

00:18:33.726 --> 00:18:38.250
showed if everyone had two
scoops of butter, cow fat,

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:42.120
and ate grass-fed beef, of how
much land use it would cover.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.620
Just America would
go north of Canada.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:45.870
This is every square inch.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:49.590
This would be leveled, all
the way down to Brazil.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.450
And that is not one
other single animal

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:55.540
can live where there's
pasteurized grass-fed beef.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.290
That's why all the wolves are
killed, all the bears, all

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:02.010
the coyotes, while there's
more horses round up, living

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:04.360
in holding cells than are free.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.610
And that is not factory farm.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:07.110
That is grass-fed.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.810
The reason why is land use.

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:13.260
Land use, and they
live 35% longer,

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.970
so they're using more resources.

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:17.760
So the whole grass-fed thing
is just a marketing term,

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.230
you know, about
regenerating soil

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:23.010
that's already been
exposed of what that is.

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:24.720
Only 15% come out--

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.750
when you have any animal,
and you whatever you eat,

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.930
an animal, only about 15%,
20%, comes back in the land,

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:33.220
so you're regenerating
hardly anything.

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.160
It's extremely inefficient.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.410
And I think just the other
thing that we disag--

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.010
it's very important to
note of you mentioning,

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:44.640
like when you did this
biohacking and losing weight,

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.920
it's very important
to recognize--

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:50.070
and you say this openly--
that you were on steroids

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:53.010
and testosterone and legal,
as you call it, "meth,"

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.292
but safer, for eight years.

00:19:55.292 --> 00:19:56.750
And I think that's
very important--

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:57.416
DAVE ASPREY: No.

00:19:57.416 --> 00:19:58.320
That is false.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.335
Just so we can be
really clear on that.

00:19:59.335 --> 00:20:00.043
KIP ANDERSEN: OK.

00:20:00.043 --> 00:20:04.620
Well, it was medophenol,
or some sort of speed.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.820
If I am jacked up on--

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:06.150
DAVE ASPREY: It's
not speed, dude.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:07.020
Get your science right.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:07.895
KIP ANDERSEN: OK, OK.

00:20:07.895 --> 00:20:09.720
Something that's
for narcoleptics.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.990
Does anyone know
what narcolepsy is?

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:14.820
It's someone who takes
that for steroids.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.320
And I think it's
just very important

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.820
to note that that's
not left out.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.230
Because that's very
important in this equation.

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:23.160
So we can do this without
getting jacked up on drugs--

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:23.280
DAVE ASPREY: All right.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:23.946
Here's the deal.

00:20:23.946 --> 00:20:26.250
I went off the stuff
for three years

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:27.900
while developing The
Bulletproof Diet.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:31.140
The fact that I use cognitive
enhancers kicks ass.

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:32.940
And the fact that
you're not doing them

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:36.689
might be why there's cigars
on hot dog buns in your movie.

00:20:36.689 --> 00:20:37.480
KIP ANDERSEN: What?

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.970
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:39.240
DAVE ASPREY: All right.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:39.650
All right.

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:40.150
All right.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:40.670
All right.

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:41.170
OK.

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:41.270
So--

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:42.400
JOEL KAHN: I'm
gonna bring it back.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.160
I'm actually a
militant vegan blogger.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.210
KIP ANDERSEN:
That's an oxymoron.

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.918
JOEL KAHN: Mike
[INAUDIBLE] labeled that.

00:20:46.918 --> 00:20:49.170
But I'm in a very loving
and harmonious mood today.

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:50.810
I'm just excited
to be at Google,

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:52.330
and all your people out there.

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:54.420
I will say one,
and only one thing.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.512
Dave may not have seen it.

00:20:55.512 --> 00:20:56.220
May have seen it.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:21:00.020
October 2, 2017,
127-page publication

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.490
of Oxford University on the
impact of grass-fed beef

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:03.790
on the environment.

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:07.170
It's as deleterious to
greenhouse gas production

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:09.780
as his CAFOO-based,
grain-fed beef.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.150
According to science, and
I'm always going to science.

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:13.441
I don't really want an opinion.

00:21:13.441 --> 00:21:14.300
I want science.

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:15.990
I trust doctors at universities.

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:17.080
I want to bring this
together, though.

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.210
I've mentioned something called
the True Health Initiative.

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:20.530
It's not a paid position.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:24.300
It's over 400 scientists and
physicians and dieticians

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:25.050
that have come up.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.180
And I want to give you that
core definition that we use,

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:29.100
because I want you to walk
out of here with something

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:29.600
you can do.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.954
So number one, eat
minimally processed foods.

00:21:31.954 --> 00:21:33.870
I think all three of us
will say that's right.

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:35.520
That's not the middle
of the grocery store.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.061
That's not vending
machines, usually.

00:21:37.061 --> 00:21:38.064
That's not fast food.

00:21:38.064 --> 00:21:39.230
That's not gas station food.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.710
Eat minimally processed.

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:41.030
Eat close to nature.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:42.480
If you can find
farmer's markets,

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.040
if you can find produce--

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.350
frozen vegetables
are often better

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:48.810
than stuff that's
been transported

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:51.457
2,000 miles from California
to my home in Detroit.

00:21:51.457 --> 00:21:52.290
Eat close to nature.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:54.850
Number three is eat a
predominately a plant-based

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:55.350
diet.

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:56.280
Those aren't my words.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.290
It doesn't say exclusively.

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:00.270
The plate needs to be full.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:02.400
The USDA says that
half your plate should

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.492
be fruits and vegetables.

00:22:03.492 --> 00:22:04.950
The Harvard School
of Public Health

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:06.952
says half your plates are
fruits and vegetables.

00:22:06.952 --> 00:22:08.410
How many people do
that in America?

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:09.440
Less than 3%.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.440
So predominantly plants.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.560
And your liquid should
be predominantly

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.780
water, not sugar-sweetened
beverages, not all kinds

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:19.350
of energized drinks that are
putting chemicals in you,

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.395
and particularly, refined
sugars, you don't need.

00:22:21.395 --> 00:22:23.270
We have to be very
careful about the language

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:25.020
too, because there's
all kinds of carbs,

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.186
there's all kinds of sugars.

00:22:26.186 --> 00:22:27.900
Are they added in an orange?

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.990
Are they natural in an orange?

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:32.700
Are they added in a soda?

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:35.340
And you add to that seven to
eight hours of sleep a night,

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.010
you add regular physical
activity, you add community,

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.420
you add socialization,
and social support,

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:42.330
you prevent disease
and you promote health,

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.810
whether you're in Okinawa,
whether you're in Sardinia,

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:47.940
whether you're in Costa Rica,
whether you're in Loma Linda,

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.040
whether you're here
in Mountain View.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.790
I mean, it isn't that hard.

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:55.150
So if you like that three
or four close to nature,

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:56.910
minimally processed,
predominantly plants,

00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:58.650
and you want to put
some other stuff on it,

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:00.108
you're probably on
the right track,

00:23:00.108 --> 00:23:03.139
because you're doing better
than you know 3/4 and 80%

00:23:03.139 --> 00:23:05.430
of people that don't have
their own animals in the yard

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:08.247
and don't have access
to the kind of food

00:23:08.247 --> 00:23:09.080
we're talking about.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.240
We're all sort of
elitist eaters,

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.325
either because of spiritual,
because of environmental.

00:23:14.325 --> 00:23:16.200
In my case, predominantly
because of medical.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.580
I think you have to be--

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:19.880
and one of the questions
Jessie prepared us for,

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:20.990
where does moderation--

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.740
I am not--

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.290
I don't think any of us are
moderate eaters on the panel.

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:27.500
I'm an exquisitely
careful eater,

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:29.090
and I've done that for 40 years.

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:31.940
And I teach my patients be
moderate in your exercise.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.352
Be fanatic about the care
you put in your body.

00:23:34.352 --> 00:23:35.810
I think Dave would
agree with that.

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:37.605
He's fanatic about what
he puts in his body

00:23:37.605 --> 00:23:38.480
in a different sense.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.254
But there's a lot in common
here that would bring up

00:23:41.254 --> 00:23:42.170
the health of America.

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:45.020
JESSE MICHAELS: Dr. Kahn, I
want to press you on one thing.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.730
Just the grass-fed beef.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:48.890
Both you and Kip spoke
to kind of just negative

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.950
environmental repercussions.

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:54.232
Do you think it's not
healthy as well, and why?

00:23:54.232 --> 00:23:55.940
JOEL KAHN: Just a
quick answer, because I

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.130
do want to be fair to time.

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:00.922
It's an elitist
question in that 95

00:24:00.922 --> 00:24:02.630
plus percent of the
meat eaten in America

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:03.620
is not grass-fed beef.

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.110
It's still what's called
CAFO factory farmed beef.

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.780
We all agree that is
the worst of scenarios.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.000
To cruelty to animals,
cruelty to workers,

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.320
disease in workers,
environmental destruction.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.730
And the cool thing is with
all these ag-gag laws,

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.954
now drones are flying
over these places

00:24:18.954 --> 00:24:20.870
and making movies that
couldn't be made before

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:23.510
of these pools of
crap from animals

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:26.510
that are exploding and going
into the waters and the ground.

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:28.640
Why do we have arsenic
in rice and chicken?

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.857
Because there's just been
exposures of all these

00:24:30.857 --> 00:24:31.940
toxins in the environment.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.210
It's horrible.

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:34.130
So we all agree.

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:34.797
Shut those down.

00:24:34.797 --> 00:24:36.338
And that's not going
to happen quick.

00:24:36.338 --> 00:24:36.960
That's Tyson.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.450
That Smithfield.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:38.951
Conagra.

00:24:38.951 --> 00:24:40.866
These are the biggest,
most powerful companies

00:24:40.866 --> 00:24:41.570
with lobbies.

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:44.230
But you should be concerned
that 95-plus percent of the meat

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:45.980
in America is toxic.

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.320
Dave agreed in a blog
he wrote that meat

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.150
is like smoking if we're
talking about processed meat.

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:52.250
And we all agree to that.

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:53.340
I mean, it's horrible.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.040
But it's what
you're going to eat

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.020
unless you're exquisitely
careful about what

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.074
you put in your body.

00:24:58.074 --> 00:24:59.990
This is a good age to
do it at, because you'll

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:01.190
reap the benefits.

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:02.570
Science is progressing.

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.490
You guys can all
live over 100 if you

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:05.810
take good care of yourself now.

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:06.890
You really can, and
wear a seat belt.

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:07.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:09.066
KIP ANDERSEN:
What's your thoughts

00:25:09.066 --> 00:25:11.390
on whether grass-fed
beef is better though?

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:13.700
JOEL KAHN: Well, you know,
there's little clues.

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.410
There is science--
again, I like science.

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:18.020
There's clues that grass-fed
beef versus conventional beef

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:21.340
has some health benefits
over the CAFO-raised beef.

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:24.080
The factory-farmed beef, in
terms of omega-3 and some

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:24.730
nutrients.

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:26.879
There is no beef on the
planet that has fiber.

00:25:26.879 --> 00:25:28.670
There's no beef on the
planet that has much

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:30.210
in the way of rich vitamins.

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:31.460
We know those are plant-based.

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.793
But we all agree your plate
should be either completely,

00:25:33.793 --> 00:25:36.050
or to a large extent,
covered with plants.

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:39.140
That's already elitist
compared to the 1% to 3%

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.360
of Americans that actually
eat five servings of fruit

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.420
and vegetables a day.

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.660
We want you to do that.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.060
There's this coolest
study out there.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.440
You take a hospital hamburger.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.640
Literally, and I
love it, because I

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.590
think hospital food is the
biggest damn embarrassment

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:52.895
in the United States right now.

00:25:52.895 --> 00:25:54.770
You take a hospital
hamburger and you eat it,

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:57.186
and you can measure within 45
minutes if your arteries are

00:25:57.186 --> 00:26:00.170
functioning less well than
before the hospital hamburger.

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:02.597
You throw a big slab of
avocado or a big salad

00:26:02.597 --> 00:26:04.430
along with the hamburger,
you bring yourself

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:05.600
back up to neutral.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.310
So whatever you're
eating, always

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:08.900
add the plants to the meal.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.300
Again, there's commonality
of opinion here.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:16.130
Grass-fed beef,
again, 90% plus--

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:18.910
John Mackey spoke here,
the founder of Whole Foods.

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:23.540
His kind of philosophy is eat
plants 90% and the last 10%

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.390
is your decision.

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:27.260
There's certain
patients I don't think

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.460
that's true for as
a medical doctor.

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.010
But as a societal
recommendation,

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:33.100
that's cool by me.

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:34.340
JESSE MICHAELS: OK.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.670
Assuming diets aren't
one size fits all,

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:39.950
how do you go about kind
of figuring out what

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:41.930
the best ideal diet is for you?

00:26:44.714 --> 00:26:47.450
DAVE ASPREY: One of the things
I did on the Bulletproof Diet

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:50.420
roadmap, which is a free
download on the website,

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:54.560
and it's basically my first
big book in an infographic,

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:58.310
is to say, look, there's
a bunch of suspect foods.

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:00.830
And one of the examples here
is the nightshade family.

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:03.992
These are potatoes, tomatoes,
eggplant, bell peppers,

00:27:03.992 --> 00:27:04.700
things like that.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.970
Roughly a third of cases
of rheumatoid arthritis

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:09.440
are caused by eating this.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.132
And what happens is
that animals don't

00:27:12.132 --> 00:27:13.340
want you to eat their babies.

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.173
That's why we're so
protective of our young.

00:27:15.173 --> 00:27:17.300
Well, plants really can't
do those same things,

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:20.270
so they cover their babies
in protective compounds.

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:21.800
That's why if you
go into the park

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.000
and you eat most of
the plants there,

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.791
you'll get profoundly
sick, because they're

00:27:24.791 --> 00:27:26.120
protecting themselves from you.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.510
So some of us have genetic
reasons that we will not

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:30.560
handle those well.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.420
If you give me
something that's cooked

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:34.290
with a little sprinkle
of cayenne pepper,

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.560
I'll have the arthritis
back in my knee

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.450
that I've had since I was 14.

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:40.010
It's caused by food.

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:42.890
That said, cayenne is
really a healthy compound

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:44.300
for the other 2/3 of people.

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.760
So I go through these four big
categories of plant defense

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.640
systems that are put in by
mother nature, not by man,

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.520
and say, these may not be
compatible with your biology,

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.980
but they might be compatible
with the biology of someone

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:55.830
next to you.

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:58.100
So you need to eliminate
all of those likely suspects

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.210
for a couple of weeks
and see how you feel,

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:03.226
and then go out and have
like, pizza, beer, cheesecake,

00:28:03.226 --> 00:28:05.600
whatever bad stuff you can
think of and just be like, oh,

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.674
my god, that's how
I used to feel.

00:28:08.674 --> 00:28:10.340
All of that stuff
came back, and then go

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:11.798
through the process
of elimination.

00:28:11.798 --> 00:28:13.545
It is not the same for everyone.

00:28:13.545 --> 00:28:15.170
JESSE MICHAELS: You
guys would probably

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:16.540
say a lot of the foods--

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.740
JOEL KAHN: I'll grab
a quickie on that.

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:20.582
So if it's not
one diet fits all,

00:28:20.582 --> 00:28:22.040
and I don't know
that we know that.

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.100
I don't know that we couldn't
put everybody on a single diet

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.450
and their health would blossom.

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:27.510
You know what I would choose?

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:29.093
It would be a
well-constructed rainbow

00:28:29.093 --> 00:28:32.450
diet of minimally processed
plant-based foods.

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:34.120
It works real well
for disease processes

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.170
to eat that way according
to medical science,

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:38.060
and certainly in my
field, cardiology.

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.775
But there is such
a thing, if you

00:28:39.775 --> 00:28:41.900
don't feel well, if you've
got brain fog, if you've

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.970
got bloating, if
you've got joint pain,

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:45.580
do an elimination diet.

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:47.370
Dave and I share
a friend JJ Virgin

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:51.860
who wrote a rather good book
called "The Virgin Diet."

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:53.104
So you eliminate dairy.

00:28:53.104 --> 00:28:54.770
See how you feel for
six to eight weeks.

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:57.530
Very common, not just
the bloating and the gas.

00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:58.730
My wife was that example.

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:00.170
I hope she doesn't
mind my saying.

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:03.740
But when we walked into that
dorm cafeteria 40 years ago

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:06.121
and she stopped eating dairy,
in a week she felt better.

00:29:06.121 --> 00:29:08.370
She thought it was just
Jewish food made you feel bad.

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:11.900
It turns out it was dairy in the
Jewish food made her feel bad.

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:13.220
You know, she's enjoyed that.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:13.880
So do that.

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.260
Try gluten-free.

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:18.142
I don't think America needs
a gluten-free 100% of people,

00:29:18.142 --> 00:29:20.350
but there are people with
celiac disease undiagnosed.

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:22.509
There's people who have
celiac sensitivity.

00:29:22.509 --> 00:29:23.550
Do that for six to eight.

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:26.714
It might even take three months
to see how better you feel now.

00:29:26.714 --> 00:29:28.130
Now, I will argue
with you, if you

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:29.838
don't need to be
gluten-free, the science

00:29:29.838 --> 00:29:32.300
says, particularly if
you're buying processed,

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:35.932
rice-based bread substitutes,
which are common everywhere,

00:29:35.932 --> 00:29:37.640
you may not be doing
your health a favor.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.170
So elimination diet
is a way to do it.

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:43.476
There are a lot of people who
will do a 21-day Daniel fast.

00:29:43.476 --> 00:29:45.350
Maybe you've heard of
that in churches, which

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:46.641
is based on the Book of Daniel.

00:29:46.641 --> 00:29:48.830
It's kind of a plant-based
religious thing.

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:51.170
But the medical documentation
from the University

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:53.844
of Tennessee in Memphis is
blood sugar, C-reactive protein,

00:29:53.844 --> 00:29:55.760
blood pressure, blood
cholesterol will go down

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.610
in three weeks by doing kind
of that kind of elimination.

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:00.950
And then go back and add
foods in one at a time.

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.614
Very logical way to
see what's bugging you.

00:30:03.614 --> 00:30:05.030
KIP ANDERSEN: Just
to add to that,

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:08.210
because we asked every
single doctor in our film,

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:10.909
oh, you hear, oh, I've been
vegan for two weeks, or three

00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:11.950
weeks, or whatever it is.

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:15.320
Or at least people say,
and I don't feel good.

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.285
What is going on?

00:30:17.285 --> 00:30:18.850
The bottom line they
all kind of said

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:21.860
is that get tested
for what's going on.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:26.540
I think Dr. Goldhamer says,
there's nothing in dead rotting

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:29.100
animal flesh, whether it's
you just killed or not,

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:31.780
in animal flesh that you
cannot get somewhere else.

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:33.164
And you so find out.

00:30:33.164 --> 00:30:34.580
If you're not
feeling well, you're

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:35.730
not having the right diet.

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:38.030
There's maybe something that you
can tweak yourself, your diet

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:38.580
to.

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.760
But you can
substitute everything

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.540
with plant-based foods.

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:43.850
If you love cheese, like I do--

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:45.700
I was a hardcore cheeseholic.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.200
When I got off cheese, when I
went vegan for the first three

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.880
weeks, I've felt
the best I've ever

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.470
had in my life to this day.

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:53.900
But now finally, I've
been vegan 10 years, just

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:56.617
in the past year and a
half to two years, now

00:30:56.617 --> 00:30:58.950
I have nut cheeses again,
because they're actually good.

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:01.610
So that's the main
thing, is the takeaway.

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:03.500
If you have something
to tweak to your diet,

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.290
it's Keto or whatever, or
even if it's fat or not fat,

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:08.624
you can have a plant-based
version, and it's incredible,

00:31:08.624 --> 00:31:09.540
and it's good for you.

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:11.160
Not only for good
for you mentally,

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.410
physically, spiritually, but
it's good for the planet,

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:15.250
and you don't have
to kill any animals.

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:16.190
Bonus all around.

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:17.180
JOEL KAHN: I just want to
jump in there for a minute.

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:19.110
The hottest diet right
now in Silicon Valley

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:20.901
according to the
newspaper almost every day

00:31:20.901 --> 00:31:23.000
is the keto diet,
ketogenic diet.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.310
Low carb, relatively high fat,
and brain power, and the rest.

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:28.910
And I'm not even mimicking it.

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:30.740
In fact, there's a
new startup this week,

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:32.690
you can now buy ketone
bodies in a bottle,

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:34.880
three bottles for
$100, to enhance

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.050
your athletic performance.

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:37.585
There are plant-based
keto diets.

00:31:37.585 --> 00:31:39.710
There's a Facebook user
page in the last few months

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:43.100
that's grown to enormous numbers
of plant-based ketogenic diet.

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:46.940
But more important, science
rules to me, Valter Longo, PhD,

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:49.430
is the world's leading expert
on aging and longevity.

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:51.590
He's the head of a
Biogerontology Research

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:54.170
Institute in Los Angeles at USC.

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:56.830
He's got a plant-based
ketogenic five day

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:58.880
a month diet I use
in all my patients.

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:02.480
It's amazing and transformative
to eat nuts, olives,

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:05.330
60% of calories from
fat, very low protein,

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:07.520
because protein
activates aging pathways.

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.860
No added sugar, because
everybody hates sugar.

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:11.120
Nobody loves sugar.

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:14.000
We can debate what sugar
does to your health status,

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.170
but we don't like it.

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:18.110
And the results that have been
published in animals and humans

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:21.470
with a plant-based,
five-day ketogenic diet

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:23.210
are actually
transformative in terms

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:26.140
of multiple sclerosis,
brain growth, BDNF,

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:27.140
a protein in your brain.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.146
But just getting a
flat belly again.

00:32:29.146 --> 00:32:30.770
So there are all
these different paths.

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:31.894
I just wanted to shout out.

00:32:31.894 --> 00:32:33.800
But even in Silicon
Valley, you can

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:37.340
be on the cutting edge of
what seems to be a trend,

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:40.760
but also do it in a way that
might be a little more helpful,

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:41.930
in my opinion.

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:44.840
JESSE MICHAELS: Dave, if you
can get all of your protein

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:48.830
from plants and you can do a
plant-based ketogenic diet,

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:52.130
why are you a big fan of
grass-fed beef and other meats?

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:54.570
DAVE ASPREY: There are these
things called cell membranes

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:55.190
in the body.

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:58.010
We like to think that we have
this membrane around ourselves,

00:32:58.010 --> 00:33:01.160
but it's actually made
of tiny droplets of fat.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.740
And all of our hormones are
made out of cholesterol.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.330
And very interesting
new research

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:08.630
just came out that shows that
the plaque in your arteries

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:11.120
doesn't come from the
food that you eat.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.470
It actually comes from bacteria.

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:13.470
JOEL KAHN: It's a maybe.

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:14.110
DAVE ASPREY: In the gut.

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:15.020
JOEL KAHN: But it is new.

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:16.800
DAVE ASPREY: Yeah,
well, it's that whole I

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.493
like science thing.

00:33:17.493 --> 00:33:18.460
JOEL KAHN: It's one study.

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:19.085
It's one study.

00:33:19.085 --> 00:33:20.037
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:20.037 --> 00:33:21.120
DAVE ASPREY: I don't know.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.200
It's one study, though--

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.075
JOEL KAHN: Versus 110
years of other studies.

00:33:24.075 --> 00:33:25.617
But there is one
new study, I agree.

00:33:25.617 --> 00:33:27.450
DAVE ASPREY: This is
that whole epidemiology

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:30.390
versus understanding the
core mechanisms of life.

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:32.952
When we analyze the fats and
we look at exactly what they're

00:33:32.952 --> 00:33:35.410
made of, we're like, oh, those
fats don't come from plants.

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:38.370
They don't come from animals.

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:40.006
They come from
bacteria, which means

00:33:40.006 --> 00:33:41.880
we've got a problem with
bacteria in the gut.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.640
So if you're eating sugar,
you're eating these CAFO meats,

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.350
you're going to be
causing that problem.

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:48.840
That said, if you want to
have adequate testosterone

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.756
production, it's
really helpful to have

00:33:51.756 --> 00:33:53.380
some of these animal
fats in your diet,

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:54.210
to have healthy membranes.

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:55.710
Because the bottom
line is we actually

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:56.850
aren't made out of plants.

00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:59.220
Like, if you look around,
we are made out of animals

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:00.780
because we are animals.

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:03.540
We have a very long
history of eating animals.

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:06.720
And I've looked a lot
at monoculture habitat

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.436
destruction.

00:34:07.436 --> 00:34:09.060
And if you've ever
seen what a field of

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.670
soybeans does to all
of the animals that

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:12.920
are killed by tractors--

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.840
KIP ANDERSEN: They're
there to feed cows.

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:15.420
I mean--

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:17.630
DAVE ASPREY: I think vegetarians
eat soybeans last time I

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:18.130
checked.

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:20.130
KIP ANDERSEN: 90% of
all soy is fed to cows.

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:21.838
DAVE ASPREY: Hey,
we're all in agreement.

00:34:21.838 --> 00:34:22.870
Let's not do that.

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:23.370
Right?

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:24.187
JOEL KAHN: Agree.

00:34:24.187 --> 00:34:26.520
DAVE ASPREY: But here's the
deal, whatever plants you're

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.219
growing, keep in mind, I run
an organic farm with very

00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:31.949
high productivity per acre.

00:34:31.949 --> 00:34:33.120
Guess what plants eat?

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.800
They eat dead animals.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.927
They eat poop.

00:34:35.927 --> 00:34:36.760
That's what it does.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:39.480
So what we're doing to
feed these vegan diets out

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:43.169
there is we're actually
mining minerals.

00:34:43.169 --> 00:34:45.210
We're about to run out,
in 40 years, the stuff we

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:46.469
use to make fertilizer.

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:49.110
Or maybe we can get some from
natural gas and put it back in.

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:51.719
But we are trashing
the soil to make

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:53.639
what most vegans eat
because there aren't

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:55.020
that many organic vegans.

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:56.989
Talk about-- yeah, I know.

00:34:56.989 --> 00:34:58.860
It's kind of funny
when science comes in.

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:04.590
So what happens here is
literally bunnies, cute little

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:08.787
bunnies, turtles,
mice, whole families,

00:35:08.787 --> 00:35:10.620
tractors just come
through and just take out

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:11.714
their whole thing.

00:35:11.714 --> 00:35:13.380
You know, you've got
to think about that

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:15.540
if you're going to eat a
big grain bowl for lunch.

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:18.330
Because the net deaths
per calories if I eat

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:23.790
one grass-fed cow per year
is 0.7 deaths per year

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:26.430
unless the cow stepped on
a frog in the front pasture

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:27.780
of my farm.

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:29.529
So what's going on
here is that if you

00:35:29.529 --> 00:35:31.320
want take care of the
soil, you should have

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.240
animals shitting on the soil.

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.074
That's how it works.

00:35:34.074 --> 00:35:36.448
JOEL KAHN: I thought we weren't
allowed to use that word.

00:35:36.448 --> 00:35:37.355
DAVE ASPREY: Oops.

00:35:37.355 --> 00:35:38.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.240
JOEL KAHN: I asked before
we started, if you can

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:41.448
google a word, can we say it?

00:35:41.448 --> 00:35:42.186
And he said no.

00:35:42.186 --> 00:35:44.144
DAVE ASPREY: There's an
environmental argument,

00:35:44.144 --> 00:35:45.900
and there's the
study that shows it's

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:49.380
what's going on your bacteria,
and also the fact that people

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:51.690
feel better on moderate protein.

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:54.360
One thing that's terribly
missing from vegan diet

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:57.061
is collagen, which is the
connective tissue that

00:35:57.061 --> 00:35:57.810
makes your joints.

00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:00.510
One of the things that makes my
joints not hurt any more, even

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:02.160
though I thought your joints
were supposed to always hurt,

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.868
is that your joints
are made of collagen,

00:36:03.868 --> 00:36:05.490
and I eat collagen again.

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:06.810
And this comes from animals.

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:08.389
There is no
plant-based collagen.

00:36:08.389 --> 00:36:09.930
So there's a great
argument for this.

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:11.721
I'll also tell you
there's a great argument

00:36:11.721 --> 00:36:13.740
for eating a lot
less grass-fed meat.

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:15.459
You don't need to
have a huge steak.

00:36:15.459 --> 00:36:17.250
The whole paleo thing,
where it's all like,

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:19.950
carnivore-based is not a
good way to live a long time.

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:21.420
It's a good way to get cancer.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.220
But moderate
amounts, particularly

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:26.220
of animal fat and
some animal protein,

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:27.460
will make you feel better.

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:28.170
They'll give you more energy.

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:29.420
They'll make you look younger.

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:31.003
They'll make you
live longer, and they

00:36:31.003 --> 00:36:32.440
feed the plants
the crap they need

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:36.090
so we can stop destroying
large swaths of our environment

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:39.180
and our soil to feed cows
that eat the wrong stuff

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:41.629
or to feed people who eat
the wrong stuff, like grains.

00:36:41.629 --> 00:36:42.420
JESSE MICHAELS: OK.

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:44.970
Let's give Kip a
chance to respond.

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:46.980
KIP ANDERSEN: So
that was hilarious.

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.740
So, science grass-fed
beef, again and again,

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:50.970
it's about land use.

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:54.240
You cannot have any other
animals share this land with

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.420
you.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:56.540
Yes, it is true.

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:57.720
DAVE ASPREY: I have a farm.

00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:58.160
KIP ANDERSEN: OK.

00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:58.680
OK.

00:36:58.680 --> 00:36:59.805
Actually, this is a great--

00:36:59.805 --> 00:37:01.400
How many acres are in your farm?

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:01.700
DAVE ASPREY: I have 32 acres.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:02.408
KIP ANDERSEN: OK.

00:37:02.408 --> 00:37:04.260
So 32 acres, how many sheep?

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:06.760
DAVE ASPREY: Right now, I have
a half-acre with three sheep.

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:07.640
KIP ANDERSEN: A half-acre
with three sheep.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.640
DAVE ASPREY: And we rotate
them around so they--

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.280
KIP ANDERSEN: So they eat lots
of grass, which is land use.

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.220
So if we were to
take his 32 acres,

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:17.640
and I was going veganic farming,
which is how "Cowspiracy" ends,

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:21.840
I would blow away the production
with veganic composting

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:26.070
and production, not only
by 10, but probably 30--

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:28.220
if you have only three
sheep not so much--

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:31.260
I'd grow around 10 times,
probably 5 to 10 times

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.940
more food than you would.

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:35.610
Because we just had a meme
on this on our "Cowspiracy."

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:36.810
We do it all the time.

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:38.150
You have a funnel of food.

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:41.440
A cow, for example, eats
around 35, 50, 100 pounds,

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:44.490
depending on where it
is, of how much food.

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:48.540
Day after day after day, it
drinks 25 gallons of water

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:50.250
every single day.

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:53.470
Add that up over 18 months,
and guess what you get?

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:55.220
You funnel down, funnel
down, funnel down.

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:57.011
You get some of that
goes back in the soil.

00:37:57.011 --> 00:37:59.310
At the end of the day,
the animal flesh you get

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:02.190
is around 250, 300 pounds.

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:04.770
Out of thousands and
thousands of food.

00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:07.050
So what it is, it's
called inefficiency.

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:11.400
And then the other question
too is, again, how efficient

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.490
can you be in the--

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:14.484
what was the last part?

00:38:14.484 --> 00:38:15.900
There's one other
part about that.

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:22.570
But I guess the goal is to be
as efficient as we can with--

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:24.329
not all of us have 35 acres.

00:38:24.329 --> 00:38:26.120
If you want to break
it down to five acres,

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.730
say we're all given
five acres, you

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:30.940
try putting one sheep on
that, and I'll put mine,

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:33.610
I'll leave the sheep out,
and see who grows more.

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:35.330
There's not even a
remote comparison.

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:35.913
And know what?

00:38:35.913 --> 00:38:37.210
I don't have to kill the sheep.

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:38.980
Can I film some time
you killing the sheep

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:39.940
with your own bare hands?

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:40.630
Can I film that?

00:38:42.514 --> 00:38:44.680
DAVE ASPREY: You can actually
film me taking it down

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.840
on a bandsaw, because I
actually know how to do that.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:48.090
KIP ANDERSEN: I can film that?

00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:49.740
DAVE ASPREY: Sure
you can film that.

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:53.138
As long as you take a
bite when we're done.

00:38:53.138 --> 00:38:55.069
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:55.069 --> 00:38:56.860
JOEL KAHN: He won't
TMAO if you do, though.

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:57.410
All right.

00:38:57.410 --> 00:39:01.000
I just have a quick, just again,
we got to bounce back quick.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.660
Collagen is important.

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:04.169
And this is obscure,
but it's also

00:39:04.169 --> 00:39:06.710
you guys are young, healthy,
you want great skin, great hair,

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:08.735
great nails, taking
biotin and all this stuff.

00:39:08.735 --> 00:39:11.230
You know, you don't need
to eat animal collagen,

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:13.930
because our human body makes
collagen. It's a miracle.

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:17.200
You need, however-- this is an
interesting historical point,

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.562
but it's relevant today.

00:39:18.562 --> 00:39:20.270
There are only four
species on the planet

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:21.145
don't make collagen--

00:39:21.145 --> 00:39:24.100
Guinea pigs, bats,
gorillas, and humans.

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:26.140
We're the only four
mammals on the planet.

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:28.820
My dog and my cat make
collagen. Humans can't.

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:30.400
We lost an enzyme in our liver.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.610
We are required-- and Linus
Pauling, double Nobel Prize

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:35.890
winner taught this in his
biochemistry research,

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:37.375
we have to eat a
ton of vitamin C--

00:39:37.375 --> 00:39:39.860
tada, fruits and vegetables,
fruits, and vegetables.

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:42.220
We need a ton of leucine,
which comes from the legumes

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:44.140
primarily and almonds
to some degree.

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:46.480
If you're a plant-based
eater and you eat properly

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.720
as the rainbow,
whole food, close

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.860
to nature, minimally
processed diet,

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.854
you make all the
collagen you need.

00:39:52.854 --> 00:39:55.270
There's actually a very cool
sign, where your earlobe gets

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:57.510
a crease, and it shows you're
collagen weak and collagen

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:58.010
deficient.

00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:59.380
It's a marker of heart disease.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:02.512
It's less common amongst
those that eat tons of plants.

00:40:02.512 --> 00:40:03.970
So you can make
collagen. You don't

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:06.636
have to eat animal collagen. You
don't have to drink bone broth.

00:40:06.636 --> 00:40:09.052
You need to eat
healthy to maintain it.

00:40:09.052 --> 00:40:10.510
I will say I'm
rather proud of this

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:12.430
because, again, as you're
growing up in a world that's

00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:14.263
going to be congested,
and dirtier, and more

00:40:14.263 --> 00:40:17.020
polluted, and more [INAUDIBLE],,
I can calculate it online

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:18.610
in my 40 years of
being a plant eater,

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:22.460
I've saved 15,000 animals and
16 million gallons of water.

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:24.340
So when I have my
eulogy told, which

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:28.720
I hope by that time will be
45,000 animals and 60,000

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.312
gallons of water that,
you know, each of us,

00:40:31.312 --> 00:40:33.520
if you know the story about
throwing a starfish back.

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.895
You know, we can make one
little difference in the world.

00:40:35.895 --> 00:40:39.040
And you know, being sensitive
to your carbon footprint

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.500
in every way, in your car, in
your bike, in your walking,

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:44.950
but in your food, which is the
biggest segment of your carbon

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:47.160
emission as a human
on the planet.

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:50.890
You know, it can be just one
personal vote for sensitivity,

00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:53.100
humanity, and for doing good.

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:54.640
And if we spread
that word, which

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.920
Google can do probably better
than anybody out there,

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:58.378
you know, we can
make a difference.

00:40:58.378 --> 00:41:01.810
Because air pollution is
choking your guys' health off.

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:04.780
You just had a fire up north
and you knew it firsthand,

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:07.019
but these things are important.

00:41:07.019 --> 00:41:07.810
JESSE MICHAELS: OK.

00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:08.590
I want to move on.

00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:11.470
We can follow up with you
slaughtering a lamb for Kip.

00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:18.310
But we focused up until now on
kind of animal protein, fats,

00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:19.870
carbs sugar, sodium.

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:22.330
I kind of want to just
do a little rapid fire

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:24.940
and hear what they're
good for and why

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.580
you might think they're bad,
either in excess or just

00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:28.705
generically.

00:41:28.705 --> 00:41:30.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:32.380
We'll also follow up with
your version of "War"

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:33.959
by Edwin Starr.

00:41:33.959 --> 00:41:36.000
JOEL KAHN: They're all
saying, what song is that?

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:36.499
I know.

00:41:36.499 --> 00:41:37.835
I'm old.

00:41:37.835 --> 00:41:39.195
AUDIENCE: We know it.

00:41:39.195 --> 00:41:39.820
JOEL KAHN: Yes.

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:40.437
Rock on.

00:41:40.437 --> 00:41:41.770
The wise people in the audience.

00:41:43.927 --> 00:41:45.010
JESSE MICHAELS: Go for it.

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:46.300
DAVE ASPREY: So fats.

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:49.240
Certain kinds of fats are great
for building cell membranes.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:52.390
Many other kinds of fats
are good for making energy

00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:54.820
because they have more
electrons in them than sugar

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:58.480
or carbohydrates, and you want
high octane fuel in the body.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.879
And other fats are good
for causing inflammation,

00:42:00.879 --> 00:42:01.670
which is a problem.

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:03.260
So different fats,
different things.

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:05.650
Sugar, generally, you
don't eat a lot of sugar,

00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:06.850
particularly fructose.

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:08.560
It's just not good for you.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:11.020
And we have abundant evidence
that it messes up your gut

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:14.014
biome, which also then increases
your risk of heart disease,

00:42:14.014 --> 00:42:15.430
your risk of cancer,
and your risk

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:17.260
of every other
degenerative disease ever,

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:19.060
and it'll make you
get hypergly-bitchy.

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:21.040
It's just bad news.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.380
The next one after
that was sodium.

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.120
It turns out that
you're probably not

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.867
getting enough salt in
your diet right now.

00:42:27.867 --> 00:42:29.950
The more stressed you are,
the more salt you need.

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:33.190
The current recommendations
from the government

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:34.660
around salt intake
are actually so

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:36.340
low that they raise
heart attack risk

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:38.020
through an enzyme called renin.

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:40.690
The Russian space program just
figured out some amazing things

00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:43.960
like if you a high salt diet,
you can eat 25% more calories

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.730
without gaining weight.

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:47.540
Not that you necessarily
want to do that.

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:48.980
But I'll tell you that
if you're stressed,

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:50.380
you're not getting enough
sleep, you're traveling a lot,

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:52.750
you're staying up late, you're
getting bad light in your eyes,

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:54.790
all the stuff that
increases biological stress,

00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:56.837
you're in a bad
relationship, eat more salt

00:42:56.837 --> 00:42:57.920
if your body wants you to.

00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:01.300
But make it sea salt that
has balanced minerals in it

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.396
versus industrial salt
that has aluminum in it,

00:43:03.396 --> 00:43:05.020
because you really
don't want aluminum.

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:06.490
JESSE MICHAELS: Carbs and sugar.

00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:07.960
JOEL KAHN: You did sugar.

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.168
DAVE ASPREY: I did say sugar.

00:43:09.168 --> 00:43:13.420
But carbs, carbs in general,
I am not an anti-carb person.

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:14.780
I'm an anti-sugar person.

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:16.510
And I think the
right kinds of carbs

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:19.360
that aren't wrapped in mother
nature's defense system

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.780
is a useful thing to do.

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:23.657
That's what I'll tell you white
rice is better than brown rice.

00:43:23.657 --> 00:43:25.240
People say, oh, brown
rice, but fiber.

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.160
And they forget the
80 times more arsenic

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:29.060
that's in brown rice
versus white rice.

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:32.729
The covering on grains triggers
all sorts of immune system

00:43:32.729 --> 00:43:33.520
problems in people.

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:37.260
In fact, wheat has 26
different compounds

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:39.220
you can be allergic to
that are not gluten.

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:40.777
And we can test for those today.

00:43:40.777 --> 00:43:42.610
So these tend to trigger
problems in people.

00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:44.080
Can you survive a
famine on grain?

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:44.620
Yes.

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:47.320
Will you live with the highest
performance, best feeling life

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:49.028
where you give the
most back to the world

00:43:49.028 --> 00:43:51.370
you have to give if you
eat a lot of whole grains?

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:53.500
I don't believe so.

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:55.100
JESSE MICHAELS: Kip, Dr. Khan.

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:55.420
KIP ANDERSEN: I'll let him--

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:56.090
I mean, he's the MD.

00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:56.580
JOEL KAHN: Are you sure?

00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:57.150
OK.

00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:58.390
You got to remind me.

00:43:58.390 --> 00:44:00.610
So sugar.

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:01.970
Small, medium amounts.

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:04.330
But we've gone crazy with
sugar, and we eat too much.

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:06.163
And of course, we should
always distinguish.

00:44:06.163 --> 00:44:07.930
We're talking sugar
in fruit, go for it.

00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:10.360
500,000 people just
studied out of China,

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.712
first author their name Du.

00:44:11.712 --> 00:44:13.420
More sugar you eat,
the lower your chance

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:16.065
of developing type 2
diabetes if it's in fruit.

00:44:16.065 --> 00:44:17.440
And if you have
two type diabetes

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.810
and you eat sugar in
fruit, you live longer.

00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:22.570
That's totally different than
Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Mountain Dew,

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:23.590
and Amp.

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:27.220
So enjoy the sweet
of nature, but don't

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:31.660
add in the amazing amounts of
added sugar, refined sugar,

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:33.800
of all types.

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:34.490
Give me another.

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:34.990
Carb?

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:36.530
We have to be specific.

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:38.467
Talking about refined
carbs as you're

00:44:38.467 --> 00:44:39.550
going to find in pastries.

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:42.091
One of the worst foods you can
eat in your life are pastries.

00:44:42.091 --> 00:44:44.260
That's been known since
the '50s, '60s, '70s, '80s.

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:47.710
Perfect bomb of refined
flour, refined sugar,

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:50.860
added, usually processed,
poor quality non-organic oils.

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:52.540
Don't eat donuts,
the number one food

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:53.956
you'll see at the
doctor's office.

00:44:53.956 --> 00:44:56.430
Typically, don't eat
processed pastries.

00:44:56.430 --> 00:45:00.040
Don't eat you know Ding Dongs
and HoHos and all the rest.

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:02.920
You know, we're talking
carbs like a bean carbs,

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:06.250
like a squash, carbs like
a piece of lettuce, which

00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:09.370
all food is a combination
of fat, carbs,

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:11.140
and protein to some extent.

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:12.100
Go for it in my world.

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:13.632
And then give me another.

00:45:13.632 --> 00:45:14.590
JESSE MICHAELS: Sodium.

00:45:14.590 --> 00:45:16.060
JOEL KAHN: Sodium.

00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:19.150
If you're a tribesman in South
America called the Yanamamo,

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:21.370
you need a few hundred
milligrams of sodium a day.

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:24.300
Current recommendations
now are 1,500 to 2000.

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:26.860
Your average blood
pressure is around 100.

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:29.200
The number one killer in
the world is hypertension.

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.325
Number one killer in the
world according to a study

00:45:31.325 --> 00:45:35.530
called the Global Burden
of Disease Studies.

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:37.747
Because again, it's
everything in excess.

00:45:37.747 --> 00:45:39.580
Americans are eating
too much of everything.

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:40.538
Too much refined sugar.

00:45:40.538 --> 00:45:41.650
Too much refined flour.

00:45:41.650 --> 00:45:45.760
Too much refined salt. Too many
refined and poor quality fats.

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:47.710
I'm fine with whole food fats.

00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:50.200
I agree, there's
populations that

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.830
eat high percentage of
fats and are healthy.

00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:56.516
There's populations like Okinawa
and this tribe in the Bolivian

00:45:56.516 --> 00:45:58.390
called the Chimane, they
eat very little fat,

00:45:58.390 --> 00:46:00.556
and they're healthy, but
don't eat the refined crap.

00:46:00.556 --> 00:46:03.160
So I'm more towards
a low salt diet,

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.850
recognizing this
number one killer.

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:05.841
And was there one more?

00:46:05.841 --> 00:46:06.340
Are we done?

00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:07.631
JESSE MICHAELS: No, we're done.

00:46:07.631 --> 00:46:08.640
JOEL KAHN: OK, good.

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:09.205
KIP ANDERSEN: The
only thing I'll

00:46:09.205 --> 00:46:11.980
add to that is just, again, kind
of personal experimentation.

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:15.740
I used to do marathons
being vegetarian.

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:17.250
I was a hardcore cheese-aholic.

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:18.875
And I really thought
protein, because I

00:46:18.875 --> 00:46:22.240
ate eggs and cheese, and then
just with "What the Health?",

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:25.250
there was going to impart
more of the story arc with me.

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:28.150
It was the first time I did
a full marathon being vegan.

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:30.850
And then I purposely never
owned a bike or swam on a lap

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:33.670
in my life, and I wanted
to train for an Ironman

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:35.140
within 90 days.

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:37.640
And by doing nothing
different, other than--

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:39.130
this brings in of carb--

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:40.390
I did carb overloading.

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:43.390
Carb loading, and
then getting rid

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:44.800
of all those
inflammatory things,

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:48.790
like dairy, especially,
and eggs and protein,

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:51.710
I increased my
training half the time.

00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:54.164
I bettered my marathon
by 23 minutes.

00:46:54.164 --> 00:46:55.330
And then I did the Ironman--

00:46:55.330 --> 00:46:56.913
I've never done
this-- within 90 days.

00:46:56.913 --> 00:46:58.455
And that was mainly
a lot from carbs.

00:46:58.455 --> 00:46:59.788
That's my experience with carbs.

00:46:59.788 --> 00:47:01.240
So it's maybe not all the times.

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.920
I don't do that now.

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:04.840
But I think there's a
time and place, not only

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.239
like, who you are, but what
are you doing at this time?

00:47:07.239 --> 00:47:08.530
Are you trying to build muscle?

00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:12.730
Are you a long distance
runner like Rich Roll?

00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:15.210
Most of the ultra
endurance runners,

00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:16.772
they're mostly
vegan, if not 100%,

00:47:16.772 --> 00:47:18.980
they're getting more and
more, so I guess it depends.

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:20.771
JOEL KAHN: They're
renaming the NBA the NVA

00:47:20.771 --> 00:47:23.870
because so many players
have gone vegan this month.

00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:24.370
OK.

00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:25.286
Don't announce it yet.

00:47:25.286 --> 00:47:26.720
It's just something
I know inside.

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:27.905
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:27.905 --> 00:47:29.530
JESSE MICHAELS: I
want to give you guys

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:32.410
a chance to kind of
disintermediate yourselves,

00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:35.470
meaning that you guys, you
know, believe certain things,

00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:39.610
and you guys all have platforms,
and people believe you when

00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:40.870
you speak about these things.

00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:41.740
JOEL KAHN: I have a
pro-erection platform.

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:43.240
I wanna just put
it right out there.

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:43.952
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:43.952 --> 00:47:45.502
Sorry.

00:47:45.502 --> 00:47:46.960
JESSE MICHAELS:
But I'd love to get

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:50.380
kind of your process
and your sources.

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:54.755
We hear a lot of terms like peer
reviewed, like meta studies.

00:47:54.755 --> 00:47:55.630
Where should we look?

00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:56.980
You mentioned PubMed.

00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:58.550
How should we look
at these things?

00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:00.790
How do we look at
them for ourselves?

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:03.400
Can you empower us?

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:05.640
DAVE ASPREY: Well,
we're here at Google.

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:08.010
And we went through
this long period of time

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:10.590
where you had to go to a
guy in a white lab coat

00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:12.751
or "Reader's Digest."

00:48:12.751 --> 00:48:14.500
Those are your two
sources of information.

00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:15.330
JOEL KAHN:
"Prevention" magazine.

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:16.121
DAVE ASPREY: Right.

00:48:16.121 --> 00:48:18.559
And so we really didn't
have the ability to do this.

00:48:18.559 --> 00:48:20.100
You guys remember
microfiche readers?

00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:21.516
Like, when I was
in seventh grade,

00:48:21.516 --> 00:48:24.312
we had to go look up like,
these incredibly stupid ways

00:48:24.312 --> 00:48:25.020
of finding stuff.

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:26.250
So everything was hidden.

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:28.492
And you could never find
a million other people

00:48:28.492 --> 00:48:30.450
doing what you do to find
something that works.

00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:32.658
And we've solved that problem
over the last 20 years,

00:48:32.658 --> 00:48:35.290
and Google's been one of the
biggest companies to do that.

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:37.270
So there's two places to go.

00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:38.850
One is you can look at PubMed.

00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:40.800
You can find almost
any academic research

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:43.830
ever about the specific thing
that you're looking for.

00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:46.320
And the second thing to
do is find other people

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:48.630
who are doing something
similar or trying to solve

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:50.130
the problem you want to solve.

00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:51.750
Biohacking is the
art and science

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:54.810
of changing the environment
around you and inside of you

00:48:54.810 --> 00:48:56.890
so you have full control
of your own biology.

00:48:56.890 --> 00:48:58.659
So if your job is
to get swole, you're

00:48:58.659 --> 00:49:00.450
going to talk to people
who are doing that.

00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:02.460
And if your job is
to live past 180,

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:04.020
you're going to talk to
people who are doing that.

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:05.410
But you can find
these communities.

00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:06.993
And then you find
these amazing things

00:49:06.993 --> 00:49:10.960
that should not be possible
if the dogma is true.

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.450
And that's what happened to me.

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:13.620
I did the vegan thing.

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:16.045
I did the excessive exercise
thing, and it didn't work.

00:49:16.045 --> 00:49:18.420
And I found, wow, there's all
these anti-aging people who

00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:21.570
meet 10 minutes from Google
and have for 25 years.

00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:23.100
I'm chairman of this group now.

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:24.510
They're looking at these things.

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:25.801
They're studying, will it work?

00:49:25.801 --> 00:49:27.090
And yes, we talk with vegans.

00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:28.090
We talk with non-vegans.

00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:29.700
Begins We bring them
in for lectures.

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:32.610
But the bottom line
is community is

00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:35.520
what's going to help you the
most, because the community has

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:38.220
the power to go out and
do the searching for you

00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:39.970
and to bring up
interesting things.

00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:43.050
Well, wait, how can this paper
exist if we all believe this?

00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:44.530
I'm going to run an experiment.

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:46.500
And if you find that
your life was radically

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:49.350
different after doing that,
there is truth in that,

00:49:49.350 --> 00:49:51.540
because the number one part
of the scientific method

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:53.490
is observation.

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:54.960
And then you can
form a hypothesis,

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:56.005
and then you can test it.

00:49:56.005 --> 00:49:56.880
You have a community.

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.170
You can test it now that's
never existed before.

00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:01.990
And that is the most
amazing thing right now.

00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:03.092
JESSE MICHAELS: Kip?

00:50:03.092 --> 00:50:04.300
KIP ANDERSEN: Wanna go first?

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:09.420
JOEL KAHN: I would
say you go to PubMed.

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:11.027
You know, P-U-B-M-E-D dot com.

00:50:11.027 --> 00:50:12.360
Some of you may have been there.

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:12.930
So of you may not.

00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:14.304
The National
Library of Medicine,

00:50:14.304 --> 00:50:16.110
26 million medical articles.

00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:17.550
Different than a blog.

00:50:17.550 --> 00:50:20.020
Different than a newspaper.

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:22.650
But a tremendous
range of quality.

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:25.260
Negative studies often
don't get published.

00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:27.660
You do a study that grass-fed
beef does or doesn't

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:30.500
do something, and it's negative,
you're unlikely to publish it.

00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:34.020
It may damage your chances
of getting further grants.

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:36.540
Egg board, dairy
board, meat board.

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:38.874
There is a green board,
a broccoli board.

00:50:38.874 --> 00:50:40.290
I mean, they don't
have any money.

00:50:40.290 --> 00:50:41.510
But you do need to read.

00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:43.980
The first place I go usually
is the end of article,

00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:45.240
where was the funding from?

00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:47.531
And that's true at the Harvard
School of Public Health,

00:50:47.531 --> 00:50:48.870
and that's true overseas.

00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:50.370
And sometimes,
it's not disclosed.

00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:53.460
And with all that muck, that's
where you go, nonetheless.

00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:58.080
We have 110 years of studies on
nutrition and atherosclerosis.

00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:01.560
Somewhere amongst that, we can
come to that core, you know,

00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:04.560
eat minimally processed,
mainly close to the ground,

00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:08.340
and largely plants as
a rallying point that

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:11.185
is likely to favor your
health and prevent disease.

00:51:11.185 --> 00:51:12.560
And yes, there's
inconsistencies,

00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:14.280
and there's
disappointments when we

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:16.980
learn that three guys
at Harvard in the 1960s

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:20.070
took some money to favor
the idea that sugar

00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:22.140
was bad for your health
and not disclose that.

00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:25.170
But that's three researchers
in 50 years in all.

00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:27.030
So we're doing OK
with medical science.

00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:30.280
There's people that really
care and really are ethical.

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.770
Not everybody's in a bad
place, so I trust science.

00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:34.182
I really do.

00:51:34.182 --> 00:51:35.890
KIP ANDERSEN: What's
happened, especially

00:51:35.890 --> 00:51:37.650
after the film comes
out, people have

00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:38.640
these articles that come out.

00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:40.056
And eventually,
we're going to get

00:51:40.056 --> 00:51:43.930
ready to do one specifically
that goes over each point,

00:51:43.930 --> 00:51:46.819
because they're very easy
to refute the rebuttals.

00:51:46.819 --> 00:51:47.610
And a lot of them--

00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:50.760
I was just on "Doctors," and
they're all attacking us,

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:53.970
and they're literally quoting
studies for the egg industry

00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:55.639
that's put out by
the egg industry.

00:51:55.639 --> 00:51:57.180
And this happens
time and time again,

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:59.346
where they have these studies
that they're refuting.

00:51:59.346 --> 00:52:00.640
They're like, what about this?

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:01.110
What about this?

00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:02.984
And it's like, did you
actually see the film?

00:52:02.984 --> 00:52:04.350
This is a huge part of the film.

00:52:04.350 --> 00:52:05.130
Follow the money.

00:52:05.130 --> 00:52:06.250
Follow who it went to.

00:52:06.250 --> 00:52:08.974
Don't look at things at
face value, surface level.

00:52:08.974 --> 00:52:10.890
You have to go deeper,
deeper, deeper, deeper.

00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:12.540
And that's what the film did.

00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:14.530
And I think it was
kind of sidetracked,

00:52:14.530 --> 00:52:18.960
but "Cowspiracy" just a few
years ago, a lot of the facts

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:22.020
were refuted then, and I
learned a lot from that.

00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:25.710
Just in two, three years fr
now, everything pretty much

00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:28.700
in that entire film is common
knowledge for the most part.

00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:30.200
And the same with
"What the Health?"

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:32.984
And looking back in history,
10, 20, 30 years from now,

00:52:32.984 --> 00:52:34.150
there's one way this can go.

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:36.450
And this one way is
the plant-based diet,

00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:38.220
not only for again,
for the planet,

00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:39.990
for your health,
mind, body, and spirit

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:44.940
is the way to go, and to search
through these murky studies

00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:47.280
and find the ones that
are truly independent.

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:50.280
And again, I guess
brought up again,

00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:53.280
rather than like biohacking,
really bioharmonizing yourself

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:56.010
with the planet, not to have
everything come towards you

00:52:56.010 --> 00:52:57.540
and fix me, myself.

00:52:57.540 --> 00:53:00.480
How about, how can I integrate
myself with the entire planet

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:01.980
so I'm at one with
it, and so I feel

00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:05.010
liberated because of a
much bigger self than just

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:05.710
my own self?

00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:07.043
And I think that's the goal too.

00:53:07.043 --> 00:53:09.210
It's 7 billion people,
and how do we all fit in?

00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:12.727
What can I do to become part
of the greater whole of us?

00:53:12.727 --> 00:53:15.060
JESSE MICHAELS: I wanna get
questions from the audience.

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:17.210
Does anybody have any questions?

00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:18.210
JOEL KAHN: Don't be shy.

00:53:21.078 --> 00:53:24.514
Good, good, good.

00:53:24.514 --> 00:53:27.050
AUDIENCE: What are your
thoughts on the supposed

00:53:27.050 --> 00:53:30.197
estrogenic effects of soy?

00:53:30.197 --> 00:53:32.030
JOEL KAHN: I'll jump
in as a medical doctor.

00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:35.420
I personally think that eating--
well, I don't personally think.

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:38.690
The science says if you eat
organic soy in place of meat,

00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:40.340
you favor the chance
you won't develop

00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:41.390
breast cancer for women.

00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:43.460
And if you've had breast cancer,
you won't develop recurrence

00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:45.920
of breast cancer, because
there's natural estrogen.

00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:49.370
And the very, very weak activity
that's in plant-based estrogen

00:53:49.370 --> 00:53:50.630
like the soybean--

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:52.540
and only organic, because
thank you Monsanto,

00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:55.940
we've largely destroyed that
crap in terms of quality.

00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:56.840
But it's out there.

00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:59.120
Your soy milk I noticed
in your coffee shops

00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:02.040
are Pacific brand, organic soy.

00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:03.120
it's a good choice.

00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:06.390
But so to replace--

00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:09.800
again, CAFO, where they're
administering extra hormones

00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:12.230
to get that chicken to grow
fast, that cow to grow fast,

00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:13.310
make more money.

00:54:13.310 --> 00:54:16.850
You're better off by far eating
soy than that type of food.

00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:19.890
You get into higher quality,
there's no head to head study.

00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:22.550
Soy is a very safe food if
you don't have a food allergy

00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:24.090
or food intolerance.

00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:25.839
I wouldn't eat it
three meals a day.

00:54:25.839 --> 00:54:28.130
It can have something that's
called goitergenic thyroid

00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:29.260
interacting effects.

00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:32.090
But you don't see that in
natural populations in Japan.

00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:34.370
I mean, it's a condiment
to your stir fry

00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:35.799
and the rest of your diet.

00:54:35.799 --> 00:54:37.340
KIP ANDERSEN: This
is the one thing--

00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:39.070
you know, we wanted to
make our film 90 minutes,

00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:40.580
and was the last
thing we cut out.

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:43.130
And I was like, oh god, someday
we'll do a director's cut.

00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:46.550
Because that was a huge
marketing, essentially-- again,

00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:48.140
by theory, not 100%.

00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:50.960
Well, we do know it was put
out by the Weston Price.

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:54.650
And this big scare, right when
soy milk started taking off,

00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:58.340
and cow milk started going
down, all of a sudden this thing

00:54:58.340 --> 00:54:59.240
came out.

00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:02.420
Soy is bad because of,
ironically, estrogen.

00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:04.800
What is in cow's milk?

00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:06.590
Its growth hormone fluids.

00:55:06.590 --> 00:55:08.020
Whether it's
organic or not, it's

00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:11.570
supposed to make a small calf
grow into a big, thousand pound

00:55:11.570 --> 00:55:13.790
cow as fast as it possibly can.

00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:15.650
So it's so ironic,
because they're saying

00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:17.150
it's about the estrogen part.

00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:20.150
It's phytoestrogen.
When the real concern

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:22.340
is the estrogen and the
growth hormones from cow's

00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:23.879
milk and cheese and dairy.

00:55:23.879 --> 00:55:25.920
That's the one that you
have to be worried about.

00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:26.670
And that was what?

00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:28.019
25, 30 years ago.

00:55:28.019 --> 00:55:29.060
I've been vegan 10 years.

00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:32.490
For four years, I did not
eat soy because of that.

00:55:32.490 --> 00:55:34.959
And then I found out it it was
put out by the Weston Price,

00:55:34.959 --> 00:55:36.000
and it's like, thank God.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.340
And it's very true.

00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:39.350
If you do eat soy,
organic, that is

00:55:39.350 --> 00:55:41.390
one thing, because it
is heavily pesticide.

00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:42.920
But soy is incredibly
good for you,

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:47.000
and there's study after
study after study on that.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.804
And I'm bummed we put that out,
because that was a big thing.

00:55:50.804 --> 00:55:52.012
JOEL KAHN: On the other hand.

00:55:52.012 --> 00:55:53.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:56.060
DAVE ASPREY: My wife
is a medical doctor

00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:58.640
from the Karolinska
Institute in Stockholm.

00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:00.260
When I met her,
she drank soy milk.

00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:01.280
She was infertile.

00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:03.740
My very first book was
how to turn fertility back

00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:05.840
on with 1,300 studies on it.

00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:08.030
When we took her
off soy milk, she

00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:09.590
was able to gain
weight that she'd

00:56:09.590 --> 00:56:13.710
been unable to gain her entire
adult life drinking soy milk.

00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:17.040
Soy contains phytic acid,
which inhibits your ability

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:20.190
to absorb minerals from the
other vegetables you might eat.

00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:22.530
So if you want to eat
soy, you should pair it

00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:25.761
with a nice piece
of grass-fed steak.

00:56:25.761 --> 00:56:27.510
JOEL KAHN: But you
won't get colon cancer,

00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:29.820
because we know phytates
resist the development of colon

00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:30.320
cancer.

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:32.090
So you pick your choice.

00:56:32.090 --> 00:56:35.070
DAVE ASPREY: The point
there also about soy, aside

00:56:35.070 --> 00:56:38.460
from the estrogenic
effects, which are present.

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:41.159
And the estrogen that's in soy
doesn't fit in your estrogen

00:56:41.159 --> 00:56:43.200
receptors properly, so it
basically clogs them up

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:45.900
so your own natural estrogen
activities don't work.

00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:48.750
You can use soy, for instance,
at certain times of the month

00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:51.990
to help with PMS symptoms
because it has an effect.

00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:54.030
But to take it sort
of all willynilly,

00:56:54.030 --> 00:56:56.905
I am highly skeptical of
that being a good choice.

00:56:56.905 --> 00:56:58.530
The other problem is
that fermented soy

00:56:58.530 --> 00:57:02.100
is the second highest histamine
food after fermented fish

00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:03.330
sauce.

00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:05.070
Histamine is actually
a neurotransmitter.

00:57:05.070 --> 00:57:07.190
It also causes allergies
and things like that.

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:09.720
So there are lots of people
who go on the Bulletproof Diet,

00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:10.650
and I'm like hey,
maybe you should

00:57:10.650 --> 00:57:12.960
stop eating even the gluten-free
soy sauce for a little while

00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:13.835
and see what happens.

00:57:13.835 --> 00:57:15.900
And what happens is, I
don't get hives anymore.

00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:19.039
So if you eat soy and you
get some brain fog later

00:57:19.039 --> 00:57:20.580
in the day, you get
profoundly tired,

00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:21.990
it may not be
estrogen. It may be

00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:24.150
one of the other many
problems with soy, aside

00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:25.890
from the environmental
destruction caused

00:57:25.890 --> 00:57:29.460
by mowing down beautiful fields
and forests to plant soybeans

00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:31.379
to feed people low-quality crap.

00:57:31.379 --> 00:57:32.670
JOEL KAHN: You don't eat natto?

00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:34.980
Fermented natto is
not on your diet.

00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:37.230
DAVE ASPREY: No, natto is
actually the one form of soy

00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:38.450
that I do recommend.

00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:39.900
JESSE MICHAELS: We've got
one question in the back.

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:40.983
I can repeat the question.

00:57:40.983 --> 00:57:43.554
AUDIENCE: Just to
alleviate the situation,

00:57:43.554 --> 00:57:44.911
this question's not about soy.

00:57:44.911 --> 00:57:45.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:46.265
DAVE ASPREY: Darn.

00:57:46.265 --> 00:57:49.055
AUDIENCE: A huge thanks for Kip
because your films definitely

00:57:49.055 --> 00:57:51.850
changed my and my
girlfriend's life.

00:57:51.850 --> 00:57:55.551
So as a vegan or
vegetarian, you definitely

00:57:55.551 --> 00:57:57.342
have a situation you're
with your friends,

00:57:57.342 --> 00:58:00.180
and suddenly your friend
becomes a plant activist.

00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:03.669
And I was wondering, in
this kind of situation,

00:58:03.669 --> 00:58:05.625
how do you usually go
about it and can you

00:58:05.625 --> 00:58:09.537
share your experience of
friends who eat lots of meat

00:58:09.537 --> 00:58:11.982
and they got irritated about--

00:58:11.982 --> 00:58:14.192
KIP ANDERSEN: What was
the first part of that?

00:58:14.192 --> 00:58:15.900
JOEL KAHN: Their
friends become activist.

00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:18.540
JESSE MICHAELS: The question
is around social situations

00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:20.240
where-- he was
influenced by your film.

00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:20.910
He went vegan.

00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:22.785
Maybe you're at the
dinner table and you have

00:58:22.785 --> 00:58:24.270
to explain that to meat eaters.

00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:25.590
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:58:25.590 --> 00:58:26.795
KIP ANDERSEN: Well, I went
vegan, because part of it

00:58:26.795 --> 00:58:27.750
was health.

00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:30.700
Health was the last part.

00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:32.285
What's interesting,
I used to never go

00:58:32.285 --> 00:58:34.410
to barbecues, especially
in the first years of when

00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:36.960
I was vegan, because
everybody does

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:41.190
these very immature things,
kind of like, where you say,

00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:42.760
oh, if you're gonna
eat animals, I'm

00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:43.960
gonna eat two times animals.

00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:46.567
Or the whole soy thing,
and this and that.

00:58:46.567 --> 00:58:48.150
And then, especially
with the animals,

00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:50.520
I'm gonna eat three
times as many animals.

00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:52.137
Every time, it's such a thing.

00:58:52.137 --> 00:58:54.220
If you tell someone to not
eat sugar, that's like,

00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:55.470
well, you know, it's
interesting stuff.

00:58:55.470 --> 00:58:57.553
But if you tell someone
to not eat animals because

00:58:57.553 --> 00:59:00.840
of certain things, it
triggers someone back,

00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:03.720
and these immature things around
when they're 8 to 12 years old.

00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:06.885
And that is when we become
jaded to that animal

00:59:06.885 --> 00:59:08.640
as another living
being, of exactly

00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:10.530
that you would never
in a million years,

00:59:10.530 --> 00:59:14.190
if you're 12 years old, look a
cow, look a sheep, in the eye

00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:15.120
and slit his throat.

00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:19.440
So it's beyond-- it's a whole
other level of betrayal,

00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:21.850
not only within yourself,
but you're saying, wow,

00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:25.400
are you saying I'm not in line
with who truly morally am?

00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:27.720
And that's a deep question
not only for yourself.

00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:29.928
Are you saying my parents
are bad because they fed me

00:59:29.928 --> 00:59:31.630
this way, or my culture's bad?

00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:33.360
So it's a very deep thing.

00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:35.010
That's why it's such
a sensitive topic

00:59:35.010 --> 00:59:38.020
because at the core level,
human beings are compassionate,

00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:38.735
loving beings.

00:59:38.735 --> 00:59:40.110
And that's why at
the core level,

00:59:40.110 --> 00:59:43.430
whether 5%, 10% of the
core of who we are inside,

00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:44.310
we're frugivores.

00:59:44.310 --> 00:59:48.160
We're meant to love other
beings and all of the planet's

00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:48.990
other life forms.

00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:50.449
And that's the big
reason why we're

00:59:50.449 --> 00:59:52.281
in the situation where
we are, because we've

00:59:52.281 --> 00:59:53.230
gone away from that.

00:59:53.230 --> 00:59:54.605
So the only thing
I say is people

00:59:54.605 --> 00:59:58.360
is the reason why I made
these films is just hey,

00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.240
watch this funny film
called "Cowspiracy,"

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.740
or this comedy called
"What the Health?"

01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:04.364
And you know, I mean, that's all
you can do, is try to educate.

01:00:04.364 --> 01:00:08.460
Because it is hard, because
it's such a deep-lying seeded

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:10.379
contradictory with
their own selves.

01:00:10.379 --> 01:00:12.170
DAVE ASPREY: There's
something that happens

01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:13.950
any time you go on a new diet.

01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:16.710
And this happened
when I was raw vegan.

01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:20.724
It happened when I discovered
like Atkins in the early '90s.

01:00:20.724 --> 01:00:21.390
Like, all right.

01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:22.590
Like, lost half this
fat, and the other half

01:00:22.590 --> 01:00:24.960
won't budge on that diet,
and things like that.

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:27.480
You go through this like, oh,
my god, I have the solution,

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:30.270
and I feel a moral
obligation to tell everyone.

01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:31.650
But the real moral
obligation you

01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:33.780
have, whether you're like,
a radical keto dieter--

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:36.510
like that's the latest like,
you know, carb shaming,

01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:39.810
or the vegan side of things,
where, OK, this is it.

01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:43.120
Like, this is what's
working for me right now.

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:45.300
The best thing you
can do, no matter

01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:48.570
what your diet is, and you
just discovered it, is shut up

01:00:48.570 --> 01:00:49.200
and eat.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:49.500
JOEL KAHN: I agree.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:50.916
DAVE ASPREY: And
when you do that,

01:00:50.916 --> 01:00:52.481
the people who are
open to learning

01:00:52.481 --> 01:00:54.480
will ask you why you're
doing what you're doing,

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:56.760
and you'll have the best
conversations of your life.

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:58.050
And if instead you're
like, I'm going

01:00:58.050 --> 01:00:59.758
to tell you why I'm
doing what I'm doing,

01:00:59.758 --> 01:01:02.120
people are like, could
you, you know, STFU.

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:03.499
Like, we're not here for that.

01:01:03.499 --> 01:01:05.040
We want to do what
we're going to do.

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:08.430
So my path over the last 20
years of discovering this stuff

01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:11.640
has been to learn that,
look, when I'm eating,

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.560
I don't judge other
people for what they eat.

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.060
Like, I'm assuming
they're doing it.

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:17.143
If they want to know why
I'm doing what I'm doing,

01:01:17.143 --> 01:01:19.130
I'll tell them, but I
never offer it first.

01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:21.390
And given that I'm well-known
now, they usually ask.

01:01:21.390 --> 01:01:24.000
But even back when I was
doing what I was doing like,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.130
why, you're working at a
computer security company.

01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:28.620
Like, why did you carry a stick
of butter to lunch with you?

01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:28.890
Right?

01:01:28.890 --> 01:01:29.431
I'm like, OK.

01:01:29.431 --> 01:01:30.410
Now it's an opening.

01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:30.910
Right?

01:01:30.910 --> 01:01:32.820
And so if you just
politely order

01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:35.460
the plant-based diet
that you want to order

01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:39.510
and you eat it without
emotion and without judgment,

01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:41.744
you'll find that you'll
have the best conversations,

01:01:41.744 --> 01:01:43.410
and you'll probably
swing the people who

01:01:43.410 --> 01:01:47.400
are your target, the
ones who are open

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:50.160
versus angering the ones who
are not open and are really

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.020
not your target.

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:54.054
KIP ANDERSEN: I agree 100%.

01:01:54.054 --> 01:01:55.470
Now, I actually
go to a barbecues.

01:01:55.470 --> 01:01:56.310
I don't say anything.

01:01:56.310 --> 01:01:57.180
I used to say something.

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.070
In the first couple of
years, so passionate.

01:01:59.070 --> 01:02:01.776
And now I don't say anything,
and it kind of comes to you,

01:02:01.776 --> 01:02:03.150
or they'll ask
something exactly.

01:02:03.150 --> 01:02:05.370
So again, whatever you do.

01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:07.470
And just kind of
like, lead by example

01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:09.900
and really be present,
but don't say anything.

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:12.570
So now I purposely go to
barbecues, and just my presence

01:02:12.570 --> 01:02:16.530
there, like bringing a veggie
burger, the new Beyond Burger.

01:02:16.530 --> 01:02:17.370
Having that there.

01:02:17.370 --> 01:02:19.860
Then you're like, it's
a little minimal form

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:21.670
of passive activism.

01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:22.962
And I don't say anything.

01:02:22.962 --> 01:02:24.170
You know, if they come to me.

01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:24.970
But it's very true.

01:02:24.970 --> 01:02:25.470
Very true.

01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:26.511
Because it does not work.

01:02:26.511 --> 01:02:27.394
I tried for 10 years.

01:02:27.394 --> 01:02:28.060
It doesn't work.

01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:28.980
DAVE ASPREY: Like,
I go to barbecues.

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:30.195
I don't eat the barbecue.

01:02:30.195 --> 01:02:32.910
I'm like, well, it's
probably fed a bunch of crap.

01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:34.380
Like, it's not
good quality meat.

01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:36.750
And you shouldn't burn
your meat on open fire.

01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:38.700
I can show you all
the science for that.

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:40.770
So, it's like, I'll
have the salad.

01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:43.020
And when I go out to eat,
I'd go to Joel's restaurant.

01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:45.030
I'll go to a vegan
restaurant because you're

01:02:45.030 --> 01:02:47.760
going to get less crap, as
long as you throw away the tofu

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:50.760
and stuff, at a vegan
restaurant than you

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:54.480
are at the typical American
feedlot restaurant.

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:58.210
But just by making those
choices, and then saying,

01:02:58.210 --> 01:03:00.810
I'm going to do this not that,
and you can say it's about me.

01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:03.149
It's about what works for
my biology, and it's OK.

01:03:03.149 --> 01:03:04.690
You can eat whatever
you want to eat,

01:03:04.690 --> 01:03:08.610
but we can just have a really
like, productive dialogue

01:03:08.610 --> 01:03:12.310
versus like, shaming.

01:03:12.310 --> 01:03:14.830
JESSE MICHAELS: I think on
that, two more questions,

01:03:14.830 --> 01:03:16.780
although that was very
nice olive branch.

01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:18.313
Yes, Erica?

01:03:18.313 --> 01:03:20.159
AUDIENCE: So then,
for those of us

01:03:20.159 --> 01:03:21.867
that can't cook for
every meal, let's say

01:03:21.867 --> 01:03:22.515
we're going out for
our birthday dinner

01:03:22.515 --> 01:03:24.262
or going out to a
restaurant, what

01:03:24.262 --> 01:03:26.418
is going to the safest
thing at a restaurant, then,

01:03:26.418 --> 01:03:28.334
that isn't like, plant-based.

01:03:28.334 --> 01:03:30.090
Or you're going
out with a group,

01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:32.347
you want to kind of be easy.

01:03:32.347 --> 01:03:34.180
JOEL KAHN: I've been
eating in restaurants--

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:35.440
JESSE MICHAELS: Dr.
Khan, Let me just

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.606
repeat the question real
quick for the listeners out

01:03:37.606 --> 01:03:38.912
there, viewers out there.

01:03:38.912 --> 01:03:40.870
So it's basically, you're
in a group situation,

01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:42.644
you're going to a restaurant.

01:03:42.644 --> 01:03:44.560
Maybe they ask you about
dietary restrictions.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:45.268
Maybe they don't.

01:03:45.268 --> 01:03:48.140
You want to kind of be
easy and eat with them.

01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:50.860
How do you do that while
adhering to the healthiest diet

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:51.755
possible?

01:03:51.755 --> 01:03:52.255
Dr. Kahn?

01:03:52.255 --> 01:03:54.850
JOEL KAHN: Just quickly,
there's an amazing website been

01:03:54.850 --> 01:03:57.010
around 20 years,
happycow.net, if you're

01:03:57.010 --> 01:03:58.600
looking for that
healthy restaurant,

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:01.300
whether you're in Moscow,
St. Petersburg, Istanbul,

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:02.266
or Mountain View.

01:04:02.266 --> 01:04:04.390
So that's a great resource
when you're out of town.

01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:05.630
happycow.net.

01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:07.879
It's, as far as I
know, noncommercial.

01:04:07.879 --> 01:04:09.420
Maybe it' will list
every whole food,

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:12.230
or list every similar
market and restaurant.

01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:13.974
Two, is I go right--

01:04:13.974 --> 01:04:15.890
if I'm in an Italian
restaurant, the contorni,

01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:17.710
you know, the side dishes.

01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:19.390
I put together
spinach, root garlic,

01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:22.460
with a braised
grilled cauliflower.

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:23.470
Whatever it is.

01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:25.120
That's a nice safe place to go.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:26.597
And ask questions.

01:04:26.597 --> 01:04:28.180
Food allergies are
everywhere, so it's

01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:30.947
not at all odd to even the chef
to come out of the kitchen.

01:04:30.947 --> 01:04:32.530
I do own a large
restaurant in Detroit

01:04:32.530 --> 01:04:34.120
besides being a cardiologist.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.070
I mean, that should be
encouraged because nut

01:04:36.070 --> 01:04:37.361
allergies are life-threatening.

01:04:37.361 --> 01:04:39.641
So get the food you want
out of a restaurant.

01:04:39.641 --> 01:04:41.140
And if you got to
tell your friends,

01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:44.230
I'm doing the Beyonce diet,
or doing the NBA diet,

01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:47.030
or I've developed
whatever allergy--

01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:49.090
I mean, allergies
everybody respects nowadays

01:04:49.090 --> 01:04:52.939
if you don't want to go
into the whole conversation.

01:04:52.939 --> 01:04:54.730
DAVE ASPREY: I always
just go in and I say,

01:04:54.730 --> 01:04:56.939
I want a plate
covered in vegetables.

01:04:56.939 --> 01:04:59.230
And I go, actually, guys, I
mean covered in vegetables.

01:04:59.230 --> 01:05:01.480
That doesn't mean three
pieces of asparagus.

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:02.259
Right?

01:05:02.259 --> 01:05:03.550
And then, they're like, really?

01:05:03.550 --> 01:05:04.750
Like, no, I mean that.

01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:06.220
And then I'll look on the menu.

01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:09.230
If there's a wild
caught fish, I'll do it.

01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:11.230
And yes, I'm concerned
about overfishing.

01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:12.970
I'm also concerned about eating.

01:05:12.970 --> 01:05:15.560
And I'm hoping that we'll
do some more work on that.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:18.410
But in the meantime, if you just
get the plate of vegetables,

01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:19.130
here's the trick.

01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:21.485
They always put canola oil
in almost every restaurant,

01:05:21.485 --> 01:05:22.860
and they tell you
it's olive oil,

01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:24.651
because they cut the
olive oil with canola.

01:05:24.651 --> 01:05:26.780
You tell them it has
to 100% olive oil,

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:29.260
because if I get canola
oil, I have seizures

01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:30.670
right there on the floor.

01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:32.212
And then you always
get the real oil.

01:05:32.212 --> 01:05:33.586
JOEL KAHN: That
actually is true.

01:05:33.586 --> 01:05:35.404
DAVE ASPREY: Yeah, and
for me, I just say,

01:05:35.404 --> 01:05:36.570
could you cook it in butter?

01:05:36.570 --> 01:05:37.430
JOEL KAHN: He won't
have a seizure.

01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:39.349
But if you say that,
they will be very careful

01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:40.640
not to put what you don't want.

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.970
DAVE ASPREY: Otherwise,
most well-meaning waiters

01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:44.890
and waitresses will
give you bad fats

01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:46.070
because they don't know it.

01:05:46.070 --> 01:05:47.611
And oftentimes, the
cook doesn't even

01:05:47.611 --> 01:05:50.390
know until they turn the big
jug of industrial oil around.

01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.890
Oh, yeah.

01:05:50.890 --> 01:05:52.060
It is 25% canola.

01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:53.200
I didn't know.

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:55.339
So just avoiding bad fats
is critically important

01:05:55.339 --> 01:05:56.380
if you want to feel good.

01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:59.080
But literally, you can always
say a plate of vegetables.

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:00.380
And that's enough.

01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:00.880
Right?

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.950
I bring my own fat to
pour on the vegetables

01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:04.540
to get enough fat to feel good.

01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:06.610
But maybe you do
that, maybe you don't.

01:06:06.610 --> 01:06:07.720
That's the trick.

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:08.950
Only vegetables.

01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:11.660
And if they're feeding
industrial meat,

01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:12.880
I'm right with these guys.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:13.810
Don't eat industrial meat.

01:06:13.810 --> 01:06:15.685
Like, it will take away
years from your life,

01:06:15.685 --> 01:06:17.050
and it's bad for the planet.

01:06:17.050 --> 01:06:18.880
And that said, if you can get
a little bit of good quality

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:19.690
protein, do it.

01:06:19.690 --> 01:06:22.467
If not get some
protein once a day

01:06:22.467 --> 01:06:24.550
that's really high quality
protein, which probably

01:06:24.550 --> 01:06:28.030
didn't come from vegetables.

01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:30.670
JESSE MICHAELS: Anybody else?

01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:31.170
Go for it.

01:06:31.170 --> 01:06:34.110
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thanks a lot
for talking about the big issues

01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:35.609
like how we can
harmonize with life,

01:06:35.609 --> 01:06:38.194
and how we can
listen to science.

01:06:38.194 --> 01:06:40.110
Dr. Kahn, I wanted to
ask if you could give us

01:06:40.110 --> 01:06:42.640
a little more recommendations
than just going to PubMed.

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:45.226
That's such an open-ended thing.

01:06:45.226 --> 01:06:48.210
I'm particularly thinking of
like, Dr. Greger's website

01:06:48.210 --> 01:06:51.500
or other consolidated
sources where

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:54.710
we don't have to figure
it all out on our own.

01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:58.330
JESSE MICHAELS: Question as, is
other verified medical sources

01:06:58.330 --> 01:07:00.184
outside of just
PubMed, Dr. Kahn.

01:07:00.184 --> 01:07:00.850
JOEL KAHN: Yeah.

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:03.130
It brings up a little
bit of a sensitive issue.

01:07:03.130 --> 01:07:05.440
Can a doctor who
chooses a plant diet,

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.592
a vegan diet not be objective?

01:07:07.592 --> 01:07:08.800
And I've already declared it.

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:11.500
When I see that meat
will reverse my patients

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:14.680
heart blockage, I will be
obligated to recommend meat.

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.060
Just that science doesn't exist.

01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:18.430
The only diet for
atherosclerosis reversal

01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:21.910
are plant diets, naturally
low in added fats and oils.

01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:24.910
And until that changes,
that's what I'll recommend.

01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:27.460
So there is a website,
nutritionfacts.org.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.200
I don't think that
would be received well

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:33.850
in the ketogenic diet
and some other movement.s

01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:36.146
but if you watch
"What the Health?"

01:07:36.146 --> 01:07:38.020
and you're looking for
some more information,

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:41.050
yes, that's always
a recommendation.

01:07:41.050 --> 01:07:43.120
Where else would you
go if you want some--

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.340
because I really do
like Dr. Greger's work,

01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:47.350
because the medical
references are there.

01:07:47.350 --> 01:07:48.674
And you can search for others.

01:07:48.674 --> 01:07:49.840
There usually aren't others.

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.860
These are the ones that exist.

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:53.560
I don't think he's got a bias.

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:56.170
It's just the way
the literature goes.

01:07:56.170 --> 01:07:58.842
PCRM.org, Physician Committee
of Responsible Medicine,

01:07:58.842 --> 01:07:59.800
there's a lot websites.

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:02.170
So if you get into the
plant-based movement,

01:08:02.170 --> 01:08:03.790
I mean, there's all
kinds of websites.

01:08:03.790 --> 01:08:06.220
But they're basing
their website usually

01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:08.350
on science that's in PubMeds.

01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:11.560
KIP ANDERSEN: Highly, highly
recommend nutritionfacts.org

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:12.880
for something simple.

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:13.580
It's a video.

01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:16.310
It's always very fast,
always sourced very well.

01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:17.330
Nutritionfacts.org.

01:08:17.330 --> 01:08:20.380
You can type in
anything, anything,

01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:24.520
and it'll come out in a very
succinct, two-three minute way,

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.390
Sourced, sourced, sourced.

01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:28.960
It's a great, great resource.

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.004
JESSE MICHAELS: Cool.

01:08:30.004 --> 01:08:31.420
Thank you guys so
much for coming.

01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:32.567
Really appreciate it.

01:08:32.567 --> 01:08:33.650
Let's give it up for them.

01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:37.000
[APPLAUSE]
