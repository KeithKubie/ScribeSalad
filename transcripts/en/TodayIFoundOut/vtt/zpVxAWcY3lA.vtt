00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.279
Whether a block, a wheel, a cylinder or a
pyramid, a cheese’s shape is dictated by

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:13.190
concerns with pressure, salt absorption, ripening,
economics and/or tradition.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.220
Cheeses that are made in wheels, like creamy
Brie and Camembert, need equal rates of salt

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.831
uptake, as well as even ripening action from
its molds (like P. camemberti and P. candidum)

00:00:21.831 --> 00:00:22.831
as they break down the milk proteins and produce
the delicious ambrosia within.

00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:26.759
The wheel shape facilitates both as the consistent
thickness encourages equal absorption as the

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.110
surface flora spread; so the disk’s shape
keeps the mold from focusing too much on one

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.110
area (as it would if there were, for instance,
square corners, where a higher percentage

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.110
of molds would work on the edge areas, resulting
in an over-ripened edge.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.110
These edges in square blocks are often a source
of problems in many cheeses if the cheese

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.110
maker doesn’t get the conditions just right).

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.110
Another reason to make a cheese in a wheel,
at least historically, is pressure.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.570
For example, for traditional rind-covered
cheddars, the dry salting method used in their

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.700
production needs quite a bit of pressure to
hold the curd together until it is able to

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.910
stick on its own.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.600
The round molds provide extra strength in
pressing, where rectangular molds of the same

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.951
thickness, even stainless steel ones, tend
to lose their shape and even split at the

00:00:52.951 --> 00:00:54.300
seams over time.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.580
As one professional cheese maker noted on
the durability of these molds, “design engineers

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.210
who know cheese plants typically design the
item, then double it.”

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.760
A third reason for making cheese into a wheel,
particularly for those produced in mammoth

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.850
proportions, is that you can just roll the
large wheel rather than lugging it about.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.149
Historically, cheese wheels were often made
in these very large sizes for sale to marketplaces

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.939
and if you wanted to buy cheese from the market,
you used to have to ask the seller to cut

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.641
off the amount you wanted from these very
large wheels, rather than have cheese you

00:01:21.641 --> 00:01:24.619
could buy pre-packaged in consumer sized portions.

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.759
If none of these issues are a concern, then
making cheese in a block (often from large

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.470
blocks that are then cut into smaller blocks
for consumer usage) is often a wise choice

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.729
as blocks are easier and more economical to
stack, store and transport over long distances.

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.719
Other shapes are used as well, sometimes as
much to do with tradition as anything else

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:49.159
thanks to modern cheese making equipment and
environmental controls.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.549
These include cylinders and pyramids, which
are very popular with goat’s milk cheeses

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:55.549
like chèvre.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.789
In fact, in France the shape of a goat’s
milk cheese tells savvy consumers instantly

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.249
where their cheese originated.

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:05.229
For example, the flat disk of Banon is known
to originate in Provençe, while a log of

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.759
the mild and creamy Montrachet comes from
Burgundy, and the striking cheese of Valençay,

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.630
called either Valançay or Pyramide, is instantly
recognizable for its flat-topped pyramidal

00:02:14.630 --> 00:03:38.340
shape (and loved for its mild 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:04:36.460
nutty flavor).
