00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
hey there everyone welcome to california

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.520
i'm about to show you a moon tree that's

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.639
right a moon tree now the moon trees all

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.130
over the world not just here they're

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.019
mainly in the United States and another

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.910
place you can find them is the good

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.970
state of Alabama that's where my friend

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.699
Destin lives so I asked him if it also

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.949
helped me out in what should we call

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.289
this operation moon three rolls a brady

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.660
i am more than willing to take on this

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.939
assignment from you i am pulling up next

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.380
to the u.s. space &amp; rocket center right

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.739
now we're about to go inside and check

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.870
out some Apollo's stuff and talk about

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.129
moon trees

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.860
ok so what exactly is a momentary well

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.340
the moon tree is a tree grown from seeds

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.460
that were taken to the moon seeds taken

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.129
to the moon basically about 500 seeds

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.870
were taken to the moon by an astronaut

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.840
called Stuart Roosa. he was the command

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.350
module pilot of apollo 14 now before he

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.180
was an astronaut, Roosa is what's called a

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.870
smokejumper smokejumpers parachute

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.720
firefighters one answer to the problem

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.600
of fire and remote roadless areas so he

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.729
had an association with trees and he was

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.560
asked if he'd take these seeds on his

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.970
voyage to the moon

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.040
he agreed okay check it out this is the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.340
Saturn V. this is what took the seeds

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.630
to the moon

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.340
we're gonna go to the end of the museum

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.990
here and see if we can look at the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.780
Apollo capsule which I wrote the seats

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.400
are actually in there not at some point

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.380
but i guess we have to return to Earth

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.650
want to take it out

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.370
alright so this is the apollo 16 command

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.520
module so this is not Apollo 14 which is

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.020
what the seeds were actually taken on

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.970
but still the Apollo program was

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.590
forward-thinking often hears a moon rock

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.390
by the way. Stuart Roosa didn't

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.580
actually walk on the moon that was alan

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.860
shepard and edgar mitchell rusev stayed

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.780
above in the command module called

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.910
kittyhawk basically orbiting the moon

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.910
waiting for his buddies to come back he

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.080
didn't mess around while he was up there

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.400
though he had a lot to do

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.930
he actually took a lot of photos of the

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.000
Moon and so while the guys were down on

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.910
the surface of the Moon these seeds were

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.820
going around the moon right there so

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.110
that the seeds didn't actually touch

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.700
down on the moon but they did go around

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.510
the moon after that they went back up a

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.360
rendezvoused, and then they came all

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.000
the way back and that's when the seeds

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.820
went to Mississippi which is where they

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.680
started to sprout once they were

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.930
sprouted they handed out all over the

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.480
nation even to other countries and we're

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.530
going to go try to find one of those

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.810
trees right now so my moon tree is one

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.239
of these here it's actually surprising

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.830
sort of how hidden the way it is

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.660
you'd think it'd be out on grand display

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.630
really important but this one's it's not

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.650
easy to find if you don't know what

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.340
you're looking for

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.650
now unfortunately there were seven here

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.150
at the Space and Rocket Center but in

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.410
the '80s they died

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.330
well I guess that's bound to happen to

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.690
some of the trees now where are we

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.310
it's around here somewhere i'll tell you

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.470
what this is hard work making these

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.150
educational YouTube videos

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.070
no messing around ok we don't know

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.810
exactly where the trees were planted it

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:08.830
was somewhere here at the Space and

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.750
Rocket Center so in order to figure out

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.480
what the whole grounds look like

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.580
erotic space shot oh ok

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.390
they're the trees were planted somewhere over

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.500
there. not really sure where you like

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.549
that

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.580
what's your name and I didn't like it i

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.170
loved it i was great

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.000
oh the seeds were up there they went to

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.930
the moon that came back they were

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.489
planted somewhere over here and they

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:37.690
died but we're going to see if we can

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.700
find a tree that actually survived there

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.010
was no countdown or anything good for ya

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.659
so we're going to go to Birmingham

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.040
Botanical Gardens see if we can find the

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.019
only one that I'm aware up here in the

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:47.829
state

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.959
let's go check it out keep glasses want

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.109
to come and we have liftoff on your part

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.240
about working

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.560
three minutes past the hour.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.310
all right here we go

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.330
are overkill I this is it this is my

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.870
moon tree if you don't believe me have

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.910
a look at this surprisingly unimpressive

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.180
little sign hidden away down here coast

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.740
redwood sequoia set pair of errands moon

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.169
tree in quotation marks the seed from

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.750
which this tree spring was taken to the

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.650
moon

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.270
how's it going you doing good we're

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.880
looking for the moon tree country me

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.360
show you

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.700
ok let's go find the mention there's a

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.520
guy in in England his name is brady he

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.590
has an educational YouTube channel and

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.030
he's making a video about moon trees and

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.669
he sent me up here to find the moon tree. so

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.979
could i get seeds from this tree and

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:49.810
have a second generation is that how

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.700
that works because we've done it before

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.040
we've actually planted seed and we

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.650
sent it to a Michigan arboretum so that

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.669
leads nicely to the issue of

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.530
second-generation omon trees i'm sure you

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.660
can figure out what they are these are

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.700
the sons and daughters of original moon

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.430
trees of this generation moon trace just

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.900
take the seeds plant them somewhere else

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.600
and it sounds to me like distance

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.160
learning himself up for second

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.750
generation moon tree in his backyard in

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.610
Alabama can we climb in there and see if

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.039
we can finally I mean a seed all right

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:19.900
let's go come on let's go mr. Taylor

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.940
said we could do you know what movie is

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.630
what would you guess the moon tree is a

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.990
moon moon moon Trey their branches are

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.700
shaped in a crescent

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.280
oh that's a good guess it's not right

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.530
but it's a good guess now it was grown

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.450
from seeds that were taken to the moon

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.130
last night

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.050
now that I wouldn't have thought

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.160
understand

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.030
yeah you seen these sycamore see pods I

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.830
don't know what they look like you so

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.440
Destin's montre that's a sycamore mine

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.440
here this is a redwood there were three

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.370
other types sweet gums furs and pines

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.070
there you moan trees that's the five

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.590
types of seeds that Stuart Roosa took to

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:03.310
the moon

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.680
I'm gonna touch the bark.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.739
so this tree came from a seed that went

00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:22.099
to space not only did go to space went

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:25.909
around the moon we go Destin send you

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:27.049
those bad boys

00:06:27.049 --> 00:06:28.789
Brady we're not gonna find any seeds

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:30.499
they keep it to clean around here it

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:32.179
looks like they trimmed at one point in

00:06:32.179 --> 00:06:37.159
time and that thing is big isn't it look

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.389
about there's the moon there's moon tree

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:50.779
Moon Moon tree Moon Moon tree so I think

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:53.179
school about moon trees is that that

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:54.949
means that seeds are completely

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:58.219
transportable it gets a little unit of

00:06:58.219 --> 00:07:00.860
life that goes dormant and you can do

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.809
whatever you want with it and it's still

00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:03.949
going to work

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:06.169
bruiser mitchell and Shepherd they've

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:08.149
all died now in fact apollo 14 is the

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:09.919
first mission for which all three

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:12.289
astronauts have passed away so it

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:14.360
somehow fitting that they're the ones

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.069
that have left us with this legacy of

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:20.239
Apollo. not a statue not a stone or metal

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:23.239
monument but something living and

00:07:23.239 --> 00:07:25.159
3 second-generation moon trees and

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:28.159
maybe 3rd 4th 5th generation moon trees

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:30.769
a way that we can always remember one of

00:07:30.769 --> 00:07:34.870
humankind's greatest accomplishments

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.060
if you've never seen Destin's youtube

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.520
channel smartereveryday I'm amazed you

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.410
haven't but you really should

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:42.400
it's not only one of the best

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.290
educational channels on youtube it's one

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.360
of the best channels on youtube . make

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.590
sure you check it out

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.390
links are on the screen description all

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:55.630
the usual places what i was thinking and

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.030
then the eggs back and them could have

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:03.100
chickens but they wouldn't have big legs

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:09.460
so you can eat them just have them as a

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:17.970
pad at the moon again
