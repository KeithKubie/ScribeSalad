00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.790
- [Instructor] What is BD, so
when they're just saying BD,

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.770
they're saying literally
the length of segment BD.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.090
So they're saying the length
from B, point B to point D.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.520
And B is sitting here at
negative two, D here is at five.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.930
So you're looking at really the distance

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.970
between negative two and five.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.450
So you literally could just
say, well, that's gonna be five,

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.640
that's kind of our endpoint,
minus negative two,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.400
so five minus negative two

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.460
is the same thing as
five plus two, or seven.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.440
Another way, you could
literally just count it out.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.430
Count out the distance, you
go one, two, to get to zero,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.940
three, four, five, six, seven,
to get all the way to five.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.370
Or you could say, look, I got to get,

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.520
I got to go two to the right just to get,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.600
I got to go two to the
right just to get to zero,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.460
and I got to go five more
to the right to get to D,

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.010
so that's going to be seven.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.270
Let's do a couple more, what is BD again?

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.900
Well, here we're going from one to four.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.563
The distance between
one and four is three.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.290
And then let's do one more, what is AD?

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.040
So A is a negative five,
D is all the way at four.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.610
So we're going from negative
five to zero, which is five,

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.690
and then we're gonna go four
more, five plus four is nine.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.040
Or you could say, hey look,
we start at negative five,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.550
we end up at four, four
minus negative five

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.683
is the same thing as four
plus five, which is nine.
