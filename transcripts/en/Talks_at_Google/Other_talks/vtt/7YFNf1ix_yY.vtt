00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:07.150
&gt;&gt;presenter: Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome
to AuthorsGoogle New York presentation. This

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.519
is Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, a Hungarian scientist.
He is the former Emil T. Hofmann professor

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.500
at the University of Notre Dame and dis-,
current Distinguished Professor and Director

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.310
of Northeastern University Center for Complex
Network Research and associate member of the

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.199
Center for Cancer Systems Biology at the Dana
Farber Cancer Institute at Harvard University.

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.140
He's here today to talk about his current
book, "Bursts", which probably has direct

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:35.850
applications for all of us here at Google.
So, without further ado, Dr. Barabasi.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:36.850
[applause]

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:47.710
&gt;&gt;Albert: Thank you and thanks for the opportunity
of being here. So, well, let's just start

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.550
easy in that respect and I wanna show you--
if I can get technological-- a video that

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.960
I just discovered, essentially, last week
by somebody giving a talk. So, I stole it.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.930
And what you see here, this is what I call,
what the original title is "Good Morning",

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.690
and it's a visualization of when people say
"good morning" around the globe. So, essentially,

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.780
it's coming from Twitter and what they have
done is that every time somebody, somebody

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.250
tweets "good morning," they color code it
in real time and what you end up, like the

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.620
green is like an early good morning, the yellow
is like 9am good morning at the local time

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.280
and then black are those people who say good
morning at the really odd time.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.280
[laughter]

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.920
So, and if you just kind of look at it, you
can see how the morning comes around the globe

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.960
and how it really spreads and as a wave goes
through the US, like the, the orange line

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.310
goes through US as, as 9am passes by and,
and on one hand it is beautiful and the other

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.670
one it's, it appears to be completely useless
because who really cares about when people

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.670
say "good morning?"

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.670
[laughter]

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.680
But, on the other hand, it actually powers,
shows the power of what you can do with data

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.460
today. What you can do with this massive amount
of data that is emerging about human behavior.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.200
And, of course, being at Google here today
I don't have to preach the power of data because

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.500
Google is really about data in that respect.
But it also shows how much data we can actually

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.359
cover about what we do essentially, on a daily
basis. And I'm a physicist and which means

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:19.099
I'm a natural scientist and, and -- which
means that I believe that natural phenomena

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.700
can be understood, described, quantified,
predicted and controlled. And no one would

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.719
find anything questionable about that statement.
That's what scientists are supposed to do

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:34.159
and that's how scientists are supposed to
believe to drive their work. What, however,

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.909
if we replace natural phenomena with humans?
And if we read the sentence together, then

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:43.680
it says humans are supposed to be understood,
described, quantified, predicted and controlled

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.110
and that's obviously a very scary statement.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.529
[laughter]

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:52.279
So, I mean, we don't have to panic, of course.
That's the good news because the, the, -- there's

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:57.219
little secret that we don't really talk about
in science is, is that the fact that the scientific

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:02.230
revolution that really determines our life
has really stopped at the border of natural

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.379
sciences. It never really reached us humans.
And what I mean by that? I mean that we have

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:14.459
no problem predicting where an electron will
go, but we have -- but we cannot foresee electronic

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:21.540
crisis or, kind of emerging financial crisis
and so on. We have no problem turning on and

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.190
off a gene, essentially, in a cell, but we
have serious difficulties foreseeing wars

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.650
and battles and major crisis and so on. And
the reason for that is very simple. There

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.499
is a fundamental difference between humans
and bacteria, or, or other kind of natural

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:42.680
organisms because bacteria don't get really
annoyed at you when you put them under the

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.150
microscope. And the moon will never sue you
for landing a space craft on its face, but--

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.150
[laughter]

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.680
on the other hand, none of us really would
like to submit ourselves to that detailed

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.599
data collection that we really submit objects
of na-, of the study of natural sciences;

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:04.780
trying to know about them everything all the
time. And what I'm trying to do today is to

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.760
tell you a bit that this is about to change.
And it's gonna, and it's good change essentially

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.499
in a very profound way. Now, I mentioned prediction.
In order to make predictions, essentially,

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:20.599
you need data; lots of data. Anyone who tells
you that they can make any prediction without

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:24.259
data are either palm readers or business consultants.

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:25.259
[laughter]

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:30.729
So, when it comes to humans essentially, what
is really changing is that we started to have

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:36.810
data. And you know very well the kind of data
I'm talking about. Every time we send an email,

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.930
we leave some digital breadcrumb about our
social links, about interests and so on. Our

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.270
bank knows our ability to pay for things,
our tastes, our willingness to pay for certain

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.870
things and where we shop for. And, and our
mobile phone company knows where we are and

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.530
how me move around and, and so on. And so
we often don't choose to think about it. But

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:03.389
at the end of the day that we are under multiple
microscopes that will record, in real time,

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:08.879
what we do and from these digital breadcrumbs,
we actually, one can re-, recover a person's

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:16.439
life with almost minute resolution. So, when
it comes to the book Burst, what I tried to

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:21.340
achieve here is to, to kind of talk about
the fundamental changes that are happening

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.449
thanks to this huge amount of data that is
emerging about human behavior. There are lots

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.599
of aspects of this data. One of them is privacy
aspects and I'm sure being at Google you know

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:36.470
exactly what I'm talking about. But the book,
even though it mentions privacy, is not about

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.669
privacy. It's about the laboratory that really
our society is becoming, thanks to this huge

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:47.780
amount of data that is being automatically
collected about all of us and about its revealing

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:55.470
power to understand human behavior. Now, when
it comes to human behavior, we have to realize

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.889
that why -- I have a fundamental question
to ask is that why would a physicist care

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:05.159
about human behavior? And let me kind of rephrase
that question. Why would you listen to a physicist--

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:06.159
[laughter]

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:10.909
talking about human behavior or brain science,
instead of listening to sociologists or to

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:17.290
a brain scientist or somebody like that? And
the truth is that, yes, we in physics started

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.239
to care about human behavior, but our real
interest and my real interest really is in

00:06:21.239 --> 00:06:25.259
understanding complex systems. And there are
a bunch of complex systems out there that

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:29.440
are worthy of scientific interest. The brain
is one of them. The economy is another one.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:35.819
The human cell is another one and computer
systems is yet another one. But what is happening

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:42.530
the last years is that really, the society's
becoming the one where we can get the most

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.760
data about the behavior of the individual
components. The type of data that is really

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.749
emerging about what we do--all of us on a
daily basis--would be equivalent of knowing

00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:56.360
every, what every single neuron of mine does
in real time. Or, would be equivalent of knowing

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.539
what every single gene of mine does, essentially,
in real time because there's individual data

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:08.360
collected about each individual; about their
activity patterns, mobility patterns and so

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.379
on. So, so when, what, if you wanna be pragmatic
and you believe that complex systems behave

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:17.360
in a similar fashion, then you wanna go in
a direction where you have the most data and

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.099
where you can make the most advances. And
in the last five, ten years, human society

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:26.560
is becoming the archetypical complex system
that we can really study in real time. So,

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:32.460
I mean, this is a long pursuit for, at least
for me. It started with our studies on networks

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.740
and some of you may have actually seen my
earlier book, "Linked", where I talked about

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.729
how people are connected and how components
of a complex system, generally, are connected.

00:07:40.729 --> 00:07:45.919
How genes connect to each other, how computers
connect to each other and how you characterize

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:50.830
this large network that emerges from that.
And then, of course, the second step of this

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:55.889
pursuit is to go from the structure, the network
to the, the dynamics of when things happen

00:07:55.889 --> 00:08:01.090
and how, how do we understand in time, the
type of events that take place in a complex

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:07.560
system and that's really the, the pursuit
and the goal of "Burst" in that respect. Now,

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.469
when I wrote "Burst" actually, I had a couple
of goals in mind. And one of them had to do

00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:16.509
with how the book should look like. If you
write to a general audience, particularly

00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:21.539
about science, there are a couple of clichés
that you are supposed to respect. First of

00:08:21.539 --> 00:08:26.719
all is that you are supposed to spill all
the big ideas in the first chapter, so just

00:08:26.719 --> 00:08:30.620
in case you never had the patient, the patience
to go all the way to the end, you haven't

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:35.710
really missed anything. So, you can stop at
the end of chapter 1. And, and also kind of

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:41.669
the chapters have to be a standalone so that,
once again, if you, if you feel that you stop

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:45.640
in the middle of the book you can still go
to a cocktail party and chat about reading

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:52.400
the book, itself. So, I kind of, when I wrote
"Burst", I said, "Let's, let's try to do something

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.900
different in a sense that if you don't have
any of these expectations that I described

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.220
from the novel, to the contrary, if you get
to the end of the novel and there's nothing

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:05.040
surprising that really builds on what happened
before, then you are somewhat disappointed."

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:11.390
So, in a way, I built essentially the book
to read as a narrative that evolves in time

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:16.580
and, and builds on each other and I can tell
you that much that, unless you read it to

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.940
the end, you will really not find out along
the way what hap-, what happens because some

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:25.290
of the big questions that I'm asking are really
kind of addressed fully only to the end and,

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:29.940
and they are kind of big turns in the, in
the story as we move along. But let me give

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:37.000
you also kind of an insider connect to "Burst",
which is like because it has a couple of different

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.120
lines of narratives that are moving together
and the first narrative has to do with what

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:50.690
I call "Hasan." This is a picture of Hasan
and Hasan is an artist. He's a, he's a media

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:54.760
installation artist, depending on how you
wanna define him, but one of the reason that

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.770
actually became interesting to us is because
something interesting happened to me after

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:03.110
September 11th, that is, after travelling
around Africa--and he travels a lot, I mean,

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:07.230
he travels so much essentially that he has
a 96 pages thick passport because he needs

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:12.260
that many pages to fit all the pass-, all
the stamps that, to the countries he travels

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:18.080
to--and so, he was actually, pulled off the
plane once he returned to US after September

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:24.280
11th and was questioned by the FBI in Detroit
and that started essentially a hiatus step.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:30.080
Kind of lasted about six months that eventually
ended with lie detector tests and he has spent

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:36.760
many, many hours in the FBI offices; never
being really arrested, never being really

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:43.780
officially processed, but nevertheless, constantly
harassed about what are his activities. It

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:48.840
turned out that the reason why they arrested
him was very simple--because he happened to

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:55.790
have a, a storage box in Florida that he closed
down just right after September 11. So, the

00:10:55.790 --> 00:11:01.060
local owners of the storage facility looked
at him and said, "You know, you know, September

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:05.150
11th, we know that Florid-, people from Florida
are [ ] the training happened there. This

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:09.071
guy's called Hasan Alaji. Hasan Alaji, he
has brownish skin, so what could he be?"

00:11:09.071 --> 00:11:10.071
[laughter]

00:11:10.071 --> 00:11:11.320
[Albert laughs]

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:16.360
So and that really kind of put him underwater
for about six months and much longer, actually,

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.690
so certain activity continues today. But what
is interesting about him is not what happened

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:25.030
to him, because he's not alone; it happened
to many people. What is interesting about

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:31.910
him is that how he reacted to these events.
And the, after some of the, some of the visits

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:37.240
to the FBI, he was asked essentially to every
time to reveal where he goes internationally,

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:42.200
partly for his own safety so he can come back
to the US and so on, and eventually he decided

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:46.870
that he will start revealing this information
publically. So, if you, he has a website that

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:51.030
I haven't yet connected to Internet here,
but the point is that if you go to his website,

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:57.311
trackingtransients.com, you can find out in
real time where he is precisely. You can get

00:11:57.311 --> 00:12:02.680
pictures of the environment where he is. You
can get, essentially, not only for where he

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.240
is now, but all his past for the last six,
seven years. You can get pictures of all the

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:12.000
meals he ate, all the bathrooms he's visited,
all the expenses he ever made, all the flight

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.401
numbers he ever took, pretty much all his
life, essentially, spelled out there. So,

00:12:16.401 --> 00:12:20.900
now you parti-, perhaps can understand why
it's interesting for us because he's a person

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:25.610
whose activity is publically known. It's available
to everybody because he chose to disclose

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:32.570
his life, the way he thinks about it, by disclosing
all his activities and putting it out to everybody,

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:36.880
it becomes worthless because the value of
the information is based that some people

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.060
have it and others don't and that's where
the value is derived from and when everybody

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:45.690
has access to the information the value really
drops. And, and in his case, he thought that

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:50.720
the value for the FBI for information about
him becomes worthless if it's available to

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.990
everybody. And he also kind of tracks himself
in the behalf of the FBI, the way he thinks

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:59.600
about it. But, as a result, we know a lot
about him and one of the things I do in the

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:05.610
book is that we actually analyze his trajectory,
his, his habits and we compare it to the habits

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:10.470
of millions of other individuals to try to
understand whether is he really unusual or

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:16.580
is he normal? Was the FBI actually right arresting
him for, for because he was, the reason he

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:21.670
was arrested was for irregular travel patterns
as well. And, and was, was the FBI right doing

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.810
so or he's relatively ordinary and there are
some actually interesting surprises as we

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:28.690
analyzed him as they come along in the book.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:32.640
So, that's the first story line that we follow
across the book and only at the end of the

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:37.280
book we actually get to understand what's
happened to him all the way here today. The

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:44.940
second story line I call it 1514. And it really
refers to an event that started in Rome in

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:51.810
1513 at the Papal election and then it went
into a big crusades that started, that started

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:56.970
from Hungary and spread to Transylvania and,
of course, one of the reasons this was somewhat

00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:00.630
interesting for me--and I knew a bit more
about it because I happened to be born in

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:04.500
Transylvania so I'm somewhat more familiar
with, with the events over there--but why

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:08.380
is this interesting? The reason why this event
is interesting, from the perspective of the

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:12.870
book, is because at the certain moment at
the beginning of the events, some person gets

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:17.420
up and says, "I know exactly what's going
to happen." And he gives, essentially, a prophecy

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:22.530
saying that if you guys do with these decisions
and the decision is about starting a crusade

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:27.230
or not starting a crusade, then, then this
will be the outcome of the events. It will

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:30.060
lead some really blott-, bloody battles, in
which you're gonna be ending up, ending up

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:35.680
on the shorter end of the table. And, and
the question that I ask through this particular

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:41.970
story is that was he right making that prediction?
And how could somebody in 1513 make a prediction

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:49.370
about the events that will actually happen
during the next six months. And, in general,

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:54.470
using this one as a, as a starting point,
can we really make predictions about events

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:59.980
that are of such magnitude as, as they appear
in history books and so on? And the beauty

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:04.481
about events happening in 1514 that we know
exactly what the outcome is, of course. But

00:15:04.481 --> 00:15:09.090
I think that the story itself is very fascinating
and very much ties into the, the world pursuit

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:13.970
of the book about predictability of human
behavior. And the third aspect of the book,

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:21.000
of course, is the science. And I, the code
is called "Bursts" because the bursts certainly

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.780
refers to an activity pattern that we all
beha- that we all follow. And if you look

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:31.220
at anybody's activity pattern in real time--when
do we send emails, when do we make phone calls,

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:36.170
so when do we browse the Web--and I challenge
you for those of you have access to data like

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:39.430
that to look at it whether it's the case or
not. I'm sure it's going to be true because

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:43.980
we looked at lots of data in that respect.
These events are not random in time, but they

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:48.900
are conglomerated into bursts. That is, I
have short periods of time when I send lots

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:52.590
of emails out and then long periods where
I don't have, get a chance to do any. And

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:56.360
then follows another burst of activity when
it comes to my email. Same for phone calls,

00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:02.580
same for, even essentially, sex, same for,
same for visiting the libraries or certain

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:07.020
locations and so on. So one of the things
we notice in the last kind of decade is that

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:11.620
really human activity is not entirely random,
but there -- it has these conglomerations

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:15.930
into these short bursts. And most important
the timing of these events actually follows

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:21.730
very precise laws that we call "power laws".
And that is, and it's not kind of following

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:26.320
the random, random patterns that one would
expect if really our activity pattern would

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.590
be derived by randomness. Now, of course,
no one expects that their activity pattern

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:34.530
is random so that's never a question. I don't
think that I'm acting randomly and I hope

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:38.920
none of you acts random, either. But the question
from the scientific perspective is that what

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:43.590
are the signatures from the norm-, from those
normal randomness? And burstness is one of

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:48.130
the signatures. And burstness actually takes
us to the next question, which I already outlined

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:53.200
here. I said, "If we were to understand humans
the way we understand natural phenomena, we

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:59.260
should be able to predict their activity."
Now, prediction is really a very scary word

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:03.400
by itself because the question is what are
we going to predict? Am I going to try to

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:07.351
predict what you're going to dream about tonight?
Or, will I predict when will you get the next

00:17:07.351 --> 00:17:13.220
promotion? Or a chance encounter with somebody
and so on. And as I mentioned earlier, in

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:18.290
order to predict anything we need data--lots
of data. So, a litmus test of our ability

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:24.620
to predict human behavior really rests on
our ability to collect data about some aspects

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:30.430
of human behavior; then we can use later to
say how predictable it is. So, when we started

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:36.240
thinking about this problem several year ago,
I thought, "Let's collect data about human

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:41.210
mobility; where we are, where we go next."
So, I actually, not having access to any other

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:46.450
data, I was so curious whether we are predictable
or not that I decided to collect data about

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:51.030
myself. So, I started to wear this tiny, sexy
watch that was really a conversation piece

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:59.240
at any single dinner that I went to because
it was standing out as a big brick on my hand.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.240
[laughter]

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.970
But what it did, essentially, is that it's
really designed for runners and anybody else

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:09.880
who's involved in other sports that needs
to track their location in time, and what

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:14.150
it does is it tracks in real time where you
are and at the end of the day you can put

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:18.210
it into the computer and you get, essentially,
your trajectory. So, in my case, I got a map

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:23.000
like that. So, here's how I'm moving around
Boston so I can disclose my location because

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.550
this is mine. And, and the question that I
wanted to ask with this data that if I have

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:32.200
access to my past whereabouts, could I write
an algorithm that would tell me where I'm

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:37.110
going to be tomorrow at 3pm? Not that I really
care about where I'm gonna be tomorrow at

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:41.890
3pm. I should know better than that, but that's
really a test of how well we understand, essentially,

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:47.960
some aspects of human behavior, like human
mobility. But as we're, as we're kind of collecting

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:54.250
data I realize that there is already lots
of location data collected by individuals

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:59.100
because -- is there anybody in this room who
does not have a mobile phone? Ok, nobody's

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:03.680
raising their hand. So, and of course, nope,
you're not kidding yourself in this particular

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:07.160
institution about the fact that your mobile
phone company knows exactly where you are

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:13.240
at any moment. So, and, and not only do they
know where you are and that's normally not

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:17.530
collected, but for billing purposes, every
time you make a phone call that data is actually

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:23.870
being collected. So, so the mobile phone company
knows not only where you are, but it knows

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:28.100
where millions of other consumers. So, this
is much richer data than what I could ever

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:32.550
collect about myself because it allows us
to compare many, many individuals and, of

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:37.960
course, mobile phone companies are terribly
worried about releasing some of this data

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:43.000
as you very well know here because they wanna,
they wanna protect the data for keeping the

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.040
trust of their consumers and also for legal
reasons and so on. But in the last few years

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.770
they realized that there's lots of value in
this data, so they started to raise it for

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:55.660
researchers, for other companies and my group
happened to be one of those that we were given

00:19:55.660 --> 00:20:00.590
quite large scale data about human mobility
and calling patterns--of course, anonymized

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:03.710
we don't know who the users are, we don't
know their phone numbers, we just know, they

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:09.050
are for us, they are just particles wandering
in space like a bromium particle in a gas.

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:14.130
And this really kind of allowed us to ask
the question: How predictable we are? So,

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:18.320
lemme give you an idea what is the amount
of data that one can actually get from that.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:23.550
And what you see, of course, is a visualization
of the wonderful city of Paris, of how people

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:29.110
move around Paris, thanks to their mobile
phone data. And when you see this firework-like

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:32.980
type of jumps out there it doesn't really
mean that lots of mobile phone consumers jump

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:38.410
up in the sky and came back, but it just really
meant that in order to visualize the high

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:42.120
number of people going from one location to
another one, the next street, they really

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.930
had to move them out of space, essentially,
out of the flat space because otherwise you

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:50.490
wouldn't see the huge amount of activity that
is taking place over there. So, this kind

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:56.580
of gives you an idea of, of how much we know
about these individuals and once you have

00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:02.040
access to the data, you can really start asking
the legitimate question: Is this behavior

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:06.860
predictable? Now, one of the questions we
first asked in a series of papers is that

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:12.990
what are distances that people travel on a
daily basis; how far you move around? And

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:18.760
the answer was relatively simple. If you look
at how many individuals move a certain distance,

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:24.730
this is the, this is the typical distance
car-, travel by, let's say, a person in a

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:30.330
big period versus the, how many people travel
that much, you find that most individuals

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:36.610
tend to stay local; that they just move two
to five kilometers on a daily basis. So, they

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:39.800
have a reduce of movement that is relatively
small, but of course, there are a few people

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:44.550
out there at the tail of the distribution
that move a lot. And the number of individuals

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:48.371
who move a little and versus those who move
a lot follows a very precise power law. So,

00:21:48.371 --> 00:21:53.100
again, it's, it's, if you have a large population
you can predict how many people will be big

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.030
travelers, work travelers and how many will
be just sticking around in the neighborhood,

00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:01.500
moving next door, essentially, to work from
their home and so on. So, this was kind of

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:06.040
the first step. And it already indicated there
was a lot of heterogametic in the population;

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:10.450
people behave quite differently if you look
at the large population. The next thing we

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:13.370
did is that we used this trajectory to measure
the entropy of each individual. That is, for

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:19.510
each person we measure the entropy of the
trajectory. Now, what is entropy? The entropy

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:23.790
of this particular system is zero. It says
that there is completely order system. You

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:28.260
know exactly where each ball is; there is
no ambiguity about each ball's position so

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:33.470
that's why we say "from our perspective it
has zero entropy." Now, this is a system how

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:37.910
it looks like if it is a disordered system
and that would have some kind of larger entropy

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:41.960
clearing on zero because it's random. So,
the entropy is a measure of randomness in

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:46.940
that respect, but the reason why we, we measured
entropy is because entropy is connected to

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:53.240
predictability. Lemme show you what I mean.
If I remove a ball--sorry--and, and you look

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:57.620
at this, you say, "Because the entropy of
the system is zero, you have absolutely no

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:01.700
ambiguity about where the use-, about where
the ball is missing from." You know exactly

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:06.450
the position of the ball that is missing from
there. What, so if I put it back I give you

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:12.510
no new information; very predictable. However,
if I show you this configuration then you

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:16.120
have no way of really knowing where I removed
that particle from. So, if the entropy of

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:21.860
the system is not zero, then it's much harder
to predict. And the same to our, to our trajectory.

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:26.110
If I measure your trajectory, my trajectory,
if I get a very, very low entropy it means

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:30.650
that we're very predictable. If I get a very
high entropy I have lots of problems predicting

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:34.750
where you're gonna be next time. So, what
we, what was our expectation? So, first of

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:39.420
all, we, we're able to derive from entropy
a measure of predictability and the predictability

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:44.309
in this case goes between number zero and
one. So, this is horizontally is this high

00:23:44.309 --> 00:23:49.090
predictability and zero means is that the
user is completely, it's impossible to predict.

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:54.120
It's completely random, his or her motion.
And the predictability would be one if I could,

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:58.340
if one could, in principle, write a data mining
algorithm that, based on the past locations,

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:02.370
could a hundred percent accuracy predict their
next location. So, there will be no randomness

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:06.360
whatsoever in the persons motion. He or she
goes always exactly the same time back and

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:12.040
forth between home and work, for example.
So, our expectation was that because there

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.670
is this big heterogametic in the way we behave
and we move around, as we showed earlier in

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:21.140
the distances, we would find that most people
are difficult to predict because they happen

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:25.530
to have a life and they are somewhat spontaneous
and so on. And there may be a few people that

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:30.040
are somewhat easier to predict. So, that was
kind of where our starting point, that there

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:34.460
will be this kind of spectrum of behavior.
So then we measured the entropy for each user

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:40.920
and then we measured from that the predictability.
And on this plot, the predictability looked

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:45.440
like that. So, what is it that we see here?
Essentially, this is the predictability across

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:49.550
a large number of users who use mobile phones.
And the first thing you notice is that it's,

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:53.770
it's not a small number, but it's a very large
number. It's peaked around .93, which means

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:58.730
that, for a typical person, if you know their
past locations in principle with a 93 percent

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:02.940
accuracy, you can predict their next, their
next location, which is a huge amount of predictability

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:09.309
across the population and when it comes to
their next location. What is also interesting

00:25:09.309 --> 00:25:15.510
about this curve is that there is nobody under
80 percent. That is, we always think that

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:21.179
there are, so in reality we are all very predictable,
we're missing essentially the people who don't

00:25:21.179 --> 00:25:26.270
have really a high predictability and really
what is surprising is we tend to think that--ok,

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:30.430
fine. I happen to be a regular fellow. I go
always to work in the morning or, in my case,

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:34.470
at noon and I come back in the evening and
I have my favorite cafeterias and I follow

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:39.140
that path every day and so on. But there are
these other cool people around me.

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.140
[laughter]

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:45.600
The students and the rockers and so on who
are really cool and they are really unpredictable.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:49.710
They are spontaneous. They're really living
out there. Well, what this curve tells you

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:54.809
is that that person may seem cool to you,
but is probably only five percent less predictable

00:25:54.809 --> 00:25:55.809
than you are.

00:25:55.809 --> 00:25:56.809
[everyone laughs]

00:25:56.809 --> 00:26:02.130
So, I don't want to put it in terms that we
are all boring, but when it comes to our predictability

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:06.470
or at least our locations, it is, it is actually
the case. At least that's what the data is

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:07.470
showing to us.

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:08.470
[audience member laughs]

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:12.860
So, why am I bringing this example up and
why did I put this one in the book? Is because

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:17.130
I was really trying to show that once you
can collect enough data about people you can

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:21.950
really ask this fundamental question how predictable
we are and you get really surprising answers,

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:25.920
which kind of if one interpolated into the
future, could say, "Is it possible that just

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:30.990
about any aspects of human behavior could
be predicted if we collect enough data?" And

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:34.350
that's really kind of a question, that is
a question of our times and I'm sure many

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:39.190
of you are thinking about it in this context
and, and the answer is very complex. And I

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:43.610
kind of try to advance this argument as I
move along the book is that where will this

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:48.800
essentially lead in the long term? So, kind
of closing the, the science part for a second

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:54.450
in the interest of time, the last aspect of
the book – it's kind of the last vehicle

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:58.990
to getting the message through -- is a very
nonconventional one because it has to do with

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:03.570
images. So, if you flip through the book you
will see images like that and these are the,

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:09.370
these are drawings and kind of like, it's
kind of using different media. It was done

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:11.970
by Botond Reszegh and Botond Reszegh is an
artist from Transylvania, from the village

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:17.990
where I'm from, essentially, from the city
where I'm from in Transylvania. And what he

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:21.690
and I had been working on for the last few
years while writing this book is that to,

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:26.840
I told you there are different layers in the
book: the history, the science, Hasan and

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:31.870
so on. So, every second chapter, essentially,
has an image like that, which tries to put

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:36.090
these different layers on top of each other.
It tries to marry the science with the history.

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:40.200
And this is a good example of that. This comes
before the chapter where we start to talk

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:44.559
about the historical, the historical moment
when the Pope election takes place in Rome

00:27:44.559 --> 00:27:50.950
that starts the history aspects of the book
and, and hence, since that particular event

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:57.090
took place in the Sistine Chapel, we see,
we see kind of the image of God in front of

00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:00.929
the Sistine Chapel. What is interesting is
that this particular event takes place a few

00:28:00.929 --> 00:28:05.800
months after the painting of Michelangelo
was finished, so those electors who were actually

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.640
electing the next Pope probably could smell
the fresh paint on the wall because it was

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:15.190
just brand new; a few months old. And on top
of it you see a Brownian motion because I

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:20.070
talk in that particular chapter about the
possibility that we are random. And one aspect

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:24.929
of random mobility is that we move completely
randomly. That is, that we move like a random

00:28:24.929 --> 00:28:30.140
particle and you kind of see a Brownian trajectory
over there. So, as I mentioned, every second

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:35.350
chapter has--and I think these are beautiful
images that Botond Reszegh has done--and kind

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:41.750
of the concept of bursts in essence marry-,
married with, with some of the battles that

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:45.860
took place in the the event, the concept of
chance and weather predictability on the top

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:49.880
and at the same time showing the historical
location of some of the events that took place

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:55.670
in the history line. And, and the last reason
why, and this one actually is one of my favorites,

00:28:55.670 --> 00:29:00.760
once again, on the top those criss-crosses
essentially show the trajectory of mobile

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:05.570
phone users, as is recorded by mobile phone
companies where they are based on their phone

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:10.810
calls. And what you see in the latter, essentially,
is a key letter in the historical line because

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:18.120
it reveals who is the character--who is the
main character--of the historical story. And

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:22.890
this letter was written about seven years
before the events took place in Transylvania

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:28.610
and one of, and, and I actually travelled
quite a bit to find that particular letter

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:33.390
and the reason why this was particularly interesting
for me is it was written actually by Leonard

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:36.980
Barabasi who happens to be one of my ancestors
who was the viceroy of Transylvania, so, the

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:43.870
second person after the king at that time.
So, he himself was very personally involved

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:47.600
and through him, essentially, our family was
very involved in much of the events of 1514.

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:51.990
So, it's not a completely independent story.
The reason why I picked it is because it has

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:56.549
lots of personal relevance, just like the
science in the book because if I wanna conclude

00:29:56.549 --> 00:30:02.380
I wanna say in many ways this was a very personal
book because I don't -- I try to write about

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:07.420
things that I care about that involves the
science part, the type of research that we

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:11.830
do in my group about predictability, about
human behavior, about complication of social

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:16.940
science and the history like also follows
my personal interest in that respect. And

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:22.670
my goal was in this book is to kind of combine
these different narratives together and it

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:31.600
will be up to you to decide how successful
that attempt has been. Thank you very much

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.299
for attention.

00:30:33.299 --> 00:30:34.299
[applause]

00:30:34.299 --> 00:30:38.540
And I believe we have some time to take some
questions? Am I correct? I guess we have to

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:41.010
use that microphone so that it will be recorded
for posterity, or whatever you say, in the

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:44.410
spirit of this talk.

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:45.410
[Albert laughs}

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:46.420
And the spirit of the book. Yes.

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:53.290
&gt;&gt;audience member#1: Hi. You mentioned predicting
people's location. I was wondering what granularity

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:54.290
that was at?

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:57.890
&gt;&gt;Albert: Oh. So, the work we have done, essentially,
we entirely use only the tower level data.

00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:04.230
So, so, so, we know exactly where users are
when they make a phone call and, and only

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:06.700
what is the tower they are closest at. So,
what we--

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.980
&gt;&gt;audience member#1: So, is that typically
like a half mile or?

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:11.880
&gt;&gt;Albert: Well, it depends on the, on the
region, obviously. In big cities, it could

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:17.900
be a few hundred meters, essentially, a quarter
of a mile, even shorter. In, so the, so the

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:21.850
density is very, very high in big cities like
New York City and becomes much lower when

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:26.600
you go out of that. Yes, that's right, but
the majority of the users that we looked at

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.940
happened to be in the big cities because that's
where people are. So, in that respect we have

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:34.710
quite a bit of resolution, but yes, indeed.
In principle, we also chunked the time into

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:37.510
hour long intervals because there's really
not much of a [ ] where you'll be maybe five

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:43.549
minutes from now. It's more like in hourly
intervals so, so at the end, a temporal regularity,

00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:47.950
temporal chunks are on hour and the location
resolution is the tower distance.

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:49.450
&gt;&gt;audience member#1: Thanks.

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:50.450
&gt;&gt;Albert: Mm-hmm.

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:56.220
&gt;&gt;audience member #2: Hi. You talked about
trying to understand people. There's this

00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:02.500
stupid flatworm called C. elegans where we
know the complete circuit diagram; every cell

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:09.510
and every neuron and yet people have not been
able to build a complete simulator of this

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:15.810
worm. So, I look at that and I say, "We're
very far away from being able to predict individual

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:20.680
people." We can predict statistical things
and that's quite different. Have you ever,

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:26.460
I don't know if you've seen the book, "Human
Behavior and the Principle of Least Effort",

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:32.910
by Zipf in 1949 where he tried to predict
mass behavior, but I look at this specific

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:37.140
simulations and I say, "We can't even do a
flatworm." People have also tried to do the

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:40.410
garden slug and again, they know the wiring
diagram and they can't tell you what the slug

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:41.880
will do.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:46.230
&gt;&gt;Albert: It's, it's a lovely question. Essentially,
is that, I mean I think that your question

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:51.549
has many, many -- raises many, many issues.
The flatworm, C. elegans, is one of my favorites,

00:32:51.549 --> 00:32:54.240
essentially. I have published quite a number
of papers on that. I know, I don't know if

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:58.440
you know, that you can knock out a particular
gene and then you would make it to make all,

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:02.760
only in circles and circles and circles. So,
so, we understand lots about that, but--

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.860
&gt;&gt;audience member #2: You mean the Indianapolis
Race Course?

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:06.860
[Albert laughs]

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:08.170
&gt;&gt;Albert: That's right, that's right. It becomes
a car racer, that's right. But, on the other

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:12.929
hand, the, the question you are really raising
is that what is the type of data? Can we really

00:33:12.929 --> 00:33:18.790
understand something from fundamentals? Physicists
have been very kind of arrogant in that respect

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:22.390
to say if we understand elementary particles
we can tell you everything what you're gonna

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:26.900
do next. And that's not the case. So, in the
sense that really, I mean, there are these

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:31.270
different resolutions of how we understand,
essentially, in the world and one of the,

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:35.950
and I think most of us in sciences have given
away that particular possibility that in my

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:40.400
understanding quantum mechanics elementary
particles we're gonna understand how our brain

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.799
works. But what is really happening is that
at different levels of resolution we can really

00:33:44.799 --> 00:33:49.850
measure certain aspects of behavior and they,
by themselves, can be predictable. So, I may

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:54.870
not understand fully the full quantum mechanics
of how a electron moves exactly in let's say,

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:59.700
one particular metal, but I can make a chip,
a pretty good chip about it and I can predict

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:04.630
very well the chip's behavior when it comes
to computation. And in the same way, I think

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:08.929
what happens about human behavior is that
we do not understand really from, let's say,

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:13.679
from neuron level why we do things and so
on, but certain behavior aspects of ours are

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:18.069
really fundamentally predictable and the data
is really telling us that is possible – the

00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:21.970
possibility. And, I think, if anything I can
hope from this research is that we will start

00:34:21.970 --> 00:34:27.379
asking systematically what aspects of human
behavior are part of that category that can

00:34:27.379 --> 00:34:31.550
be predicted and what aspects of that would
never be predictable, essentially, given the

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:34.970
amount of data we can collect of them, partly
because they happen too rarely to find any

00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:40.039
patterns about them and partly because they
inherently have such a large entropy, for

00:34:40.039 --> 00:34:43.769
example, that, that they're predictable if
it will be zero. And I think it's all up to

00:34:43.769 --> 00:34:50.259
us all in this environment is really ripe
for that to ask these questions across many

00:34:50.259 --> 00:34:52.680
behavior patterns. Thank you.

00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:57.700
&gt;&gt;audience member #3: Thank you, Dr. Albert,
for your presence. It's fantastic, fascinating

00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:04.579
chart indeed. My question is like, the minute
that someone says "predict," the notion that

00:35:04.579 --> 00:35:10.000
I get in my mind is predicting some form of
an event like a 9/11 happening, some kind

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.920
of event, right? And what I've really kind
of gathered from your research is predicting

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:16.920
human location--

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:17.920
&gt;&gt;Albert: Sure.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:20.970
&gt;&gt;audience member #3: like, where they are,
where they're going to be. So how will you

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:26.869
kind of connecting that locational prediction
to some kind of event that might take place.

00:35:26.869 --> 00:35:29.791
Have you made that, that bridge? Do you know
what I mean?

00:35:29.791 --> 00:35:34.200
&gt;&gt;Albert: The answer simply is no. And I,
I think we're very, very far from that, but

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:37.349
we're at the moment we can actually ask that
question whether that's possible or not. You

00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:41.970
are very right. Everything that I refer to
here, refers to habitual events; things we

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:47.400
do, things we do with certain amount of regularity
that we can actually collect data about that.

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.940
But I think that's the only way to proceed
at this stage. Let's first understand habitual

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:56.430
events. Let's understand the type of things
that we do and occupies 93 percent of our

00:35:56.430 --> 00:36:01.239
time because the reason why we can predict
93 percent accuracy is because we spend a

00:36:01.239 --> 00:36:05.800
huge bulk of our time at home and at work
and travelling in-between and there is very

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:10.670
little time in-between to do something crazy,
in that respect, in something different. And

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:14.960
I think once we understand the habitual events,
which I call the normal behavior patterns,

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:19.359
then we can start asking systematical the
question how we can predict, essentially,

00:36:19.359 --> 00:36:24.470
the event that differ from normal. And 9/11
is an event that differs from normal. Could

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:29.619
we get there? Right now, I say, "It's hopeless."
We cannot collect enough data to predict 9/11

00:36:29.619 --> 00:36:37.229
in that respect, another 9/11. But, on the
other hand, I think that we have to walk systematically

00:36:37.229 --> 00:36:41.190
this path through the small details all the
way to the big picture in order to get there

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:42.220
and give a precise answer.

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:46.369
&gt;&gt;audience member #3: Great. That's very interesting.
So, am I to, am I right in understanding that

00:36:46.369 --> 00:36:52.279
your thought is, rather your research, is
on the premise that most of the things that

00:36:52.279 --> 00:36:59.109
happen in the future has a very tangible link
to some data point that happened in the past?

00:36:59.109 --> 00:37:02.009
It could be location; it could be something
else which you have not yet researched as

00:37:02.009 --> 00:37:03.009
yet.

00:37:03.009 --> 00:37:06.289
&gt;&gt;Albert: Oh, I believe that and I think,
I think, think about the weather patterns,

00:37:06.289 --> 00:37:10.390
for example. In 1800 and this is one of the
things I talk about in the book, the way,

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:13.549
you know what? England was actually pretty
good at predicting about the weather. And

00:37:13.549 --> 00:37:18.609
the way they did it, and up to like 1960s,
was that every day the weather map would come

00:37:18.609 --> 00:37:23.150
in, what are the weather in the morning and
around UK and then the weatherman would look

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:28.650
around, essentially, and say, "I remember.
Four years ago in April was we had exactly

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:32.640
the same pattern. It was very, very similar.
Let's pull out that map." So they said, "Oh,

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:36.609
yeah. This is just like that." So let's pull
out the next day's map from four years ago

00:37:36.609 --> 00:37:40.720
and we say if the weather is today like four
years ago, then it's gonna continue next day

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:45.289
that way. And it was relatively predictive
in that respect. How did we get today to the

00:37:45.289 --> 00:37:49.210
very precise prediction that a few hours ahead
we are very accurate about the weather? By

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:54.310
collecting a huge amount of data about the
weather patterns, essentially. So, once that

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:58.880
data converged, that is, that we had enough
resolution in the data collection and in the

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:03.299
computational tools, then weather prediction
became rather accurate and we also understood

00:38:03.299 --> 00:38:07.500
the limits of how we can go. It's about 19
days how we can advance, how we can predict

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:11.160
in the future because there's a chaotic limit
that we are hitting that the instabilities

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:15.130
are too, the normalarities are too strong
and you cannot go beyond that even if you

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:20.259
have enough data. I think that's the type
of understanding we seek about human behavior.

00:38:20.259 --> 00:38:25.190
How far we can go in advance and what is the
limit of predictability? And I believe that

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:29.569
there will be a limit of predictability. For
human mobility, it's quite long because we

00:38:29.569 --> 00:38:33.799
are very regular. For some other aspects,
like 9/11, maybe very, very short.

00:38:33.799 --> 00:38:35.660
&gt;&gt;audience member #3: Thank you.

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:36.770
&gt;&gt;Albert: Thank you.

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:44.049
&gt;&gt;audience member #4: Hi. My question is about
also to predicting locations and you're, you're

00:38:44.049 --> 00:38:49.140
talking about habits and you're saying most
people are regular, but did you see any events

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:55.210
or what about the number of people who like,
just stuff that happens out of habit like,

00:38:55.210 --> 00:39:00.369
you get arrested, they go to jail, you spend
time in jail, you get in an accident, they

00:39:00.369 --> 00:39:02.819
go to the hospital or they get deployed to
Iraq.

00:39:02.819 --> 00:39:03.819
&gt;&gt;Albert: Yes.

00:39:03.819 --> 00:39:06.670
&gt;&gt;audience member #4: These kind of things.
Do you see these people and do they fall within

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:08.160
that 20 percent that you talked about?

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:12.269
&gt;&gt;Albert: It's a very good question and the
question is where is the seven percent coming

00:39:12.269 --> 00:39:17.579
from that we are failing to predict, that's
also part of it. And it's undeniable that

00:39:17.579 --> 00:39:21.220
we have major life changes and when you get
hired in Google, for example, you change fundamental

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:26.170
your behavior of what you did before, if you
were a student or something before. We marry,

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:30.910
we divorce, we move jobs, we move houses and
so on and that changes, essentially, our,

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:36.279
our mobility pattern. The question is what
percentage of your time at any moment is really

00:39:36.279 --> 00:39:40.849
reflecting that change? And the, the fact
is that after the change you enter in another

00:39:40.849 --> 00:39:45.460
habitual pattern that is very predictable.
So, for example, you mention someone in jail.

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:49.540
Hey. Somebody's in jail is very predictable.
It's gonna be in jail for a couple of years.

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:50.540
[laughter]

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:54.999
So, so, in that respect, I think part of the
unpredictability comes from the people who

00:39:54.999 --> 00:39:59.859
we see, this is the kind of on average end
and those who are on the lower end in predictability

00:39:59.859 --> 00:40:03.999
are people who may have actually had a change
of lifestyle during the period that we were

00:40:03.999 --> 00:40:09.969
looking at. They may have moved location and
so on. So, this is part of the picture, absolutely.

00:40:09.969 --> 00:40:15.719
But I think we tend to underappreciate the
time that we actually spend on habitual patterns

00:40:15.719 --> 00:40:19.859
and how little is actually the transition
time from one to another one. And once you

00:40:19.859 --> 00:40:23.489
have the transition, then you switch to another
one. So, I think that's where, that's why

00:40:23.489 --> 00:40:24.489
we don't get a hundred percent.

00:40:24.489 --> 00:40:25.489
&gt;&gt;audience member #4: Thanks.

00:40:25.489 --> 00:40:33.549
&gt;&gt;audience member #5: So, the fifth part of
your natural science or human diagram is control.

00:40:33.549 --> 00:40:38.440
So, what do you think the implications of
your work are for controlling people's behavior,

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:43.670
location, or other aspects that you think
you can measure and get enough data about?

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:47.789
&gt;&gt;Albert: I mean, that's a lovely question
and it's a very pertinent question and let

00:40:47.789 --> 00:40:52.829
me tell you again an example from the weather
patterns. So, everybody has heard of John

00:40:52.829 --> 00:40:56.710
van Neumann, essentially and he's a really
big developing the first computer, not only

00:40:56.710 --> 00:41:01.200
in architecture, but in building the first
computer. Few of you may know the fact of

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:05.869
why he actually got the money to do that--from
the military. Because he proposed that he

00:41:05.869 --> 00:41:12.390
will predict weather and he will control the
weather. And they had like this crazy images

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:15.299
of how they are gonna control. They gonna
spray chemicals around the weather and disperse

00:41:15.299 --> 00:41:21.869
clouds and so on and, of course, they never
got to that, but they got to the, it was thanks

00:41:21.869 --> 00:41:25.519
to John Neumann that first time the Meteorological
Agency of US has purchased a computer to start

00:41:25.519 --> 00:41:30.609
predicting weather and that's what, that's
why we have it. So, luckily they never got

00:41:30.609 --> 00:41:34.849
to control and I'm just hoping that this will
be the same case as well, here. And I think

00:41:34.849 --> 00:41:39.640
one of the goal I had with this book is let's
just talk openly about these issues. Because

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:44.319
I think we, as a society, have to come together
and decide how far we wanna push it. And I

00:41:44.319 --> 00:41:48.059
think Google is struggling this question very,
very much both internally, I'm sure externally,

00:41:48.059 --> 00:41:53.150
which we see very much of how, how we find
this balance essentially between the usefulness

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:58.849
for me and the, and the, at least the perception
of control about, about my, about what I do.

00:41:58.849 --> 00:42:02.509
And I think that the only way we can actually
arrive to, to where it's situational, to where

00:42:02.509 --> 00:42:10.049
we don't kill innovation, but we also maintain
privacy and, and kind of lower the fear level

00:42:10.049 --> 00:42:15.400
is by talking openly about that. So, to be
shorter, essentially, I think we're everybody's

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:19.359
very far away from thinking seriously about
control. But we have to realize that's the

00:42:19.359 --> 00:42:25.920
natural progress of understanding processes,
but, but control is a question of will. And

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:31.710
will can be controlled by loss, can be controlled
by consensus and we can control that control,

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:36.769
essentially, we can limit control only by
understanding what it could lead. And I think

00:42:36.769 --> 00:42:40.069
that's why I put it there, that let's just
get it open out there. Let's, let's think

00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:43.499
about it and let's come together and decide
where the limits of that one are.

00:42:43.499 --> 00:42:44.690
&gt;&gt;audience member #5: Thank you.

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:45.690
&gt;&gt;Albert: Sure.

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:50.109
&gt;&gt;audience member #6: You talked about having
like a huge amount of data and then from that,

00:42:50.109 --> 00:42:56.609
extrapolating with 93 percent accuracy a person's
location in the future and I was wondering

00:42:56.609 --> 00:43:01.319
if having all of that data, was the reason
you were able to do that? Or if you had data,

00:43:01.319 --> 00:43:07.380
just solely one user, would your set of prediction
algorithms work just as well, just for that

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:08.380
single person?

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:11.769
&gt;&gt;Albert: Well, I think it would have worked
just as well for one person except nobody

00:43:11.769 --> 00:43:14.469
would have really believed we could predict
and the referees would have never believed

00:43:14.469 --> 00:43:18.880
that I got something generic here. They just
have thought that I just got a very peculiar

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:23.839
user who's very boring, irregular. So, I think
from my perspective as a physicist, I always

00:43:23.839 --> 00:43:27.989
ask the question, "The result that I get,
how generic it is?" If I can only predict

00:43:27.989 --> 00:43:33.099
you, everybody will kind of jump at me and
say, "You are a very special case." And of

00:43:33.099 --> 00:43:36.880
course you are a very special case, but if
I want to show the generic results, I have

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.990
to do that for everybody in this room and
not only in this room, but I have to look

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:45.119
at non-Google employees as well and people
who go to school and people who live under

00:43:45.119 --> 00:43:49.609
the bridge and so on. And, and at the end
of the day, that was the reason why we have

00:43:49.609 --> 00:43:54.789
to have this different data is to really understand
how limited is the understanding we get from

00:43:54.789 --> 00:43:58.349
this data. How particular it is for one person?
And even in this case you may ask, "Is it

00:43:58.349 --> 00:44:02.029
really just referring to the country where
the data is from?" And I think that we believe

00:44:02.029 --> 00:44:06.519
that this is rather generic, it's not particular
to one country. You may ask other questions.

00:44:06.519 --> 00:44:09.874
What is the demographic spectrum of the people
we use? And of course, that's limited by the

00:44:09.874 --> 00:44:14.799
people who use cell phones as well, but in
this case actually, the country has 110 percent

00:44:14.799 --> 00:44:18.799
penetrational cell phones. That there are
ten percent more subscriptions than how many

00:44:18.799 --> 00:44:23.519
people are in the country; so therefore, we
think that we get a pretty good demographic.

00:44:23.519 --> 00:44:28.280
So, I think the main reason we look for lot,
many people is to convince ourselves and the

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:31.660
community that this is a generic result and
not particular to you or I.

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:33.130
&gt;&gt;audience member #6: Thanks.

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:34.130
&gt;&gt;Albert: Ok.

00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:38.719
&gt;&gt;audience member #7: In the location data
that you got from the cell phone companies,

00:44:38.719 --> 00:44:45.869
were you able to actually correlate like street
closures and other events that actually caused

00:44:45.869 --> 00:44:50.720
habitual travel to, to change? The reason
I bring this up is because there's enough

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:55.160
traffic analysis as a civil engineer where
we try to control how populations move by

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.859
building roads, destroying roads, things like
that.

00:44:56.859 --> 00:44:59.670
&gt;&gt;Albert: Sure. Now, let me, you're, you're
right on the money in the sense that one of

00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:04.170
the reasons I, I personally believe we need
to understand this, the type of travel patterns

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:09.999
is to be able to build better cities and that's
part of it, building better roads and so on.

00:45:09.999 --> 00:45:13.690
We have a project now that we're trying to
do that, but the data we get, essentially,

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:17.850
is inherently limiting in that respect because
we know only when the person makes a phone

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:22.859
call where they are only in the tower resolution.
Now, on the other hand, I believe that, that

00:45:22.859 --> 00:45:26.359
we could actually extract some of the anomalies
in the mobility that you're talking about.

00:45:26.359 --> 00:45:31.710
And we have a project now where we're trying
to do that by first building up a map of the

00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:35.359
regular mobility pattern of what is, what
is the predicted one and trying to see if

00:45:35.359 --> 00:45:40.299
there are any significant deviations from
that and we hope to look into the, into the

00:45:40.299 --> 00:45:44.030
media as well, to detect some of these events
that we know that took place and correlate

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:48.950
with that and see how detectable we are. The
results so far were not encouraging. I think

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:52.519
the data collection is very sparse. In order
to do that I think you need to get the type

00:45:52.519 --> 00:45:58.079
of data that, that resulted in the Paris visualization
that really recorded every time a user passed

00:45:58.079 --> 00:46:02.470
from one tower to another type of region where
either he or she made a phone call or not.

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:06.339
So, that's kind of the, the pass through data
and we don't have regulatory access to the

00:46:06.339 --> 00:46:10.790
data because normally what phone companies
do not collect that, but they could and they

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:19.099
did for, for that particular visualization
project. If we would have that, then I think

00:46:19.099 --> 00:46:20.490
the resolution would be possible.

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:21.819
&gt;&gt;audience member #6: Thanks.

00:46:21.819 --> 00:46:24.059
&gt;&gt;Albert: Thanks. So, it's a matter of data.

00:46:24.059 --> 00:46:25.059
[Albert laughs]

00:46:25.059 --> 00:46:27.109
&gt;&gt;audience member #7: I'm wondering if you've
ever read Isaac Asimov's Foundation series?

00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:28.480
&gt;&gt;Albert: Why do you think I work on this
project?

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:29.480
[laughter]

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:33.150
&gt;&gt;audience member #7: Yeah, I mean, ok. So,
did you take some inspiration from that. There's

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:35.009
this science called "psychohistory" and--

00:46:35.009 --> 00:46:36.569
&gt;&gt;Albert: Sure, in Harry Seldon, that's right.

00:46:36.569 --> 00:46:37.569
[laughter]

00:46:37.569 --> 00:46:42.269
Of course just to tell you, I don't think
we're any close to that and you remember why

00:46:42.269 --> 00:46:45.299
he was successful at predicting the future?
What, what was the price for that?

00:46:45.299 --> 00:46:51.810
&gt;&gt;audience member #7: I think he got to build
a encyclopedia, or funding for his encyclopedia.

00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:55.269
&gt;&gt;Albert: Sure, but that have noble, but it
was actually something that had to happen

00:46:55.269 --> 00:46:58.170
in order to be predictive. They had to stop
every innovation.

00:46:58.170 --> 00:46:59.479
&gt;&gt;audience member #7: All right.

00:46:59.479 --> 00:47:04.219
&gt;&gt;Albert: So, absolutely science was outlawed
and there could be no innovations. So, essentially,

00:47:04.219 --> 00:47:09.049
they had to maintain this stationary state
of the society where no new Google would ever

00:47:09.049 --> 00:47:14.420
come along. So, so in that respect, I, I really
think that that's where I say that there may

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:18.260
be a certain amounts of days, of months, of
years of limitation of how far you can go

00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:22.849
and that's one of the goal of this is to say
what type of events? How far into the future

00:47:22.849 --> 00:47:28.869
could we predict it? And, and the -- Asimov
was actually a smart person and he realized

00:47:28.869 --> 00:47:34.230
that if you allow for innovation, predictability
will pretty much go to zero on long time because

00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:39.440
how well could you have predicted twenty years
ago the impact of Google on the society? Hopeless.

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:43.630
Am I correct? I mean, look at the 1960s visions
of how the 2000 is gonna look like and you're

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:48.680
laughing about it. It's like a fairy tale,
isn't it? We are all flying in personal rockets

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:50.970
around the earth and we have no Internet or
concept that we don't have a personal computer

00:47:50.970 --> 00:47:57.720
concept of one? So, how different is our reality
from what we imagined back then? And that's

00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:01.760
thanks to innovation. And thanks to innovation,
taking a different path from what could be

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:06.690
predicted based on what people cared about
back then, which they cared about space travel,

00:48:06.690 --> 00:48:11.829
so, so therefore, they projected their future
based on space travel and not on what they

00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:18.289
could not have imagined, which is the Information
Revolution. So, so that's why I, I think that

00:48:18.289 --> 00:48:23.390
Harry Seldon will never become a reality,
only at the price where we stop essentially.

00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:28.160
So, maybe you could do that in North Korea.

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:29.160
[laughter]

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:32.730
So, perhaps this is a good moment for us to
end? Thanks for your attention. Thank you

00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:33.730
for attention.

00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:34.730
[laughter]

00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:34.731
[applause]
