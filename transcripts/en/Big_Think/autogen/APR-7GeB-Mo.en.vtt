astrophysicist and astronomers didn't
 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.150
astrophysicist and astronomers didn't
like the fact that he was popularizing

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160
like the fact that he was popularizing
 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.700
like the fact that he was popularizing
their field and and they thought that he

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710
their field and and they thought that he
 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.740
their field and and they thought that he
shouldn't do this that he was cheapening

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750
shouldn't do this that he was cheapening
 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.369

the field this attitude is expanded in
 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.530
the field this attitude is expanded in
many ways and biotechnology it seemed

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540
many ways and biotechnology it seemed
 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.590
many ways and biotechnology it seemed
much worse than what carl sagan had had

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600
much worse than what carl sagan had had
 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.770
much worse than what carl sagan had had
to do deal with and the reason is is

to do deal with and the reason is is
 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.029
to do deal with and the reason is is
that in graduate school we are told kind

because you don't want to give people
false hopes and unlike astronomy

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:16.679
false hopes and unlike astronomy

biomedical science is is geared very
 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.370
biomedical science is is geared very
often to curing diseases and so you you

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380
often to curing diseases and so you you
 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.770
often to curing diseases and so you you
have a breakthrough it's possible that

diabetes may never happen so don't think
 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.570
diabetes may never happen so don't think
that we're ever going to get there and

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580
that we're ever going to get there and
 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.350
that we're ever going to get there and
the idea that the idea and it's really a

subconscious ideas don't give false hope
 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.469
subconscious ideas don't give false hope
to people okay so that's one thing so

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479
to people okay so that's one thing so
 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.940

don't speculate don't give false hope
 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.930
don't speculate don't give false hope
the second thing is don't scare people

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940
the second thing is don't scare people
 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.190
the second thing is don't scare people
bio technology is a really powerful

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200
bio technology is a really powerful
 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.830
bio technology is a really powerful
technology and if you scare people with

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840
technology and if you scare people with
 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.830
technology and if you scare people with
the kinds of things that could do then

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840
the kinds of things that could do then
 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.110
the kinds of things that could do then
they're going to shut us down we are

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120
they're going to shut us down we are
 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.850
they're going to shut us down we are
doing great research and we're doing

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860
doing great research and we're doing
 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.140
doing great research and we're doing
things that are going to help humanity

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150
things that are going to help humanity
 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.550
things that are going to help humanity
and because of you speculating you're

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560
and because of you speculating you're
 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.450
and because of you speculating you're
scaring people

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460
scaring people
 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.920
scaring people
all and they'll reject the whole thing

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930
all and they'll reject the whole thing
 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.020
all and they'll reject the whole thing
you know you tell people about human

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030
you know you tell people about human
 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.900
you know you tell people about human
cloning you just bring it up and they

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910
cloning you just bring it up and they
 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.640
cloning you just bring it up and they
want to shut down our research on cells

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650
want to shut down our research on cells
 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.830
want to shut down our research on cells
and so don't don't talk about that so

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840
and so don't don't talk about that so
 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.350
and so don't don't talk about that so
those are very strong kinds of feelings

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360
those are very strong kinds of feelings
 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.740
those are very strong kinds of feelings
that other people have and I've gotten

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750
that other people have and I've gotten
 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.400
that other people have and I've gotten
emails from many people many scientists

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410
emails from many people many scientists
 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.950
emails from many people many scientists
over the years condemning me for doing

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960
over the years condemning me for doing
 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.440
over the years condemning me for doing
both of those things speculating about

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450
both of those things speculating about
 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.600
both of those things speculating about
the future and also talking about

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610
the future and also talking about
 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.660
the future and also talking about
biotechnology in a very broad sense it

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670
biotechnology in a very broad sense it
 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.910
biotechnology in a very broad sense it
could be used for this purpose or that

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920
could be used for this purpose or that
 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.650
could be used for this purpose or that
purpose the third thing is that in a

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660
purpose the third thing is that in a
 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.040
purpose the third thing is that in a
field like biology it's very difficult

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050
field like biology it's very difficult
 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.770
field like biology it's very difficult
to bring it to a aller understanding

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780
to bring it to a aller understanding
 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.010
to bring it to a aller understanding
without simplification and so you have

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020
without simplification and so you have
 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.230
without simplification and so you have
to simplify if you want people to

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240
to simplify if you want people to
 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.630
to simplify if you want people to
understand it and I think that it

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640
understand it and I think that it
 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.510
understand it and I think that it
requires a scientist who has a much

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520
requires a scientist who has a much
 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.490
requires a scientist who has a much
deeper knowledge to do the

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500
deeper knowledge to do the
 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.590
deeper knowledge to do the
simplification because you know what you

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600
simplification because you know what you
 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.210
simplification because you know what you
can simplify and what you can't and

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220
can simplify and what you can't and
 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.090
can simplify and what you can't and
that's what I try to do but it means

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100
that's what I try to do but it means
 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.370
that's what I try to do but it means
that I'm not a hundred percent accurate

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380
that I'm not a hundred percent accurate
 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.120
that I'm not a hundred percent accurate
if I say that every cell in my body has

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130
if I say that every cell in my body has
 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.940
if I say that every cell in my body has
the same DNA I'll get attacked for

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950
the same DNA I'll get attacked for
 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.770
the same DNA I'll get attacked for
saying no there ourselves in the immune

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780
saying no there ourselves in the immune
 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.300
saying no there ourselves in the immune
system where the DNA is a little bit

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310
system where the DNA is a little bit
 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.840
system where the DNA is a little bit
different and my response will be well

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850
different and my response will be well
 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.580
different and my response will be well
you know if we get into all the details

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590
you know if we get into all the details
 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.280
you know if we get into all the details
you lose the big picture so there are a

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290
you lose the big picture so there are a
 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.870
you lose the big picture so there are a
lot of scientists who say you're not

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880
lot of scientists who say you're not
 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.490
lot of scientists who say you're not
being accurate you're misleading people

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500
being accurate you're misleading people
 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.150
being accurate you're misleading people
with their very narrow and then the

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160
with their very narrow and then the
 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.800
with their very narrow and then the
final problem is that some people are

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810
final problem is that some people are
 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.640
final problem is that some people are
jealous you know this guy's on TV how

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650
jealous you know this guy's on TV how
 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.560
jealous you know this guy's on TV how
does he have the right to be on TV and

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570
does he have the right to be on TV and
 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.530
does he have the right to be on TV and
i'm not even talking just about my own

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540
i'm not even talking just about my own
 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.270
i'm not even talking just about my own
work i'm talking about other people's

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280
work i'm talking about other people's
 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.170
work i'm talking about other people's
work how how dare i do that the other

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180
work how how dare i do that the other
 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.550
work how how dare i do that the other
people should be presenting their work

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560
people should be presenting their work
 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.980
people should be presenting their work
but the other people can't different

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990
but the other people can't different
 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.500

people have an ability or not to be able

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510
people have an ability or not to be able
 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.870
people have an ability or not to be able
to present things at Al a level so i

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880
to present things at Al a level so i
 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.540
to present things at Al a level so i
think that sort of summarizes what's

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550
think that sort of summarizes what's
