00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140
[Captions by Y Translator]
We've done some fun stuff
with dry ice in the past.

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.520
Today, we're going to kind
of push that to a limit,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.500
and see what happens
if we drop a lot of dry ice

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.320
into some very hot water.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:14.500
[Music]

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.056
We got a common request
from YouTube user Sagar Parajuli

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.500
asking us to boil
dry ice plzzzz.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.060
Plzz.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.640
To start out, we want to take
a look at the difference

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.350
between putting dry ice
in room temperature water

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.920
and boiling hot water.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.320
See if we get
a different result.

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:33.491
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:35.155
We'll take dry ice and water,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.100
and see what gives
us the best reaction,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.320
and then scale that up.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.780
Let's put in there
for 30 minutes.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.500
Just like 30.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.040
Just until it boils over,
and then we take it out.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.220
30.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.640
Has your microwave had a bowl
of water explode inside it?

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.197
Calli is going to show you
how to fix that,

00:00:52.197 --> 00:00:53.247
because I don't know.

00:00:53.247 --> 00:00:54.947
Apparently, she's
microwave expert.

00:00:54.947 --> 00:00:57.320
So the first thing you want
to do is go to the store

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.780
that sell microwaves.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.340
Pick one up...

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.600
And then you're done.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.400
Yeah, that's it.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.150
That's how you fix
your microwave guys.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.842
We're really good at this.

00:01:05.842 --> 00:01:12.080
[Music]

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.000
Trying to just get two pieces
that are kind of the same.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.500
That's pretty close.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.683
All right, you take one.

00:01:17.683 --> 00:01:18.902
&gt;&gt; Got it.
&gt;&gt; I'll take one.

00:01:18.902 --> 00:01:20.594
So this one is
super boiling hot,

00:01:20.594 --> 00:01:22.232
and this one is just tap water.

00:01:22.232 --> 00:01:22.873
Hot...

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.440
Not hot..

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.520
Room temperature.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.100
That's the word.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.960
All right, so we're going to drop
these in the count of three,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.940
and see if there's a difference.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.340
1, 2, 3.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.732
Gee, I wonder what
the difference is.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.000
There's this, there's a bit
of a difference here.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.017
So though dry ice
and room temperature water,

00:01:38.017 --> 00:01:40.542
it definitely still produces
vapor as you can see.

00:01:40.542 --> 00:01:42.494
So, the hot water
is making the dry ice

00:01:42.494 --> 00:01:44.514
is actually sublimate
faster in this one.

00:01:44.514 --> 00:01:47.152
But you're still getting
bubbles in room temperature.

00:01:47.152 --> 00:01:49.030
You're actually
getting more bubbles.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.420
So those were about
the same size,

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.100
and now from a hot water,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.320
we just have this tiny little chip
floating around the surfaces,

00:01:54.323 --> 00:01:56.550
which I'm trying to grab
but it's running away from me.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:57.700
Come here you.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.900
So the cold water
definitely last longer.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.000
That's our dry ice left there.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.820
And that's how dry ice left
from the colder water.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.300
So we are going

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.140
through our dry ice much faster
with the hot water,

00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:11.720
and that entertaining [inaudible]

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.550
Just vibrating on the counter.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.902
So boiling hot water

00:02:14.902 --> 00:02:17.000
definitely gets you
a lot more of a reaction.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.600
That's good.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.180
There's one other thing
I want to test though,

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.115
and that is the surface area

00:02:21.115 --> 00:02:23.322
of the dry ice going
into hot water.

00:02:23.322 --> 00:02:26.345
Will the same quantity of dry
ice give us a bigger reaction

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:28.043
if we crush it up into powder,

00:02:28.043 --> 00:02:30.009
or is it better
as a single block?

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.892
Let's find out.

00:02:30.892 --> 00:02:34.050
Okay, these two chunks of dry
ice are about the same size.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.676
Now, I'm going to chop
one of them up,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.720
and just break it up
until it's a really fine powder,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.600
and the other one going
to leave as a chunk.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.080
[Music]

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.800
Nope.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.732
It was so angry about that.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:49.760
No, don't do that.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.640
3, 2, 1.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.780
[Music]

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.080
That is just cool.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.040
So right at the
very very beginning,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.360
this had just a huge plume,
and so quickly, it dissipated.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.220
And now, we've just got

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.550
like this little low
bubbling come out of it.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.740
Yeah, but look at the way

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.433
it expands across the counter.
&gt;&gt; It's already almost gone too.

00:03:12.433 --> 00:03:13.650
I don't know I kind of--

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.885
Like I did, I did like
the sudden explosive bit,

00:03:16.885 --> 00:03:17.850
but I'm liking

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.750
how that just keeps pouring
stuff out more and more.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.554
So maybe what we
need to do is both.

00:03:22.554 --> 00:03:23.999
Just have like a large chunk,

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:25.650
and then also
some powder for just

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.180
some extra explosiveness right
at the very beginning.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.350
But I think we also need
to start scaling this up,

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.102
and you may notice there's
a few sizes of pots here.

00:03:34.442 --> 00:03:35.400
Which one are we going with?

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.600
I think we need to do...

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.300
Let's do them in order.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.100
Let's do...

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.065
Small, medium, large.

00:03:41.065 --> 00:04:06.760
[Music]

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.340
That's a terrible noise.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.980
Okay, we've got our small pot.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.480
That's reached a rolling boil,

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.240
and here we've got a good-sized
chunk of dry ice as well,

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.359
as some smaller chunks,

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.679
and even some powdered bits
down at the bottom.

00:04:17.679 --> 00:04:20.050
We're just going to pour all
of that in at once,

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.762
and see what kind
of explosive reaction we get.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.420
Whenever you're ready.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.920
[Music]

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.300
It actually threw out
a little bit of water with it.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.860
Oh, good.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:34.940
Boiling water everywhere.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:35.255
Yeah.

00:04:35.255 --> 00:04:36.490
That's actually warm.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.644
That's really cool.

00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:38.190
Oh, yeah.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.800
The vapors coming
off of this is quite warm.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.140
It's really hard to put
dry as vapor in your mouth,

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.806
because for one thing it's...

00:04:46.806 --> 00:04:47.747
Like it's fizzy.

00:04:47.747 --> 00:04:49.900
Like it makes your mouth fizzy.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.000
But your body doesn't want
to breathe it in.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
So it's going to try
and make you cough.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.800
Like that.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.840
Yeah, it gets into your throat
at all, it's just...

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.150
Your body's just like,
no, don't breathe this in.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.400
You die from this.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.260
This is the opposite
of everything we wanted.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.280
[Music]

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.080
There we go.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.440
We're going to want to stand
back a little farther

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.640
for the bigger...

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.520
For the bigger pot.

00:05:13.524 --> 00:05:14.328
Yeah, we are.

00:05:14.328 --> 00:05:17.800
That started throwing drops
of water kind of right away.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.560
I want to know

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.880
if the water is cool
enough to touch.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.040
Nope.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.660
It's very...

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.000
It's very warm water.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.558
&gt;&gt; It's like hot tub.
&gt;&gt; It has definitely cool down a lot.

00:05:27.558 --> 00:05:29.462
Should we chop up a bunch more?

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.520
Yes.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.780
That was really cool to watch.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.140
The little mini explosion
and how much vapor we got,

00:05:36.142 --> 00:05:38.478
but we weren't technically
boiling the dry ice.

00:05:38.478 --> 00:05:38.944
Not yet.

00:05:38.944 --> 00:05:41.060
We put the dry ice
into boiled water.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.520
Let's try actually boiling it.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.760
Let's see what it does.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.240
All right, we got
more water boiling on the stove.

00:05:46.248 --> 00:05:48.450
We'll see if it's any different
if we actually leave it

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:49.532
in the boiling water.

00:05:51.376 --> 00:05:53.198
Oh good.
It does that.

00:05:53.892 --> 00:05:56.350
So that's pretty much the same
reaction we're getting before.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:57.082
So yeah, it's just

00:05:57.082 --> 00:05:59.032
more consistent with
what we had before.

00:05:59.032 --> 00:05:59.550
I think it...

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.514
Yeah, it's probably
slowing down,

00:06:01.514 --> 00:06:04.345
or it's probably staying hot
a little bit longer,

00:06:04.345 --> 00:06:06.022
not cooling down quite as fast.

00:06:06.022 --> 00:06:08.820
Although, you can see we already
have a different reaction.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.506
We're no longer getting
that pillar rising

00:06:10.506 --> 00:06:11.316
up to the ceiling.

00:06:11.316 --> 00:06:12.471
So I think that means

00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:14.450
that the dry ice
is winning the fight

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.072
between hot and cold here.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.332
So the water itself probably
isn't even boiling anymore.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.480
That's a good way to test it.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.280
It's not.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.127
Yeah, when I blow all the vapor
out of the way, I can see

00:06:26.127 --> 00:06:29.022
that there is bubbling right
off of the chunk of dry ice,

00:06:29.022 --> 00:06:31.722
but it's not boiling
the water anymore.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.392
Even though we have this stove
turned as high as it goes.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.740
So here it is,

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.840
the piece of dry ice
that has been boiling.

00:06:38.382 --> 00:06:39.350
And I would say

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.664
that it looks pretty much just
like what it looked like

00:06:41.664 --> 00:06:42.436
before it went in,

00:06:42.436 --> 00:06:44.022
except now, it's
a little bit smaller.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.900
Not really any more brittle.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:54.160
[Music]

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.820
So, boiling dry ice,

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.140
I mean you get
a cool explosive effect

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.150
when it lands
in the boiling water.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.392
But as soon as it cools down,
you're back to normal dry ice.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.500
So I think with our
scaled up experiments,

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.220
we will not leave things
on the stove just

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.900
because it's splashed water out

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.420
with both of the tests
we've done so far,

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.380
and I think we want to avoid
splashing too much water

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.960
on the appliance and stuff.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.180
So we're going to take
our boiling water,

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.999
and same as we did
with our first experiment,

00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:22.750
we're gonna take
them off the stove,

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.150
put them on the hot pad,

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:25.920
and then put the dry
ice in over here.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.520
[Music]

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.320
3, 2, 1.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.460
[Music]

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.300
Oh, that is everywhere.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.460
[Music]

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.600
Holy cow.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.940
Cal, can you see me?

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:45.560
No.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.720
Where are you?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.520
Try and blow smoke ring in this.

00:07:49.912 --> 00:07:50.712
I did.

00:07:50.712 --> 00:07:51.600
Did you see it?

00:07:51.613 --> 00:07:52.892
Yes.
Good job.

00:07:52.892 --> 00:07:56.240
[Music]

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.120
It's so warm and fizzy.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.740
We got the same explosion

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.340
that we had before
with the big chunks,

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.860
but now, we're just
at that rolling sort of...

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.560
Filling, filling the
room with vapor.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.700
Kind of like the small chunks did.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.051
And we should make sure
that we have a door open,

00:08:11.051 --> 00:08:13.550
because we are filling the room
with carbon dioxide.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.163
We don't want hypoxia.

00:08:15.163 --> 00:08:17.802
Is that what
this lightheadedness is?

00:08:17.802 --> 00:08:18.662
Ah weird.

00:08:18.662 --> 00:08:22.660
[Music]

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.550
So I'm thinking
that for our our Mongo pot here,

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:28.800
we should probably
take it outside.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.200
Yeah, and not stand near it.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.740
It's going to be
a lot funnier inside though.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.222
It's true.

00:08:35.222 --> 00:08:40.280
[Music]

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.780
That's a big old pot
of boiling water.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.100
This is definitely safe.

00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:43.942
Yeah.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.340
All right, you take one handle.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.000
I got it.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.060
Ready?

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.420
3, 2, 1.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:58.200
[Music]

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.320
I can't see anything yet.

00:08:59.412 --> 00:09:01.612
Whoa, that is a weird
sound dampening effect.

00:09:01.612 --> 00:09:02.918
Like all the echo is gone.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.560
I had no idea I was going
to take a shower this morning.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.940
I can't see anything.

00:09:06.941 --> 00:09:07.882
It's just white.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.860
Mark, can you see us?

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.240
I'm going back in.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:18.900
I'm soaked.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.340
Yeah, that did splash
some boiling water.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.240
That was...

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.340
Wow.

00:09:24.732 --> 00:09:25.980
The ceiling.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.032
Oh no.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.599
That was definitely a good idea.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.280
There's Mark.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.660
Hey Mark, welcome back.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.400
Only Mark went anywhere.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.540
3, 2, 1.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:10:01.940
[Music]

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.860
Thank you for
this wonderful idea.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.140
[Music]

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.600
There definitely is
a temperature change.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.192
That's insane.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.020
[Music]

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.320
Oh my gosh.
Did it--

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.098
It actually launched
bit some dry ice too.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.060
No, its-- Have you
seen the floor?

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.880
I hadn't been able
to see the floor.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.120
We're soaking wet.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.580
Let's get some towels.

00:10:27.702 --> 00:10:30.132
So thanks Sagar
for your suggestion.

00:10:30.192 --> 00:10:32.644

we are sending you $25

00:10:32.644 --> 00:10:33.980

Remember, if you've got any cool
ideas you want to see us try,
