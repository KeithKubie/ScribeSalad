00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:17.419
Have you heard the one about Thomas Jefferson

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:19.802
and the Louisiana Territory?

00:00:19.802 --> 00:00:22.857
Thomas Jefferson, author of The Declaration of Independence,

00:00:22.857 --> 00:00:27.672
was not a fan of the new constitution presented in 1787.

00:00:27.672 --> 00:00:29.371
He was very worried

00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:32.154
that The Constitution gave too much power

00:00:32.154 --> 00:00:33.999
to the new, national government,

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:36.053
and not enough power to the states,

00:00:36.053 --> 00:00:39.200
an issue known as "big government".

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.380
Jefferson only reluctantly agreed to support it

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.619
when his friend, James Madison,

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:47.755
promised to propose a bill of rights after it was ratified.

00:00:47.755 --> 00:00:51.886
But Jefferson's fears about big government did not go away.

00:00:51.886 --> 00:00:55.091
For example, Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton,

00:00:55.091 --> 00:00:57.761
proposed a national bank in 1790,

00:00:57.761 --> 00:01:01.593
and Jefferson knew there was no provision in The Constitution

00:01:01.593 --> 00:01:03.725
to permit such a thing.

00:01:03.725 --> 00:01:08.393
Hamilton claimed some sort of implied powers mumbo-jumbo.

00:01:08.393 --> 00:01:10.955
Sure, it wasn't written in The Constitution,

00:01:10.955 --> 00:01:14.783
but The Constitution implied that it could be done.

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:16.376
But, Jefferson wasn't buying it.

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:18.659
Nonetheless, the bank was established

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.462
by Hamilton and President Washington.

00:01:21.462 --> 00:01:24.261
When Jefferson was sworn in as President in 1801,

00:01:24.261 --> 00:01:27.302
he pledged to reduce the size and scope

00:01:27.302 --> 00:01:29.295
of the national government.

00:01:29.295 --> 00:01:33.451
But, of course, things didn't go exactly as he had planned.

00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:37.518
Spain secretly transferred the Louisiana Territory to France

00:01:37.518 --> 00:01:40.041
right beneath Jefferson's nose.

00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:41.791
When Congress found out,

00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:43.858
they quickly began discussions with France

00:01:43.858 --> 00:01:46.336
to buy a piece of the territory

00:01:46.336 --> 00:01:50.271
along the Mississippi River for about $2 million.

00:01:50.271 --> 00:01:53.110
But, there was one little problem:

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.970
Jefferson knew there was no provision

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.190
in The Constitution to buy foreign territory.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.559
So what was a strict constructionist to do?

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:05.432
First, he tried to get an amendment to The Constitution passed

00:02:05.432 --> 00:02:07.695
that would expressly permit the purchase,

00:02:07.695 --> 00:02:09.904
but Congress wasn't willing to do it.

00:02:09.904 --> 00:02:14.322
Then, without permission, the U.S. negotiators in France

00:02:14.322 --> 00:02:16.779
cut a deal for all of the territory

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:19.827
for a cool $15 million dollars.

00:02:19.827 --> 00:02:23.297
That new land doubled the size of the nation!

00:02:23.297 --> 00:02:25.793
Now Jefferson was really stuck.

00:02:25.793 --> 00:02:29.484
He knew that the territory would be a great acquisition for the country,

00:02:29.484 --> 00:02:32.674
providing lots of new land for farmers and other settlers,

00:02:32.674 --> 00:02:36.260
but how could he constitutionally justify it?

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.907
In the end, Jefferson turned to the argument

00:02:38.907 --> 00:02:41.814
used by his old foe Alexander Hamilton.

00:02:41.814 --> 00:02:44.723
He claimed that the power to purchase the territory

00:02:44.723 --> 00:02:48.190
is implied in The Constitution's treaty-making power.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.441
This was the exact argument

00:02:50.441 --> 00:02:53.906
that he had mocked openly a decade before,

00:02:53.906 --> 00:02:57.784
so it must have crushed his pride to have to use it.

00:02:57.784 --> 00:02:58.866
But more importantly,

00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:04.241
he may have committed the biggest big government play ever!

00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:05.833
How ironic is it

00:03:05.833 --> 00:03:09.071
that one of the biggest opponents of big government

00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:11.275
doubled the size of the young country

00:03:11.275 --> 00:03:16.353
and did so while openly questioning its constitutionality?

00:03:16.353 --> 00:03:18.059
At $15 million,

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:19.733
which is about three cents an acre,

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:21.588
it has been called by many

00:03:21.588 --> 00:03:23.320
the greatest real estate deal

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.371
in the history of the United States.
