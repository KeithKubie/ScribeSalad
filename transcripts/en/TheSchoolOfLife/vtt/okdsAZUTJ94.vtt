00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.880
A good life is the fruit of a succession of
good decisions, especially around love and

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.830
work. However, we seldom accord the business
of decision-making the kind of careful attention

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.930
it requires. When faced with a large decision,
we lack rituals and procedures. We typically

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.770
procrastinate, lean on the nearest person
or rush headlong into an unexamined solution.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.340
Fortunately, decision-making is a skill and
– like any other – it can be taught. The

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.710
chief enemy of good decisions is a lack of
sufficient perspectives on a problem. We should

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:42.839
systematically think through any issue from
five distinct angles: through the eyes of – variously

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:50.100
– our Enemy, our Gut, Death, Caution and Courage. As we try out, juggle with

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.869
and then synthesise these oblique perspectives,
we will feel our sense of possibility expand

00:00:54.869 --> 00:01:02.299
– and a tolerable way forward gradually
emerge from the present confusion. Enemy Our

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:08.040
enemies have deep insights into us: they know
our frailties, they actively want the worst

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.691
for us and they’re bringing a desperate,
mean intelligence to bear on our case. Thinking

00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:19.000
of them helps beautifully to clarify our thoughts.
It can be unfeasibly hard to be a true friend

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.130
to ourselves, in the way we should be; our
minds may well go blank if asked to imagine

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.070
what a sweet and well-meaning person might
advise us to do next. We’re so much better

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.610
at getting into the heads of our bitterest
foes. They appreciate our weaknesses and temptations

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.740
like no other. We can at last put these characters
to constructive use: by doing the very opposite

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.140
of what we suspect (probably very correctly)
they might propose and say. We will be energised

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.920
and focused by the haunting voices of those
dispiriting but very telling and mesmerising

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.700
judges: those who refuse to believe in us.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.950
In a sense, we know the answer already
– or at least one version of it. We call

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.340
it gut-instinct and it is there from the moment
a dilemma first appears. The Gut is the accumulation

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.200
of all the decision-making lessons we’ve
ever derived across our lives, revealed unconsciously

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.080
at speed. Most of us have become rather good
at not listening to the Gut. Probably it got

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.200
us into trouble a number of times, maybe pushing
us into some crazy moments for which we paid

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.200
dear. Now we pride ourselves on being thinking
people, who take their time, gather evidence

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.569
and make full use of their higher mental powers,
as well we should. Nevertheless, we thereby

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.510
lose a source of important insight. We should
be brave enough to invite our Gut to the decision-making

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.490
table, not necessarily in order to follow
it but in order to know what it wants, and

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:56.110
then submit its stubborn and impatient certainties
to gentle rational cross-examination. Death

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:04.250
The largest, but always easily-forgotten certainty,
is that all our decisions are unfolding in

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.560
the backdrop of a giant ticking death clock.
We should listen to its beat and take its

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.090
daunting messages to heart. The thought of
Death has a habit of highlighting our responsibilities

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.040
to ourselves and of weakening our concern
for living according to what is expected of

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.459
us by society. It is a terrifying agent of
authenticity. Death may lend us a perverse

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.980
new sort of confidence to tackle challenges.
By frightening us about one enormous thing,

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.600
it may make us less scared of the many smaller
obstacles in our way. Our lives won’t be

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.540
what they could be unless we submit pretty
much every choice we face to the arbiter of

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.750
eternity and oblivion.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.420
Somewhere around the table at every

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.411
decision must be the voice of caution. It
wears dowdy clothes and speaks quietly. It

00:03:55.411 --> 00:04:01.060
certainly lacks glamour in an age of bravado
and bombast. It’s easy to feel that we must

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.820
always and invariably jump – because life
has to be about giving the new a go. It may

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.170
not be. Let’s remember, Caution clears its
throat to tell us, that most new businesses

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:18.320
fail, most schemes end in disaster and most
relationships merely rehash the themes of

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.540
the current unsatisfactory one. Furthermore,
there is a huge amount to be lost and there

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.820
are many people around us who may get very
hurt by our ambitions. The devil one knows

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.210
may just have the edge over the many demons
one doesn’t quite. Caution does not look

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.970
down on the idea of compromise, it recognises
that there are, at points, simply no ideal

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:47.020
options for the imperfect beings we ultimately
are. Caution has the bravery not always to

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:56.680
rebel against reality. From an early
age, we’ve learnt how to follow the rules,

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.100
wait in line and do the dutiful, expected
things. We can be good boys and girls; it

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.520
got us to where we are today. There would
have been no other way to learn how to spell,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.940
drive a car or take up a position in the working
world. But there can now be a subtle risk

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.660
from an opposite direction; the risk of being
overly faithful for too long to conventions

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.840
that were dreamt up without our particular
interests and hopes in mind. At points, we

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.960
need vigorously to relearn the art of Courage,
to remember that the happiest lives have invariably

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.080
had inflection points where people did the
slightly unexpected and weird thing, took

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:40.449
a gamble and won. Sometimes, Caution is just
weakness and cowardice wrapped up in the cloak

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:48.160
of self-deception. Courage and Caution need
to fight this one out, without any presumption of victory on either side.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.280
Any hard descision we have to make will always by deffinition not be perfect.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:59.680
But with such tinking behind us we have a slightly better chance than usual of opting for the good enough choice.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.440
Our videos are just the start of our content.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.280
We believe in making the world a more emotionally intelligent place

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.400
and to that end we have now also published some extraordinary books,

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.240
as well as other merchandise that re-enforces some of the themes illustraited in our videos.
