00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.029
The Surprisingly Short History of the Pony
Express

00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:07.330
Given that most have still heard of the Pony
Express today, unlike so many other messaging

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.840
companies long gone, you may think that the
Pony Express was once an integral part of

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.840
communication between the East and West in
the United States.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.269
It turns out, this was never the case and
the Pony Express was around only for an extremely

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:21.970
short amount of time.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.960
It all started on April 3, 1860, when two
riders, one in Sacramento, California, the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.900
other in St. Joseph, Missouri, simultaneously
embarked on a mirror-like mission – carry

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.480
mail across the difficult and dangerous terrain
of the American West in the shortest amount

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.910
of time possible.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.960
With each load (including the riders) weighing
no more than 165 pounds, the two men reached

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.850
the others’ starting point in record time:
the westbound rider made it to Sacramento

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.490
in just under 10 days, while the eastbound
man reached St. Joseph in 11.5.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.240
Together, these journeys marked the beginning
of the Pony Express.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.400
The brainchild of visionary businessman William
Russell, the Leavenworth &amp; Pike’s Peak Express

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.869
Company (later to be known as the Pony Express)
was born of two desires: (1) people’s need

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.979
to communicate and (2) a businessman’s need
for profit.

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.890
By the 1850s, hundreds of thousands of Americans
had migrated to live west of the Rocky Mountains.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.280
Remember that by this time, California had
seen its great Gold Rush, the Mormons had

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.040
fled religious persecution and were settling
in Utah in large numbers, and thousands of

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.920
pioneers had made the arduous trek of the
Oregon Trail over the high mountains to homestead

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.380
in the West.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.359
Before the Pony Express, it could take up
to 8 weeks for a letter from the eastern U.S.

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.780
to reach these westerners since most mail
was shipped by boat.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.090
The few letters that went overland only cut
that time by half, and then only by taking

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.289
a southern route for mail service – out
of Fort Smith, Arkansas, with stops in El

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:52.530
Paso, Texas, and Yuma, Arizona, before arriving
in San Francisco, California, three to four

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.700
weeks later.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.530
As you can imagine, anyone who had a need
for transcontinental communication was soon

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.209
frustrated by the extraordinarily long delivery
time, and just as long for a reply.

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:07.600
Coinciding with the national desire for speedier
mail service was Russell’s need for a new

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.929
source of income.

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.239
Together with his partners, William Bradford
and Alexander Majors, Russell ran a stage

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.260
coach and freight business out of Leavenworth,
Kansas that by the late 1850s was floundering.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.580
While on a trip to Washington, he pitched
an idea to California’s Senator William

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.340
Gwin – to quickly deliver mail via an overland
central route that followed the Oregon and

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.120
California trails.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.069
The key to his speedy delivery was to be a
system of hundreds of way stations where fresh

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:39.260
horses and riders would be continuously substituted
all along the 1,800 mile trail.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.819
The route itself began in St. Joseph, Missouri,
followed the Platte and Sweetwater rivers,

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.549
then crossed the Rockies via the South Pass
to Salt Lake City, Utah.

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.620
From there, the riders crossed the deserts
of Utah and Nevada, then went over the Sierra

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.000
Nevada Mountains and finally landed in California
– all in about 10 days.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.190
Hundreds of men were hired to manage the way
stations where fresh horses (between 400 and

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.469
500 total) and riders (about 80) would be
waiting to relieve a tired courier.

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:11.159
The riders themselves had to be small, under
120 pounds, and the mail bags were limited

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.300
to 20 pounds, all to keep the weight the horses
had to bear to a minimum (which, with equipment

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.530
and mail, was capped at 165 pounds).

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.640
The couriers, who were paid $25 per week (about
$640 today), were given a distinctive uniform

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.500
of red shirt and blue pants, and at first,
they blew a brass horn to signal their impending

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.400
arrival at a way station.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.830
This last was soon discarded, however, when
it became clear that the approaching hoof

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.930
beats provided sufficient notice.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.799
For maximum efficiency, a station was placed
every 10-15 miles for the riders to switch

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:47.720
horses, and then after every 75-100 miles,
the couriers themselves would be replaced.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.390
The enterprise was intended to make a profit,
and Russell and his partners had hoped Uncle

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.840
Sam would ultimately subsidize the venture.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.710
It didn’t, and even though the Express initially
charged $5 per half-ounce of mail (today’s

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.590
U.S. Post Office charges $0.49 for up to 13
ounces for first class delivery), the Pony

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.969
Express operated at a significant loss.

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:11.310
Its end came quickly – just 19 months after
it started, when it was replaced with better

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.310
technology.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.500
Beginning in June 1860 (only two months after
the first Pony Express ride), telegraph lines

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.860
to connect the East and West Coasts were begun
by the Pacific Telegraph Company coming out

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.220
of Nebraska and the Overland Telegraph Company
from California.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.720
On October 24, 1861, the transcontinental
telegraph was up and running and two days

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.120
later, the Pony Express officially ended.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.240
A great idea, but bad timing.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.840
Bonus Facts:
• Though not called spam back then, telegraphic

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.310
spam messages were extremely common in the
19th century in the United States particularly.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.840
Western Union allowed telegraphic messages
on its network to be sent to multiple destinations.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.440
Thus, wealthy American residents tended to
get numerous spam messages through telegrams

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.670
presenting unsolicited investment offers and
the like.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.780
This wasn’t nearly as much of a problem
in Europe due to the fact that telegraphy

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.669
was regulated by post offices in Europe.

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.680
• Buffalo Bill Cody (1846-1917) was a Pony
Express rider.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.449
Outside of riding for the Pony Express, he
is estimated to have killed around 20,000

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.259
bison (often called “Buffalo,” even though
they are not) in his lifetime.

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:23.220
For reference, one single hide in good condition
would bring in about $3.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.060
Made into a winter coat, it could bring in
as much as $50.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.360
Ironically, Buffalo Bill was one of the most
outspoken supporters of plans to protect the

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.290
bison populations through legislation.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.510
In the end, President Grant vetoed the bill
that would have protected the herds, due to

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.640
the frequent small wars the U.S. had to fight
with the Plains Indians.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.380
By getting rid of the bison herds, it took
away the Plains Indians primary food and clothing

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.530
source.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.260
• A common myth surrounding American Bison
is that there were massive herds before the

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.740
Europeans came to America, on the scale that
Americans eventually encountered them at.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.050
In fact, evidence suggests that the Native
Americans naturally kept the bison populations

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.440
regulated by various means.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.530
After the European diseases wiped out most
of the Native Americans, the American Bison

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.220
population exploded, becoming the most numerous
large wild mammal on Earth until eventually

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.419
hunted to near extinction within a few centuries
after this population explosion.

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:20.630
At their peak, it was estimated that there
were nearly 100 million American Bison in

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.219
existence, only a few centuries ago.

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:28.520
• The fastest delivery every made by the
Pony Express was President Lincoln’s inauguration

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.630
address that was delivered in less than 8
days.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:50.250
• The first telegram sent, on May 26, 1844,
was from Samuel Morse (who invented the code)

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.189
and read, “What Hath God Wrought?”
