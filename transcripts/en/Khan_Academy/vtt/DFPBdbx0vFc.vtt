00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.530
Let's talk a little bit more
about reserve ratio

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.950
requirements and then if I have
time, I want to introduce

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.830
another, almost related and
often confused, topic, and

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:10.956
that is leverage.

00:00:10.956 --> 00:00:21.950
So let's do reserve ratio
requirement and let's say in

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.460
whatever jurisdiction or world
that I live in, that

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.750
requirement is 10%.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.810
So that means that for every
dollar of checking account

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.170
liabilities or notes libraries
that I have outstanding, that

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.760
I have to keep at least 10% of
that in actual whatever the

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.850
reserve currency is.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.390
In our world we've been dealing
so far it's been gold.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.360
In the current world,
it's not gold.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.760
It's actually dollar bills.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.310
But anyway, we'll stay in the
gold world and later on we'll

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.010
get ourselves off the
gold standard and

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.200
see how that works.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.070
But let's just do the example
from scratch again and just

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.670
see how big I can get my balance
sheet and see exactly

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.400
how this stops me from
getting too big.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.350
So I have my bank like
I always did.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.530
Let's say my building is worth
100 gold pieces and then I

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.140
capitalize it with another
200 gold pieces.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.120
This is the building.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.040
And this is my equity that
I start off with.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.470
So I start off with
300 equity.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.355
I should always do the equity
in a different color because

00:01:31.355 --> 00:01:33.900
sometimes it gets confused with
the liabilities because

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.720
they're both on the
right-hand side.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.820
So this is my equity.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.810
And then I might take
some deposits.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.110
Let's just-- I don't want to
make this too large of a

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.840
diagram, so let's just say I
take another 100 gold pieces

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.090
in deposits.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.900
And then I have checking
accounts for these people who

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.000
deposited them.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.250
I'll do that in purple.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.820
These are checking accounts
or notes deposit

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.330
accounts for people.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.620
These are my liabilities.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.300
So my question is, if these are
all the deposits I have,

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.230
or this is all of the
reserves I have, how

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.160
much can I lend out.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.530
Or, how much can I expand
my balance sheet?

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.810
Well, the reserve ratio
requirement says that my

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.940
reserves over my total checking
accounts that I have

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.820
on my liabilities and the notes
that I issue, that my

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.110
reserves can be no more--
or have to be at

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.760
least 10% of that.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.300
So right now I only
have 100-- whoops.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.130
I pressed the wrong button.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.560
Right now I only have 100
gold pieces of on

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.670
demand checking accounts.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.970
And I'm not going to worry
too much about the notes

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:50.700
outstanding right now.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.840
They're really the same thing,
at least from a balance sheet

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.180
point of view.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.083
And I have 300 gold pieces.

00:02:56.083 --> 00:02:58.930
So I actually have more reserves
than I have on demand

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.170
accounts because I've actually
pre-capitalized it with some

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.940
of my initial equity.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.070
So how much lending can I do?

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.870
Well, this requirement says that
I can only expand these

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.190
on demand accounts so that this
is at least 10% of it,

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.160
this 300 gold pieces is at
least 10% of it, right?

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.990
These are my actual reserves.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.510
So let's think of it this way.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.430
10% has to equal my reserves.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.610
I have 300 gold pieces
of reserves.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.860
100 from actual deposits, 200
that I actually put in ahead

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.110
of time to start up my bank.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.520
That was my own gold-- over
the total amount of-- I'll

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.920
just say demand deposits.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.610
I won't worry-- it's demand
deposits plus bank notes, but

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.000
we'll keep it simple
right now.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.250
I think you get the idea.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.340
So we can do a little
bit of math.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.670
Let's see.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.820
Multiply so we get 10% of the
demand deposits have to equal

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.310
300-- or divide both sides by
0.1 and then you say, well, I

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.680
could have up to 3,000 gold
pieces of demand deposits.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.050
So how much could I expand
my balance sheet?

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.910
Well, I could keep making loans
until I have 3,000 gold

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.310
pieces of demand deposits.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.990
Let me start making loans out.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.870
So someone has a project where,
say, 900 gold pieces.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.630
They need to build a factory
of some kind.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.650
I say, sure, here you go.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.030
900 gold pieces-- I'll draw it a
little bit less high than it

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.440
should be if it would be
proportional to that.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.040
So 900 loan.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.630
And I don't hand that
person gold.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.190
I just give them a
checking account.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.250
So it's a 900 checking
account.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.810
Of course they're going to use
this maybe to write checks to

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.830
their laborers or their
contractors, whoever needs to

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:54.980
build a factory.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:55.550
And so let's see.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.650
How much do I have outstanding
right now in

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.380
terms of demand deposits?

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.680
I have 900 plus 100.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.470
I have 1,000.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.950
So I have 2,000 left.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.770
So let's say someone has
a really big project.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.960
They want to build a bridge
over the local river or

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.750
whatever and they'll charge a
toll and I think that's a

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.370
pretty good idea because people
are very likely to use

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.040
that bridge.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.190
So I'll give out a loan
to that person.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.740
So I'll give out a 2,000 gold
piece loan to that person.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.770
And then instead of giving them
actual gold, I'll just

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.810
create a checking account
for them.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.320
I could've actually issued
bank notes, same idea.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.660
So 2,000 checking account.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.090
And then I'm done, right?

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.560
Because are my total
demand deposits?

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.060
2,000 plus 900 plus 100.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.390
I have 300 in total demand
deposits-- and actually all of

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.900
my liabilities at this point
are demand deposits.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.000
I could have borrowed money in
some other way, but I won't

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.730
worry about right now.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:59.350
So the ratio of my reserves--
300 to my demand deposits,

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.010
which is this part right here,
which is essentially all of my

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.730
liabilities right
now-- is 10%.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.670
And what this allows-- because
of this requirement, one, it

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.820
kept me from keep making
loans out.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.440
I've essentially maxed out what
I can do under this type

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.880
of reserve ratio requirement.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.460
And what it says is, it allows
10%-- essentially it makes

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.650
sure that I'm liquid enough.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.340
It makes sure that when these
people, who I've said, at any

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.850
point in time, you can come and
ask for your money, that

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.630
if people actually do want their
money in terms of gold--

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.250
remember, they can transact
with this money.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.210
They can write checks or if
these were bank notes, they

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.890
could exchange those
bank notes.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.070
But if whoever has access to
this checking account at some

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.610
point in time actually wants
their gold, I need to keep at

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.100
least 10% aside, assuming
that no more than 10%

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.840
need it at one time.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.420
So that's what these reserve
requirements are.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.850
It keeps me liquid.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.920
Liquid means when someone
actually asks for their gold,

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.360
I have the gold to
give it to them.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.860
Now a separate question
is, am I solvent?

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.450
Solvent means, am I good
for the money?

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.600
And solvent is just an issue
of, are your assets larger

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.390
than your liabilities?

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:08.640
So right now in this world,
my assets are what?

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.590
I have 3,000 plus my
initial equity.

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.490
This was 100 down here.

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.360
So my assets are 3,300.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.840
So I'm also solvent.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.800
As long as my assets-- which are
this entire left-hand side

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.120
of the balance sheet-- as long
as my assets are bigger than

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.520
my liabilities, I'm solvent.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.170
Which means that even if in a
world-- let's say in a world

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.190
where for whatever reason,
people wanted gold again,

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.450
they'd come to me and
let's say they

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.980
wanted 400 gold pieces.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.480
I would not be liquid in that
situation because I do not

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.930
have 400 gold pieces to
immediately give them.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:49.630
So I would have a liquidity
problem.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.610
Maybe I would have to borrow
gold from someone else, but I

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.290
would be solvent assuming
that these two

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:57.130
loans are still good.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:00.170
And if someone gave me enough
time, either these loans would

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.460
be paid back or maybe I could
sell these assets, which these

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.420
loans are, to somebody else and
get 900 gold pieces for

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.770
them, in which case I could pay
these people with the gold

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:10.450
that they need.

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.140
So anyway, I just wanted to
show you that difference

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.650
between liquidity
and solvency.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.520
And actually, I realize that I
almost used up all my time.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.140
So in the next video,
I'm going to

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.240
show you about leverage.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.140
And leverage and leverage
requirements have a lot more

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.350
to do with solvency
than liquidity.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.045
And just to give you a little
bit of a preview, it

00:08:31.045 --> 00:08:35.020
essentially says, how much of a
cushion do you need to have

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:39.630
before you're insolvent-- before
your liabilities are

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:40.760
greater than your assets?

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.850
So how much loss can you
take here before

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:44.179
you're out of business?

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:46.350
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:49.650
It ended up being just on
reserve ratios, this one.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:51.580
The next one, I'll
do leverage.
