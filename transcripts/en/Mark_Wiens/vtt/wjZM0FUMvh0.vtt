00:00:01.005 --> 00:00:02.815
- (laughs) You can
actually just stir that up.

00:00:02.815 --> 00:00:05.745
It looks like melted ice cream.

00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:09.689
And what I like to do is
get a piece of actual meat,

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:12.772
and then use that as a dipping sauce.

00:00:14.237 --> 00:00:17.570
Oh, you do not want to spill any though.

00:00:19.892 --> 00:00:22.725
(soft rock music)

00:00:26.604 --> 00:00:27.614
Good morning everyone.

00:00:27.614 --> 00:00:29.007
It's Mark Wiens with migrationology.com

00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:31.006
in Bangkok, Thailand.

00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:31.839
My mom, my sister, and my niece,

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:34.589
are all visiting here in Bangkok.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.985
And so today, we're gonna
take a quick day trip

00:00:37.985 --> 00:00:42.380
to Ayutthaya, which is the
cultural, historical capital.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.895
And it's going to be a full car load.

00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:48.048
Ying and Micah are coming,
taking the whole family.

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:49.962
We're gonna visit a
couple historical sites,

00:00:49.962 --> 00:00:52.298
and eat some delicious food.

00:00:52.298 --> 00:00:53.793
Are you ready...

00:00:53.793 --> 00:00:57.267
(mumbles)
Our road trip?

00:00:57.267 --> 00:00:59.851
Ayutthaya?
- Ayutthaya. (laughs)

00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:02.101
Everything Ayutthaya.
- Yeah.

00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:04.863
Micah, how is that milk?

00:01:04.863 --> 00:01:06.656
- Ayutthaya.
- Time to put you in

00:01:06.656 --> 00:01:08.012
your bed, in the car seat.

00:01:08.012 --> 00:01:10.929
(foreign language)

00:01:16.894 --> 00:01:19.355
- Let me introduce all of you to Imara.

00:01:19.355 --> 00:01:23.022
Imara is 10-months-old,
and she is my niece.

00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:26.215
Imara, good morning.

00:01:26.215 --> 00:01:28.210
(foreign language)

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.159
I'm gonna be making a video

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.146
today.
- Have you not

00:01:30.146 --> 00:01:32.396
make a video of this place?

00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:35.955
- Have I made a video in Ayutthaya?

00:01:35.955 --> 00:01:37.725
Probably years ago.

00:01:37.725 --> 00:01:38.970
But it's been a very long.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.157
- It's time for a new one.
- We are all loaded

00:01:40.157 --> 00:01:41.240
into the car.

00:01:42.142 --> 00:01:45.931
We've got Ying and mom,
and Imara and Micah.

00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:47.393
A double car seat back there.

00:01:47.393 --> 00:01:49.557
And according to Google Maps,

00:01:49.557 --> 00:01:51.348
it says it's gonna take
us one hour and 26 minutes

00:01:51.348 --> 00:01:52.642
to get there,

00:01:52.642 --> 00:01:56.433
so hopefully the kids will
fall asleep immediately.

00:01:56.433 --> 00:01:57.382
I know Micah.

00:01:57.382 --> 00:01:59.149
Micah loves sleeping in the car.

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.456
He falls asleep almost immediately.

00:02:01.456 --> 00:02:02.427
We are on our way.

00:02:02.427 --> 00:02:03.548
Is he already sleeping?

00:02:03.548 --> 00:02:06.381
(soft rock music)

00:02:24.316 --> 00:02:26.553
Okay, we have just made it to Ayutthaya.

00:02:26.553 --> 00:02:30.720
That was abut an hour and
20 minutes driving here,

00:02:32.481 --> 00:02:34.623
and we're gonna first
stop at a temple called

00:02:34.623 --> 00:02:37.014
Wat Yai Chai Mongkhon, which is

00:02:37.014 --> 00:02:39.535
one of the famous historical temples,

00:02:39.535 --> 00:02:43.702
with ruins in Ayutthaya,
so that's our first stop.

00:02:45.546 --> 00:02:48.009
Hello Micah, how was that ride?

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:51.883
Straight from the car seat
into the carrying bag.

00:02:51.883 --> 00:02:52.806
Come on Micah.

00:02:52.806 --> 00:02:53.973
Come on Micah.

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.966
(drum music)

00:03:07.763 --> 00:03:10.040
It's a temple monastery complex,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.836
known for it's giant, old chedi stupa,

00:03:13.836 --> 00:03:16.569
which is over there,
we'll check it out later.

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.227
But this whole complex dates back to 1357,

00:03:20.227 --> 00:03:22.894
and it was built by King Uthong.

00:03:25.072 --> 00:03:27.489
(drum music)

00:03:43.067 --> 00:03:47.234
(several people speak foreign language)

00:03:48.503 --> 00:03:51.230
Made it up to the top
level, the mid-level lookout

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.466
platform, and you can walk
around the chedi up here,

00:03:54.466 --> 00:03:57.511
and actually, there's a nice, cool breeze,

00:03:57.511 --> 00:04:00.039
and a nice view of the
entire temple complex

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:01.789
from up here as well.

00:04:03.082 --> 00:04:06.332
(drum and chime music)

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.643
Micah, Micah.

00:04:25.101 --> 00:04:26.434
Oh, there he is.

00:04:37.643 --> 00:04:40.709
That was a good visit at
Wat Yai Chai Mongkohn.

00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:42.243
We are gonna take a drive now to go eat

00:04:42.243 --> 00:04:44.880
some boat noodles next.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.762
I'm looking forward to
eating some boat noodles.

00:04:47.762 --> 00:04:50.748
And, is Ayutthaya famous for boat noodles?

00:04:50.748 --> 00:04:53.359
(foreign language)

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:54.571
(foreign language) The whole area.

00:04:54.571 --> 00:04:57.083
This who area, including Ayutthaya,

00:04:57.083 --> 00:04:59.531
as well as the northern
suburbs of Bangkok,

00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:03.698
that's considered the birth
place of Thai boat noodles.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.183
(soft rock music)

00:05:20.707 --> 00:05:23.134
We arrived to the boat noodle restaurant,

00:05:23.134 --> 00:05:26.326
and immediately, what I love
about boat noodle restaurants,

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:28.962
the first thing is that
you can immediately smell

00:05:28.962 --> 00:05:33.129
the aroma of cinnamon, and
kind of a sweet, spice aroma.

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:38.835
Let's eat some boat noodles.

00:05:39.784 --> 00:05:42.701
(foreign language)

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.012
Here's something that's kind of cool.

00:05:56.012 --> 00:05:59.784
They have a hanging bouquet
of fried pork skins.

00:05:59.784 --> 00:06:03.141
And you just grab one, and pull.

00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:06.558
And then you eat these with your noodles.

00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:10.164
(foreign language)

00:06:10.164 --> 00:06:12.282
We ordered a variety of
different boat noodles,

00:06:12.282 --> 00:06:15.448
all with sen lek, which are
the medium-sized rice noodles,

00:06:15.448 --> 00:06:17.555
and all of them are,

00:06:17.555 --> 00:06:19.707
there's a mix of pork and beef,

00:06:19.707 --> 00:06:23.257
and then we got nam tok, which means that

00:06:23.257 --> 00:06:24.991
it's the broth,

00:06:24.991 --> 00:06:26.018
they put a little,

00:06:26.018 --> 00:06:28.201
it's a dark, rich broth.

00:06:28.201 --> 00:06:29.611
And how they do that is,

00:06:29.611 --> 00:06:32.247
they add a little bit
of raw blood into the

00:06:32.247 --> 00:06:33.896
bottom of the bowl, and then they

00:06:33.896 --> 00:06:35.996
put in the ingredients, and
then they pour in the hot soup,

00:06:35.996 --> 00:06:38.551
and the curdles the
blood, to make the soup

00:06:38.551 --> 00:06:40.866
really flavorful and rich and delicious.

00:06:40.866 --> 00:06:42.928
Imara's actually loving the boat noodles.

00:06:42.928 --> 00:06:45.654
This is her first boat noodle experience.

00:06:45.654 --> 00:06:47.019
I'm not sure how to
tell which ones are beef

00:06:47.019 --> 00:06:49.041
and which ones are pork.

00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:50.706
Sometimes they serve them
in different colored bowls

00:06:50.706 --> 00:06:53.104
or something, but these,
they're all in the same bowls.

00:06:53.104 --> 00:06:54.547
Noodles are on top.

00:06:54.547 --> 00:06:55.711
The meat is below here.

00:06:55.711 --> 00:06:58.059
There's some morning glory,
there's a piece of liver,

00:06:58.059 --> 00:06:59.637
some meatballs.

00:06:59.637 --> 00:07:01.867
And I do love to season my noodles, but

00:07:01.867 --> 00:07:05.430
the first thing to do with boat noodles

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.457
to really taste the flavor,
is to taste that soup broth.

00:07:08.457 --> 00:07:11.239
And you can see that richness.

00:07:11.239 --> 00:07:13.019
And that aroma is wonderful,
and you can see that

00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:15.421
they've already added a
little bit of chili flakes

00:07:15.421 --> 00:07:18.004
in there, as their preparation.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.353
Mm.

00:07:23.619 --> 00:07:26.923
It has a sweetness to it, and it's already

00:07:26.923 --> 00:07:30.177
quite sour, and a little bit spicy.

00:07:30.177 --> 00:07:33.102
Yeah, you can eat as many
as you want actually.

00:07:33.102 --> 00:07:33.935
- [Pam] They're little, but they're not--

00:07:33.935 --> 00:07:35.926
- [Mark] Oh, that might be,

00:07:35.926 --> 00:07:37.850
okay that's probably good right there.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.899
Ying really loves the cab moo,
which is the fried pork skin.

00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:43.082
And it looks really good,
how she fixed her noodles.

00:07:43.082 --> 00:07:46.008
I'm gonna add this onto mine as well.

00:07:46.008 --> 00:07:47.911
Did you try the fried pork skins Pam?

00:07:47.911 --> 00:07:49.312
- Yeah.
- You should.

00:07:49.312 --> 00:07:51.895
And then you can mix it all up.

00:07:52.773 --> 00:07:55.440
- [Pam] It's like entertainment.

00:07:56.648 --> 00:07:58.592
- [Mark] Oh, and you can actually
hear that pork skin start

00:07:58.592 --> 00:08:00.666
to crackle when it hits that liquid.

00:08:00.666 --> 00:08:02.025
- [Pam] I like it.

00:08:02.025 --> 00:08:05.108
- Alright, going for the noodles now.

00:08:06.433 --> 00:08:09.891
I think you have to actually
eat the entire blob,

00:08:09.891 --> 00:08:11.622
the entire bowl of noodles.

00:08:11.622 --> 00:08:12.908
I didn't get all the meat in this bite,

00:08:12.908 --> 00:08:15.502
but the entire bite of
noodles in one bite.

00:08:15.502 --> 00:08:18.150
Or maybe that's because I've
been taking a lot of photos,

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:22.317
and they've already sort
of stuck together already.

00:08:23.154 --> 00:08:24.571
- [Pam] You okay?

00:08:30.798 --> 00:08:31.631
- Mm.

00:08:35.862 --> 00:08:37.427
That's awesome.

00:08:37.427 --> 00:08:39.077
That extra chili.

00:08:39.077 --> 00:08:42.236
That bumps the heat up nicely.

00:08:42.236 --> 00:08:43.903
Okay, meatball time.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.827
Yeah, nice and firm.

00:08:53.802 --> 00:08:54.635
Mm.

00:08:57.096 --> 00:08:59.513
I got the liver in that bite.

00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:10.981
I'm trying to not drip
any boat noodles on Micah.

00:09:10.981 --> 00:09:13.710
- [Pam] He might get his first taste...

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.975
- I'm pretty sure my first bowl was pork.

00:09:15.975 --> 00:09:19.558
But I think this one
is beef, the next one.

00:09:20.772 --> 00:09:24.582
The blob of noodles, the duo of meatballs,

00:09:24.582 --> 00:09:26.171
oh, they're stuck together. (chuckles)

00:09:26.171 --> 00:09:29.000
And then, yeah this looks like beef.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.583
This looks like beef this time.

00:09:34.778 --> 00:09:35.974
Mix that all around.

00:09:35.974 --> 00:09:37.537
And yeah, it's actually very sour.

00:09:37.537 --> 00:09:40.204
You don't need any more vinegar.

00:09:41.655 --> 00:09:44.973
I'll try to go for some beef and noodles.

00:09:44.973 --> 00:09:47.361
And you really want to
make sure those noodles

00:09:47.361 --> 00:09:51.528
absorb as much of that
broth as possible, per bite.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:00.891
- You're like a real guy.

00:10:00.891 --> 00:10:03.224
You go out with your family.

00:10:03.224 --> 00:10:05.057
- Beef is pretty good.

00:10:06.858 --> 00:10:08.591
The beef is quite tender.

00:10:08.591 --> 00:10:09.885
We just finished with the boat noodles.

00:10:09.885 --> 00:10:12.277
The restaurant is called
Kuay Teow Reua Pa Lek.

00:10:12.277 --> 00:10:13.110
The recipe they made, it's a little bit

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:14.829
on the sweet side.

00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:17.257
I like the less sweet version,

00:10:17.257 --> 00:10:19.576
but the broth was really rich, and

00:10:19.576 --> 00:10:23.201
the overall flavor was
well-balanced and good,

00:10:23.201 --> 00:10:24.644
just a little bit on
the sweet side for me.

00:10:24.644 --> 00:10:26.210
We're back in the car now.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.749
Micah slept through that entire meal.

00:10:29.749 --> 00:10:34.206
But, Imara had her first
taste of boat noodles.

00:10:34.206 --> 00:10:37.790
How did you like the boat noodles, Imara?

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.635
Oh, I think that's a yes.

00:10:39.635 --> 00:10:41.198
I saw her mouth water.

00:10:41.198 --> 00:10:42.806
And then also, they have a lot of,

00:10:42.806 --> 00:10:45.522
a cluster of street food
stalls right outside

00:10:45.522 --> 00:10:46.554
of the restaurant.

00:10:46.554 --> 00:10:48.245
So we got some snacks.

00:10:48.245 --> 00:10:51.352
We're snacking on some fried bananas now.

00:10:51.352 --> 00:10:53.739
- [Pam] They are really
tasty, they're filling.

00:10:53.739 --> 00:10:55.139
- Yeah.
- Between this.

00:10:55.139 --> 00:10:57.620
- Fried bananas are good.
- This and the noodles,

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.272
I don't need a lot more.

00:10:59.272 --> 00:11:03.439
- Battered in coconut and
sesame seeds, and then crispy.

00:11:04.675 --> 00:11:07.807
(baby cries)
Oh yeah.

00:11:07.807 --> 00:11:09.010
They're always good.

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:11.737
This particular banana
is a little bit sweet,

00:11:11.737 --> 00:11:14.737
and a little bit tart on the inside.

00:11:15.746 --> 00:11:17.641
Okay, next stop, we are going to

00:11:17.641 --> 00:11:18.724
Wat Mahathat.

00:11:21.367 --> 00:11:24.200
(soft rock music)

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:40.530
We just entered into Wat Mahatat.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.767
And this is one of the
iconic areas in historical

00:11:43.767 --> 00:11:46.213
Ayutthaya, in the historical park.

00:11:46.213 --> 00:11:47.822
Today is a really nice day.

00:11:47.822 --> 00:11:50.167
I can't believe how cool and nice it is.

00:11:50.167 --> 00:11:51.334
It's overcast.

00:11:52.349 --> 00:11:54.766
(drum music)

00:11:58.201 --> 00:12:01.402
If you ever do any kind of
searching for Ayutthaya,

00:12:01.402 --> 00:12:04.252
this is one of the most
famous and iconic sites

00:12:04.252 --> 00:12:05.827
that you will see.

00:12:05.827 --> 00:12:09.287
And the story goes, was that there was a

00:12:09.287 --> 00:12:12.427
full Buddha statue, and the head fell off.

00:12:12.427 --> 00:12:14.651
And then over many, many
years, it grew into the

00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:17.289
Bodhi tree, as well as it
sort of wrapped into the wall,

00:12:17.289 --> 00:12:18.122
as well.

00:12:27.297 --> 00:12:29.714
(drum music)

00:12:31.717 --> 00:12:35.414
What I'm loving today is how
peaceful and quiet it is.

00:12:35.414 --> 00:12:37.018
And I'm here on a week day.

00:12:37.018 --> 00:12:38.663
But I've been here on the weekends,

00:12:38.663 --> 00:12:40.849
when it's just packed and,

00:12:40.849 --> 00:12:42.823
this gives it a totally different,

00:12:42.823 --> 00:12:45.460
peaceful, calm charm to it,

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.627
when it's quiet like this.

00:12:48.507 --> 00:12:51.340
(soft rock music)

00:12:53.338 --> 00:12:56.588
- With video, Imara, Pam, me and Micah.

00:12:58.377 --> 00:13:01.669
Micah had a huge milk meal as we were

00:13:01.669 --> 00:13:03.439
walking around the ruins.

00:13:03.439 --> 00:13:07.487
Imara, what did you think of Ayutthaya?

00:13:07.487 --> 00:13:09.136
We are back to the car,

00:13:09.136 --> 00:13:11.657
and one of my absolute favorite,

00:13:11.657 --> 00:13:15.347
the best reason to come to Ayutthaya,

00:13:15.347 --> 00:13:17.650
is to eat freshwater prawns, which

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:20.007
Ayutthaya is very famous for.

00:13:20.007 --> 00:13:22.318
I would not take a trip to Ayutthaya

00:13:22.318 --> 00:13:23.933
without eating some freshwater prawns.

00:13:23.933 --> 00:13:26.045
So next up, we are going to eat some

00:13:26.045 --> 00:13:27.114
freshwater prawns.

00:13:27.114 --> 00:13:28.278
It's a real treat.

00:13:28.278 --> 00:13:29.802
Most of the restaurants
are not located within

00:13:29.802 --> 00:13:33.055
Ayutthaya town, but they
are within the province.

00:13:33.055 --> 00:13:35.004
A little bit south of the
main part of the town.

00:13:35.004 --> 00:13:36.652
So, we're gonna drive a little ways,

00:13:36.652 --> 00:13:39.423
and there are a whole bunch of
freshwater prawn restaurants,

00:13:39.423 --> 00:13:42.487
which are usually along the river.

00:13:42.487 --> 00:13:46.837
And we're gonna try one that
I've never been to before.

00:13:46.837 --> 00:13:49.670
(soft rock music)

00:14:02.763 --> 00:14:04.013
Oh that's okay.

00:14:05.202 --> 00:14:07.148
That's awesome.

00:14:07.148 --> 00:14:08.604
It's like cotton candy.

00:14:08.604 --> 00:14:11.081
Ayutthaya, along with freshwater prawns,

00:14:11.081 --> 00:14:13.770
is very famous for roti saimai.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:18.149
A roti, it's like a little
pancake type of crepe,

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:21.897
filled with cotton candy, which
is pretty much pure sugar,

00:14:21.897 --> 00:14:24.120
so it's not really my favorite.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.105
But Ying wanted to buy some to bring home

00:14:25.105 --> 00:14:26.341
to her family, and
especially to her sister,

00:14:26.341 --> 00:14:27.508
who loves it.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:52.820
It was about a 20 kilometer drive from the center of Ayutthaya to get to this restaurant.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.040
and I'm already liking it, a nice relaxing feel.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.860
This restaurant is called Rauen Sai Nam.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.020
We got a nice table on the edge of the river,

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:13.720
they kind of have a deck, a patio overlooking the river.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.720
and right next to the bride.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:23.220
Got a couple of dishes, but mainly, really what you want to eat here, are the freshwater prawn.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:28.080
And they are, they are very pricey, they are expensive, but it's a real treat.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.660
So right now he is lighting up the charcoal.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.420
We're here are at a random time in the middle of the afternoon.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:34.680
Oh hello Micah and Ying.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:57.340
Oh ho ho ho, I can already smell that shell roasting, that shell roasting over those hot coals.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:10.860
As he's roasting the prawns you can actually see the head oils, that liver,

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:15.060
that yellow buttery goodness, just starting to melt.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:20.100
He cooks it just perfection making sure that, you really do not want to overcook these.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:26.540
He knows exactly what he's doing though, just so that they are perfectly coked and juicy and tender,

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.100
and oily and butter.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:32.700
Ok, he said I can open it up.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:37.980
Oh, oh, that steam aroma that comes out of there is just insane.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.500
Of all the things you could possibly do in Ayutthaya,

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:04.120
eating freshwater prawns is the absolute culinary and attraction highlight.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.660
And I've been looking forward to this all day long.

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:09.580
They roasted for about 10 minutes on the grill.

00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:12.940
And then, we also ordered a couple of other dishes, which also look very good.

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:18.220
But nothing can outdo the beauty of this freshwater prawn.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.940
And these are just roasted with nothing on them, I don't they are seasoned with anything.

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:24.960
But they are served with a sauce, but normally you don't even need a sauce,

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:29.840
just because you want to experience just that pure flavor of the freshwater prawn.

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:35.800
Oh hohoho, you can actually just stir that up like, it looks like melted ice cream.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:40.480
And what I like to do is get a piece of the actual meat

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.040
and then use that as a dipping sauce

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.140
oh you do not what to spill any though.

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:53.540
And just dip and fully coat. Oh now you have the best of both worlds in a single bite.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.520
That has to be one of the best things in the whole world.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:13.900
And that combination, that head oil liver, it's so buttery and so creamy.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:20.900
It is like melted ice cream, but with a bitter, slightly bitter roasted shrimp flavor to it.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.580
And then that meat is a little bit muscular, but at the same time it's quite tender.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.120
And it's, it's quite sweet.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.360
They cook them just perfect.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.920
So they are not overcooked, definitely not overcooked, which would dry them out and probably make them tough.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.980
But just, melt in your mouth unbelievable.

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:54.560
If I could just choose, a single one ingredient, to eat in Thailand,

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.700
It may be freshwater prawns.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.800
That freshwater prawn is immaculate.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.800
But this roasted eggplant salad which is called yam makua yao,

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.200
it also looks pretty good, there's some big shrimp on top of there, there's some minced pork in here.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:10.840
there are some shallots, and those eggs, let me put some of this on my plate,

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:17.520
And those eggs, which is like a half boiled soft boiled egg, on the side here,

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.840
it actually, that yolk almost looks like the shrimp.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.420
On to the salad, oh a chili in this bite.

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.140
Oh that's really good too,

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:42.680
It's citrusy and it's salty, and again that egg just melts in your mouth like the shrimp.

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:47.320
And then there's shallots in there, smoky eggplant.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:52.560
And then that dressing is a little bit sour, like lime, limey.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:56.500
And then it also has a saltiness, like a fish sauce saltiness to it.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.720
For soup we got tom khlong pla neua on.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.060
And this is a type of soup, there's fish in here.

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:05.820
It's similar to tom yum, but a little bit different and they use dried chilies in here.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:13.100
And I've already tasted tasted this and it's very good, my sister really likes it.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.360
Oh, that's a good flavor.

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:24.980
It's really, it's actually salty to the point where its,

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:30.460
it's almost too salty, but just perfect right at that bottom line, where it just keep you craving more.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.840
A little bit spic you can feel that dry chili,

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.820
a little bit sour, you can also really taste that lemongrass, and those kaffir lime in there as well.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.080
kaffir lime leaves, sorry.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:49.840
I'm moving back to the freshwater prawn already.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.780
For my next bite I think I will try a little bit of that sauce.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.800
It's breathtakingly good.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:11.200
And that sauce, it is pretty good with the sauce.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:17.780
That gives it like a little bit of an acidic, and also sweet and, chili flavor.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:23.640
But yah really, you really don't need anything to complement that prawn.

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:31.920
We just finished with this meal, that was incredibly, unbelievably good especially the freshwater prawns.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.180
Nice restaurant, sitting on the river with a nice view

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.660
and now I'm just hanging out and relaxing.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.680
That was the perfect was to end this day trip to Ayutthaya.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.760
And it was good to get out of Bangkok for a little bit to show my Mom and sister,

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:49.060
and then to take the kids, the babies, walking around,

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.580
and just to enjoy Ayutthaya.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:57.400
When you come to Ayutthaya, if you have the chance to try some freshwater prawns,

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.940
you want to take that chance, they are unbelievably good.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:05.580
I'm going to end the video right now, it's been a fantastic little day trip to Ayutthaya.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.840
Please remember to give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it,

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.560
and also, I'd love to hear from you in the comments section below.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.600
Thank you again for watching, and I will see you on the next video.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:20.660
Good bye from Ayutthaya, Thailand.
