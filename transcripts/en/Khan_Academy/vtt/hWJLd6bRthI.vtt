00:00:00.222 --> 00:00:01.641
- [Voiceover] So, here we have the graph

00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:03.391
y is equal to g of x.

00:00:04.754 --> 00:00:07.919
We have a little point
discontinuity right over here

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.688
at x is equal to seven,

00:00:10.688 --> 00:00:12.361
and what we want to do is figure out

00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:17.244
what is the limit of g of
x as x approaches seven.

00:00:17.244 --> 00:00:20.199
So, since you say, well, what
is the function approaching

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.123
as the inputs in the function
are approaching seven?

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:26.000
So, let's see, so if we input
as the input to the function

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.785
approaches seven from
values less than seven,

00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:32.189
so if x is three, g of three is here,

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.448
g of three is right there,
g of four is right there,

00:00:36.448 --> 00:00:39.281
g of five is right there, g of six

00:00:40.337 --> 00:00:42.820
looks like it's a little bit more than,

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.055
or a little bit less than negative one,

00:00:46.055 --> 00:00:49.888
g of 6.5 looks like it's
around negative half,

00:00:52.306 --> 00:00:55.473
g of negative 6.9 is right over there,

00:00:56.458 --> 00:01:00.233
looks like it's a little
bit less than zero,

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:03.939
g of negative 6.999 looks
like it's a little bit,

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:05.686
it's still less than zero
but it's a little bit

00:01:05.686 --> 00:01:08.889
closer to zero so it looks
like we're getting closer

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:13.378
as x gets closer and closer
but not quite at seven,

00:01:13.378 --> 00:01:14.867
it looks like the value of our function

00:01:14.867 --> 00:01:17.231
is approaching zero.

00:01:17.231 --> 00:01:19.234
Let's see if that's also true from values

00:01:19.234 --> 00:01:21.127
for x values greater than seven,

00:01:21.127 --> 00:01:24.238
so g of nine is up here,
looks like it's around six,

00:01:24.238 --> 00:01:26.823
g of eight looks like it's
a little bit more than two,

00:01:26.823 --> 00:01:29.743
g of 7.5 looks like it's a
little bit more than one,

00:01:29.743 --> 00:01:34.597
g of 7.1 looks like it's a
little bit more than zero,

00:01:34.597 --> 00:01:37.638
the g of 7.1 looks like it's
a little bit more than zero,

00:01:37.638 --> 00:01:41.093
g of 7.01 is even closer to zero,

00:01:41.093 --> 00:01:45.260
g of 7.0000001 looks like
it'll be even closer to zero

00:01:46.144 --> 00:01:48.786
so once again it looks like
we are approaching zero

00:01:48.786 --> 00:01:50.236
as x as approaches seven,

00:01:50.236 --> 00:01:53.055
in this case as we approach
from larger values of seven.

00:01:53.055 --> 00:01:55.744
And this is interesting because the limit

00:01:55.744 --> 00:01:58.929
as x approaches seven of
g of x is different than

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.980
the function's actual value, g of seven,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.245
when we actually input
seven into the function.

00:02:04.245 --> 00:02:06.024
When we actually input
seven into the function,

00:02:06.024 --> 00:02:08.955
we can see the graph tells us
that the value of the function

00:02:08.955 --> 00:02:11.210
is equal to three.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.562
So we actually have this
point discontinuity,

00:02:13.562 --> 00:02:16.034
or sometimes called a
removable discontinuity,

00:02:16.034 --> 00:02:17.813
right over here, and this is,

00:02:17.813 --> 00:02:19.550
I'm not gonna do a lot of depth here,

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.321
but this is starting to touch on how we,

00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:24.807
one of the ways that we can
actually test for continuity

00:02:24.807 --> 00:02:27.598
is if the limit as we approach
a value is not the same

00:02:27.598 --> 00:02:30.785
as the actual value of the
function of that point,

00:02:30.785 --> 00:02:33.294
well, then we're probably talking about,

00:02:33.294 --> 00:02:37.461
or actually we are talking
about, a discontinuity.
