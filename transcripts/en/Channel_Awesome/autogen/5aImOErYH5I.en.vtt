00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 align:start position:0%
my theory now cuz uh because it brings
 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.179 align:start position:0%
my theory now cuz uh because it brings
up<00:03:29.729><c> a</c><00:03:29.909><c> Turing</c><00:03:30.209><c> first</c><00:03:30.479><c> yes</c><00:03:30.720><c> uh</c><00:03:31.189><c> because</c>

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:32.189 align:start position:0%
up a Turing first yes uh because
 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
up a Turing first yes uh because
mcgucket<00:03:32.699><c> brings</c><00:03:32.939><c> up</c><00:03:33.239><c> also</c><00:03:33.989><c> it</c><00:03:34.169><c> was</c><00:03:34.260><c> in</c><00:03:34.379><c> 1982</c>

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 align:start position:0%
mcgucket brings up also it was in 1982
 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.490 align:start position:0%
mcgucket brings up also it was in 1982
and<00:03:35.489><c> I</c><00:03:36.060><c> think</c><00:03:36.449><c> that's</c><00:03:36.629><c> when</c><00:03:36.780><c> the</c><00:03:36.870><c> calendar</c><00:03:37.169><c> was</c>

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
and I think that's when the calendar was
 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.569 align:start position:0%
and I think that's when the calendar was
and<00:03:37.919><c> they</c><00:03:38.069><c> kept</c><00:03:38.250><c> saying</c><00:03:38.280><c> thirty</c><00:03:38.760><c> years</c><00:03:39.030><c> ago</c><00:03:39.359><c> uh</c>

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 align:start position:0%
and they kept saying thirty years ago uh
 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.159 align:start position:0%
and they kept saying thirty years ago uh
so<00:03:41.579><c> again</c><00:03:42.060><c> there's</c><00:03:42.569><c> some</c><00:03:42.720><c> sort</c><00:03:42.930><c> of</c><00:03:42.959><c> connection</c>

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 align:start position:0%
so again there's some sort of connection
 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.740 align:start position:0%
so again there's some sort of connection
there<00:03:43.500><c> if</c><00:03:43.859><c> I</c><00:03:44.340><c> had</c><00:03:44.489><c> to</c><00:03:44.609><c> guess</c><00:03:44.849><c> because</c><00:03:45.180><c> he</c><00:03:45.479><c> talks</c>

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 align:start position:0%
there if I had to guess because he talks
 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.729 align:start position:0%
there if I had to guess because he talks
about<00:03:45.900><c> um</c><00:03:47.239><c> you</c><00:03:48.239><c> know</c><00:03:48.359><c> like</c><00:03:48.629><c> past</c><00:03:49.169><c> girlfriends</c>

about um you know like past girlfriends
 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.289 align:start position:0%
about um you know like past girlfriends

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 align:start position:0%
stuff like that I had the calendar I
 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.759 align:start position:0%
stuff like that I had the calendar I

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 align:start position:0%
think there's even pictures of woman my
 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.740 align:start position:0%
think there's even pictures of woman my
guess<00:03:53.009><c> is</c><00:03:53.129><c> that</c><00:03:53.250><c> he</c><00:03:53.400><c> lost</c><00:03:53.579><c> somebody</c><00:03:53.939><c> like</c><00:03:54.479><c> in</c>

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 align:start position:0%
guess is that he lost somebody like in
 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.809 align:start position:0%
guess is that he lost somebody like in
that<00:03:55.019><c> portal</c><00:03:55.500><c> or</c><00:03:55.650><c> whatever</c><00:03:55.829><c> could</c><00:03:56.250><c> be</c><00:03:56.310><c> but</c><00:03:56.790><c> a</c>
