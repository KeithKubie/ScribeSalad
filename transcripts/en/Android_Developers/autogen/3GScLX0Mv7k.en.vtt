 Ringgold: When I was little, 

00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.375
 There were no cars on the street. 

00:00:04.375 --> 00:00:06.333
 Few had cars. 

00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.458
 She was born in 1930 in Harlem 

00:00:08.458 --> 00:00:10.500
 On street number 146, 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.667
 My work has now reached all over the world. 

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:15.250
 In Guggenheim, Tate, and everywhere else. 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.833
 [singing] 

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:19.458
 I am curious that I did not think I was 

00:00:19.458 --> 00:00:20.917
 I will become an artist. 

00:00:20.917 --> 00:00:22.167
 I think the artist 

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:23.292
 He does something ordinary. 

00:00:23.292 --> 00:00:25.125
 They are all artists. 

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:26.667
 Look at this, it's beautiful. 

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:28.792
 The art that people make comes from 

00:00:28.792 --> 00:00:32.583
 From their vision of colors, 

00:00:32.583 --> 00:00:37.042
 I saw many formations of beautiful colors 

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:41.625
 I convey what I see to my work. 

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:45.417
 Everyone can fly. Just try, and you will. 

00:00:45.417 --> 00:00:49.125
 The most important thing in life for me 

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:51.083
 Is inspiration. 

00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:54.917
 I want to inspire others, 

00:00:54.917 --> 00:00:56.708
 And get inspiration. 

00:00:56.708 --> 00:00:57.833
 Do not you see this great thing? 

00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:03.833
