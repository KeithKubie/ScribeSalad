00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.300
You've now seen a lot of variable declarations. I've seen a lot in my life.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.960
I've written a lot in my life. Here's a bunch more. Some of these have mistakes

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.415
in them. Can you match each variable declaration to a description of the

00:00:11.415 --> 00:00:16.410
mistake? The possible mistakes are, the variables can only contain letters and

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.590
numbers. B, it's always a good idea to include an initial value. Variable type

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.970
doesn't match initial value type. Variable has a bad type. No mistake, this

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.390
variable declaration is fine. Variable declarations need a semicolon. And

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.600
variable declarations must have types.
