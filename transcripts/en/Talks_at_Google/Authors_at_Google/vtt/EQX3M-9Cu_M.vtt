Time, Wired and
The New York Times.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.149
Please welcome Steven Johnson.

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:45.149
[Applause]

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.579
&gt;&gt;Steven Johnson: Thank you.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:47.579
All right.

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.579
Thank you.

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.640
This is day three of the book tour for Future
Perfect so I'm at that lovely stage where

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.579
I'm still I'm still excited to listen to
myself talk about this book.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.489
In a couple weeks, I'll be very tired of my
own voice on this topic.

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:12.660
This is a very optimistic book,
and already just in the, in this first week,

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.340
I'm realizing how odd that seems to people
now.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.710
I did an interview on NPR last week
where they started the interview saying, "Our

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.970
next guest is an actual optimist."

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.520
Like I was a Giant Panda they had found somewhere
and they were kind of amazed at it.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.660
And I think probably inside a company like
Google, and inside the tech sector, we're

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.740
much more likely to find people who feel there
is progress going on in the world and there's

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.470
reason for optimism, but when we kind of get
outside of that realm, we see a lot of

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.460
people who are not so optimistic about the
future, and this is--this is a book that is

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.980
making a case for reasons to be encouraged
and enthusiastic about our, kind of, prospects

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.010
ahead.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.500
But it's specifically a political book.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.860
It's my first real foray into the political
conversation in a kind of explicit way, but

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.900
it's not a political book in the mode that
most political book seem to be written these

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.860
days, which is one side bashing the other
side.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.349
And it's not really about existing political
parties but rather it's an attempt to kind

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:23.020
of map out what I see as this a new
emerging world view, a vision of how we make

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:30.159
progress, how we continue progress and social
good around us that I've been seeing

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:35.519
everywhere I look in all these people and
organizations over the last five or ten years.

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.599
And it's trying to make the case that there’s
a coherent kind of political philosophy that's

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.689
emerging in these different groups; one
that is different from the traditional viewpoints

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:45.969
of the left and the right.

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:48.350
It's not a centrist argument, because I think
what I'm

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.730
arguing for is quite different.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.540
So, it is an argument and what I want to do
today to kind of walk you through the stages

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.540
of the argument.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.670
There are kind of four primary
stages and tell you some stories along the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.730
way as kind of case studies on how this stuff
works.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:11.109
The first kind of rung of the argument is
this: we have a set of institutions in society

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:20.749
that, while they vary in case to case in
many ways, they are coherent enough as a type

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:22.599
that we talk about them as kind of categories.

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:28.310
We talk about a corporation; we talk
about the marketplace; we talk about the government

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.120
or the state.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.680
And we all know there are like many instances
of corporations that behave very differently.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.409
They're employee owned
corporations; they’re corporations with

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:42.260
lots of participation that are not particularly
hierarchical the way, in many ways Google

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.470
is;
they're very top down corporations just as

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.450
there are are various different kinds of governments:
local, state, federal and so on.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.090
But we've agreed, as a society, that those
institutions as a group are kind of coherent

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.540
enough that we can refer to them as the
government or the state or private sector

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.249
or the market place.

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:06.099
And we have a set of kind of political philosophies
that are predicated on the various kind of

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.540
ratios of influence of those
different institutions.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.170
So if we are on the left, we think that the
state should have strong force in society

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.819
and provide a safety
net and so forth.

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.639
And if we're on the right, we think the market
should be unleashed to do as much as it should.

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.199
And in general,
the political conversation is an attempt to

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:27.479
figure out how do you balance those two competing
forces.

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:33.569
What I am trying to argue is that for a long
time there has been another social architecture,

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:37.539
another institution, that has been
working in the world and providing actually

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:44.680
a lot of the fuel for social progress in our
world, but that has become increasingly

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.139
important in the last twenty or thirty years,
and that organization is what I am calling

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:55.699
the Peer Network, which is a simplified
way of describing it from Peer to Peer Network.

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.650
And actually, the easiest way to think about
the power and importance of this organizational

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:06.340
structure is to actually think about
the Internet itself and the Web itself.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.920
And this actually gets us directly into the
presidential political conversation that's

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.920
happening right now.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.490
I wrote a little bit about that in The Times
Magazine this weekend.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:21.590
In the "You didn't build that" speech, which
was, until last week, the most controversial

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.729
speech of the political season, [chuckles]
President

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:30.259
Obama was talking about how entrepreneurs
while they build a business are nonetheless

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:34.440
reliant on all sorts of infrastructure
that's been provided for them by the government

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.971
so they didn't build the roads that their
businesses use and they didn't build the

00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:42.060
a lot of the technological infrastructure
that they rely on and that is something that

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.569
the government did provide.

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:48.530
And the line that
after notorious "You didn't build that" line

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.520
was actually specifically about the history
of the Internet.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.730
It said, quote, unquote,
"Government built the Internet so that businesses

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.680
then could make money off the Internet."

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.419
That was sort of the sequence and that was
the

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:01.419
description.

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:05.949
Shortly after that quote appeared, The Wall
Street Journal ran this sort of contrarian

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:10.039
Op Ed that said, "Actually the government's
role in the invention of the Internet was

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:14.919
greatly overstated and in fact it was really
the private sector that did it and it was

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.060
no
accident that the Internet kind of languished

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.830
for twenty years in relative obscurity until
the private sector jumped on it, including

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:23.830
companies like Google."

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.629
And so there was kind of this argument debunking
the government built the Internet story.

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:32.849
Now, we understand from what we were just
saying at the beginning why this matters.

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:35.030
If you're on the left and if you can show
that the

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.039
government played an important role in innovating
and creating this platform that then actually

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:44.150
encouraged business, that's a great defender
of progressive left values.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:49.189
The government actually is not just a safety
net, it's a driver of change and innovation.

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:51.570
If you're on
the right, if you can show that the government,

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.181
as they called it in The Wall Street Journal,
that it was an urban myth that the

00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:59.310
Internet had been created by the government,
well then that keeps your libertarian ideals

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.760
intact.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:07.740
But if you think about the actual organizations
that built the Internet, and certainly that

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:15.909
built the Web, and many of the other
key elements of code that our infrastructure

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:21.601
is now based on, I think that the most important
thing here that is lost is that there

00:07:21.601 --> 00:07:25.950
is this different organizational structure
that was maybe the most important of all which

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:32.340
was this loose, decentralized affiliation
of largely computer scientists around the

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:37.139
world collaborating in an open way; building
on each other's ideas without private

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:43.939
ownership of their ideas, without patents,
sharing and building on, in a collaborative

00:07:43.939 --> 00:07:46.340
network, the kind of core ideas.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.629
Funded by the government for sure.

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:54.280
Funded by visionary, early government spending
that allowed them to build these collaborative

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.280
networks.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.969
Very few people who were actually working
on the Internet in its formative years were

00:07:58.969 --> 00:08:00.789
working inside a government agency.

00:08:00.789 --> 00:08:04.099
They
were all outside, many of them in universities,

00:08:04.099 --> 00:08:08.200
and they were working in that really venerable
tradition of open source, peer

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.629
reviewed science, where they were taking ideas
and saying, "That's a great idea and I can

00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:13.629
improve it.

00:08:13.629 --> 00:08:14.629
I can improve it."

00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:16.449
No one
was holding any kind of proprietary claim

00:08:16.449 --> 00:08:18.819
over these ideas.

00:08:18.819 --> 00:08:21.770
And what's true about the Internet is even
more true of the Web.

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.731
It wasn't like there was some kind of big
DARPA research project

00:08:24.731 --> 00:08:27.449
that led directly to the creation of the Web.

00:08:27.449 --> 00:08:32.390
And so if you think about it, you think about
all the technology and all the code out there

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:37.070
that has been produced by these kinds
of peer networks, whether they're government

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:41.160
funded research or whether it's open source
software, whether it's things like

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:46.850
Wikipedia, think about how essential those
things have now become to our lives today.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:50.740
I mean in The Times piece this weekend, I
had this little thought experiment which is

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.810
if you could somehow, if you were like some
Dr. Evil and you wanted, you could create

00:08:54.810 --> 00:09:01.630
this targeted magnetic pulse that would cause
every bit of peer produced code to shut

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.190
off on the planet.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:06.880
Imagine the magnitude of that event.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:07.880
The Internet would go down.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.880
The Web would go down.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.850
The markets would go
down.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:16.920
Potentially the energy sector, aviation, whole
parts of the world, would go dark overnight.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:22.370
It would be a global catastrophe of a
pandemic or something like that.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:28.889
That shows how much that open structure of
open code collaboration has shaped our world

00:09:28.889 --> 00:09:29.889
today.

00:09:29.889 --> 00:09:34.320
The state and the private sector are
now dependent on the products of that labor.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:40.670
Now, in the context of a company like Google,
you will probably take some variation of this

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:42.670
for granted.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:46.130
But the point here is if
we'd been having this conversation thirty

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:49.029
years ago with most people in the world--.

00:09:49.029 --> 00:09:56.050
I now live in Northern California in Marin
County, California and if I showed up in 1971

00:09:56.050 --> 00:10:02.769
or something like that and said, "We're gonna
build this new set of products using

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:08.360
collaborative non-proprietary labor with no
traditional ownership relationships.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.010
We're going to get together and share ideas
and build things."

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:16.290
Most people would have said, "Absolutely,
I'm sure on your commune in Northern California

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:18.670
you're really gonna, you know, make some
beautiful baskets.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.990
We look forward to seeing these products,"
right?

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:23.210
People would have said, "That's not really
how the real world

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:24.210
works.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.600
Real things don't get built in that kind of
way.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.070
In the marketplace, you have to have private
property and you have to have all this stuff.”

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:35.800
Here we are now, forty years later, and we
see that this stuff works.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.510
And, in fact, now a huge part of our daily
lives are dependent on

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:43.370
precisely that kind of peer network collaboration.

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:46.940
So what we are talking about here is not some
utopian fantasy.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:52.810
It's not some
collectivist dream on some grad school seminar

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:53.870
on radical thought.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.779
It is a practical reality that we can point
to and say this

00:10:57.779 --> 00:11:02.810
works in the real world, and in many cases
it has outperformed offering, competing offerings

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:07.290
that were created by the private
sector.

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:11.930
So that's the beginning, the first scaffolding,
that there's this structure of the peer network

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:16.830
that deserves to be considered
alongside that of the top-down corporation

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:21.220
or the top-down government agency.

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:27.510
The second stage then is that that kind of
structure, embodied in code, can be used to

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:30.360
solve other kinds of problems.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.920
Not just the
problems of organizing and connecting all

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:38.710
the minds and information of the world, but
other kinds of problems.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:43.691
The best example of this in the last couple
of years is: one, Wikipedia, obviously, which

00:11:43.691 --> 00:11:46.959
is the attempt to use peer networks to
solve the problem of how do you create a global

00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:48.370
encyclopedia.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:53.760
If, again, if fifteen years ago we were having
this conversation and

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:58.209
someone said, "I think we could all collectively
build a global encyclopedia that would rival

00:11:58.209 --> 00:12:02.449
or exceed Britannica in quality and
greatly exceed it in terms of the scope and

00:12:02.449 --> 00:12:07.779
comprehensiveness of the encyclopedia," even
the true believers in the room probably

00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:09.870
would have said, "Yeah, that's not really
going to happen.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:11.000
I think that's unlikely."

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.610
And yet it happened, and it's real and it's
there.

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:19.399
The other great example, from New York, is
Kickstarter.

00:12:19.399 --> 00:12:24.740
Kickstarter is an attempt to solve the problem
of how do you fund creative

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:30.270
work, how do fund interesting experimental
artistic work that is not yet getting supported

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:34.140
by the traditional venues of the market.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:41.610
We have decided as society long ago that it's
important to support creative work when it's

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:45.390
in that more experimental stage when it
doesn’t yet have the private sector backing.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:50.620
That's why we have big institutions like the
National Endowment for the Arts, or big

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:56.300
philanthropic institutions like the Duke Foundation
or the MacArthur Foundation and so on.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:02.720
We don't have a National Endowment for
the Detergents because we've decided that

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.570
the private sector is very good at coming
up with laundry materials, but we do have

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.420
a
National Endowment for the Arts because we

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:12.589
feel that artists need a little extra help,
right?

00:13:12.589 --> 00:13:17.519
And we think it's good, as a society,
to support those ideas so that they can spread

00:13:17.519 --> 00:13:21.090
and even turn into more interesting ideas.

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:26.560
Up until recently, the way that you funded
your experimental projects was either you

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.090
kept your day job or you went to a big
organization like the National Endowment for

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:33.459
the Arts or the Duke Foundation and you tried
to get a grant and a small number of

00:13:33.459 --> 00:13:38.190
decision makers inside those big organizations
would make a decision of whether to support

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:39.740
your project or not.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.970
Well, Kickstarter came along and they said,
"Wait a second--the world is filled with people

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:48.050
who would probably be willing to give
ten dollars or fifty dollars to support an

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:52.329
interesting project even if they aren't technically
investing in the project.

00:13:52.329 --> 00:13:54.630
Even if
they don't see a commercial return from that

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:57.399
investment if the project takes off."

00:13:57.399 --> 00:14:01.610
And so they went out and created this platform,
and what's interesting about Kickstarter actually

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:05.360
is that it's an example of a for-profit company.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.240
It's a venture backed start up
that's probably going to make a tidy return

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.720
for its investors.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:14.700
But what it creates is this peer network gift
economy where people

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:19.670
are proposing projects and funding projects
without traditional commercial relationships.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:24.960
There's not an invest, by the kind of
bylaws of the system, there is not a investment

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:25.960
relationship.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:31.120
There's not a ROI measured by traditional
accounts in the Kickstarter

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.420
structure.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:36.480
But here we are now, and you all know this
as well as I do, but here we are now three

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:41.240
or four years later, and Kickstarter is on
track to give away more money to artists this

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:45.110
year than the entire budget of the National
Endowment for the Arts.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:49.630
So the question
is no longer is Kickstarter whatever.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:52.000
Is it ever possible that it would be as big
as the NEA?

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.440
The question is Kickstarter going to
be ten times bigger than the NEA?

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.770
And that's not an argument for doing away
with the NEA.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:02.470
It is maybe an argument to make the NEA work
a little more like

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:03.759
Kickstarter.

00:15:03.759 --> 00:15:08.130
But what it effectively does, and this is
the key to so many of these types of organizations,

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:14.610
is that it decentralizes
and diversifies and densifies the number of

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:18.160
people who are involved in the decision making
process of which creative works should

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.569
get funded and which shouldn't.

00:15:20.569 --> 00:15:24.640
And there is a decision--less than fifty percent
of Kickstarter projects get funded--so it's

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.750
not as
if anything goes, there is a selection process

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:28.830
which is crucial to these systems.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:33.879
There has to be a way of separating the signal
from the noise, just as page rank figured

00:15:33.879 --> 00:15:37.190
out this way--in a decentralized way--of figuring
out what was quality on the Internet

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:39.630
and what was not.

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:43.470
But they greatly expanded the pool of people
who were involved in that decision making

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:48.300
process, so instead of these very top-down,
very small number of decision makers who are

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:52.399
funding creative work before now we have this
much wider net.

00:15:52.399 --> 00:15:55.130
And what it is about
is this kind of gift economy exchange.

00:15:55.130 --> 00:16:00.980
So again, we have this situation where using
the technology, creating peer networks solves

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:06.949
the problem and does it in really extraordinarily
way and actually untaps, unlocks all this

00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:10.220
kind of energy and enthusiasm that
wasn't there before.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.680
So that's using the technology of a peer network
to solve a different kind of problem in the

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.600
case of KickStarter, it's
Arts funding.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.310
But the key thing that I want to stress here,
particularly in the context like--of that

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:28.639
of Google, is that these aren't
necessarily all high tech solutions.

00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:33.579
I'm not optimistic in a cyber-utopian sense.

00:16:33.579 --> 00:16:35.040
There's not a sense of 'Okay, if we could
just

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.170
like throw the Internet at people, and get
the on their Android phones, the world would

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:40.170
be better.'

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:45.339
In fact, I think in many cases the peer
networks could work just as well in very low

00:16:45.339 --> 00:16:48.279
tech environments without a lot of technology.

00:16:48.279 --> 00:16:52.350
The Internet makes it easier to form
these kinds of structures, in part because

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:57.529
it lowers the organizational cost of forming
groups as Clay Shirky as argued over the

00:16:57.529 --> 00:16:59.290
years.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.579
But I think it's just as important to point
out that there are face-to-face, real world

00:17:02.579 --> 00:17:04.310
applications of peer networks, too.

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:06.980
And I'll
tell you just about two of them.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:11.990
One involves a great story from about fifteen
years ago.

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:22.159
A couple, Jerry and Monique Sternin were asked
by Save the Children to go

00:17:22.159 --> 00:17:28.960
and look at childhood malnutrition in the
rice paddy communities in Vietnam.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.130
And the traditional way that you deal with
this

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:36.000
problem in developing world context is you
send people over, you've got children that

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.830
aren't getting enough nourishment, and one
solution is you just take a bunch of food

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:45.850
and you're going to chopper it in and deliver
it and say, "Here, you should eat more of

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:46.850
this."

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:51.330
And then you go, which is obviously not a
sustainable solution to the problem.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:54.120
The other way is to kind of come in as an
outside expert and be like, "This is what

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.860
you should be eating, you should be doing
this more.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.990
Here's a big lecture, we're going to
try and make sure that you do this."

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:03.250
But the approach that these guys took was
that they decided actually to solve it in

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:06.530
a decidedly peer network, bottom up way.

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:10.630
They said,
"Inside this community, in the diverse set

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:15.230
of approaches to feeding your children that
exist in this extended community, there are

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:19.690
going to be people who actually have figured
out a way, given the existing conditions that

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:24.559
they live in, to have healthier, better
fed children.

00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:28.660
And so what we need to do is not come in from
the outside with a bunch of solutions or outside

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.679
set of supplies of
food, but we need to figure out within this

00:18:31.679 --> 00:18:36.440
network of people to unlock these strategies
that they've already stumbled across or

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.679
found knowingly on their own."

00:18:39.679 --> 00:18:43.600
And so the first thing they did was they went
in and they just weighed the children, right?

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.350
They just went around with scales and
went from neighborhood, community to community,

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:51.790
and figured out what are the kids who are
actually doing well, what are the kids

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:54.919
that are the least malnourished in this community.

00:18:54.919 --> 00:18:57.430
And they called these the positive deviants.

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:01.470
These were the ones that were
deviating from the norm in a positive way.

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:06.309
So they found these outliers, these positive
deviants, and then they did this kind of on

00:19:06.309 --> 00:19:11.940
the ground ethnographic-thick research where
they tried to figure out what was it about

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:16.690
the diets and the routines of these
families that were helping them to have these

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:20.760
healthier children in this particular, specific
context.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.240
And they found there were these clear recurring
patterns, one of which is that they were being

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:30.000
fed rice in small meals through out
the day rather than just a couple of big meals.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.540
Which was helping their stomach--basically
there's only so much rice a small

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.540
stomach can take in.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.420
So they were having these little incremental
snacks through the day.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:40.680
But the most important thing that the
found was that they were feeding, the positive

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:47.060
deviants were feeding their kids little crustaceans,
little shrimp, that were in the

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.540
swampy areas of the rice paddies.

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:55.610
Which had been largely seen as a "low-class"
food and most of the other families just kind

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:57.059
of
shunned that stuff and just fed their kids

00:19:57.059 --> 00:19:58.059
rice.

00:19:58.059 --> 00:20:03.700
But in fact, because there was additional
vitamins and proteins in these little

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:09.100
crustaceans, the kids were getting a much
more richer, balanced diet.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:13.740
So once they figured out what the strategies
were, which were there already in the community,

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:17.520
instead of broadcasting that to the
group, they again used the peer network structure

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.120
to spread the word.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.159
So they had the families themselves who had
adopted these

00:20:22.159 --> 00:20:28.830
kind of dietary policies, the families themselves
hosted potluck dinners for the rest of the

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:32.659
community and everybody came and they
sat, and the families that had adopted this

00:20:32.659 --> 00:20:37.940
kind of showed their peers in the community
and cooked for them.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.760
Basically gave them
the meals that they were preparing for their

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.760
kids.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:47.110
And so word spread organically, was being
pushed along and kind of amplified by

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:48.799
the outside agency.

00:20:48.799 --> 00:20:54.549
But the knowledge and the kind of gossip about
that knowledge that spread through the community

00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:57.050
spread through
the peer network itself in a kind of bottom

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:58.050
up way.

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:02.950
What they found was, there was a short term
decrease in malnutrition, but the key thing

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:08.429
was they went back a generation later, and
they saw the same positive news.

00:21:08.429 --> 00:21:10.360
It had stuck in that community.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.279
It wasn't just a one time thing.

00:21:12.279 --> 00:21:16.250
They left, came back ten-fifteen
years later and the kids were still better

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:20.330
fed and so it had become part of the kind
of habits of the community.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:24.630
The positive
deviance had become the new norm in that world.

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:29.159
So that's an example of how peer networks
can work without technology.

00:21:29.159 --> 00:21:31.230
I mean the most advanced technology they used
in that was a

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:34.080
scale, effectively, right.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:40.700
The other example, and here is where I think
the most opportunity exists for this kind

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:51.760
of social change, and this is on the level
of location and neighborhoods and local governments.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:59.640
So in the late '80s in Porto Alegre in Brazil,
a city that had had terrible

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.640
growing pains.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.770
It's gone from two hundred thousand people
to two million people in a short amount of

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:09.029
time and they had these vast
shanty towns and favelas without running water

00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:11.370
or access to a sewer or electricity.

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:14.260
So they were just a city that was really growing
at an

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.549
incredible clip and was having hard time keeping
up with it all.

00:22:17.549 --> 00:22:24.580
In 1989, they instituted this really extraordinary
approach which they called participatory budgeting.

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:27.350
And participatory budgeting
is the idea that there's a certain significant

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:35.600
slice of taxpayer dollars each year that is
held for the local communities to decide

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.950
directly how it should be spent.

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:44.490
So every year, neighborhoods around the city
get together and they have these local referendums

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:47.679
where they talk about the needs of the neighborhood,
they talk about the community, they talk about

00:22:47.679 --> 00:22:49.530
what's working and what's not
working.

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:55.590
And at the end of this process they create
a ranked list of things they want funded.

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:59.690
Whether it's bringing the sewer to
this part of the neighborhood or adding another

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:04.539
room to the schoolhouse or building a community
garden or park.

00:23:04.539 --> 00:23:09.100
And that list is
then presented to the city and the state and

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:13.760
projects get funded with a slight bias towards
neighborhoods that have less resources.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:18.330
In this system, it doesn't just go to the
wealthiest neighborhoods.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:23.779
And what the found was, almost immediately,
this approach was much more effective.

00:23:23.779 --> 00:23:25.390
It had a couple of really positive effects.

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:29.159
The
first was that it greatly reduced the amount

00:23:29.159 --> 00:23:34.710
of corruption and waste in the process because
when the neighborhood itself was

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:38.800
proposing something that they wanted built
and they had a mechanism to say, "Yes, we

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.510
want to have this playground here."

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:44.440
When that
playground didn't show up for six months or

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.039
a year, there was an immediate sense that
something was wrong.

00:23:47.039 --> 00:23:50.120
Where is if the project
had been kind of green lit by some bureaucrat

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.000
that no one ever really know, they wouldn't
have really noticed that something was

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000
missing.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.460
So it was much harder for money to just get
lost or projects to get infinitely postponed.

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:01.360
And so they saw this dramatic
increase in a whole number of metrics ,in

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.730
roads being built, or sewer pipes being connected
and so on.

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:08.419
The other thing that happened, though, was
it that created this positive feedback loop

00:24:08.419 --> 00:24:10.190
where people got involved in the process,
they

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:17.850
showed up, and were engaged in this neighborhood
referenda and from that engagement, they ended

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:20.620
up seeing results, right?

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.419
You know
six months later this thing that they wanted

00:24:22.419 --> 00:24:23.620
was actually built.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:26.831
So it created this positive feedback loop
of engagement, of people

00:24:26.831 --> 00:24:30.370
saying " Okay, I can get involved and things
will improve.

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:32.970
I'll see the results right away."

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:36.669
So participatory budgeting is now spreading
really across the world.

00:24:36.669 --> 00:24:41.289
It's in over ten percent of city budgets in
Europe, or involve

00:24:41.289 --> 00:24:46.320
significant participatory budgeting approaches
and it's now coming.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.289
There's experiments with it here in Brooklyn
and in Chicago and other

00:24:49.289 --> 00:24:50.290
cities around the U.S.

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:52.990
So it's a very powerful mode.

00:24:52.990 --> 00:25:00.650
And it's not hard to imagine how you could
take a model like that and layer a Kickstarter

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:02.460
style approach on top of it.

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.420
In fact,
there are a lot of really interesting companies

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:05.420
are starting to do this.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.580
Some of them for-profit, some of them non-profits.

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:12.929
Companies like Neighborland,Neighborly and
SeeClickFix, and the basic idea is that you

00:25:12.929 --> 00:25:15.919
say you've got this community of folks, in
a

00:25:15.919 --> 00:25:21.250
neighborhood, they know better than anybody
else, they are the true experts.

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:23.290
They know where the problems are and where
the

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:24.290
opportunities are.

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:28.549
They know what the needs are, they know what's
not working, what is working, where the little

00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:30.160
impasses are in
that community.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:35.529
And if you give them a platform, one, that
enables that peer network to identify problems

00:25:35.529 --> 00:25:42.539
and needs, and other members in the
community to vote on and rank those needs.

00:25:42.539 --> 00:25:46.600
To say, "Yes, you're right, you have pointed
out that we need another stop sign there and

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.640
I'm going to endorse that in some fashion."

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:53.020
So you have a peer network to identify the
needs of the community, then you have another

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:57.309
layer of network to propose solutions to
those problems.

00:25:57.309 --> 00:26:02.080
So there's an abandoned lot in the neighborhood,
somebody proposes building a beer garden there;

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.450
somebody proposes
paving it over; somebody proposes building

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:07.679
a condo; somebody proposes making a community
garden.

00:26:07.679 --> 00:26:13.649
All these different proposals come in and,
along the Brazilian model, people can vote

00:26:13.649 --> 00:26:16.010
on those proposals.

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:17.570
Maybe even fund them directly.

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:20.490
Maybe it's a Kickstarter model where
they say "Yes, I would like to see that and

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:22.299
here's one hundred dollars to contribute to
it."

00:26:22.299 --> 00:26:26.809
Maybe they have voucher-like
economics where they have a certain slice

00:26:26.809 --> 00:26:30.090
of their taxes that they are paying into the
city that they can allocate towards projects

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:35.090
that they want to support or want to be a
part of.

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:40.490
And so you have this layered peer networks
here where both the identification and the

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:44.320
solving of the problem are created by the
community itself.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:48.780
Some cases there may be cities involved in
that process; in some cases there may be private

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:50.510
sector forces involved in that process.

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:52.630
Some cases it may be just local communities.

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:56.170
One of my favorite stories actually, that's
not in the book that I just came across the

00:26:56.170 --> 00:27:02.169
other day, is this story about this guy,
Mark Lakeman in Portland who lived in Oregon

00:27:02.169 --> 00:27:05.919
in this semi-anonymous residential street
in Portland.

00:27:05.919 --> 00:27:09.120
I think it's the intersection
of Sherritt Street and Ninth Street, I think

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.520
it was.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:14.150
And he lived there for a few years and it
was just a classic residential

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:18.270
street where there's an intersection where
nothing ever happened and, you know, just

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:20.840
kind of owned by the cars.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:25.830
And he went on this trip, actually to Central
America, and he came back and realized that

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:31.169
throughout human history and particularly
in these traditional societies, crossroads

00:27:31.169 --> 00:27:34.890
were a core location of civic culture.

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:36.610
Where streets came together, that was where
a

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:41.000
community would gather and do interesting
things and where there was this strong tradition

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.240
of civic bonding that would happen.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.860
And he
looked out at the intersection by his house

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:45.860
and there was nothing.

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:46.860
It was dead.

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:50.000
And so he said, "How can we make this space
more

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000
interesting?

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.280
How can we create a community and something
distinctive about this otherwise generic intersection?"

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.510
And so he decided the first thing to do was
to paint it.

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:04.360
He wanted to create this very elaborate, you
know, intersection wide, even slightly larger,

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.630
maybe
slightly psychedelic painting.

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:08.710
He got his neighbors on board, he said, "I
think it'll be great.

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:10.309
I think it will
make this--.

00:28:10.309 --> 00:28:11.309
It'll be a space.

00:28:11.309 --> 00:28:13.960
It will have some definition to it."

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:17.700
And he went to the city of Portland and initially
went to the

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.959
transportation department and they were like,
"You can't do that."

00:28:19.959 --> 00:28:23.470
And they actually said, "That's not allowed.

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:24.590
That's public
space.

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:25.740
No one can use it."

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.350
That was the quote.

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:30.730
Nice and Orwellian.

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:34.980
And so, he finally got the attention of the
mayor's office and they actually got excited

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:36.260
about it and so they built this thing.

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:40.590
They ended up starting to call it "Share-it"
square, as in sharing, rather than Sherritt

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:42.260
which was spelled with an 'E'.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.490
And after
building this thing, it became this little

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:49.559
gathering place and and they created a little
solar powered twenty-four hour tea station

00:28:49.559 --> 00:28:50.630
so you could get a little tea.

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:54.019
And they created a little lending library
where people could drop off books and pick

00:28:54.019 --> 00:28:57.320
up books and a
few other, a classic Portland, Oregon kind

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.580
of story.

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.640
And all of a sudden all these other intersections
around the city, and then in

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.840
Seattle and then in other places started to
be inspired by that and they started creating

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:09.279
this thing called, with this little
manual called "Intersection Repair."

00:29:09.279 --> 00:29:14.630
It was how to take this dead thing that you
live next to and turn it into something that

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.690
the
community actually owned and felt like they

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:18.490
had some identity there.

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:20.690
And now they have this whole organization
called "City Repair"

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:22.260
that's encouraging things like that.

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:28.850
So that kind of model of allowing people at
the local level to solve those problems and

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:33.360
giving them tools, sometimes just a manual
of how to do it and how to get through the

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:38.179
bureaucratic system to make those changes
and sometimes actual technology platforms

00:29:38.179 --> 00:29:40.419
to
let people do this.

00:29:40.419 --> 00:29:42.550
This is a great opportunity.

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:47.440
This is tremendous opportunity and I think
we have now in the culture an awareness

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:52.260
that those kinds of participatory, bottoms
up, peer networks can work.

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:54.679
People are willing to try things now because
of the success

00:29:54.679 --> 00:29:58.809
that we can point to with things like the
Internet, and the Web, and Wikipedia, and

00:29:58.809 --> 00:30:00.279
Kickstarter.

00:30:00.279 --> 00:30:05.070
So that part of the landscape I find really
enthusiastic, really you know inspiring and

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:08.880
exciting and there are a million different
projects that are working in that way.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:17.760
The final rung in the argument then is, if
you believe in these things, if you believe

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:24.140
in the power of these kinds of new
institutions, then where does that put you

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:25.990
on the political spectrum?

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:28.670
It's kind of where we began.

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:32.419
You know, I think people who
believe in the power of these systems take

00:30:32.419 --> 00:30:37.250
very seriously the libertarian idea that was
first and most powerfully formulated by

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:43.110
Hayek which was that decentralized systems
in the long run will outperform centralized

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:44.690
systems.

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:52.070
The world is so complex, society is so complex,
the economy is so complex that no small group

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:57.450
of planners or generals or people in
charge of the whole thing can possibly understand

00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:02.940
the complexity of that universe and so systems
like marketplaces tend to work better

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:06.919
because each participant in the marketplace
doesn’t have to understand the whole.

00:31:06.919 --> 00:31:09.820
You don't have to have that kind of information
bottleneck where you have to condense the

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:13.149
whole thing down to something that a small
group of people can understand.

00:31:13.149 --> 00:31:15.630
All the
marketplace needs is individuals looking at

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:20.250
some part of the society, some part of the
economy, and if you create a system that

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:24.269
allows exchange and cooperation and competition
between all those different agents, you'll

00:31:24.269 --> 00:31:30.000
end up being much more effective than
this bottleneck of the state or central planners.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:37.040
So on the one hand, I think that folks who
are championing these kinds of systems take

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:41.221
that critique very seriously but they aren't
libertarian in that they don't think that

00:31:41.221 --> 00:31:46.260
the market solves all the problems in the
world and there are many things in society

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:49.140
that we need
non-market forces to help us solve.

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:54.580
And there are many cases where non-market
agencies and collaborative structures than

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:57.139
can do
better than the market.

00:31:57.139 --> 00:32:02.470
History of the Internet and the Web and so
many of the technologies that we rely on is

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:05.929
the most articulate
case for that.

00:32:05.929 --> 00:32:11.090
So these folks who believe in that kind of
progressive tradition and community building

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:15.940
and bottom up and believe in that --at the
same time-- that kind of Hayek influenced

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:17.990
belief in the power of decentralization.

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:19.110
Who are these people?

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:22.649
They're not big government
people; they're not big capital people.

00:32:22.649 --> 00:32:25.990
So in the book I'm starting to call these
people peer progressives.

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:28.930
And they are folks
that are working outside the traditions of

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:33.500
the left and the right, but I think they've
got a building track record right now that

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:39.070
is actually generating results that we can
point to and say this kind of approach actually

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:40.070
works.

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:47.550
I'll leave you, we can open up to conversation,
but I'll tell you just one story that may

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:55.130
be my favorite story of the whole book,
which took place right here in this neighborhood

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:59.420
and is an example of how a government agency
can work with a peer network to

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:07.419
actually solve problems in cities and involves
the incredible 311 service that the city has

00:33:07.419 --> 00:33:09.559
pioneered here.

00:33:09.559 --> 00:33:12.610
There's 311 in many
cities around the country but no one does

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:15.940
it better than New York.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:17.779
It's one of Bloomberg's big projects.

00:33:17.779 --> 00:33:21.860
It's what happens when you
have a nerd mayor, you get things like 311.

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:27.630
But 311 is absolutely one of the great advances
in urban living and civic culture that

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:29.890
we've seen in the last decade or two.

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:33.519
So as most of you, 311 works on a couple levels.

00:33:33.519 --> 00:33:41.090
311 takes call volume off of 911 so you can
call 311 if there's a, you know, a

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:44.730
problem that the authorities should know about
but it's not a life or death emergency.

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:49.350
So if someone breaks into your house, you
still call 911 but if there's like a homeless

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:53.280
person asleep by a playground, well, then
you can call 311.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.870
So it reduces call volume
on 911, which is helpful.

00:33:56.870 --> 00:34:01.330
But the big thing is it functions as an information
concierge for the city, right?

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:06.700
So anybody can call in and say, "Hey, are
schools closed today?

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:07.970
Is it alternate side parking?

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:09.550
I need a battered women's shelter.

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:13.010
I'm looking for a kids' event in Prospect
Park."

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:15.950
And they'll get a live human being in thirty
seconds.

00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:21.890
They speak over a hundred and eighty languages,
not one person.

00:34:21.890 --> 00:34:25.160
They
all speak, some of them speak some languages,

00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:26.550
others speak others.

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:29.100
And they know the answers to kind of, they
figured out

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:33.410
ninety-five percent of the questions are actually
a small subset of potential questions so they

00:34:33.410 --> 00:34:35.560
have a lot of the answers pre-canned.

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:39.660
But they can get you to people who know the
answers throughout the government infrastructure

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:40.660
as well.

00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:43.210
So you get a human being and
they've done all this quality testing on the

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:46.810
call centers and they actually perform--.

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:51.240
They have the customer satisfaction at its
very top and the only thing that is competitive

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:55.540
with them are high end hotel chains in terms
of customer service, in terms of a

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:58.080
call center.

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:02.530
They greatly outperform other government institutions
like the IRS.

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:04.810
If you call the IRS, they don't do nearly
as good

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:08.810
a job; and at the bottom of the list in terms
of call center customer satisfaction are the

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:10.350
cable companies.

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:13.620
So you actually have a
government agency that is responding to customers

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:14.620
in this way.

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:20.850
But here's the big thing: every question and
observation and data point that comes in through

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:26.300
311 is being tagged, and geotagged
and mapped and categorized by the city.

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:30.780
So people can call in and report potholes,
as Bloomberg apparently likes to do, and they

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:34.730
can come in and complain about a bar down
the street that is making too much noise and

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:38.721
all those complaints and requests and all
those questions gets tagged and mapped.

00:35:38.721 --> 00:35:46.850
So the city has this constantly adapting dashboard
that shows them the needs of a vast city of

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:48.310
eight million people.

00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:53.210
This is classic information overload problem,
how do you figure out where the problems are

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:54.970
in a city that big?

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:57.331
And the old way of
doing it would be like, okay, you would hire

00:35:57.331 --> 00:36:00.110
a bunch of experts that would be on the city
payroll that would go out and look for

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:03.740
potholes and look for problems and report
back to headquarters.

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:07.370
In the new model, in the peer network model,
you deputize anyone

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:11.720
who can dial three numbers on a phone and
allow them to be part of this process.

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:15.230
You greatly decentralize and diversify the
number

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:19.850
of people involved in this problem solving
routine, again, very similar to the insight

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:21.720
of page rank.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.940
Don't hire a bunch of
archivists and librarians to organize the

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:27.930
Internet, let anybody who can organize the
Internet by just linking from one site to

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:31.260
another be part of this process.

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:32.660
And it's been a huge success.

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:35.750
The city is much more responsive to these
needs.

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:37.190
And there've been, they've fielded over a
hundred

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:38.710
million calls.

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:39.710
It just works.

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:43.660
And it's you know, been created by government
so it's not that the government is, you know,

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:45.630
should be rendered
obsolete by these systems.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:47.859
But what the government is doing is saying,
"No, no, no.

00:36:47.859 --> 00:36:49.610
We want to create networks that allow far
more

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:52.300
people to be part of this process."

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:56.760
And this best case study of this [chuckles]
happened right here, and I experienced it

00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:00.460
first hand many years ago walking around this
neighborhood.

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:05.241
It was this very bizarre thing where every
now again certain neighborhoods on the west

00:37:05.241 --> 00:37:08.640
side of Manhattan would smell like maple syrup
and you'd be

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.690
walking down the street in the West Village.

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:14.850
All of a sudden you'd be like, "Oh my God,
it smells like pancakes.

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:15.860
What is going on?"

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:18.210
And you'd
walk for blocks and blocks and there's be

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:21.360
the total saturated smell of maple syrup.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.090
This started around 2004.

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:28.670
And you know it's
post-9/11 New York, people are nervous about

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:30.490
this kind of thing.

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:32.980
They're worried it's like a chemical attack
or something like

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:37.060
that, so you know from like the Aunt Jemima
wing of Al Qaeda.

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:40.920
[laughter]And so they're, they start calling
it in 311.

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.421
311 had just
started just about a year before, so they're

00:37:43.421 --> 00:37:48.260
calling into 311 and like, "It smells like
pancakes in Chelsea.

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:49.400
What's going on?"

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:53.120
And
so the city sent out inspectors to test the

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:57.300
air and the air was fine and safe and so they
encouraged people--.

00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:01.480
They told the 311
operators if people call in tell them it's

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:04.260
fine, they should enjoy the smell, it's not
going to hurt them.

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:05.260
But it kept happening.

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:08.580
And The Times wrote about it and local bloggers
wrote about it.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.480
And it would happen every couple of months
in

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.660
a slightly different neighborhood but all
on the West Side.

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:19.590
And it became so common [laughter] an occurrence
that inside the 311, the city

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:25.351
began calling these things "Maple Syrup Events",
capitol "M", Capital "S", Capital "E" which

00:38:25.351 --> 00:38:29.650
is like the worst thriller you've ever
gone to, you know, 'The Maple Syrup Event.'

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:35.680
And they, so they, it kept happening and then
finally years later, someone inside 311

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:40.150
said, "Wait a second, all these calls that
we've been getting over the years, these are

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:41.150
clues.

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:42.150
Right?

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:44.140
They're not just people
freaking out about terrorists.

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.180
They're clues.

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:49.330
We can solve this riddle of where these smells
are coming from."

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:50.600
And so they went back.

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:55.100
They had all the data roughly in terms of
neighborhoods of where the calls where coming

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:59.390
from in past MSEs
and they instructed their operators when the

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:05.430
next one erupted to get exact geo-coordinates,
like cross streets of where the callers

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:07.300
were coming from.

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:14.050
And they aggregated all this data and when
they built into the model the prevailing wind

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:18.110
patterns for each day
that the MSE had happened, it created this

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:24.310
incredibly clear vector that just pointed
back to this one location in New Jersey.

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:25.390
The
smells were coming from New Jersey.

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:29.600
[laughs] I'm not saying they were bad smells
they just were coming from New Jersey.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:32.790
And so they literally saw this point on the
map and [laughs] they drove their van across

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:39.400
the bridge and went to this point in New Jersey
where they found that there was a artificial

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:47.120
flavor and scent plant that every now and
then would process the fenugreek seed which

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.510
used in many cuisines in the world.

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:52.660
But in the U.S. supermarket you're most likely
to find it on the shelf where they sell cheap

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:56.590
maple syrup knockoffs.

00:39:56.590 --> 00:40:00.530
My love about this story is, yes, it was not
a chemical attack.

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:02.960
It was not a life or death matter.

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:10.070
But when they were designing
311, nobody said the other thing the service

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:14.180
should be good at was if there's a syrupy
smell in Manhattan [laughter] we should be

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:16.970
able to use
it to trace the origins of it.

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:24.040
But because the system was this decentralized,
diverse peer network, because it allowed anyone

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.180
on the
street who was experiencing something, they

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:30.030
had a mechanism to report it and there was
a mechanism for looking at all that data and

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:31.210
analyzing all that data.

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:36.920
The system turned out to be extremely good
at both noticing this problem and ultimately

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:40.020
solving the
mystery of where it came from.

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:44.600
And that, I think, is the great power of these
kinds of systems and it's something we've

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:47.000
seen again and again and again in the
technology world.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.690
When you invite more people to participate
in the process --what Tim O'Reilly calls the

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:55.130
architecture of
participation-- and you have more kind of

00:40:55.130 --> 00:41:00.210
diverse groups of people participating in
the process and you give all those individuals

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:03.000
a
voice.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.760
And you give them a platform where they can
point out what it is bothering them, whether

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:09.930
it's is a serious urban crisis or
whether it’s maple syrup smell.

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:15.700
In the long run, those systems are not just
kind of touchy feely nice because everyone

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:19.320
gets a
voice, in the long run they will out perform

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.910
the alternatives.

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:24.790
And one of the ways they out perform is by
coming up with new solutions or observing

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:28.030
new problems that the original creators never
dreamed of.

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:32.900
That's where they get this kind of extraordinary
innovative power that can solve problems that

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:34.950
we didn't even know we
were going to have to solve when we were designing

00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:36.830
the service in the first place.

00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:42.340
And so, when you have, you know, government
sponsored institutions, in general, like city

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:46.650
governments have not been a hot bed of
innovation over the course of the last century.

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:52.200
But when we have examples to point to, like
311, and we have examples to point to

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:56.990
from either the private sector, like Kickstarter
or that sort of middle zone like so much of

00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:03.160
the technology that we use today,
neither private sector nor government created,

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:07.200
I think it makes a very good case that we're
on to something.

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:10.500
And that there is
really a new opportunity here, inspired by

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:15.390
the Internet, sometimes using the Internet,
sometimes using technology but most using

00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:17.360
this way of organizing the world.

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:23.180
So, I hope with this book, this book is just
designed very explicitly to be the start of

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:24.220
something.

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:26.270
It's a fun book to write
because it's in a sense a book about something

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:28.030
that hasn't fully happened yet.

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:30.060
There's a lot of stories in it.

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:33.770
It's driven by
narrative so it's not a book about abstract

00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:34.980
political theory.

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:38.170
But I mostly wrote it to be short and timely
and get it out there

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:42.700
because I wanted to capture what I saw happening
around me, but mostly I wanted it to be it's

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:45.060
own little platform.

00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:48.530
And my dream for
this project is that folks will read it and

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:53.310
then three or four years from now I'll hear
somebody say, "Oh, I used that idea and

00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:55.891
that platform and that way of looking at the
world to solve this other problem," which

00:42:55.891 --> 00:42:57.520
had not occurred to me at all.

00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:03.120
That will be the sign of its success is if
it actually triggers things that were not

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.150
actually part of my blueprint at all.

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:06.430
So if
you can be one of those people, if Google

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:10.020
can be one of those organizations, that would
make me incredibly happy and thank you

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:14.760
again for having me come visit.

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:16.830
Appreciate it.

00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:17.870
[Applause]

00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:22.520
So if there are any questions, I think probably
people will want to go to the microphone,

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.520
right?

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:25.300
Because this is being recorded, so
if anyone has.

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:32.310
And by the way I am very happy to hear other
stories from your experience, or inside or

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:37.050
outside of Google that
resonate with what I've been talking about

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:38.420
instead of just a question.

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:41.120
Or you can just tell me stories about your
own personal

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.160
life, uh, if you'd like as well.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.160
[Laughter]

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.160
Yes?

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:47.000
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Hello, [clears throat] thanks for
being here, I don't have a story about my

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000
personal life--

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.020
&gt;&gt;Stephen Johnson: Please.

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:57.210
&gt;&gt;Male #1: But I'm curious on your thoughts
around sort of the risks of imperfect or flawed

00:43:57.210 --> 00:43:58.210
platforms.

00:43:58.210 --> 00:44:02.240
The Kickstarter example
is a good one because it's been in the news

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:07.070
a lot recently, well, it's been on the 'Internet
news" a lot recently--

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:08.070
&gt;&gt;Stephen Johnson: Yeah.

00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:09.310
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Where they've made some changes
to the way they are sort of allowing programs

00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:10.960
into the platform.

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:13.780
So you can use
that specific example or I mean, if there's

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:17.240
other examples that you've sort of encountered
where good intentions can lead us astray.

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:20.790
I mean, it's something that we kind of keep
in the back of our minds, I think, at Google

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:22.660
because we are building these
platforms--[fades out]

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:23.660
&gt;&gt;Steve Johnson: Yeah.

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:31.050
It's a great question and I do try and talk
about this a little bit in the book, although

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:36.350
I'm also trying to
be you know provocatively utopian in what

00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:40.400
the book is saying because I feel like we
need a little bit of that right now.

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.200
It's not
as though you set up a decentralized network

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:46.880
and let everybody participate and you're golden,
right?

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:52.850
I mean what happens when you
create much more diverse unplanned networks

00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:58.500
is it introduces, by definition, it introduces
more noise and chaos into the system.

00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:01.410
The
beautiful thing about perfectly planned environments

00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:02.860
is they're very controlled.

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:05.990
They may be nightmares, but they don't have
that

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:11.200
kind of ragged noisiness and when you open
up a platform to anybody that means it is

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:18.280
filled with all sorts of cranks, and people
with an agenda, and scam artists, and people

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:21.420
who are trying to abuse the system in one
way or another, or people who are just wrong

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:25.750
and misguided in their views [laughter] and
trying to steer with good intentions in the

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:28.040
wrong way, right?

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:33.460
So to that I think you have to take that seriously
and that means you have to design the architecture

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:37.960
of these things so they
subdue that as much as possible.

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:41.350
And this is exactly what Kickstarter is trying
to do right now.

00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:44.040
They're an experiment and they're
constantly going to be tweaking things just

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:50.060
as Google has been tweaking page rank to deal
with people trying to exploit it from

00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:52.000
almost day one.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.880
It's an inevitable part of the process.

00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:02.130
The two things I've been saying to people
when this comes up are:

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:06.150
One, these are also the objections people
make about democracies, right?

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:10.430
We've decided, in general, most of us around
the world,

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:15.880
that despite the fact that democracies open
up the voting process to cranks and scam artists

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.410
and people who are just wrong.

00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:20.090
That in
the long run they're better than these other

00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:24.820
systems because they involve a much more diverse
make up of decision makers that

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:27.020
better represent the needs of the overall
population.

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:31.590
And so it doesn't mean that democracies work
the second you set them up and

00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:33.870
you have to be constantly tinkering with them.

00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:36.390
The other example, I think, is Wikipedia,
right?

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:43.330
This is one of the places where the media
has been--you know I think they've skewed

00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:47.990
things by focusing disproportionally on the
places where Wikipedia fails.

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:52.620
In the book I say it's a bit like aviation
history right?

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:59.130
The news with the aviation should be the astonishingly
large number, high percentage of flights that

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:03.760
you know take off and land
with perfect safety, rather than the plane

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:04.760
crash.

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.940
But, of course, we cover the plane crash;
same thing with Wikipedia.

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:10.380
Incredible
news every day should be this thing works

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:12.200
99.9 percent of the time.

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.731
[laughs] It's amazing that it works, and yes
every now and then, there

00:47:15.731 --> 00:47:21.110
are articles where someone has abused that
platform, said something libelous, said something

00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:28.140
insane, but, they've, overtime, built this
ind of social architecture that encourages

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:31.420
more truth and less falsehoods.

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:36.430
[chuckles] And it, the system kind of trends
toward more

00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:41.910
accuracy despite it having any traditional
top down experts deciding things.

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:46.740
So each problem, each network is gonna be
unique.

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:51.210
The problem of a neighborhood self-organizing
and creating a peer network to solve its needs

00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:58.240
is probably going to be different from a global
encyclopedia, but I think there are probably

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:02.690
some common threads that we can
learn, best practices that we can apply that

00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:04.350
deal with those problems.

00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:07.980
But it does involve a certain lack of control
and a certain

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:13.600
increase in noise and unpredictability to
the system for sure.

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:18.360
But I think we've gotten smart enough to figure
out ways around some of those

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:19.360
problems.

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:20.360
Yes?

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:24.220
&gt;&gt;Male #2: It's interesting when you talk
about peer based networks and there's a difference

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:27.920
between the way Kickstarter
works and the way Wikipedia works.

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:32.860
And that's to me in the term of authorship,
ownership and credit, so recognition that

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:34.560
I did this
project.

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:36.820
Wikipedia doesn't seem to have that.

00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:41.190
You don't take pride in saying, 'I edited
that', it's just for you to enjoy.

00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:43.570
And similar
behavior comes in when you think about Internet

00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:44.570
memes.

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:47.940
So I made an Internet meme of a hipster kitty,
I laugh at it.

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:50.790
I don't expect
the world to know that I made it.

00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:53.580
But that's not the model with Kickstarter
where there's abs--.

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:57.070
There's two kinds of recognition, there's
one of the artist or the maker who

00:48:57.070 --> 00:48:59.220
says, "I made this project, give me the money.

00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:01.340
If I get the money, I'm going to make it."

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:06.260
Then you go and there's this social
cachet that you get, "I backed this gaming

00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:08.080
console and so I'm great."

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:12.110
So what to you think is the balance of that
and where do

00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:14.580
you see that heading, especially when it comes
to governments and things like that?

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:19.490
&gt;&gt;Steve Johnson: Yeah, that's a really good
important observation which I didn't fully

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:21.740
address in the book.

00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:25.911
You know, the common
theme to that is this idea again which again

00:49:25.911 --> 00:49:33.660
is not news since inside of Google is that
people will be motivated by a much wider

00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:38.430
range of rewards than traditional economics
believes.

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:41.750
You know, Dan Pink has written about this
a little bit in Drive.

00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:43.740
And
sometimes when you offer money you get less

00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:44.740
motivation.

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:46.540
People are like, "No, I want esteem.

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:51.910
I want the recognition of my peers,"
for instance, to use the word peer again can

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:53.860
be a big driver.

00:49:53.860 --> 00:50:04.800
So what all these systems have showed us in
real, vivid, practical success stories is

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:11.500
that the tools that are available, the
rewards that are available to incentivize

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:12.620
people to participate are--.

00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:16.310
There's a much wider range.

00:50:16.310 --> 00:50:22.840
Everything from "we'll give you
two dollars" to "you will silently know that

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:27.970
you made this entry on Wikipedia about the
Challenger explosion slightly better by

00:50:27.970 --> 00:50:29.610
fixing that one sentence."

00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:32.540
[ chuckles] And you'll have that personal
sense of it.

00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:39.800
I, to me, I think, the amazing thing about
Wikipedia is that it works as well as it does

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:43.450
with so little recognition.

00:50:43.450 --> 00:50:46.220
You know, I
think probably with Kickstarter, they wanted

00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:52.120
to--and it may partially be because Kickstarter
is a site that started post-Facebook

00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:58.270
and Twitter, where Wikipedia predates all
of that, so they went into it assuming that

00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:03.960
all your activities would be amplified and
shared in some kind of public way and you

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:08.690
could use that “Hey, I just backed this
project on Kickstarter, aren't I awesome?"

00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:10.370
to
incentivize people to back more projects on

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:12.990
Kickstarter.

00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:15.560
And it would be very interesting to see what
would have happened--.

00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:19.030
It's kind of a cool thought experiment, it's
not really run

00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:21.761
through in my head so I don't have the answer,
what Wikipedia would have looked like had

00:51:21.761 --> 00:51:25.310
it been created post Facebook and Twitter.

00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:32.220
So, it does kind of amaze me that Wikipedia
gets as much participation as it does given

00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:35.910
that the reward is so genuinely slight.

00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:38.680
Any others?

00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:49.050
&gt;&gt;Male #3: So, in this peer based model, where
do you see experts?

00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:50.050
What's their role?

00:51:50.050 --> 00:51:51.090
Is it different?

00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:54.811
Or is it, well, I'll
let you answer.

00:51:54.811 --> 00:51:55.811
&gt;&gt;Steve Johnson: Yeah.

00:51:55.811 --> 00:51:57.820
I think there is a role for experts.

00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:03.510
Look, you know, I want to be disingenuous
about this.

00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:07.820
I didn't crowd
source the book, I wrote it as an individual

00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:09.020
author.

00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:14.610
And it is a book that is very much connective
and it's drawing upon ideas and

00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:20.320
projects that have inspired me and part of
what I do is just relay that news in the book.

00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:25.320
But I still feel that books happen to be
a form that generally work better if there

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:29.500
is one author than other forms.

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:34.220
So there are cases where individuals with
a certain

00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:39.820
message, particularly a structure of an argument
or storytelling form generally --for complicated

00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:42.240
reasons that I don't totally have
an answer for-- generally have worked better

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:44.890
with one person doing it than with a crowd
doing it.

00:52:44.890 --> 00:52:46.870
So it's not that the crowd can
solve everything.

00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:50.770
And in terms of experts, what I think has
started happening, and I think this is one

00:52:50.770 --> 00:52:57.021
of the things been an enduring success of
what we used to

00:52:57.021 --> 00:53:09.370
call the "blogosphere" [laughs] is actually
again extending the realm of expertise.

00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:13.200
You know I notice this a lot in the financial
crises.

00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:18.040
And I wrote about this a little bit in the
book, leading up the election in 2008.

00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:24.030
That one of the things that was there
then that wasn't there for instance when there

00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:27.960
was the recession before Clinton was elected,
and there was a lot of talk about

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:31.720
politics and how either party were going to
fix the economy.

00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:35.370
You had a certain number of experts that would
show up on the pages of the Wall Street Journal,

00:53:35.370 --> 00:53:39.650
or the pages of The New York Times, the Op
Ed pages and you had a political class of

00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:44.470
pundits who would talk about these issues
on CNN or something like that.

00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:48.710
But by 2008, you had
this amazing new caste in the middle there

00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:54.560
of academics actually, economists who were
working at schools who were actually trained

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:59.660
in the field who were not necessarily pundits,
who were not going to go on these shows, but

00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:03.260
had an extraordinary amount of
expertise, actually more expertise than most

00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:05.470
of the people who'd been on television before.

00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:12.610
Who now, thanks to blogging, were able
to kind of weigh in on all these topics and

00:54:12.610 --> 00:54:16.180
give us both some guidance and interpretation
from that kind of point of view without

00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:20.740
having to fight their way onto the Op Ed page
of The New York Times.

00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:25.700
And it's not that the experts were gone, it
wasn't that we

00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:32.270
were like, “Okay, crowd, decide whether
the Bush, I mean , McCain plan or the Obama

00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:33.980
plan is better for getting out of this mess
or

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:35.950
explain why Lehman Brothers collapsed."

00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:38.130
The crowd is not going to answer that.

00:54:38.130 --> 00:54:46.230
But what we have now is a much wider pool
of those informed experts to draw upon and

00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:52.900
that's what, and again, that's a place where,
you know, blogging seems so passé now.

00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:58.470
But you go to a good blogger who's a great
curator of interesting links to things and

00:54:58.470 --> 00:55:00.980
you
can sit down with them and see something they've

00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:04.900
put together of all these econo-bloggers who
are out there writing about these

00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:06.220
issues.

00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:11.280
That's an incredible resource that we just
did not have ten or fifteen years ago, and

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:16.060
it's in part because it's amplifying
the voices of experts but it's created a much

00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:18.340
bigger pool of experts.

00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:21.510
All right.

00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:26.570
Thank you so much for visiting and I'm happy
to sign books and I really appreciate you

00:55:26.570 --> 00:55:27.570
guys coming out.

00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:28.570
Appreciate it.

00:55:28.570 --> 00:55:28.571
[Applause]
