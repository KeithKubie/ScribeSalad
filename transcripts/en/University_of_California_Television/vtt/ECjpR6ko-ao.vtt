00:00:09.452 --> 00:00:12.451
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:14.951
Bipedal, naked, large-brained,

00:00:17.582 --> 00:00:21.751
long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:26.000
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.326
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.326 --> 00:00:31.409
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.652 --> 00:00:34.970
We grow up slowly,

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.610
we hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.693
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:41.036 --> 00:00:42.670
We shape the future from our

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.420
shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.386 --> 00:00:50.324
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.324 --> 00:00:54.491
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.984
An exploration made
possible by the generosity

00:00:58.984 --> 00:01:00.567
of humans like you.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.290
(upbeat thoughtful music)

00:01:35.211 --> 00:01:38.926
- So why is a geneticist interested in

00:01:38.926 --> 00:01:42.328
something like language,
something that we learn?

00:01:42.328 --> 00:01:44.907
To answer this question,
I'm gonna hand over to

00:01:44.907 --> 00:01:47.825
somebody who's much
more eloquent than I am,

00:01:47.825 --> 00:01:51.485
and it's this fellow here, Charles Darwin.

00:01:51.485 --> 00:01:55.014
Almost 150 years ago he really summed up

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:57.360
what's amazing and
remarkable about language.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.136
He said, "Language is an
art, like brewing or baking.

00:02:01.136 --> 00:02:03.164
"It certainly is not a true instinct,

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:05.201
"for every language has to be learnt.

00:02:05.201 --> 00:02:07.596
"It differs widely from all ordinary arts,

00:02:07.596 --> 00:02:10.516
"for man has an instinctive
tendency to speak,

00:02:10.516 --> 00:02:13.193
"as we see in the babble
of our young children,

00:02:13.193 --> 00:02:15.526
"while no child has an
instinctive tendency

00:02:15.526 --> 00:02:16.813
(audience laughs)

00:02:16.813 --> 00:02:19.296
"to brew, bake, or write."

00:02:19.296 --> 00:02:21.761
This really beautifully captures

00:02:21.761 --> 00:02:23.857
something strange about language.

00:02:23.857 --> 00:02:26.495
And let's dig into this a little bit more.

00:02:26.495 --> 00:02:29.922
By the time a child is
only a few years of age,

00:02:29.922 --> 00:02:33.270
they've already assembled a vocabulary of

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.853
thousands of words.

00:02:36.776 --> 00:02:40.166
They can assemble these
words into a potentially

00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:42.280
limitless number of meaningful sentences

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.498
using grammatical rules, and
these meaningful sentences

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:47.778
can relate not only to the present,

00:02:47.778 --> 00:02:52.458
but also the past, the future,
even abstract concepts.

00:02:52.458 --> 00:02:55.865
And then something that we
take completely for granted,

00:02:55.865 --> 00:02:57.950
but is really extraordinary,

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.566
is the ability that a child learns

00:03:01.566 --> 00:03:04.074
to take the thoughts that are
sitting inside their heads

00:03:04.074 --> 00:03:07.056
and convert them into streams of sound

00:03:07.056 --> 00:03:10.414
by the most incredible
feat of motor control,

00:03:10.414 --> 00:03:13.164
the articulatory functions moving

00:03:14.264 --> 00:03:18.109
the muscles that control
the face, the jaw,

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.186
the larynx, in this rapid kind of dance

00:03:22.186 --> 00:03:23.957
of motor function that converts

00:03:23.957 --> 00:03:26.353
thoughts into streams of sound.

00:03:26.353 --> 00:03:30.053
And then another child's
ears can do an amazing thing,

00:03:30.053 --> 00:03:32.274
which is to kind of
reverse engineer, decode,

00:03:32.274 --> 00:03:34.830
this stream of sound, reverse engineer it,

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.645
figure out what the original thought was,

00:03:36.645 --> 00:03:38.593
and come to their own conclusions.

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:39.927
(audience laughs)

00:03:39.927 --> 00:03:42.117
All these different things that happen

00:03:42.117 --> 00:03:44.803
in the first few years of life,

00:03:44.803 --> 00:03:47.717
a child can develop this suite of skills

00:03:47.717 --> 00:03:50.351
without needing any
kind of formal tuition.

00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:53.530
So in a way that seems
very, almost magical.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.917
And it's a complicated
set of different things

00:03:55.917 --> 00:03:58.263
that go towards being able
to become a proficient

00:03:58.263 --> 00:04:00.738
speech and language user.

00:04:00.738 --> 00:04:03.320
So how do we explain this?

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.897
And people have speculated
that there might be

00:04:04.897 --> 00:04:07.970
something important in our genes.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.070
Now importantly here, this is actually

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.817
a great example, a perfect example, of

00:04:13.817 --> 00:04:17.855
interaction between genes and environment.

00:04:17.855 --> 00:04:20.203
And this is obvious to you
as soon as you think about

00:04:20.203 --> 00:04:23.286
the fact that a child who grows up in

00:04:24.552 --> 00:04:26.351
the Netherlands surrounded
by Dutch speakers

00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:27.507
will learn to speak Dutch.

00:04:27.507 --> 00:04:29.668
That same child growing up in Japan,

00:04:29.668 --> 00:04:31.251
surrounded by Japanese speakers,

00:04:31.251 --> 00:04:33.079
will learn to speak Japanese.

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:35.784
And a child who is not exposed to language

00:04:35.784 --> 00:04:39.022
will never become a language user.

00:04:39.022 --> 00:04:42.855
So there's this incredible
interaction between

00:04:44.328 --> 00:04:45.639
genetics and environment.

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.443
But there's something in
the genes that seems to

00:04:48.443 --> 00:04:50.681
predispose us to soak up language

00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:54.546
from the environment
around us in early life.

00:04:54.546 --> 00:04:57.527
Now not every child, unfortunately,

00:04:57.527 --> 00:05:00.732
when exposed to language,
becomes as proficient

00:05:00.732 --> 00:05:02.809
as this young lady here, for example.

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:05.441
So there are some kids who
are exposed to language

00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:07.175
and have language-rich environments,

00:05:07.175 --> 00:05:11.282
but they fail to become
proficient language users.

00:05:11.282 --> 00:05:13.261
And in some cases there
might be a reason for this

00:05:13.261 --> 00:05:16.186
like they have a physical
problem, they're deaf,

00:05:16.186 --> 00:05:19.692
or they have some kind of
general cognitive problem.

00:05:19.692 --> 00:05:21.658
And in some cases there are actually kids

00:05:21.658 --> 00:05:23.533
that fail to learn language
and it's a mystery,

00:05:23.533 --> 00:05:26.192
and we don't know why.

00:05:26.192 --> 00:05:27.909
It was noticed very early on when people

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:31.857
started studying these kind of disorders

00:05:31.857 --> 00:05:35.040
that these cases clustered in families.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.526
So if you have a relative with a problem

00:05:37.526 --> 00:05:38.872
with development of speech and language,

00:05:38.872 --> 00:05:41.796
that dramatically increases your risk.

00:05:41.796 --> 00:05:45.528
Now this kind of familial
clustering could in fact

00:05:45.528 --> 00:05:47.507
relate to something
like shared environment,

00:05:47.507 --> 00:05:49.493
for example, in a family.

00:05:49.493 --> 00:05:52.996
But we know from studies
of twins that actually

00:05:52.996 --> 00:05:55.273
there's a very very high heritability

00:05:55.273 --> 00:05:57.085
for these kind of speech
and language disorders,

00:05:57.085 --> 00:05:58.897
unexplained speech and language disorders.

00:05:58.897 --> 00:06:02.222
We know this by looking
at the concordance in

00:06:02.222 --> 00:06:04.915
the rates of language
disorders in identical twins

00:06:04.915 --> 00:06:07.046
as compared to non-identical twins.

00:06:07.046 --> 00:06:10.469
There's been many many studies
that robustly show this.

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:12.770
What I want to talk to you about

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.185
in the remainder of the
talk is the idea that

00:06:16.185 --> 00:06:18.480
we should be able to go
further than just saying

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.650
well, there's genes involved,

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.798
to actually being able to say can we take

00:06:22.798 --> 00:06:25.308
some people who have speech
and language problems

00:06:25.308 --> 00:06:28.934
and figure out what the actual genes are,

00:06:28.934 --> 00:06:30.916
the particular genes, that are important?

00:06:30.916 --> 00:06:33.134
One of the wonderful
things about being able to

00:06:33.134 --> 00:06:36.467
find the genes that are involved is that

00:06:37.348 --> 00:06:39.484
we can use these as kind of windows,

00:06:39.484 --> 00:06:43.312
molecular windows, into
the intermediate biology.

00:06:43.312 --> 00:06:45.658
And this is my favorite
slide that I always show.

00:06:45.658 --> 00:06:47.255
Everybody, I think, has
a version of this slide

00:06:47.255 --> 00:06:49.457
if they work on genes and brain behavior.

00:06:49.457 --> 00:06:51.881
There's this huge gap between DNA and

00:06:51.881 --> 00:06:55.140
the behavioral outputs
that we're interested in.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.372
And we're not so naive to ignore that gap,

00:06:57.372 --> 00:07:01.220
but we think that we can use
the knowledge of the genetics

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.138
to actually fill in, and
understand, each different level.

00:07:04.138 --> 00:07:07.833
So we can understand that
many genes that we study

00:07:07.833 --> 00:07:10.654
are important because
they code for proteins,

00:07:10.654 --> 00:07:12.804
and the proteins kind of all work together

00:07:12.804 --> 00:07:15.080
as molecular machinery in your cells

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.523
to do all the functions of your cells.

00:07:17.523 --> 00:07:20.655
We know that genes and
proteins are important

00:07:20.655 --> 00:07:24.424
for different properties in
the way that neurons develop.

00:07:24.424 --> 00:07:26.782
So, for example, they might influence

00:07:26.782 --> 00:07:29.620
the proliferation of neurons
in early development.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.271
They might influence how neurons migrate

00:07:33.271 --> 00:07:35.546
to the final positions in the brain,

00:07:35.546 --> 00:07:39.427
how those neurons
differentiate and extend out

00:07:39.427 --> 00:07:42.211
kind of their axons to
connect up and wire up

00:07:42.211 --> 00:07:44.925
with other neurons in the brain.

00:07:44.925 --> 00:07:45.989
And then we might want to understand

00:07:45.989 --> 00:07:47.563
how neural circuits actually work.

00:07:47.563 --> 00:07:49.477
One of the most fascinating things about

00:07:49.477 --> 00:07:52.198
the interaction between
genes and neurocircuitry

00:07:52.198 --> 00:07:53.947
is that your genes are important for the

00:07:53.947 --> 00:07:55.685
functions of your neurocircuits,

00:07:55.685 --> 00:07:59.544
even in your adult brain,
because they help you to learn.

00:07:59.544 --> 00:08:03.908
Genes are actively working
to strengthen and weaken

00:08:03.908 --> 00:08:06.443
the links, the synapses, the links between

00:08:06.443 --> 00:08:10.110
your different brains
cells throughout life.

00:08:11.222 --> 00:08:13.611
And of course we have
these complex assemblages

00:08:13.611 --> 00:08:16.561
of neural circuits,
built by a combination of

00:08:16.561 --> 00:08:19.751
genes and experience, and
it's those in the brain

00:08:19.751 --> 00:08:22.433
that are doing these kind
of complex behaviors.

00:08:22.433 --> 00:08:24.415
And the idea here is that if we can find

00:08:24.415 --> 00:08:29.409
something at this end of
the spectrum, the DNA level,

00:08:29.409 --> 00:08:32.031
and we know that it's
linked at this other end

00:08:32.031 --> 00:08:34.372
to speech and language, we can use that

00:08:34.372 --> 00:08:36.465
as a tool for understanding
all these different levels.

00:08:36.465 --> 00:08:38.809
And there's interactions and relationships

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:40.003
between the levels.

00:08:40.003 --> 00:08:42.142
This is a gross oversimplification,

00:08:42.142 --> 00:08:44.982
but it's a starting
point for thinking about

00:08:44.982 --> 00:08:47.108
what I'm gonna talk about.

00:08:47.108 --> 00:08:48.466
So I'm gonna give you an example where

00:08:48.466 --> 00:08:51.299
we've been able to identify a gene

00:08:52.206 --> 00:08:54.935
that's important in speech
and language development.

00:08:54.935 --> 00:08:58.594
And the starting point for this study was

00:08:58.594 --> 00:09:00.770
this family here, the KE family.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:03.712
It's three-generation family,
now a four-generation family,

00:09:03.712 --> 00:09:05.384
and in each of these
generations you can see

00:09:05.384 --> 00:09:07.657
these shaded individuals are affected with

00:09:07.657 --> 00:09:09.516
a severe speech and language disorder.

00:09:09.516 --> 00:09:11.368
And they're growing up together with

00:09:11.368 --> 00:09:13.981
these unaffected individuals
who are non-shaded,

00:09:13.981 --> 00:09:15.745
who are growing up
together with their kids

00:09:15.745 --> 00:09:17.142
who develop a severe problem.

00:09:17.142 --> 00:09:20.075
The severe problem is that
they have difficulties

00:09:20.075 --> 00:09:24.242
learning to make those
coordinated sequences of speech.

00:09:25.305 --> 00:09:28.305
They do actually become speech users

00:09:29.472 --> 00:09:30.666
but there's always a problem.

00:09:30.666 --> 00:09:33.690
I'm gonna now play you an
example, hopefully if this works,

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:36.527
from one of the adult
members of the KE family,

00:09:36.527 --> 00:09:37.959
from the second generation,

00:09:37.959 --> 00:09:41.126
and she's being asked by Kate Watkins,

00:09:42.919 --> 00:09:47.292
a PhD student at the time, she
now leads a group in Oxford,

00:09:47.292 --> 00:09:50.605
but at the time she was
a PhD student in London

00:09:50.605 --> 00:09:53.239
with Faraneh Vargha-Khadem,
studying this family.

00:09:53.239 --> 00:09:56.911
She asks the lady to repeat
different words five times.

00:09:56.911 --> 00:09:59.401
And she's going to ask them to repeat

00:09:59.401 --> 00:10:02.908
the word catastrophe, so listen to this.

00:10:02.908 --> 00:10:04.722
- [Kate] Catastrophe.

00:10:04.722 --> 00:10:08.297
- [Woman] Cas tas, ca tas
to fee, ca trustef, mm.

00:10:08.297 --> 00:10:09.655
(woman groans as Kate laughs)

00:10:09.655 --> 00:10:11.405
- [Kate] Catastrophe.

00:10:15.319 --> 00:10:16.815
- [Woman] Catastof. (groans)

00:10:16.815 --> 00:10:17.885
- [Kate] It's hard, isn't it?

00:10:17.885 --> 00:10:20.936
- [Woman] It's really a tongue twister.

00:10:20.936 --> 00:10:23.630
- So she's having great trouble

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:26.184
repeating the word catastrophe.

00:10:26.184 --> 00:10:28.267
That's not a comment on
the political situation

00:10:28.267 --> 00:10:31.415
at the moment, but.
(audience laughs)

00:10:31.415 --> 00:10:32.927
I promised I wouldn't be political.

00:10:32.927 --> 00:10:34.538
(audience laughs)

00:10:34.538 --> 00:10:37.496
Anyway, so this trait that
she has is something that,

00:10:37.496 --> 00:10:39.940
it's called childhood apraxia
of speech but actually,

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.147
as you can hear, it
persisted into adulthood.

00:10:42.147 --> 00:10:45.404
And even despite some
intensive speech therapy,

00:10:45.404 --> 00:10:48.690
people still suffer from these problems.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.613
The problem is that they have problems

00:10:51.613 --> 00:10:55.446
stringing together certain
sequences of sound.

00:10:56.629 --> 00:11:00.568
The problems get worse as
the utterances get longer

00:11:00.568 --> 00:11:02.278
and as they become more complex.

00:11:02.278 --> 00:11:04.863
This is shown by, this is
a study that Kate Watkins

00:11:04.863 --> 00:11:08.732
carried out on the KE family
where they're being asked

00:11:08.732 --> 00:11:12.899
to repeat either simple
or complex nonsense words.

00:11:13.738 --> 00:11:16.559
And these are nonsense
words like contramponist

00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:19.733
and perplisterock, words
that now I practice

00:11:19.733 --> 00:11:20.933
every day in front of the mirror

00:11:20.933 --> 00:11:22.268
so I'm very good at them.
(audience laughs)

00:11:22.268 --> 00:11:23.918
But these people have
never encountered the words

00:11:23.918 --> 00:11:25.455
and they try to repeat them back,

00:11:25.455 --> 00:11:27.236
and they have difficulty doing so.

00:11:27.236 --> 00:11:30.038
What you can see on these graphs is,

00:11:30.038 --> 00:11:32.492
these are unaffected
members of the KE family,

00:11:32.492 --> 00:11:34.469
these are affected
members of the KE family,

00:11:34.469 --> 00:11:36.589
and this third line is
actually adults with

00:11:36.589 --> 00:11:40.187
Broca's and other kinds of aphasias,

00:11:40.187 --> 00:11:44.354
brain damage, that yields
problems with speech praxis.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.714
Here, as you can see, the
material that gives them

00:11:48.714 --> 00:11:51.265
the most difficulty is when they have to

00:11:51.265 --> 00:11:52.999
repeat these nonsense words that are

00:11:52.999 --> 00:11:55.452
really long and complex.

00:11:55.452 --> 00:11:57.568
It's not that they can't
say certain sounds,

00:11:57.568 --> 00:11:59.861
it's that they have
particular problems with

00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:03.032
stringing them together in the right way.

00:12:03.032 --> 00:12:04.898
Something to do with
the way that the brain

00:12:04.898 --> 00:12:08.562
is programming sequences of mouth and

00:12:08.562 --> 00:12:10.675
face movements during speech.

00:12:10.675 --> 00:12:12.721
Now they also have lots of other problems

00:12:12.721 --> 00:12:14.877
with all sorts of aspects of language.

00:12:14.877 --> 00:12:17.293
They have deficits not
just in spoken language,

00:12:17.293 --> 00:12:21.726
but also if you ask them to
write linguistic items as well.

00:12:21.726 --> 00:12:23.876
Their impairment's not just in expression

00:12:23.876 --> 00:12:25.859
but also in reception of language,

00:12:25.859 --> 00:12:29.738
and there are tests of grammar
comprehension and production

00:12:29.738 --> 00:12:34.179
that they do worse on than
unaffected individuals.

00:12:34.179 --> 00:12:36.519
This is not a kind of general
intellectual disability.

00:12:36.519 --> 00:12:40.892
They don't all have a
kind of IQ that's in the

00:12:40.892 --> 00:12:43.068
intellectual disability range.

00:12:43.068 --> 00:12:45.733
But this family is not the
brightest family in the world

00:12:45.733 --> 00:12:47.934
so there are some unaffected
individuals in the family

00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:51.741
who have low non-verbal IQ, and there are

00:12:51.741 --> 00:12:54.666
affected individuals who
have normal non-verbal IQ

00:12:54.666 --> 00:12:57.003
and severe speech and language problems.

00:12:57.003 --> 00:13:01.309
So it doesn't seem like
the non-verbal problems

00:13:01.309 --> 00:13:03.734
that some of the family
members suffer from,

00:13:03.734 --> 00:13:05.829
it doesn't seem like they're a

00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:07.672
core feature of the disorder.

00:13:07.672 --> 00:13:11.342
If you look at patterns of
non-verbal and verbal cognition,

00:13:11.342 --> 00:13:13.414
different kinds of
sub-tests, you find that

00:13:13.414 --> 00:13:15.780
they have deficits that
are much more severe

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:17.995
in the verbal range, which
is what you would expect

00:13:17.995 --> 00:13:20.611
for a speech and language disorder.

00:13:20.611 --> 00:13:24.833
So working in the lab of Tony
Monaco, in the late 1990s,

00:13:24.833 --> 00:13:28.583
we started screening
the DNA from this family

00:13:29.512 --> 00:13:34.210
and we pinpointed a linked
region on chromosome seven.

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:37.021
This was actually a different region

00:13:37.021 --> 00:13:38.709
from the region that
you've just heard about

00:13:38.709 --> 00:13:41.963
in the Williams syndrome talk.

00:13:41.963 --> 00:13:45.046
Eventually we zoomed in and spotted a

00:13:46.663 --> 00:13:50.830
single tiny change, one letter
of DNA, one base of DNA,

00:13:52.573 --> 00:13:56.067
which normally in every
unaffected person in this family

00:13:56.067 --> 00:14:00.150
and in every one of you
I can guarantee, was a G.

00:14:01.187 --> 00:14:03.082
In the affected members of the family,

00:14:03.082 --> 00:14:04.767
they have two copies of every gene.

00:14:04.767 --> 00:14:07.026
One copy had the G, one copy was normal.

00:14:07.026 --> 00:14:10.243
But one copy has an A instead of a G.

00:14:10.243 --> 00:14:12.813
This was private mutation
that had occurred

00:14:12.813 --> 00:14:14.948
in the grandma of that
family and then been

00:14:14.948 --> 00:14:17.720
passed on to half of the affected members.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.887
And the unaffected members
did not receive this variant.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.513
This was in a gene called FOXP2.

00:14:25.513 --> 00:14:28.249
We could already say something
about what that gene was.

00:14:28.249 --> 00:14:30.913
It's a gene that regulates other genes,

00:14:30.913 --> 00:14:33.582
I'll tell you about that in a minute.

00:14:33.582 --> 00:14:36.165
And all these genes like FOXP2,

00:14:38.633 --> 00:14:40.566
they have something called
a forkhead box domain.

00:14:40.566 --> 00:14:44.327
They make a protein that
has this special domain here

00:14:44.327 --> 00:14:46.405
that I'm showing you, and it consists of

00:14:46.405 --> 00:14:50.127
these three helices here,
one, two, and three,

00:14:50.127 --> 00:14:52.015
and these big loops here.

00:14:52.015 --> 00:14:55.771
And the KE family have
this mutation that changes

00:14:55.771 --> 00:14:57.476
one of the amino acids in the protein

00:14:57.476 --> 00:15:00.884
that they build for FOXP2,
and it's this amino acid here.

00:15:00.884 --> 00:15:04.073
And it stops the protein
from doing its job properly,

00:15:04.073 --> 00:15:07.202
it stops the protein from binding to DNA.

00:15:07.202 --> 00:15:11.331
Since finding this
mutation in the KE family,

00:15:11.331 --> 00:15:14.026
we and others have found a bunch of

00:15:14.026 --> 00:15:16.781
other different mutations in FOXP2

00:15:16.781 --> 00:15:18.430
in different cases around the world.

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:21.022
This just shows you a
picture from a later study

00:15:21.022 --> 00:15:23.366
showing about eight or
nine different mutations

00:15:23.366 --> 00:15:24.538
that have been found,

00:15:24.538 --> 00:15:29.242
disturbing different
letters of the FOXP2 gene.

00:15:29.242 --> 00:15:33.175
In each case, they damage
one copy of the FOXP2 gene

00:15:33.175 --> 00:15:35.935
but leave another copy
of the FOXP2 gene intact.

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:40.045
So these people have
kind of an insufficient

00:15:40.045 --> 00:15:42.433
amount of FOXP2 protein
that they're making

00:15:42.433 --> 00:15:45.866
and they have speech
and language problems.

00:15:45.866 --> 00:15:47.666
Sometimes other problems in addition,

00:15:47.666 --> 00:15:49.704
but the kind of most common feature across

00:15:49.704 --> 00:15:52.972
all these patients is speech
and language disorder.

00:15:52.972 --> 00:15:55.248
We've been able to take
the different mutations

00:15:55.248 --> 00:15:58.896
that disrupt FOXP2 and
look at them in the lab.

00:15:58.896 --> 00:16:03.063
We can grow cells in the lab
and label FOXP2 in green.

00:16:05.859 --> 00:16:07.766
Here is the nucleus of cells,

00:16:07.766 --> 00:16:10.209
and here is normal FOXP2 being expressed

00:16:10.209 --> 00:16:12.755
in the nucleus of these cells
which is where it likes to be,

00:16:12.755 --> 00:16:15.345
and here are some examples
of mutations where

00:16:15.345 --> 00:16:17.754
the protein can no longer
get into the nucleus.

00:16:17.754 --> 00:16:20.637
We do other assays that show that FOXP2

00:16:20.637 --> 00:16:23.200
is not working properly in these cells.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.346
So the idea then is that you can use FOXP2

00:16:25.346 --> 00:16:29.331
to study all these intermediate levels

00:16:29.331 --> 00:16:32.533
from DNA to speech and language.

00:16:32.533 --> 00:16:37.149
And I refer you to these papers
to find out more about it.

00:16:37.149 --> 00:16:38.769
But I'm just gonna give
you a couple of examples,

00:16:38.769 --> 00:16:40.835
because I'm running out of time,

00:16:40.835 --> 00:16:44.179
of the kinds of things that
we've been studying with FOXP2.

00:16:44.179 --> 00:16:46.657
So FOXP2 is a regulatory gene that

00:16:46.657 --> 00:16:49.961
switches on and off other
genes, and this is how it works.

00:16:49.961 --> 00:16:53.260
It gets transcribed, it's a messenger RNA,

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.982
and this messenger RNA
is used as a template

00:16:55.982 --> 00:16:59.390
to build a protein also called FOXP2.

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:03.262
This FOXP2 protein binds target genes and

00:17:03.262 --> 00:17:05.823
it binds to the promoters,
the regulatory regions

00:17:05.823 --> 00:17:10.001
at the front of each gene, and
it could either activate them

00:17:10.001 --> 00:17:12.422
or it could repress them,
it could silence them.

00:17:12.422 --> 00:17:15.205
And we think that a lot of
the time what FOXP2 is doing

00:17:15.205 --> 00:17:17.667
is to silence these genes,

00:17:17.667 --> 00:17:19.805
but it can also act as an activator.

00:17:19.805 --> 00:17:21.615
It seems to do this like a kind of genetic

00:17:21.615 --> 00:17:24.575
dimmer switch if you like,
it's not all or nothing.

00:17:24.575 --> 00:17:29.054
We can then have a look, we
know that we have this gene,

00:17:29.054 --> 00:17:32.680
can we ask what are the other elements

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.466
of this FOXP2 network that it belongs to?

00:17:35.466 --> 00:17:38.464
So we might ask what are the things that

00:17:38.464 --> 00:17:41.016
bind to the FOXP2 gene to switch it on?

00:17:41.016 --> 00:17:43.505
What are the signaling processes that

00:17:43.505 --> 00:17:45.921
interact with FOXP2 to
modulate its function?

00:17:45.921 --> 00:17:48.816
What are the other
factors that bind FOXP2?

00:17:48.816 --> 00:17:50.233
And what are the downstream targets

00:17:50.233 --> 00:17:52.665
that it's switching on and off?

00:17:52.665 --> 00:17:55.626
We've identified quite a
few downstream targets,

00:17:55.626 --> 00:17:58.149
and many people have been
working on this over the years.

00:17:58.149 --> 00:17:59.944
What's interesting is
that many of the targets

00:17:59.944 --> 00:18:02.488
that FOXP2 regulates are known to be

00:18:02.488 --> 00:18:05.065
important for neurodevelopment
because when they go wrong

00:18:05.065 --> 00:18:06.767
they cause neurodevelopmental
disorders like

00:18:06.767 --> 00:18:10.350
autism, schizophrenia,
epilepsy, and so on.

00:18:12.588 --> 00:18:14.824
and we've identified
pathways like sumoylation

00:18:14.824 --> 00:18:18.326
that modulate the way the
FOXP2 works in the cell,

00:18:18.326 --> 00:18:21.347
and also other proteins like TBR1

00:18:21.347 --> 00:18:24.103
that interact with FOXP2
and are also implicated

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:26.521
in neurodevelopmental syndromes.

00:18:26.521 --> 00:18:30.688
We can go further to ask what
is the influence of FOXP2

00:18:32.688 --> 00:18:34.415
on the neuronal properties?

00:18:34.415 --> 00:18:36.131
One of the neuronal properties that FOXP2

00:18:36.131 --> 00:18:39.541
appears to influence is
the outgrowth of neurites

00:18:39.541 --> 00:18:43.734
from cells, from neurons,
and these are the things

00:18:43.734 --> 00:18:47.856
that will eventually connect
up, become axons and dendrites,

00:18:47.856 --> 00:18:50.269
and connect up with other neurons.

00:18:50.269 --> 00:18:52.883
When FOXP2 is lost, it can lead to

00:18:52.883 --> 00:18:56.393
shorter neurites with reduced branching.

00:18:56.393 --> 00:18:58.922
You might ask then, if
FOXP2 is so important

00:18:58.922 --> 00:19:02.898
for things like the outgrowth of neurites,

00:19:02.898 --> 00:19:04.875
when we have a loss of
FOXP2 why don't we have a

00:19:04.875 --> 00:19:07.914
global problem with the
whole of our brains?

00:19:07.914 --> 00:19:09.653
The reason for this is that FOXP2 is not

00:19:09.653 --> 00:19:12.854
actually switched on
itself all over the brain.

00:19:12.854 --> 00:19:16.604
It's switched on in
certain subsets of cells.

00:19:17.863 --> 00:19:20.307
This is, if I took your brain
which I promise I won't do,

00:19:20.307 --> 00:19:22.735
(audience laughs)
and I slice it in half,

00:19:22.735 --> 00:19:25.182
you can see this is a
kind of cross section.

00:19:25.182 --> 00:19:29.392
FOXP2 is expressed in the
deepest layers of the cortex,

00:19:29.392 --> 00:19:31.387
especially in motor
regions, it's expressed

00:19:31.387 --> 00:19:33.654
in layer six and layer five.

00:19:33.654 --> 00:19:36.677
It's also expressed in the basal ganglia,

00:19:36.677 --> 00:19:40.048
in the striatum, in caudate,
putamen, the thalamus,

00:19:40.048 --> 00:19:41.507
and in the cerebellum it's expressed in

00:19:41.507 --> 00:19:45.343
a very specific cell type
called the Purkinje cells.

00:19:45.343 --> 00:19:46.914
What a lot of these circuits do,

00:19:46.914 --> 00:19:50.403
the cortico-basal ganglia and
cortico-cerebellar circuits

00:19:50.403 --> 00:19:53.418
is they're important for you
to do motor skill learning,

00:19:53.418 --> 00:19:56.168
to learn to make motor sequences.

00:19:58.122 --> 00:20:01.168
Since FOXP2 is not a new human gene,

00:20:01.168 --> 00:20:04.589
it's actually present in
all sorts of other organisms

00:20:04.589 --> 00:20:08.756
in evolutionary history, we
can study what FOXP2 does

00:20:09.663 --> 00:20:12.143
say by looking in a mouse.

00:20:12.143 --> 00:20:15.748
When we take a mouse, we
can study the way that

00:20:15.748 --> 00:20:18.766
these neurons that express
FOXP2, the ways they fire

00:20:18.766 --> 00:20:21.099
during motor skill learning.

00:20:22.595 --> 00:20:26.528
We can thus kind of get
insights into what's happening.

00:20:26.528 --> 00:20:28.718
We found that in these different places

00:20:28.718 --> 00:20:31.992
in the striatum, also in
Purkinje cells in the cerebellum,

00:20:31.992 --> 00:20:36.160
that the firing of the neurons
during motor skill learning

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.780
and motor skill tasks is different from

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:43.613
when FOXP2 is mutated
from unaffected animals.

00:20:46.193 --> 00:20:48.483
So I'm gonna finish
there by just summing up.

00:20:48.483 --> 00:20:50.538
FOXP2 at the extremes,
what does this tell us

00:20:50.538 --> 00:20:53.168
about speech and language development?

00:20:53.168 --> 00:20:56.044
Heterozygous mutations
in FOXP2 cause a rare

00:20:56.044 --> 00:20:58.624
severe speech and language
disorder in humans.

00:20:58.624 --> 00:21:01.756
It's a regulatory gene, so its
targets and its interactors

00:21:01.756 --> 00:21:05.263
give us entry points into neural pathways.

00:21:05.263 --> 00:21:07.807
It's not a gene for speech
because as I've told you,

00:21:07.807 --> 00:21:09.674
versions of FOXP2 are
active in the brains of

00:21:09.674 --> 00:21:11.637
many different vertebrate species.

00:21:11.637 --> 00:21:13.288
The nice thing there
is that we can actually

00:21:13.288 --> 00:21:17.038
study what FOXP2 does
in these other species.

00:21:19.998 --> 00:21:22.287
By studying humans,
mice, and even songbirds

00:21:22.287 --> 00:21:24.465
which I didn't have time to talk about,

00:21:24.465 --> 00:21:26.555
we can uncover the roles of the gene

00:21:26.555 --> 00:21:29.217
in these kind of circuits
like cortico-basal ganglia

00:21:29.217 --> 00:21:31.437
and cerebellar circuitry
that are known to be

00:21:31.437 --> 00:21:33.997
important for complex motor functions.

00:21:33.997 --> 00:21:35.493
A curious question would be, we know that

00:21:35.493 --> 00:21:37.521
when FOXP2 is damaged it impairs your

00:21:37.521 --> 00:21:40.295
speech-motor skills, so it
would be interesting to see

00:21:40.295 --> 00:21:42.054
whether, at the other end of the spectrum,

00:21:42.054 --> 00:21:44.619
for example in people
who are really good at

00:21:44.619 --> 00:21:48.169
beat boxing, or rapping, maybe they have

00:21:48.169 --> 00:21:51.675
(audience laughs)
interesting variants of FOXP2.

00:21:51.675 --> 00:21:53.376
So the last thing I'd like to say is that

00:21:53.376 --> 00:21:56.207
the fact that FOXP2 has
been around for a long time

00:21:56.207 --> 00:21:58.408
in evolutionary history,
and it's been doing

00:21:58.408 --> 00:22:01.217
important things in the brain, means that

00:22:01.217 --> 00:22:03.591
whatever it's doing in
speech and language in humans

00:22:03.591 --> 00:22:07.512
is not novel and de novo, but
it's built on ancient stuff.

00:22:07.512 --> 00:22:09.264
So I think this suggests to us that

00:22:09.264 --> 00:22:11.650
our unique capacity for
acquiring spoken language

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:15.537
is built on systems that
are evolutionarily ancient.

00:22:15.537 --> 00:22:17.495
And there I will stop,
thank you very much.

00:22:17.495 --> 00:22:20.495
(audience applauds)

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:25.123
(upbeat thoughtful music)
