1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,240
And have you ever heard the theory that
octopus are from out of space? Yeah,

2
00:00:03,241 --> 00:00:06,270
we talked about that. Ryan Cox
the other day. Yeah. I'm not,

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,490
I'm not super well read on it, but
like it looks like a damn alien. Yeah,

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,060
he was very incredulous. Uh, but you know,
he's obviously smarter than both of us.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,470
Right. So, so he gets to me. Yeah.

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,840
It's like me looking at tackling man,
it doesn't make sense.

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,150
Of course it doesn't make sense. I'm
stupid. But he's, he's, you know,

8
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:25,160
we were looking at this eye,

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,550
but this is apparently like peer reviewed
published paper about the possibility

10
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:33,090
of octopus being reintroduced and I
think it has something to do with the way

11
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:37,620
RNA and DNA is right on them. Right.
I know. I don't understand it well,

12
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:38,161
but yes,

13
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:42,200
it's like the thought that the population
came from out of space because of the

14
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:46,650
DNA sequencing and suggest something
that makes it extra terrestrial

15
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:47,790
adaptability.
Yeah.

16
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,940
He was super skeptical because he was
saying that they're essentially so close

17
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:53,130
to everything else here.
It doesn't make sense.

18
00:00:53,131 --> 00:00:57,200
But the other theory was it might be
just this is the path of life. Right.

19
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,330
And the reason why it's so close to
us is that this is the way all life,

20
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,720
even if it's extra terrestrial,
sure gets established. Sure.

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,410
I don't believe octopus from out of space,
but I love the theory.

22
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:10,170
I love the idea of it. It looks like
it's from out of space. You know,

23
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:13,590
it's just wacky. Well, it's such
a cool thought. Yeah. You know,

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,620
that these things came from out of spaces,
so.

25
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,830
Well that's also a thought about silicide
mushrooms from the weirder people that

26
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:23,690
they came, uh, on asteroids
and their spores. I've heard
that. Yeah. And they've,

27
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,370
I don't know if you know this,
but they've proven that certain,

28
00:01:26,371 --> 00:01:27,390
I don't know about psilocybins,

29
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:31,170
but certain mushroom spores are
impenetrable to the vacuum of space. Yeah.

30
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:35,340
They can survive. Yeah. That's, that's
bananas. I pick a lot of mushrooms,

31
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,640
not psilocybins, but I'm a lot of
porcine, a lot of chanterelles. Like I,

32
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,980
I do a lot of farming. It's really
fun. Are you aware of Paul Stamets? No,

33
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,030
I don't know that. He's amazing, man.
One of my favorite podcasts ever.

34
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,130
He's a mycologist a fucking trip
in every sense of the word. Huh?

35
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,240
As super genius.

36
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:58,590
Mycologist who's the craziest story about
being in high school and what did he

37
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:01,320
say? Took 20 grams of
mushrooms and climbed a tree,

38
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,870
a lightning storm or something.

39
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,170
Fucking something where you hear
him tell the story in your hands.

40
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:10,650
Start sweating. No Way. Grams
or 10 grams or 20 grand,

41
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:13,770
like something fucking bananas. Like
some that would kill Moose. Yeah.

42
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,910
Well it wouldn't kill it,

43
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:19,080
but it would definitely make it think
it's on a moose anymore and it essentially

44
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:20,970
changed his life.
Stopped him from stuttering.

45
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:23,830
He used to stutter and he did this
and he stops done. No Way. Yeah.

46
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,980
I've heard about guys that micro dose
with mushrooms with psilocybins and it,

47
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,070
it heightens their focus and curious
or autism and you know, there's,

48
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,650
I'm not very well read on that,

49
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:39,210
but there's a whole idea that micro
dosing with these chemicals that are

50
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:43,260
naturally produced can actually
have very positive effects. Yeah.

51
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:45,870
There's quite a few people who do
that. That's really common. Yeah. Yeah.

52
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,630
I've talked to a lot of people
that do that really goes with that.

53
00:02:48,631 --> 00:02:51,600
And they also microdose with LSD.
There's a lot of that. Really not, yeah.

54
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,360
A lot of silicon valley people
are microdosing with LSD.

55
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,110
It's funny because the one person that
I know that's done the microdosing

56
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,670
mushrooms from silicone valley, yeah.
People grind them up into pill form.

57
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,540
And in fact a lot of fighters are doing
that now. Really, really strange. Yeah.

58
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:08,110
So what would that, why would that
help you? Like as a fighter? Is it,

59
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:09,660
it's not a mental focus thing.
It's a,

60
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,570
it's a physical thing at that point right
now it's gets you into the flow state.

61
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,000
Interesting. And so like with
fighters, the real thing is, um,

62
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,050
it's not just your skill,

63
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,180
but it's your ability to execute
that skill under pressure. All right?

64
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,210
So there's an overwhelming
amount of anxiety.

65
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:30,190
There's extreme consequences to getting
hit or going wrong. Getting knocked out.

66
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:33,790
The losing a fight is absolutely
devastating. It's devastating.

67
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:37,270
Emotionally is devastating physically.
It's devastating. Psychologically.

68
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:42,400
It changes your perception of who you
are and how you fit into the world. And,

69
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,040
um, that sometimes, and not,

70
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:49,510
I shouldn't say sometimes oftentimes
impedes performance kind of come back from

71
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:51,310
it kind of thing.
Well it's not just that the,

72
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,780
the consequences of it possibly go wrong,
make you hesitate and it just,

73
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,230
it's the stress of it
all is very constricting.

74
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,150
It's very difficult to operate
under that stress. Sure.

75
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:06,510
The mushrooms for some people alleviate
that stress and put you in this elevated

76
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:11,590
state where they say, and I haven't,
I've never fought on mushrooms,

77
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:15,590
but they say that when you're on mushrooms
you actually can see what a guy's

78
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,620
going to do before he does it.
Interest.

79
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,480
You have a sense of what
they're going to do.

80
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:22,960
That's a much more heightened sense than
you would if you were just in a normal

81
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:24,580
sober state.
So are you picking,

82
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:27,160
do you think you're picking that
up through like biological cues?

83
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:30,310
Like you could see the muscles twitching
in the arm before the punch comes or

84
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:33,880
like what, how do you think that a good
question. I haven't done it. I don't know.

85
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,330
You know, I've never sparred on
mushrooms are like a good idea.

86
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,950
That's a really common,

87
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:42,070
they say it is a good idea that
the guys who do it love it. Yeah.

88
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,200
Interest and guys of like, you know, had
some really extreme positive results. Huh?

89
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,820
Yeah.
That's fascinating.

90
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:52,620
I never thought as an athletic
performer that athletic enhancement,

91
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,030
that would be a thing. Yeah.
It's, it's not just the, I mean,

92
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,910
I don't think it makes you move
faster or hit stronger, hit harder.

93
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,080
But I think what it does is it puts
you in the zone. Interesting. There's,

94
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,090
there's states that you
get into where you just,

95
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,530
you can't do no wrong and either usually
very elusive. They come and they go,

96
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,550
you know, you get them like,
um, do you ever play pool?
I did a little bit. I mean,

97
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,430
but you know how sometimes you play pool
for a few hours and then you just also,

98
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,930
you feel you can't miss.
Yeah.

99
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,910
He just have this feeling of
where everything's going to go.

100
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:24,520
That's even if you're not very good.
Sometimes those,

101
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:28,510
those will conflict to tree shots,
the zone. Sure. You know, and, um,

102
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:33,250
that elusive state of like re, and
then sometimes you're like, wow,

103
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:35,530
I can't believe I'm in the zone.
Then it goes away, you know,

104
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:40,720
maintaining that flow state. What do
you think it takes emotions out of it?

105
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:42,640
Like is that,
is that why you're in that state?

106
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:45,850
Like if you're not emotionally
attached to that shot or that punch,

107
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,640
maybe you can execute it
better? It's possible. I mean,

108
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:50,950
there's a lot of speculation
of what's going on,

109
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,610
what's causing this elevated state of
consciousness. It's interesting. Yeah.

110
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:55,444
I don't know.

111
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,480
Maybe I'll just start microdosing on
mushrooms and going out to chase snakes

112
00:05:58,481 --> 00:05:59,350
around.
Maybe,

113
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,040
maybe you would be more in tune with the
environment or maybe I'd get bitten and

114
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,540
die.
That's true too.
