00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.370
You’ve tried taking your crush out to the
movies, giving them gifts, you’ve tried

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.319
foot rubs, dressing up, dressing down.

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:07.700
Man, why aren’t they in love with you already?

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:16.180
So how can you make someone fall in love with
you… with science?

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.210
Hey lovers Julia here for DNews

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.760
Just a forward, you can’t force someone
to love you.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.660
There’s no love potion, no spell.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.210
You aren’t entitled to someone else’s
time, attention, and affections.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.030
Sorry Alpha males and followers of the game.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.359
Just doesn’t happen that way.

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.120
Forcing someone else to love you always ends
badly, like you might wind up creating one

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.040
of the darkest wizards the world has ever
seen.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.790
Nice going Merope Gaunt.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.270
But according to some studies by Arthur Aron,
psychologist from State University of New

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.840
York At Stonybrook, there might be a few ways
to set the mood.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.820
Probably the best way to fall in love, is
intimacy.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.500
The act of sharing a little bit about yourself
and having someone respond in kind.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.330
Of course this happens naturally.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.210
But scientists being scientists, they wanted
to create intimacy and bonds between people

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.680
in a lab, and make it happen fast.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.050
So Aron and his colleagues made a 36 question
quiz published in the journal, Personality

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.860
and Social Psychology Bulletin, to create
“closeness in an experimental context.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.810
In their study they paired up strangers and
had them take this test.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.180
It features alternating questions and they
get increasingly more personal.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.680
Stating, “One key pattern associated with
the development of a close relationship among

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.240
peers is sustained, escalating, reciprocal,
personal self-disclosure”.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.340
So I tell you something about my childhood,
then you tell me something about your mother…

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.030
and it goes back and forth for 36 questions…
at the end you stare longingly into each other’s

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.200
eyes for four minutes.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.920
At the end of the 45 minutes, by one measure
30% of participants rated their relationship

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.960
to their partner, who was a complete stranger,
as closer than their other closest relationships!

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.680
So that’s definitely interesting.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.460
So does getting super personal and staring
into someone’s eyes for four minutes sound

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.460
scary?

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.460
Oh yeah.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.460
That’s part of the thrill.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.500
A writer for the New York Times who did this
experiment on a date said “Two minutes is

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.039
just enough to be terrified, “Four really
goes somewhere.”

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.660
And there’s something to be said about being
terrified and falling in love.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.840
There are certain scenarios where love blossoms.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.840
Like scary movies.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.310
I’m not the biggest fan of them, but apparently
they help set the mood.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.840
Basically your body is aroused and stimulated
by the movie.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.870
You starting sweating, your heart is racing.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.670
But the funny thing is, when we feel a certain
way, we’re not always sure why.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.890
Mostly we figure it out by context clues.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.530
So you might accidentally mistake those feelings
for the arousal you feel when you’re attracted

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.530
to someone.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.830
This is called “misattribution of arousal”.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.890
Aron studied this phenomenon back in 1974
in a study published in the journal of Personality

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.060
and Social Psychology.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.490
In this experiment he had a group of men walk
across a scary bridge and a group of men walk

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.480
across a less scary bridge.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.810
At the other end of the bridge was a
woman who showed them pictures and asked them

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.780
how sexual they thought the pictures were
and then she gave them her phone number “just

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.230
in case they had any follow up questions”.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.890
What Aron found was that the men who walked
on the scary bridge rated the pictures as

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.080
more sexual and were more likely to call up
the woman.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.220
So just in case you don’t have a suspenseful
suspension bridge near by to take your date

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.970
on, a scary or suspenseful movie will do according
to another study published in the Journal

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.520
of Social Psychology.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.140
In this study, the researchers found that
couples had more afflictive behavior like

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.239
touching, talking, after watching a suspenseful
movie than those who went to a less “arousing”

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.239
movie.

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.730
Or another study published in the Archives
of Sexual behavior found similar results after

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.450
couples went on roller coasters!

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.300
So you’re terrified of getting intimate
with someone by asking personal questions,

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.300
no problem!

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.730
Just head to the movies or a theme park near
you.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.819
And once you find that lucky someone, you
can show them how much they mean to you by

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:46.819
giving them jewelry.

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.700
