00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:02.801 align:start size:84% position:16%
Why are we so
fascinated with Mars?

00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:05.438 align:start size:88% position:13%
There's this visceral
connection that we have.

00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:07.673 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's been a constant
steady light

00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:09.675
in the night sky for us.

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:13.713
You and I can go outside
tonight on a clear night,

00:00:13.713 --> 00:00:15.981
look towards the
southwestern sky,

00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:20.553
and see a bright orange
star, the Red Planet.

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:23.389
(audience applauding)

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:25.891 align:start size:84% position:16%
Looking at Mars,
it's also of interest

00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:30.430 line:0%
because it is within what
we call the Habitable Zone

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.131
around the sun.

00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:34.166
And so we're going to
be exploring tonight

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.401
a little bit more.

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:38.571 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
I'd like to ask our
guests here, our experts

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:40.273 line:0%
on a little bit about that.

00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:42.842
And let's get into
the challenges and
what it really takes

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:44.376
to get to Mars.

00:00:44.376 --> 00:00:47.046
- Mars is incredibly
difficult to get onto,

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:49.115
because you have to go
through the atmosphere.

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:51.084 line:0%
And the atmosphere
is not your friend,

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:53.352 line:0%
because it swells
up because of dust.

00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:55.388 line:0%
When there's a lot of
dust in the atmosphere,

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:56.822 line:0%
it shrinks.

00:00:56.822 --> 00:00:59.458 align:start position:0%
There are lateral winds,
although the atmosphere is thin.

00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:03.195 align:start size:97% position:3%
But it is a scientific bonanza
once you're on the surface.

00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:07.466
It has ancient rivers
and ancient lakes,

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.935
hydrothermal systems.

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:11.303 align:start size:94% position:6%
All the evidence is there,
the geologic evidence.

00:01:11.303 --> 00:01:14.441 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's from the first
half of geologic time.

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:17.676 align:start size:94% position:6%
So early in geologic time,
Mars was warm and wet,

00:01:17.676 --> 00:01:19.679
and the international
exploration of Mars

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:23.316 align:start size:94% position:6%
robotically is all focused
on if it was habitable

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:26.052
and whether or not life
got started and evolved

00:01:26.052 --> 00:01:27.620
and is still there.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.821
- That's amazing.

00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:32.092
So let's look at some
of the technology.

00:01:33.225 --> 00:01:35.361 align:start size:84% position:16%
Let's talk about
this character here.

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:37.930 align:start size:94% position:6%
He's making a lot of
buzz in the media, right?

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.667 align:start size:84% position:16%
Elon Musk, he's
the head of SpaceX,

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:45.304 align:start size:97% position:3%
and his true love and
passion is space exploration.

00:01:45.304 --> 00:01:48.674
And his vision is to
send humans to Mars.

00:01:48.674 --> 00:01:51.110
So NASA isn't really alone.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.279
They have partnerships.

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:54.513
Is that...
- Right.

00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:56.049 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Andrew] Really going
to be integral now?

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.384 line:0%
- Yes, so NASA historically
has partnered with people,

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:01.354 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
has consulted and contracted
with organizations

00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:02.588 line:0%
all over the country.

00:02:02.588 --> 00:02:06.159
And so as we're looking
into this next phase,

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.428
this going to Mars, there
are still going to have

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:09.762
to be these partnerships.

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:11.497
As you say, Elon Musk is one,

00:02:11.497 --> 00:02:13.899 align:start size:94% position:6%
but there are others
that are going to help us

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:15.902 align:start size:84% position:16%
do the important
work of figuring out

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:18.104
what, exactly, the
best technology is.

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:19.204
But it is definitely
something that we're

00:02:19.204 --> 00:02:20.840
going to have to do together.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.907
- It's not an easy thing.

00:02:21.907 --> 00:02:22.841
- No.

00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:24.176
- Right, so take a look at this.

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:26.679
- [Male] T-minus four minutes.

00:02:27.746 --> 00:02:30.817 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
- [Peter] We've reached
a tipping point.

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:34.487 line:0%
Thousands of years from
now, whatever we become,

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:37.824
whoever we are, we'll
look back at these

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:40.426
next few decades as
the moment in time

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:42.461 align:start size:81% position:19%
that we are moving
off this planet

00:02:42.461 --> 00:02:45.031
as a multi-planetary species.

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:47.900
- [Male] BC and DC verify
F9 and Dragon R at startup.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.468
- [Male 2] F9 is in startup.

00:02:49.468 --> 00:02:52.571 line:0%
- And SpaceX stands
as nothing less than

00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:54.507 line:0%
a massive game changer.

00:02:55.941 --> 00:02:57.843 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Male 3] Stage One, Stage
Two present for flight.

00:02:57.843 --> 00:02:59.812
- [Stephen] Elon Musk
says the only reason

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:03.382
that I founded this company is
to get human beings to Mars.

00:03:03.382 --> 00:03:05.384
- [Male 4] LC, LD go for launch.

00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:08.654 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- The key to making
Mars economical

00:03:08.654 --> 00:03:11.156 line:0%
is the reusability of rockets.

00:03:11.156 --> 00:03:12.725
- [Male5] T-minus one minute.

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:14.193 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I just don't think
there's any way

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:18.097 align:start size:97% position:3%
to have a self-sustaining Mars
space without reusability.

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:21.667
Getting the cost down
is really fundamental.

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:24.570 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
If wooden sailing ships in the
old days were not reusable,

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.438 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
I don't think the United
States would exist.

00:03:26.438 --> 00:03:27.707
- [Male 5] T-minus 30 seconds.

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:31.410
- And if they nail this
ability to land a rocket

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.313 align:start size:94% position:6%
any way they want on
Earth, then they can nail

00:03:34.313 --> 00:03:35.715
doing it on Mars.

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:37.382
- [Male 5] T-minus 15.

00:03:37.382 --> 00:03:38.818
- This flight is a huge deal.

00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:41.420 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%
We haven't yet
landed the rocket.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.589 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
So this is going to
be hopefully our first

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:45.157 line:0%
successful landing.

00:03:45.157 --> 00:03:49.628 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Male 5] T-minus
10, nine, eight, seven

00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:53.800
six, five, four, three,

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.569
two, one, zero.

00:03:58.237 --> 00:04:00.472
We have liftoff of Falcon 9.

00:04:00.472 --> 00:04:05.078 align:start size:84% position:16%
(spectators cheering
and applauding)

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.814
(dramatic music)

00:04:20.592 --> 00:04:23.195
- [Male 6] Vehicle's reached
maximum aerodynamic pressure.

00:04:23.195 --> 00:04:26.065 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Male 7] Stage 1
propulsion is still nominal.

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:27.767
Altitude 32 kilometers.

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.569 align:start size:84% position:16%
Speed at one
kilometer per second.

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.338 align:start size:81% position:19%
Downrange distance
13 kilometers.

00:04:33.505 --> 00:04:36.275
(explosive sounds)

00:04:36.275 --> 00:04:39.445
(slow dramatic music)

00:05:02.434 --> 00:05:04.770 size:88% position:44%
- [Casey] Space is defined
by the strange relationship

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.474 align:start size:84% position:16%
between failure,
risk and innovation,

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:10.610
which is you can take risks.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.979 align:start size:84% position:16%
You can try something
very innovative.

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.616
But you're more likely to fail.

00:05:16.616 --> 00:05:20.153 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So what was it
supposed to look like?

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:22.821 align:start size:84% position:16%
Well, you'd have the
booster going up,

00:05:22.821 --> 00:05:25.090
and what I'm showing
you here is going to be

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.428
a composite, a long
exposure photograph.

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:31.097
What it's supposed
to have looked like,

00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:32.899 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then the booster
coming back down.

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:35.735 align:start size:97% position:3%
And what you see on your
right hand side of the screen

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:40.138 align:start size:97% position:3%
is the booster that came
down back onto the launchpad.

00:05:40.138 --> 00:05:44.743 align:start size:88% position:13%
And what I want to know,
Jedidah, is why is it

00:05:44.743 --> 00:05:48.781
so important to
have reusability?

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:51.651 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm talking about
Mars, going to Mars.

00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:52.918
Why is that so important?

00:05:52.918 --> 00:05:55.755
- Yeah, over the long
term, the hope is that

00:05:55.755 --> 00:05:58.724 align:start size:97% position:3%
if you can reuse something,
it's cheaper, right?

00:05:58.724 --> 00:06:00.759 align:start size:94% position:6%
You want it to be cheaper
and more efficient.

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:04.363 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's sort of your workhorse
that you just continue to use.

00:06:04.363 --> 00:06:06.932
It's not always the case
that things are cheaper

00:06:06.932 --> 00:06:09.768
when you reuse them,
but you want something

00:06:09.768 --> 00:06:13.406 align:start size:84% position:16%
that you can use,
rinse, recycle, reuse.

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:15.040
That's rinse, repeat,
that's what you want.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.477 align:start size:97% position:3%
The other thing is, you
want to be able to use that

00:06:18.477 --> 00:06:21.914 align:start size:84% position:16%
piece of technology
as scaffolding for the

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:23.148
next thing you do.

00:06:23.148 --> 00:06:25.718 align:start size:88% position:13%
Maybe you use a piece
of your booster to build

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:26.986
the first structure, right?

00:06:26.986 --> 00:06:29.322
Maybe you recycle
it in that way.

00:06:29.322 --> 00:06:32.257
So you hope, first, that
there's a cost savings.

00:06:32.257 --> 00:06:33.859
You hope that there's
a sort of efficiency

00:06:33.859 --> 00:06:35.328
that you can build in.

00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:37.730
And third, that you can
use it as a scaffolding

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.064
for the next thing.

00:06:39.064 --> 00:06:42.334
- Let's look at the
idea of the timeline.

00:06:42.334 --> 00:06:44.770 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
What is it, like seven
months to get there, right?

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.338 line:0%
Just to get there.

00:06:46.338 --> 00:06:51.243 line:0%
So we need to, right now,
start building up on that,

00:06:51.243 --> 00:06:54.280 align:start size:88% position:13%
and one of the most
recent attempts at that

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.684
is the year-long mission that
both the U.S. and the Russians

00:06:58.684 --> 00:07:00.152
took part in.

00:07:00.152 --> 00:07:03.922 align:start position:0%
U.S. astronaut Scott Kelly,
you can see here in this image,

00:07:03.922 --> 00:07:07.159
spent a whole year,
coming back in March,

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:10.229
exploring this whole
concept of what happens

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:12.064
to human body

00:07:13.365 --> 00:07:16.835 align:start size:97% position:3%
being exposed to microgravity
for long durations?

00:07:16.835 --> 00:07:20.739
So we're starting to
work on those aspects.

00:07:20.739 --> 00:07:23.942 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I'd like to know,
I mean, what toll

00:07:23.942 --> 00:07:25.544
does it take on the human body?

00:07:25.544 --> 00:07:27.713
What does space travel,
long term space travel,

00:07:27.713 --> 00:07:29.648
do to a human body?

00:07:29.648 --> 00:07:31.983 align:start size:88% position:13%
- The truth is we don't
really know, right?

00:07:31.983 --> 00:07:33.819
We've never done this before.

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:35.221
Commander Scott Kelly
and his colleagues

00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:37.323 align:start size:84% position:16%
were sort of the
first to stay in space

00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:38.557
as long as they did.

00:07:38.557 --> 00:07:42.160 align:start size:88% position:13%
And even there, they had
a lot more protection

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.896
from Earth, from the
sort of microgravity.

00:07:44.896 --> 00:07:46.532
Also, we were still
in the magnetosphere,

00:07:46.532 --> 00:07:48.267 align:start size:84% position:16%
so they had protection
from radiation.

00:07:48.267 --> 00:07:49.468 align:start size:84% position:16%
Still, more radiation
than they'd have

00:07:49.468 --> 00:07:50.669
if they were where we are,

00:07:50.669 --> 00:07:52.270 align:start size:84% position:16%
but we don't know
what's going to happen

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.207 align:start size:88% position:13%
when you put a person
in sort of interstellar,

00:07:55.207 --> 00:07:58.544 align:start size:84% position:16%
interplanetary travel
for seven months.

00:07:58.544 --> 00:07:59.812
We don't know.

00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:01.781
We know already that
you lose bone mass.

00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:03.883
We know that you've got
these radiation effects.

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:05.984 align:start size:94% position:6%
We have no idea about
the psychological impact.

00:08:05.984 --> 00:08:07.519 align:start size:88% position:13%
So these are all
things that we're still

00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:10.122
trying to understand, and
his mission, their mission

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:13.526 align:start size:97% position:3%
is critical to understanding
at least step one

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:14.760
in the process.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.297
So there's a lot
to be understood.

00:08:18.297 --> 00:08:21.033 align:start size:84% position:16%
- When we get there,
I'd like to know

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:23.335 align:start size:94% position:6%
how are we going to
choose the landing sites?

00:08:23.335 --> 00:08:26.538 align:start size:97% position:3%
Now, what I've got here
for you is the map of Mars,

00:08:26.538 --> 00:08:30.142 align:start size:97% position:3%
and these are potential
landing sites that we have.

00:08:30.142 --> 00:08:32.678
What goes in, Ray, maybe
you can speak to this,

00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:33.913
about choosing...

00:08:33.913 --> 00:08:35.414 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Well, there are
engineering aspects.

00:08:35.414 --> 00:08:36.548
There are science aspects.

00:08:36.548 --> 00:08:37.716
You want to go to a place that's

00:08:37.716 --> 00:08:40.019
scientifically interesting.

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:42.321 align:start size:88% position:13%
Could be layer
deposits that represent

00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:44.456 align:start size:84% position:16%
kind of ancient
riverbeds or lakes.

00:08:44.456 --> 00:08:48.293 align:start position:0%
It could be ancient hydrothermal
deposits from volcanoes,

00:08:48.293 --> 00:08:50.162
or whatever it turns out to be.

00:08:50.162 --> 00:08:51.930
But you also need
to land in a place

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.698
that you can get back out of.

00:08:53.698 --> 00:08:55.367
And that's the plus or minus 50.

00:08:55.367 --> 00:08:57.436
It's relatively easy
to go back into orbit.

00:08:57.436 --> 00:08:58.904
And not too cold,

00:08:58.904 --> 00:09:00.572 align:start size:84% position:16%
because Mars is
cold to begin with.

00:09:00.572 --> 00:09:03.241 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's way below
freezing on average.

00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:04.810
And if you go to
the high latitudes,

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.178
it's super cold.

00:09:06.178 --> 00:09:08.747
- You know, the ultimate
goal is to send humans.

00:09:08.747 --> 00:09:12.818
So what I'd like to know
is what do you guys think

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:14.554
in terms of the specialties?

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:18.157 align:start size:94% position:6%
What kind of people should
we be sending to Mars?

00:09:18.157 --> 00:09:20.058 align:start size:88% position:13%
- It's an important
point to recognize that

00:09:20.058 --> 00:09:22.995
going to Mars is going
to be what they call

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:24.630
sociotechnological.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.499
It is not just going
to be the technical

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:27.732
that takes us there.

00:09:27.732 --> 00:09:28.901 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's not just going
to be the sociological

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:30.269
or the psychological.

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:33.005 align:start position:0%
It is going to be the
interaction of those two things,

00:09:33.005 --> 00:09:35.174
the optimization of
those two things,

00:09:35.174 --> 00:09:36.342
that makes it happen.

00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:38.511 align:start size:88% position:13%
So, yeah, you want
people that have skills

00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:39.744
that are technical.

00:09:39.744 --> 00:09:42.214 align:start size:84% position:16%
You want them to be
able to fix things and

00:09:42.214 --> 00:09:43.515
create experiments.

00:09:43.515 --> 00:09:45.317
Physicians, you need
someone there in case

00:09:45.317 --> 00:09:46.585
you have medical emergencies.

00:09:46.585 --> 00:09:50.055
But you also want the
kind of mental stamina

00:09:50.055 --> 00:09:51.957
to be able to deal with
all of the conditions

00:09:51.957 --> 00:09:54.960
that you're going to
be sort of faced with.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.331
So as I look at it, I think
about not just your skills

00:09:59.331 --> 00:10:01.733
in terms of what you've
been educated to do,

00:10:01.733 --> 00:10:04.203 align:start size:84% position:16%
I think of a variety
of perspectives,

00:10:04.203 --> 00:10:07.640
of life experiences,
of outlooks on life,

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.142
because all of those things
are going to be necessary

00:10:10.142 --> 00:10:11.343
to make this work.

00:10:11.343 --> 00:10:13.745 align:start size:84% position:16%
So we need an
inclusive environment

00:10:13.745 --> 00:10:16.682
and an inclusive set of people.

00:10:16.682 --> 00:10:18.950 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Andrew] I guess growing
food is going to be important,

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:20.419
isn't it, Jedidah?

00:10:20.419 --> 00:10:22.988
- Yeah, so it's this idea
of being able to reuse

00:10:22.988 --> 00:10:25.457 align:start size:88% position:13%
and create a sense of
self-sufficiency, right?

00:10:25.457 --> 00:10:28.093 align:start size:84% position:16%
We cannot haul all the
food we'll ever eat

00:10:28.093 --> 00:10:30.195
to Mars if we go, if we stay.

00:10:30.195 --> 00:10:31.296
All of these questions.

00:10:31.296 --> 00:10:32.631
You just can't bring it.

00:10:32.631 --> 00:10:34.566 align:start size:84% position:16%
You've got to create
self-sufficiency

00:10:34.566 --> 00:10:36.101
and food security there.

00:10:36.101 --> 00:10:39.505 align:start size:94% position:6%
So the idea is that you'll
want to figure out ways

00:10:39.505 --> 00:10:41.240
to grow things on Mars.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.509 align:start size:97% position:3%
And not just for food, which
is going to be important,

00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:45.644 align:start size:84% position:16%
but again towards
that social component.

00:10:45.644 --> 00:10:47.880
You'll want something to
do that brings you closer

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.148
to nature.

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:51.183
We've seen Mars
is an arid place.

00:10:51.183 --> 00:10:55.053
There's not much happening
there, as we can see so far.

00:10:55.053 --> 00:10:56.455
So you want some green.

00:10:56.455 --> 00:10:57.956 align:start size:88% position:13%
You'll want to get
your hands in the dirt.

00:10:57.956 --> 00:10:59.158
You'll want to grow something,

00:10:59.158 --> 00:11:00.626
see it progress over time.

00:11:00.626 --> 00:11:03.762
So there's that mental
sort of restorative piece

00:11:03.762 --> 00:11:07.966
of going and being out
in nature, even on Mars.

00:11:07.966 --> 00:11:09.534
- I mean, that's interesting,

00:11:09.534 --> 00:11:12.304
but when we're talking
about going to Mars,

00:11:12.304 --> 00:11:13.872 align:start size:84% position:16%
to me this looks
like a candy wrapper.

00:11:13.872 --> 00:11:15.874 align:start size:84% position:16%
I don't know, but
there's trash on Mars

00:11:15.874 --> 00:11:17.543 align:start size:81% position:19%
right now already.
- Already.

00:11:17.543 --> 00:11:18.377
- Right? There's trash.

00:11:18.377 --> 00:11:19.211
I mean, we're already...

00:11:19.211 --> 00:11:20.479
- What can you do?

00:11:20.479 --> 00:11:21.913
I mean, it's probably a
piece of the sky crane.

00:11:21.913 --> 00:11:24.216
- Right, but we're
not living there.

00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:25.417
Humans aren't there yet.

00:11:25.417 --> 00:11:26.919
We're sending our stuff there.

00:11:26.919 --> 00:11:30.989
And then we're already
altering Mars, right?

00:11:30.989 --> 00:11:32.958 align:start size:84% position:16%
There's already
alterations of Mars,

00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:37.095 align:start size:97% position:3%
and there's talk about how
humans will be altered by Mars

00:11:37.095 --> 00:11:38.263
as well.

00:11:38.263 --> 00:11:39.898
There's a lot of
talk about that.

00:11:39.898 --> 00:11:41.800 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I want you guys to
check this little video out.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.903 align:start size:88% position:13%
This whole idea of
altering Mars and stuff.

00:11:44.903 --> 00:11:46.906
It's really fascinating.

00:11:48.907 --> 00:11:51.743
- Terraforming Mars
is not a small job.

00:11:51.743 --> 00:11:53.011
This is a massive project.

00:11:53.011 --> 00:11:55.114 line:0%
This is a bigger project
than anything humanity

00:11:55.114 --> 00:11:56.582 line:0%
has ever attempted.

00:11:56.582 --> 00:11:59.819 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- Terraforming is
taking an environment

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.623 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
such as Mars and making
it more Earthlike.

00:12:04.623 --> 00:12:08.861 line:0%
- Terraforming is like super
science fictiony right now.

00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:11.563 align:start position:0%
I don't think people
understand how big planets are,

00:12:11.563 --> 00:12:15.233
so terraforming one
is a ludicrous task.

00:12:15.233 --> 00:12:17.769 align:start size:94% position:6%
- You solve all the
problems except breathing.

00:12:17.769 --> 00:12:21.406
So once Mars is terraformed
and made more Earthlike,

00:12:21.406 --> 00:12:23.275
you're still going to have
to wear a helmet on your head

00:12:23.275 --> 00:12:27.012
of some sort or some kind
of breathing apparatus.

00:12:27.012 --> 00:12:31.817 line:0%
- Might we have the urge
to tinker with our DNA,

00:12:31.817 --> 00:12:36.822 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
such that you don't need
a spacesuit on Mars?

00:12:36.822 --> 00:12:38.724 line:0%
- We are on the edge
right now of being able

00:12:38.724 --> 00:12:42.360 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
to change our own genome
and our own genetics

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.364 line:0%
in our own bodies in real time.

00:12:45.364 --> 00:12:48.366 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Our ability to control
DNA, the programming language

00:12:48.366 --> 00:12:51.303
of life, helps us open up Mars.

00:12:51.303 --> 00:12:54.773
What happens if there
is a virus that drives

00:12:54.773 --> 00:12:59.044 align:start size:97% position:3%
some kind of a flu and
knocks out a large population

00:12:59.044 --> 00:13:00.745 align:start size:84% position:16%
or large percentage
of your group?

00:13:00.745 --> 00:13:03.348 line:0%
You can actually
sequence the virus,

00:13:03.348 --> 00:13:05.517 line:0%
send it back to
Earth to analyze,

00:13:05.517 --> 00:13:08.654 line:0%
and you can send back from Earth

00:13:08.654 --> 00:13:11.757
an upgraded T-cell.

00:13:11.757 --> 00:13:14.459 align:start size:84% position:16%
- If you do interfere
with our genome

00:13:14.459 --> 00:13:16.561
so that you can survive on Mars,

00:13:16.561 --> 00:13:19.765
you're pretty much going
through a one-way door

00:13:19.765 --> 00:13:23.868 align:start size:88% position:13%
and saying, I will
never go back to Earth.

00:13:23.868 --> 00:13:25.938
- We might very well
have a future in which

00:13:25.938 --> 00:13:27.872 align:start size:81% position:19%
you have different
kinds of humans

00:13:27.872 --> 00:13:29.941 align:start size:88% position:13%
that look very different
from each other.

00:13:29.941 --> 00:13:32.211 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Once we get computers
that are smarter than humans

00:13:32.211 --> 00:13:34.079
at thinking about stuff
and coming up with stuff,

00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:36.749
we can ask them to figure
out how to cure viruses.

00:13:36.749 --> 00:13:39.818 line:0%
- We can kind of tell them,
look, we want to explore,

00:13:39.818 --> 00:13:42.120 line:0%
and this is what
we'd like to do.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.524 line:0%
And then the robots, either
the rovers or the helicopters

00:13:45.524 --> 00:13:48.760 align:start size:88% position:13%
or the balloons can
make their own judgement

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.163
and actually do the exploration.

00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:54.099 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
- So ultimately we're
going to need things like

00:13:54.099 --> 00:13:57.335 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
machines that can make
machines if we want to have

00:13:57.335 --> 00:13:59.338 line:0%
a solar system civilization.

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:01.540 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Well, future technologies
that we're developing

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.610 align:start size:97% position:3%
on Earth now, like 3D
printing and electric cars,

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:07.278 align:start size:84% position:16%
can actually be
extremely useful to us

00:14:07.278 --> 00:14:11.750
in creating an outpost
of civilization on Mars.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:14.319
- Imagine being able
to send a 3D printer

00:14:14.319 --> 00:14:17.690
to the Martian surface that
sort of pulls the soil out,

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:20.492
adds some water, adds some
binder, and is sitting there

00:14:20.492 --> 00:14:24.529 align:start size:97% position:3%
3D printing shelters in
advance of a community coming.

00:14:24.529 --> 00:14:26.698 align:start size:84% position:16%
And you've got your
homes pre-built

00:14:26.698 --> 00:14:29.034
waiting for you right there.

00:14:30.001 --> 00:14:32.670
- So Jedidah, this is all nice,

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:36.475
but what happens if
we find life on Mars?

00:14:36.475 --> 00:14:38.042
Will our plans be altered?

00:14:38.042 --> 00:14:39.544
- I think they should be, right?

00:14:39.544 --> 00:14:42.681
Because now we've got to
understand and figure out

00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:45.717
what's happening, try not
to completely decimate

00:14:45.717 --> 00:14:49.487 align:start size:97% position:3%
their way of being and
life in terms of, probably,

00:14:49.487 --> 00:14:51.389
microbial structures and such.

00:14:51.389 --> 00:14:55.927 align:start size:88% position:13%
Also just small tidbit,
no terraforming.

00:14:55.927 --> 00:14:57.529
- No terraforming.

00:14:57.529 --> 00:14:58.363
Interesting.

00:14:58.363 --> 00:14:59.431
Why is that?

00:14:59.431 --> 00:15:01.100
- It's a stupid idea.

00:15:02.033 --> 00:15:04.703
- Okay. Why?

00:15:04.703 --> 00:15:05.971
- It's out of equilibrium.

00:15:05.971 --> 00:15:08.506
I mean, Mars is cold and
dry today for a reason.

00:15:08.506 --> 00:15:11.010
Early in geologic time,
there were volcanoes.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:13.278 align:start size:94% position:6%
There was a massive amount
of greenhouse warming

00:15:13.278 --> 00:15:14.679
from the gases coming up.

00:15:14.679 --> 00:15:17.115 align:start size:94% position:6%
Because it's small a
planet relative to Earth,

00:15:17.115 --> 00:15:21.319 align:start position:0%
it stopped its internal
activity sooner than the Earth.

00:15:21.319 --> 00:15:24.823 align:start size:97% position:3%
So the gases in the atmosphere
were on a one-way trip

00:15:24.823 --> 00:15:27.859
to be oxidized and
placed into minerals.

00:15:27.859 --> 00:15:30.663 align:start size:97% position:3%
So if you increase the amount
of sunlight with mirrors,

00:15:30.663 --> 00:15:33.464 align:start position:0%
or whatever, you can
sublimate, get more water vapor

00:15:33.464 --> 00:15:35.267
in the atmosphere, more rain.

00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:36.435
But what's going to happen?

00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:37.970 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's going to react
with the rocks

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:41.840
and go back down into the
subsurface eventually.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.643 align:start size:94% position:6%
There's a famous reaction
that was codified

00:15:44.643 --> 00:15:46.145
by Harold Urey.

00:15:46.145 --> 00:15:50.582 align:start size:97% position:3%
He's a very distinguished
Nobel Prize winning chemist.

00:15:50.582 --> 00:15:53.385 align:start size:88% position:13%
And it's the way the
Earth stays more or less

00:15:53.385 --> 00:15:54.819
the way we like it.

00:15:54.819 --> 00:15:56.288
Sometimes it goes
into deep freeze.

00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:58.056
Sometimes it's really warm.

00:15:58.056 --> 00:16:01.359
But what happens is, is the
volcanoes pump up the gases

00:16:01.359 --> 00:16:02.627
that keep us warm.

00:16:02.627 --> 00:16:05.464 align:start size:88% position:13%
But the hydrologic cycle
consumes those gases,

00:16:05.464 --> 00:16:08.333 align:start size:88% position:13%
as carbonic acids,
CO2 goes into the water,

00:16:08.333 --> 00:16:10.669
and it reacts and
forms limestones.

00:16:10.669 --> 00:16:12.704
But the limestones
go back downstairs,

00:16:12.704 --> 00:16:15.607 align:start size:84% position:16%
get decomposed, and
the gases come back up

00:16:15.607 --> 00:16:18.576
as greenhouse gases
through volcanoes.

00:16:18.576 --> 00:16:21.279
If you stop the internal engine,

00:16:21.279 --> 00:16:23.448 align:start size:84% position:16%
you go in the
one-way deep freeze.

00:16:23.448 --> 00:16:24.716
It's what happened to Mars,

00:16:24.716 --> 00:16:26.618 align:start size:84% position:16%
because it's smaller
than the Earth.

00:16:26.618 --> 00:16:28.653 align:start size:88% position:13%
So terraforming can
increase the temperature

00:16:28.653 --> 00:16:31.356
of the surface, but you
can get some gas out.

00:16:31.356 --> 00:16:32.925 align:start size:84% position:16%
But it will eventually
get corroded

00:16:32.925 --> 00:16:35.260
and put back down
into the subsurface

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.761
in a one-way trip.

00:16:36.761 --> 00:16:39.564
So it may work for
a couple decades,

00:16:39.564 --> 00:16:42.768
but over longer
time, it's bogus,

00:16:42.768 --> 00:16:43.936
in my opinion.

00:16:45.304 --> 00:16:48.473 align:start size:94% position:6%
- And also would decimate
whatever is there

00:16:48.473 --> 00:16:50.208
that we don't know yet.

00:16:50.208 --> 00:16:53.979 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, there's a very
important paradigm

00:16:53.979 --> 00:16:55.514
that all the nations
are following called

00:16:55.514 --> 00:16:57.182
Planetary Protection.

00:16:57.182 --> 00:17:00.151 align:start size:97% position:3%
So you sterilize spacecraft
before they're on the surface,

00:17:00.151 --> 00:17:02.454
because the worst thing
to have happen is to

00:17:02.454 --> 00:17:06.958 align:start size:88% position:13%
go to Mars in the future
and find ourselves.

00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:07.992
- All right, I have a question.

00:17:07.992 --> 00:17:10.062
One last question.

00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:13.665 align:start size:84% position:16%
If you could take
anything from Earth,

00:17:13.665 --> 00:17:15.833
any physical object on Earth,

00:17:15.833 --> 00:17:17.903
what would it be, and
you take it to Mars.

00:17:17.903 --> 00:17:19.137
Wouldn't you want to
take something to Mars?

00:17:19.137 --> 00:17:20.371
What would one thing be?

00:17:20.371 --> 00:17:23.341
- I'm going on my 47th
wedding anniversary,

00:17:23.341 --> 00:17:27.812
and I really like my wife,
so she would go with me.

00:17:27.812 --> 00:17:29.081
(audience applauding)

00:17:29.081 --> 00:17:32.017
- Nice. You get points.
You get points for that.

00:17:32.017 --> 00:17:32.851
- That's videotaped.

00:17:32.851 --> 00:17:33.685
- Is this being taped?

00:17:33.685 --> 00:17:34.520
- Yes it is.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.755
(audience laughing)
