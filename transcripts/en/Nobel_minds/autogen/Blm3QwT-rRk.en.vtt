just Jeff had talked about rhythms being
all around us and I think this is an

all around us and I think this is an

all around us and I think this is an
example my wife were out on and I were

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630

out on a hike a few summers ago in New
 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.699
out on a hike a few summers ago in New
Mexico and we came across this whoops

came across this plant which is called

came across this plant which is called
 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.240
came across this plant which is called
the Colorado four o'clock and what I

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250
the Colorado four o'clock and what I
 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.620
the Colorado four o'clock and what I
want you to notice is that all the

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630
want you to notice is that all the
 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.340
want you to notice is that all the
blooms are closed and notice this this

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350
blooms are closed and notice this this
 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.560
blooms are closed and notice this this
little branch here just so you know I'm

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570
little branch here just so you know I'm
 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.760

I'm not I'm playing straight this is it

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770
I'm not I'm playing straight this is it
 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.440
I'm not I'm playing straight this is it
two o'clock when we're going out on the

two o'clock when we're going out on the
 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.360
two o'clock when we're going out on the
hike two hours later or a few hours

hike two hours later or a few hours
 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.080
hike two hours later or a few hours
later we come back and we see this at 6

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090
later we come back and we see this at 6
 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.960
later we come back and we see this at 6
p.m. so this remarkable plant rhythm is

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970
p.m. so this remarkable plant rhythm is
 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.680
p.m. so this remarkable plant rhythm is
believed to be due to the behavior of

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:19.250
time down and when they get out of bed
 

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:21.399
time down and when they get out of bed
they put another mark in the log so we

00:19:21.399 --> 00:19:21.409
they put another mark in the log so we
 

00:19:21.409 --> 00:19:25.509
they put another mark in the log so we
have two correlated pieces of data to

00:19:25.509 --> 00:19:25.519
have two correlated pieces of data to
 

00:19:25.519 --> 00:19:28.210
have two correlated pieces of data to
consider so the the the way the data are

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:28.220

plotted here is to plot not just 24

00:19:30.519 --> 00:19:30.529

hours but 48 hour intervals in this

00:19:34.289 --> 00:19:34.299
hours but 48 hour intervals in this
 

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:36.820
hours but 48 hour intervals in this
process and what this allows us to do is

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:36.830
process and what this allows us to do is
 

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:40.299
process and what this allows us to do is
compare the time that each end that the

and finally as I mentioned it's
 

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:19.270
and finally as I mentioned it's
sufficient to express just this one gene

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:19.280
