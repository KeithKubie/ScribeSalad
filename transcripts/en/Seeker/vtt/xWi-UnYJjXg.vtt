00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.230
Smartphones have revolutionized how we talk
to each other, play with each other, and help

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:14.959
each other -- so why not how we science each
other?

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.750
Let's say science needs your help, or sometimes,
you need science's help -- but who ya gonna

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:20.750
call?

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.750
NOT THE GHOSTPEOPLES.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.590
Instead, let's do the science ourselves!

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.460
This isn't a new idea.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.630
In 1999 the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence
released a screensaver that let internet-connected

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.820
computers all over the world help SETI churn
through massive amounts of data.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.940
When the computer was idle, the screensaver
would pop up and data analysis would begin!

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.940
Simple!

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.990
But distributed computing was just one way
citizens could help research and science.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.750
Today, scientists all over the world are beginning
to harness the power of these little computers

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.310
we carry in our collective pockets; by crowdsourcing
scientific research.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.650
Accessories are being used to monitor the
movement of bats and birds, map meteoroids,

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.160
and track temperatures; and some apps are
even being used to treat depression using

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.830
self-help treatments administered via smartphone.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.720
But one of my favorites takes advantage of
something we already doâ€¦ take pictures of

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.720
wildlife.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.670
The Networked Organisms and Habitats project
has an app that lets people take photos of

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.670
plants and animals and send it to Project
NOAH for identification!

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.490
You can even complete missions, like logging
GPS locations for flocks of birds, or photographing

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.470
specific insects near your home.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.970
The camera is a super-power for the smartphone.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.630
Smartphone lenses are built in to the devices
themselves, but often little attachments can

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.890
be purchased to add wide-angles, zoom functions
or, in science's case, magnification.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.610
A 3-cent lens was developed for use with smartphones
in classrooms.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.130
Normally, schools have to buy microscopes
for students, and many have to share because

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:57.110
they can cost as much as 10,000 dollars; but
for simple experiments, these lenses allow

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.620
up to 120 times magnification, revealing cellular-level
details for less than the cost of a single

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.729
text message.

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.840
Taking that idea even further, researchers
at the University of California Los Angeles,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.459
developed a tool that allows any smartphone
to analyze DNA!

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.220
DNA is tiny, even stretched out it's only
two nanometers long (50,000 times thinner

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.960
than a human hair), so the device comes with
a lens to magnify the little bugger.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.520
The lens is housed in a 3D-printed attachment
and pictures can be taken using an app and

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.560
the phone's camera!

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.160
Then, the app communicates with UCLA's servers
and analyzes the data.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.110
The whole process takes ten seconds and according
to their announcement, "could help diagnose

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.630
various types of cancers and nervous system
disorders, such as Alzheimer's, as well as

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.220
detect drug resistance in infectious diseases"
while in the field.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.040
Field testing is a huge market for smartphone
accessories, and thanks to another attachment

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.030
doctors in Rwanda have been able to test for
potentially deadly viruses like HIV and syphilis

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.950
without a lab, or even electricity.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.709
The device, developed by researchers from
more than a half-dozen universities, government

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.879
agencies, laboratories and companies, pricks
a finger (like a test for diabetes) and performs

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:15.430
an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or ELISA
test using power from the battery in the phone

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.500
to run the pumps and analyze the results.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.550
Normally, blood has to be collected and sent
to a lab, but this 34 dollar accessory has

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:29.220
a tiny vacuum chamber, and can accept pre-filled
cartridges of reagents which allow it to automatically

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.800
complete the tests in only 15 minutes.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.290
When we add-up all the conveniences for researchers,
it's easy to see how these smartphone accessories

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.900
could change science forever.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.440
Do you use any science apps?

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.930
Recommend some in the comments!

a whole week on a single science topic!

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.959
It's so fun.

00:03:52.959 --> 00:04:08.549
