00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Catherine from New Hampshire has a second question.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
"What are students allowed to talk about related to homework questions

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
on the forums and outside to other students?"

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is a good question.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It's great to see all the discussion on the forums.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We do want students to be able to discuss questions on the forums to

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
provide hints if people get stuck.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
What we don't want is for people to give out the actual answers, 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and for you to submit homework when you didn't understand it

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
or solve it yourself.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I am on the forums often as many people who post on the forums know.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I often comment and answer questions. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I do look very closely at the questions related to the homework.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I remove anything that I deem over the line.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So far, I've been really impressed with students policing themselves and

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
restricting themselves to not giving away answers.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I've been really impressed.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Where I usually draw the line is step-by-step solutions--

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
start one, do this; step two, do this; or a general framework for how

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
to solve the problem.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The other thing that's over the line is posting code.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
That just has the answer and says, "here's how you solve it."

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
That's no good.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
In general, though, I don't really want to police the forum that strictly.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I want to encourage students to have a conversation, talk about the problems,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and help each other through them.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I think that really is the way you learn.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
If the problem is hard, start getting some hints on how to get started,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
but still work out the solution yourself.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Using the forums to do that is a great way to learn more 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and to be able to understand the homework problems.
