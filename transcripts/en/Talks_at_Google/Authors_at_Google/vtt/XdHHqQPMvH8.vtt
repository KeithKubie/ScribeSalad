&gt;&gt;Winnie Lam: Hi, everyone. I'm Winnie Lam
in product management. Thank you so much to

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.180
everyone for coming.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.160
It's my honor, here, to introduce John and
Patricia Adams here to Google from the NRDC;

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.360
the Natural Resources Defense Council. In
just a few weeks’ time, President Obama

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.330
will be presenting to a select few Americans,
our highest civilian honor, the Presidential

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.860
Medal of Freedom.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:34.920
One of these few Americans receiving the honor
is John Adams, right here.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.760
[applause]

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.340
John is a true environmental hero and legend.
With his wife, Patricia, he founded the NRDC

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.340
back in 1970.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.340
&gt;&gt;Bill: It's really a pleasure to have you
guys here. This is my first chance here to

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.340
play Oprah Winfrey, so I hope I do OK.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.340
[laughter]

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.340
I wanted to add -- I noticed in the citation,
I think, that Obama is listed on the website

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.340
about the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.340
One of the quotes, I think was from Rolling
Stone, said, "If the planet had a lawyer,

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.340
it would be John Adams." Which I think, from
what I know about John and about NRDC is very

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.340
apt.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.340
So, why don't we start?

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.340
You've been at NRDC; you've been at this business
now for 40 years and long before that. Why

00:00:52.340 --> 00:01:17.030
did you write the book?

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:27.790
&gt;&gt;Pat Adams: Well, we wrote this book together
because over the 40 years that NRDC has been

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.459
growing, we've known a lot of individuals
who've made an enormous difference.

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:38.490
And the story of NRDC really is the story
of people who had ideas, wanted to make a

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.659
difference in the environmental world, and
took action.

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.969
And we wanted to highlight and herald those
individuals, as well as the founders who started

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:54.280
NRDC in 1970. And there's a story about how
that got started. We may get to that later.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.579
So, we wanted to write about the people who
built NRDC, the history, and also, to consider

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.490
it sort of a blueprint. I mean, the story
is not over. It's really just beginning in

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.289
many ways and so, this will serve as a blueprint
and a challenge for the future, we think.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:16.260
&gt;&gt;John Adams: I look back at the founding
of NRDC and I think about Stephen Duggan,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:23.629
now long gone, and James Marshall, Bob Marshall's
brother, who was a great wilderness person,

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:29.879
and James Marshall was a great environmentalist
from the Adirondacks and helped write the

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.720
state law that protects the Adirondacks and
the Catskills; the Forever Wild clauses; and

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.340
a whole range of people like this who none
of you will have heard of, except through

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.489
this book.

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:49.140
The book starts 40 years ago, and NRDC has
half of its people are 30 or under. So they

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.230
obviously didn't know any of these wonderful
people and now they will.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.670
We've created a mark for them and they helped
set up the first environmental law firm in

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:06.390
the country. And we have grown, now, to be
a 1,300,000 members and activists and have

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.819
400 professional people working at NRDC, and
we needed to record what happened and how

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:12.870
did it happen.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.769
And finally, I transitioned out of NRDCs presidency
three or more years ago. And Frances Beinecke,

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:28.000
a wonderful person, has taken over and a lot
of people were saying, "How, after 36 years,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.519
did the transition happen so well, that Frances
is now a respected leader of NRDC?" And we

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.580
wanted to talk about that and let people know
that you can have a transition, that we want

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.580
a future.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.170
NRDC has to be around in the future and we're
very, very proud that the transition worked

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.830
so well and NRDC is even stronger with the
transition.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.959
&gt;&gt;Bill: It's nice to hear that leadership
transitions can go well. I think all of us

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.840
here, at Google, are hoping and expecting
that that will happen.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.709
So, NRDC was founded just over 40 years ago,
I guess. Can you tell a little bit about the

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.609
story about what actually inspired it and
how it was born?

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.109
&gt;&gt;John Adams: Do you want it?

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.439
&gt;&gt;Pat Adams: I'll just start if off, okay?

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:19.690
1970 was a time when there were a lot of things
going on--I'm not gonna say "as you remember"--but

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.970
as you read about in your history books.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:22.970
[laughter]

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.010
The Woman’s Movement, the Civil Rights Movement,
the Peace Movement, the early stories of the

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.070
Gay Movement, and there was a lot of energy
in the air and a feeling that something could

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.070
be done.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.360
And also, it played out in the environmental
world.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.440
The Cuyahoga River was burning, Rachel Carson's
book about DDT had made a big difference,

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.110
and so, there was real energy, an idea, to
really start something new and something that

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.560
could represent the environment.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.920
And it was the first group who got this idea,
was a group of quite well-heeled lawyers and

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.380
people who lived up in the Hudson River Valley.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.510
And Con Edison had proposed to put a pump
storage plant on Storm King Mountain, a beautiful

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.480
mountain, sort of the icon of the Hudson Highlands.
And that would have meant that the top of

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.980
the mountain would have been gouged out and
billions of fish and larvae would have been

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.840
sucked in to bring in the water, and there
was a great reason for this not to be done.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.980
So, they fought this battle against Con Edison
building the plant. And what they realized

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.410
as they worked on it was how expensive it
was and how few communities would be able

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.660
to mount this kind of battle against a large
industry, or a large corporation.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:41.100
So they thought it was time to start a national
organization, built on the NAACP pattern,

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.240
and I'll let John talk more about that.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.260
&gt;&gt;John Adams: Yeah, I guess it's appropriate
to talk about what happened very quickly thereafter.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:56.180
I was at the US Attorney's office and been
a litigator in working on criminal matters

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.970
for five years, but we had a farm in the Catskills.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:06.260
And so, everybody at the US Attorney’s office
knew of my interest in the environment and

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:13.540
a lot of them knew Patricia. And so this group
of lawyers and others came to me and said,

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.520
"Would you like to try to start the first
public interest law firm in the environmental

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.070
field?"

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:26.350
And so, we decided that it was something we
would like to do. It was a little risky to

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:33.100
do it. We had three children and there wasn't
any money involved and we had to go out and

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.160
raise the money to start NRDC.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:44.760
But it looked like something that fitted my
personality quite well. So, we went to Ford

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:50.940
Foundation and Ford Foundation indicated that
they would give us some funding -- in fact,

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.340
a lot of funding.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:07:00.260
They recommended that I meet with a group
of young lawyers from Yale; four were clerking

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:06.170
down on the Supreme Court, several of them
were Rhode Scholars, they were all very special

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.600
people and have turned out to be very special
people.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.710
Gus Speth, John Bryson, these are people who
are nationally known in the environmental

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:22.460
and energy field. And so, we met and we had
a long discussions about could we work with

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:31.880
them and they were very strong in their feelings
about corporate America, and they didn't trust

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.370
anyone my age, even though I was only--

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:39.440
&gt;&gt;Pat Adams: Never trust anyone over 30.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.440
[laughter]

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.180
&gt;&gt;John Adams: So, that three years put me
at a disadvantage.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:51.470
But we worked at reaching an agreement about
what it would be if we were able to start

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:59.460
this organization and we agreed it would be
a collegial place where we work together to

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:04.050
build a program of environmental protection.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:08.460
It would be from the environmental point of
view, not from the corporate point of view;

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:14.720
that we would have a way of working together
that would be shared.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:22.120
And when we were all done, even though it
was a difficult team to swallow, they obviously

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:30.210
were very, very talented and when we got started,
it was the beginning of the modern environmental

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.460
movement.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:37.459
The first environmental laws were being written:
the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, NEEPA,

00:08:37.459 --> 00:08:39.919
and then all of the other statutes.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:48.050
All of this took place very, very quickly
after NRDC was started on January 2nd, 1970.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:53.900
And with this smart group of people, we had
a real edge -- though certain things happened

00:08:53.900 --> 00:09:02.140
that really almost stopped us from succeeding,
but I'll wait until we go further on the questions.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:10.740
&gt;&gt;Bill: So, I'm not quite as old as you guys
are, but I think I'm quite a bit older than

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.760
some of the folks here.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.070
I think, actually, you said half the folks
at NRDC are under 30 -- that's probably true

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:22.420
here at Google, or more or less. But I was
around in the early days of the environmental

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.420
movement.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:27.930
I was in school. I remember Rachel Carson's
book. I remember the Sierra Club starting

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.480
up and so on. Not starting up, but certainly
becoming much more prominent.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:37.500
I'm curious, what separated NRDC and the approach
that you took there from other environmental

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.920
groups, as this movement really took off in
the late 60s and the 70s?

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:52.260
&gt;&gt;John Adams: Well, first of all, we had these
new laws and a lot of the new laws were to

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.000
be written.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:02.810
And Ford Foundation funded six really talented
lawyers and we were there to help write these

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:07.860
statutes. And the strength that NRDC brought
to the environmental movement was that we

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:13.021
were able to write these statutes and then
we were able to get the rules and regulations

00:10:13.021 --> 00:10:17.580
that we used to enforce those statutes and
make them strong.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:24.550
And not only did we work on the rules and
regulations, but then, immediately, the industrial

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:30.270
sector came in and tried to get an advantage
under the rules and regulations, and we then

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:36.460
challenged any of the regulations that they
were trying to change.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:42.750
And we learned more about the Clean Air Act
and the Clean Water Act and NEEPA than any

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:46.260
other body, including the Environmental Protection
Agency.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:53.270
We knew these laws inside out and as we were
doing this, we were able to grow NRDC almost

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.270
immediately.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:58.660
So, we had the Ford Foundation Grant, we opened
up a Washington office immediately.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:10.040
Two years later, we opened up our office at
Palo Alto. But the team went to work on litigation,

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:16.330
writing the laws, challenging the rules and
regulations, and gaining mastery over the

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:23.881
now developing regulatory framework that would
govern all of the environmental protection

00:11:23.881 --> 00:11:28.070
measures for the next 40 years until today.

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:34.430
These same rules and regulations govern how
we deal with the environment, and I can honestly

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:40.830
say NRDC owns these laws. And the people that
are doing the work at NRDC, a lot of them

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:46.029
are still with us and they have continued
to know these laws and continued to protect

00:11:46.029 --> 00:11:47.029
these statutes.

00:11:47.029 --> 00:11:55.660
So, why were we different? Because nobody
else had this legal team. We quickly added

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.420
scientists.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:04.660
By 1973, we had several nuclear physicists
and a couple of biologists and we were heading

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:11.290
in a direction where our lawyers became scientists,
our scientists became lawyers, and we actually

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:16.779
were very merged in how we approached almost
all of the work that we did and it became

00:12:16.779 --> 00:12:19.490
a great place to work.

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:27.220
The people like Gus Speth, who then became
the head of a range of organizations, including

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:32.930
the United Nations Development Program, and
then the Yale School of the Environment, he

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:39.890
and others from our staff attracted people
just like them and we kept building this strength

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:45.120
of talent, which I think, probably fits the
arc of Google.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:50.820
You guys have smart people who started it
and smart people wanted to come and work with

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.280
them. And NRDC really has followed that model.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:13:03.250
Another thing that we did that I thought really
made a big difference, NRDC let people go.

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:08.990
We set them off on a range of issues. I mean,
we were just a handful of people in the beginning,

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:15.040
but one person was chosen to work on forestry.
Another was chosen to work on clean air. Another

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.920
was chosen to work on clean water. Another
was brought in to work on the nuclear issues

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.839
and nuclear safety issues.

00:13:21.839 --> 00:13:27.400
Well, to make any kind of headway on these
issues, you really had to be entrepreneurial.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.370
You had to raise money. You had to bring in
new staff. You had to find people who were

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:36.630
talented and determined that you were gonna
have a big impact on the outcome, and that's

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:43.029
exactly what we did to build NRDC and compete
with all of the other organizations.

00:13:43.029 --> 00:13:48.200
Finally, if you were the Sierra Club, you
wanted NRDC around because we would bring

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.770
your litigation; it was like free beer.

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:58.160
And it made a big difference and we were very
careful to let everybody know that we were

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:05.029
part of the team. We weren't NRDC, with the
headline, we weren't the lead plaintiffs,

00:14:05.029 --> 00:14:12.580
we were a team. And that has stayed with NRDC
and really built our reputation throughout

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:17.550
the environmental movement as team players
that you can trust.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.520
&gt;&gt;Pat Adams: I just wanna add one thing.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.730
I'm not a lawyer, so I learned a lot as we
were working on this book together, and those

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:28.160
early legal questions, I found interesting
about who represents the environment?

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:33.980
Who is the plaintiff, here? We have a chapter
called "Does a Tree Have Standing?" And those

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:41.180
were the issues, legal issues, that were being
discussed and in a way, what's said, set NRDC

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:42.180
apart in those early years.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:48.050
&gt;&gt;Bill: It does sound remarkably like Google
in terms of a small set of founders with enormous

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:49.160
passion.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:55.040
But at the same time, deep technical expertise
and technical expertise first in law and then

00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:00.420
something that you expanded. NRDC really did
begin as a law firm.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:05.750
You mentioned that the evolution, or expansion
into really bringing in scientists. It's since

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:13.190
evolved into policy, science, as you mentioned,
business, not just the legal side. How did

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:16.460
this happen and how has that worked?

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:20.930
&gt;&gt;Pat Adams: Well, talking to a number of
people and watching NRDC grow as we went back

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:26.020
over the history, people use such terms as
"adding tools to the toolbox", "paints to

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:30.930
the pallet," but as needs grew, NRDC found
ways to meet those needs.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:36.620
And about every ten years or so, there seemed
to be a new great need. The 70s were pretty

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:40.930
environmentally friendly, President Carter,
but when Reagan came in and he was gonna cut

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:45.830
back all of those laws, and suddenly, NRDC
realized they needed a better communications

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:50.550
systems and better memberships so that they
could represent them.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:55.709
And then there was the 104th Congress, when
we realized that we needed an advocacy program

00:15:55.709 --> 00:16:02.310
and then the climate situation has developed
where NRDC realizes they need more scientists

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:04.520
and people who are experts in climate.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:12.740
So, in that sense, NRDC constantly is adding
to its staff, but with very specific departments.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:22.560
&gt;&gt;John Adams: Patricia has mentioned them,
but through 1985, we didn't have a single

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.300
person working on communications.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:30.540
Every lawyer and scientist was his own communicator.
And clearly, that wasn't good enough for what

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:40.600
we needed. And in 1992, when we had the Republican
election and Newt Gingrich came in, it so

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:46.040
happened that NRDC had just finished a capital
campaign; the first capital campaign that

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.200
we ever had.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:55.740
And I should say that from 1970, we had a
slow growth every year and every year we would

00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:02.810
just barely make our budget, but it grew.
And by 1990, we had about something on the

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:15.490
order of about a 100,000 members and along
came the 104th Congress. They were gonna rewrite

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:17.639
all the environmental laws.

00:17:17.639 --> 00:17:24.240
So we immediately decided that we needed to
expand the environmental organizations into

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:29.529
an association. And the association was called
the Green Group, and I became the Chair.

00:17:29.529 --> 00:17:36.230
So, the Green Group decided to meet Newt Gingrich
in the challenge, right dead on, even though

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:43.919
we had a Republican House and a Republican
Senate. And what we did is we hired a very

00:17:43.919 --> 00:17:49.379
talented communications person and brought
in a bunch of staff to work with that communications

00:17:49.379 --> 00:17:50.379
person.

00:17:50.379 --> 00:17:55.809
The second thing is we really built up our
membership. We started writing letters about

00:17:55.809 --> 00:18:00.869
the threat to Newt Gingrich to the environmental
laws around the country and lo and behold,

00:18:00.869 --> 00:18:08.539
our membership went from 125,000 to 300,000.
And then it continued to grow beyond that.

00:18:08.539 --> 00:18:14.149
And we also set up an advocacy center, which
has been a hallmark of NRDC ever since 1990

00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:23.539
and 1994. And that advocacy center, we hired
the best people who had worked for the various

00:18:23.539 --> 00:18:28.460
committees--environmental committees-- and
were out of office and gone, and we brought

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:31.690
them in as the staff for our advocacy center.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:38.860
And Annie Notthoff then became the head of
the NRDC advocacy office here in California,

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:44.210
but we had an office in Washington that was
the best in the business and really the only

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:49.899
one that was set up to meet the kind of challenge
that we were faced. And that's what we did.

00:18:49.899 --> 00:18:57.179
And then, as we went on, Patricia mentioned
climate, we were able to go and get a ten

00:18:57.179 --> 00:19:03.470
million dollar grant from a Californian to
set up a climate center. That center became

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:11.600
how we directed our efforts at passing a climate
bill and our team here, and Noah and Roland

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:17.580
are here in the back, and they've been working
on energy efficiency.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:23.619
And we'll talk more about that, I think, in
a couple of minutes, but we grew our energy

00:19:23.619 --> 00:19:28.820
team because we knew that we needed that if
we were gonna really fight on the climate

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:31.740
issue. So, that team numbers now 75 people.

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.169
[pause]

00:19:34.169 --> 00:19:43.049
&gt;&gt;Bill: You mentioned the growth in membership.
I'm curious what role membership has played

00:19:43.049 --> 00:19:44.299
in the organization.

00:19:44.299 --> 00:19:52.619
Is it simply a matter of funding? Is it more
a matter of grass roots advocacy? How has

00:19:52.619 --> 00:19:55.309
that really strengthened the organization?

00:19:55.309 --> 00:19:59.669
How have you relied on it? And has that changed
in the last, say, five or ten years with the

00:19:59.669 --> 00:20:03.649
growth of the Internet and so on?

00:20:03.649 --> 00:20:07.859
&gt;&gt;Pat Adams: Membership was always an issue.
John always advocated writing and getting

00:20:07.859 --> 00:20:10.059
members and certain people at NRDC.

00:20:10.059 --> 00:20:13.320
The management was saying, "How much money
does it cost to send out the letter? What

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.379
kind of return do we get? Do we really wanna
put money in that?"

00:20:16.379 --> 00:20:22.730
But John was always really strong about building
the membership. But when it really built was

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:32.470
in the 90s, when an issue became known in
Baja, San Ignacio, in Mexico, and we were

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:38.049
told that Jacob Scherr actually, one of the
lawyers, got a call from Homero Aridjis, who

00:20:38.049 --> 00:20:43.169
is a poet from Mexico that Mitsubishi was
planning to build a big salt plant down in

00:20:43.169 --> 00:20:48.600
this lagoon where the grey whales come down
from Alaska, the Bering Sea, and it’s a

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.269
nursery for the baby whales.

00:20:50.269 --> 00:20:55.989
And if you can imagine what a large salt plant
would do; it was an International Heritage

00:20:55.989 --> 00:21:00.429
Site, a UN Heritage site. But bringing in
the boats, sucking up all the water, and then

00:21:00.429 --> 00:21:03.710
the salt being carried back out -- what was
gonna happen to the whale nursery?

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:10.350
Well, NRDC doesn't have legal standing in
Mexico. You can't exactly bring a lawsuit.

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:13.919
So, the way this was developed was through
really a campaign.

00:21:13.919 --> 00:21:19.249
This was really the first Internet work that
NRDC did. And they were able to get the message

00:21:19.249 --> 00:21:24.960
out and letters from all over the world came
in to tell Mitsubishi to stop and not build

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:29.119
this salt plant. And the membership increased.

00:21:29.119 --> 00:21:33.539
A lot of public attention was brought to it
and it was a great victory. And those members

00:21:33.539 --> 00:21:37.899
came in and have pretty much stayed and membership
has also grown since then.

00:21:37.899 --> 00:21:45.749
&gt;&gt;John Adams: I'll finish on that. The lagoon
in San Ignacio -- we didn't know whether we

00:21:45.749 --> 00:21:52.989
could save this nursery, which is quite a
remarkable place and I urge you to see it.

00:21:52.989 --> 00:21:55.109
It's eco-tourism now.

00:21:55.109 --> 00:21:59.799
The Mexican fishermen take you out in the
boats, the baby whales come up and kiss you

00:21:59.799 --> 00:22:01.649
and it really is true--

00:22:01.649 --> 00:22:04.230
&gt;&gt;Pat Adams: You kiss them, John.

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:06.390
&gt;&gt;John Adams: I kiss them.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:07.390
[laughter]

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:15.370
It’s a remarkable place and so, we started
using the Internet to get in touch with people

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:19.910
and sending out letters and ads and everything
else that you could do with the communications

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:22.399
team.

00:22:22.399 --> 00:22:27.750
Pierce Brosnan became the spokesman for this
fight and he went on radio and television

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:30.779
and we had wonderful ad campaigns.

00:22:30.779 --> 00:22:36.649
And believe it or not, we were able to send
out five million letters to Mitsubishi and

00:22:36.649 --> 00:22:38.739
the Mexican government.

00:22:38.739 --> 00:22:47.520
The president of Mitsubishi Cars came to visit
me in the office in New York on three different

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:53.239
occasions, and he would say, "It's Mitsubishi
Chemical. It’s not Mitsubishi Cars."

00:22:53.239 --> 00:22:54.239
[laughter]

00:22:54.239 --> 00:22:58.440
And I would say, "Tell it to them."

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:07.789
And it was a classic battle using law, science,
and communications, and the power of membership.

00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:14.239
And we learned a lesson there that we have
used on every battle about our BioGems, about

00:23:14.239 --> 00:23:20.679
the landscapes that we think are really important,
like Yellowstone and the bears and the wolves,

00:23:20.679 --> 00:23:26.140
the Arctic, and various places in Central
America, South America, that we're working

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.289
on.

00:23:27.289 --> 00:23:33.040
And the tactics that we're using are really
developed out of that membership. But I have

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:37.619
to say that from the beginning, we needed
the members for standing.

00:23:37.619 --> 00:23:42.840
If you wanna bring a lawsuit, you have to
have the standing to bring a lawsuit. You

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:48.500
have to bring somebody who's injured, or has
some relationship to the property that you

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.239
care about.

00:23:50.239 --> 00:23:57.220
And for NRDC to build its membership, we had
members everywhere. We brought 500 water pollution

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:04.720
lawsuits based on the Clean Water Act. The
members were signed up. We would talk with

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:10.450
them. They would write affidavits about why
the project that we're dealing with on water

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:17.139
pollution was impacting their use of the landscape,
and so on and so forth.

00:24:17.139 --> 00:24:24.419
Until the field of standing became very strong
for us, we still use it. We still need that.

00:24:24.419 --> 00:24:31.249
But I wouldn’t be able to have a straight
face if I didn't tell you that 35,000,000

00:24:31.249 --> 00:24:38.480
dollars a year of income comes from that membership,
and that is about one-third of the total income

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.809
that NRDC has.

00:24:40.809 --> 00:24:49.059
And so, all the way around, it’s a very,
very important part of the strength of NRDC.

00:24:49.059 --> 00:24:55.039
&gt;&gt;Bill: So, maybe we could switch gears a
little bit and talk about California, since

00:24:55.039 --> 00:24:59.799
it’s very close to home, here. California,
I think we all know, has been a leader on

00:24:59.799 --> 00:25:05.309
energy and environmental issues for decades;
certainly since the 70s, maybe before.

00:25:05.309 --> 00:25:10.369
And in your book, you talk about how NRDC
has really been in lockstep with what's going

00:25:10.369 --> 00:25:12.869
on in California from very early on.

00:25:12.869 --> 00:25:17.619
Could you talk a little bit about what some
of the big successes have been in California?

00:25:17.619 --> 00:25:19.229
Maybe failures, if there have been any?

00:25:19.229 --> 00:25:22.499
But also, just how that has evolved?

00:25:22.499 --> 00:25:32.190
&gt;&gt;John Adams: Well, NRDC came to California
in 1972, and came to Stanford and one of the

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:38.450
first lawyers--one of the Yale group-- was
John Bryson. He became, ultimately, the head

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:45.379
of the Public Utility Commission here at a
very young age, and then from there, became

00:25:45.379 --> 00:25:50.740
Chairman of Southern California Edison and
then Southern California International.

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:58.059
And he obviously learned a lot about energy
from our team and we learned a lot about a

00:25:58.059 --> 00:26:04.690
lot of California energy issues from John's
work at the PUC and elsewhere.

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:10.769
So we were smart enough to hire Ralph Cavanagh
and David Goldstein. I don't know if you've

00:26:10.769 --> 00:26:16.119
heard of either of these two folks, but Ralph
is really one of the great geniuses of energy

00:26:16.119 --> 00:26:23.190
efficiency and really changed the equation
about how environmentalists look at energy

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:25.590
and the production of energy.

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:35.169
His work in Washington and Oregon, with the
Bonneville Power and the Oregon and Washington

00:26:35.169 --> 00:26:42.769
utilities, was basically arguing that the
least cost is the way to go on energy production,

00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:47.149
because he always felt that efficiency would
be the least cost.

00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:52.690
And then we get a Hood River project up there
where he finally got everyone to agree that

00:26:52.690 --> 00:27:00.739
we would take one community and it had about
35,000 people -- that's my recollection -- and

00:27:00.739 --> 00:27:06.850
using the public utilities up there, they
would fund all the efficiency that you could

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:10.470
fund in the whole city of Hood River.

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:16.240
And it turned out to be a miracle. They didn't
have to build a power plant. It reduced the

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:22.590
use of energy, and for the first time, people
really realized that you could, instead of

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:28.129
building new power plants and increasing energy,
you could actually reduce the use of energy

00:27:28.129 --> 00:27:30.529
through efficiency.

00:27:30.529 --> 00:27:37.789
So, David Goldstein, a physicist who went
to Berkeley and really is one of the brightest

00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:45.050
people in the country working on these issues,
he is a MacArthur Fellow winner and he won

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:54.590
his fellowship, the MacArthur Genius Award,
because he organized efficiency in lots of

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:59.899
the things that we all use in our houses,
particularly refrigerators. And he wanted

00:27:59.899 --> 00:28:06.179
to prove that they could cut down the use
of energy in California through efficiency

00:28:06.179 --> 00:28:07.179
in refrigerators.

00:28:07.179 --> 00:28:14.159
So, he worked on something he called the "Golden
Carrot Award." He got some 25 utilities to

00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:22.179
put up around 25,000,000 dollars for a winner-take-all
competition. Whoever built the most efficient

00:28:22.179 --> 00:28:24.820
refrigerator got all of the money.

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:30.109
The competition took a year; Whirlpool won
it and now all the refrigerators throughout

00:28:30.109 --> 00:28:38.279
the United States meet the Golden Carrot efficiency
level. Amazing circumstances because refrigerators

00:28:38.279 --> 00:28:42.190
really use a lot of energy around the world,
around our country.

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:49.519
And for us to be able to see this transformation
through the work of David Goldstein. Well,

00:28:49.519 --> 00:28:55.759
that led to the building of an efficiency
team, in California, that is really the best

00:28:55.759 --> 00:28:57.549
in the world.

00:28:57.549 --> 00:29:04.149
And we just had lunch with Noah and Roland,
and we talked about what they were doing,

00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:06.729
and Annie Notthoff.

00:29:06.729 --> 00:29:13.940
So, the things that happened following David
Goldstein, is to look at really all the uses

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:20.320
of energy in California and how it could be
made more efficient, how we could get the

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:25.059
system so that it was relieved of the blockage
to allow efficiency.

00:29:25.059 --> 00:29:38.659
And now, we worked over the past nine years
on the passage of 1493, the Car Bill, Pavley's

00:29:38.659 --> 00:29:46.840
Car Bill, and working with E2 members, Environmental
Entrepreneur members, we were able to pass

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:54.670
that car bill, which is now producing really
very, very significant results in the less

00:29:54.670 --> 00:30:04.629
use of gasoline and obviously, reducing carbon,
as well as AB 32, which really is the climate

00:30:04.629 --> 00:30:06.941
bill, here in California.

00:30:06.941 --> 00:30:15.009
It’s the only climate bill in America; it’s
the strongest bill in the country. And again,

00:30:15.009 --> 00:30:19.940
our team of Environmental Entrepreneurs, you
probably don't know who they are or what they

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:21.830
are, but let me tell you.

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:28.609
One of our board members, Bob Epstein, set
up an organization called "Environmental Entrepreneurs".

00:30:28.609 --> 00:30:36.559
He went out to his friends, who were in the
high-tech world, and he encouraged them to

00:30:36.559 --> 00:30:46.539
become members of this new group, Environmental
Entrepreneurs, and they started having meetings,

00:30:46.539 --> 00:30:49.090
where they talked about the various environmental
issues.

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:57.429
They got them to contribute membership dues,
a thousand dollars or more. They now number

00:30:57.429 --> 00:31:03.809
some 900 around the country, and just to give
you a little bit of the significance of this

00:31:03.809 --> 00:31:12.259
group of entrepreneurs, they have produced,
over the course of the ten years that they've

00:31:12.259 --> 00:31:18.179
been in existence, over 500 thousand jobs
through the companies that they have invested

00:31:18.179 --> 00:31:19.179
in.

00:31:19.179 --> 00:31:26.840
They have invested 90 billion dollars in new
technology and other investments of real estate

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:35.440
and the like. This is a group of people who
have now become a major weapon for the environmental

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:43.259
future in this country, because they are competing
with the old industry who wants the world

00:31:43.259 --> 00:31:45.139
to stay the same.

00:31:45.139 --> 00:31:54.940
So, clean cars, global warming bill, and then
all of the other efficiencies that have been

00:31:54.940 --> 00:32:02.639
brought here from increasing the efficiency
of television just recently enacted here in

00:32:02.639 --> 00:32:05.639
California going nationwide.

00:32:05.639 --> 00:32:11.309
And most important, even the light bulbs,
in which new standards are being set and it’s

00:32:11.309 --> 00:32:18.389
been based on California; it’s gonna be
saving billions of dollars in energy costs,

00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:21.840
but also really having a big impact on climate.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:29.729
I asked the team to describe the impact that
their work will have on what it is we all

00:32:29.729 --> 00:32:36.390
know we need, which is really to change our
energy future, and how far will light bulbs,

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:45.050
TV, computers, and insulation and closing
the enclosure around houses, so that we can

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:52.820
really have efficiency throughout, how far
will that take us towards the goals that we

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:55.759
need since we've lost the climate bill?

00:32:55.759 --> 00:32:59.999
Well, they didn't have an answer for it, but
I can tell you one thing, it’s the only

00:32:59.999 --> 00:33:07.849
game in town, and we have to win at that game.
And that's why I think E2 and the energy efficiency

00:33:07.849 --> 00:33:14.049
team that we have here at NRDC, and working
with Google on so many of these projects is

00:33:14.049 --> 00:33:15.621
really the way we have to go.

00:33:15.621 --> 00:33:20.440
&gt;&gt;Pat Adams: I just want to tell a quick story
that sort of ties in NRDC and Google, even

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.960
though it starts back in 72.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:29.539
And one of the first women lawyers was hired,
Johanna Wald, and this is so typical of early

00:33:29.539 --> 00:33:35.190
NRDC and I wouldn't be surprised if it's not
typical of early Google. She went out when

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:39.309
John Weison hired her. He said, "OK, what
area do you want? You want the oceans or millions

00:33:39.309 --> 00:33:43.022
of acres of land to deal with?" And she says,
"Well, I'll take the land."

00:33:43.022 --> 00:33:48.749
And that was BLM, Bureau of Land Management
Land in the West. And what is interesting

00:33:48.749 --> 00:33:53.229
about this story is she started out --the
land wasn't even mapped--she had to go to

00:33:53.229 --> 00:33:57.240
the Yellow Pages to find out where a BLM office
was in Idaho, and when she got there, the

00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.299
guy left out the back door; he didn't want
to talk to her.

00:34:00.299 --> 00:34:04.399
And I tie this into Google in a way because
they didn't have Google Maps. I mean, what

00:34:04.399 --> 00:34:09.790
Google has done, in a way, to unify and give
information, has made an enormous difference

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:12.960
for NRDC and people working in this area over
the years.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:19.700
And today, Johanna's working with Google and
obviously, in NRDC on siting transition lines

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:26.950
from solar power or wind power places and
that's how you all are working together today.

00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:30.149
So, it has a nice sort of loop to it.

00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:35.440
&gt;&gt;Bill: That's been a great project to really
identify and plan, not just project by project,

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:39.339
but more systematically, where it makes sense
to put transmission lines.

00:34:39.339 --> 00:34:43.760
And we've been working with Noah as well on
the energy efficiency stuff. And I think that's

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:49.909
been a really shining example of a success
story, I think.

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:54.059
But at the same time, you mentioned the death
of the climate bill. In some ways, it seems

00:34:54.059 --> 00:34:58.470
like the environmental movement is really
at a crossroads, perhaps one of many, over

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:01.049
the last 40 plus years.

00:35:01.049 --> 00:35:06.220
We've seen, a little less than a year ago,
a devastating oil disaster in the Gulf. The

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:11.940
climate bill has stalled. There is talk of
rolling back many environmental protections,

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.650
certainly in the House.

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:20.609
Where do we go from here? And how do we remain
optimistic in the face of where things stand

00:35:20.609 --> 00:35:21.609
in Washington?

00:35:21.609 --> 00:35:29.010
&gt;&gt;Pat Adams: Well, I'll start because I said
this earlier when we met for lunch.

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:32.380
As we wrote the book, I became more and more
discouraged about what the future's gonna

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:37.630
be and when you hear the statistics about
climate change, it's very discouraging.

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:41.791
And then we were in Copenhagen and that climate
conference didn't work and the climate bill

00:35:41.791 --> 00:35:45.710
didn't pass and it's like, "How are we gonna
end this book on a positive note?"

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:50.010
And I have often accused John and environmentalists
as being gloom and doom all the time. You

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:51.579
gotta have something positive to say.

00:35:51.579 --> 00:35:58.020
But as I said earlier, and this is really
true, going and talking to people after we've

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:02.270
published the book, and particularly talking
to people of your generation, I feel enormous

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:05.390
hope because I think technology will save
the day.

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:09.940
And I think it’s possible and that this
generation of people who really understand

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:13.680
and are working with the very kind of things
that you're doing, think out of the proverbial

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:19.609
box, and it will be finding new ways for clean
energy and I think that's one of the essential

00:36:19.609 --> 00:36:21.420
things we need, and I think there's a great
deal of hope.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:27.530
&gt;&gt;John Adams: Well, technology got us into
this mess; it better get us out.

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:28.530
[laughter]

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:32.869
And I think that's where all of us come from
at NRDC.

00:36:32.869 --> 00:36:39.789
OK, so I've lived through the dark days of
Ronald Reagan and I've lived through the dark

00:36:39.789 --> 00:36:44.650
days of both Bushes, from an environmental
point of view.

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:52.430
And I often -- I actually believe that more
good comes to the environmental movement when

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:57.880
we're in dark days, because people really
realize they gotta buckle down and do things.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:03.200
California's gonna play a major role in the
future.

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:09.510
And when I say California, I mean Oregon,
Washington, New Mexico, and all of the states

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:15.599
that California has an impact on. So, that's
a block that's gonna move on efficiency, on

00:37:15.599 --> 00:37:17.990
wind, on solar.

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:28.480
And needless to say, in the last 30 years,
California has remained, per capita, even

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:33.359
on its use of energy--hard to believe--whereas
the rest of the country has increased per

00:37:33.359 --> 00:37:40.230
capita use by 40 percent. So, California is
really quite remarkable in what it's doing.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:45.770
And according to our team, and I believe them,
there's a lot more that can be done here and

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:52.079
that will be now transferred to other places.
There are some 30 states that are involved

00:37:52.079 --> 00:37:57.890
in the kind of work that California has started.

00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:06.161
We have Reggie in New York, Maine to Maryland.
And it's working very hard at reducing carbon

00:38:06.161 --> 00:38:08.880
through the laws that have been passed there.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:14.819
And so, we have to make more headway there.
So, work in all of the states is absolutely

00:38:14.819 --> 00:38:15.819
critical.

00:38:15.819 --> 00:38:23.579
The second part is we have to play as hard
a hardball as we can with the federal government.

00:38:23.579 --> 00:38:29.849
We have to ensure that Lisa Jackson survives
and is given the authority and her authority

00:38:29.849 --> 00:38:31.180
is protected.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:35.840
We have to spend time with our friends in
the Senate and in the House, giving them the

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:41.940
kinds of arguments they need. We have to be
prepared with lawsuits to block efforts. Remember,

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:46.760
it's hard to pass legislation, but it’s
equally hard to get rid of legislation.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:51.079
And we're specialists at defending the things
that are important to us.

00:38:51.079 --> 00:38:58.410
The third, in terms of the message, we think
we will win the message. If they go after

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:03.549
Lisa Jackson and the laws that protect our
health, I think that we will win the message

00:39:03.549 --> 00:39:08.740
and we will gain back our losses in the next
election.

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:14.890
There are other things that are going on here
that are very important. I look at the Department

00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:21.710
of Energy. It has 90,000,000 dollars that
it is spending on efficiency and new technology,

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:27.559
on new car batteries, and so what is happening
with the car batteries?

00:39:27.559 --> 00:39:33.030
Car battery companies are being built in the
Midwest. They're gonna be the battleground

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:38.400
states of the next election. If the battery
companies and the car companies do grow, as

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:45.920
one would expect, and people like the folks
at NRDC, we've just built a new office in

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:51.579
Chicago. That office in Chicago is looking
at the coal power plants; it’s looking at

00:39:51.579 --> 00:39:55.460
the battery companies as supporters of theirs.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:40:01.870
We're gonna build a new front in the rust
belt, because without the rust best, we're

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:05.609
never gonna be able to get a climate bill
passed in this country.

00:40:05.609 --> 00:40:13.079
So, we have a very positive attitude about
what we need to do and I would just say that

00:40:13.079 --> 00:40:23.720
we watched the Proposition 23, and that fight
over "would we have a climate bill here in

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.329
California" was absolutely critical.

00:40:25.329 --> 00:40:32.819
Well, what was really critical was that the
folks from Google and from Silicon Valley

00:40:32.819 --> 00:40:41.670
stepped into the fight and became major players
in defending AB 32. And that's a lesson, a

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:47.539
victory, a major victory, that I think will
not be lost on the folks who were doing this

00:40:47.539 --> 00:40:54.309
kind of work, because for it to succeed, they
have to have a regulatory framework that works.

00:40:54.309 --> 00:41:00.270
And if we have Just Say No people governing
our country, we're gonna have a hell of a

00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:05.019
time getting the good things done that we
need to get done.

00:41:05.019 --> 00:41:10.450
&gt;&gt;Bill: So, we've got a few minutes left.
I think we can take a few questions from the

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:12.170
audience, if anyone has any.

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:16.049
And if not, I can certainly ask some more.

00:41:16.049 --> 00:41:17.049
Yes, Sam?

00:41:17.049 --> 00:41:20.260
&gt;&gt;audience #1: [inaudible]

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:25.299
&gt;&gt;Bill: I'll repeat it.

00:41:25.299 --> 00:41:29.089
&gt;&gt;audience #1: [inaudible]

00:41:29.089 --> 00:41:34.990
&gt;&gt;Bill: The question was about on the topic
of Prop 23, which did not pass.

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:40.069
What do you make of Prop 26, which did, and
what seems like a little bit of a backdoor

00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:41.890
at the same things?

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:50.390
&gt;&gt;John Adams: Annie, would you come up here?

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:51.730
[laughter]

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:53.070
[pause]

00:41:53.070 --> 00:42:02.500
&gt;&gt;Annie: Hi, I'm Annie and I work on our California
issues. Prop 26, I think there's gonna be

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:20.289
a lot of litigation about Prop 26. And, of
course, when it comes to implementing AB 32,

00:42:20.289 --> 00:42:30.740
and things that are already on the books,
we think that that isn't gonna be affected

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:31.740
by Prop 26, so that you can generate revenues
from laws that are already on the books before

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:32.740
January 1st, 2010.

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:33.740
But anything from January 2010, when Prop
26 is retroactively effective to, will be

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:40.510
compromised. So I think we're gonna see a
lot of litigation. And what NRDC is doing

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:50.970
right now is doing an analysis to see if we
can sue on it and what kind of challenges

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:51.970
we can bring.

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:56.119
&gt;&gt;Bill: Thanks. Other questions? Yeah.

00:42:56.119 --> 00:43:10.560
&gt;&gt;audience #2: [inaudible]

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:15.380
[laughter]

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:25.380
&gt;&gt;Bill: The question is about careers for
young people starting out today in the environmental

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:30.200
movement, law policy, and other aspects, and
how does that compare to other potential careers?

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:36.349
&gt;&gt;Pat Adams: I'll let John answer that more,
but I would just say that I think today, there's

00:43:36.349 --> 00:43:38.099
not just the environmental world.

00:43:38.099 --> 00:43:43.619
In the business world, our daughter is with
Honeywell, which is a business, but they are

00:43:43.619 --> 00:43:46.240
very much involved in environmental issues,
as is Google.

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.680
So, you don't necessarily have to make that
separation.

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:58.250
&gt;&gt;John Adams: Well, NRDC is not your typical
example, but we are hiring every year. We

00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:02.839
have grown and grown and we're gonna continue
to grow as far as I can see.

00:44:02.839 --> 00:44:11.829
I think, and I'm involved with several university
programs, the Duke and the Yale Environment

00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:17.470
Schools are really, in the East, are really
wonderful places to get trained. Berkeley

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:25.769
here and a range of other places out here,
and I see a growing interest in this field

00:44:25.769 --> 00:44:26.880
and a growing need.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:31.880
I don't think there's any turning the clock
back. I think more people are getting jobs

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:35.569
in the environmental world than on almost
any of the other professions.

00:44:35.569 --> 00:44:42.019
So, I think that you should encourage the
young people to go into this field. I meet

00:44:42.019 --> 00:44:47.269
them all the time. I write recommendations
for them. We try to place as many people as

00:44:47.269 --> 00:44:48.269
we can.

00:44:48.269 --> 00:44:53.020
We have student programs and we have internships
and I know a lot of the other environmental

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:55.741
organizations have the same.

00:44:55.741 --> 00:45:01.069
I see no downward dip in the membership or
the strength of the environmental movement,

00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:05.400
even though this has been a tough economic
time.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:12.440
And a place like NRDC wants really talented
people and you can't win without them.

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.119
[pause]

00:45:14.119 --> 00:45:17.480
&gt;&gt;Bill: Yeah?

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:42.670
&gt;&gt;audience #3: I wanted to say thanks for
doing what you do and for [inaudible].

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:49.349
&gt;&gt;Bill: The question is about electronic waste
and whether there's hope for more stringent

00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:54.260
regulations to prevent export of what, basically,
are toxic materials.

00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:55.880
&gt;&gt;John Adams: [inaudible]

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.960
&gt;&gt;Pat Adams: [inaudible]

00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:58.960
[pause]

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:01.420
&gt;&gt;Noah Horowitz: Honorary doctorate.

00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:12.500
Hi. I am Noah Horowitz with the San Francisco
office. I work on consumer electronics, more

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:17.770
on the energy use side, but the question is,
what do we do with all these products, whether

00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:18.770
it’s our cell phone, our laptop, our TV
when it’s done with its useful life and

00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:19.770
it can't be reused, or for whatever reason,
people wanna get rid of it?

00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:31.950
It’s legal in almost all of the country.
All that stuff is going in the landfill. Some

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:35.410
states, California for example, has an advanced
recycling fee.

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:40.160
So, when you buy something, there's money
in advance that goes to recycle that. We're

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:45.099
working with companies like Best Buy, that
will take it from you for free, or a very

00:46:45.099 --> 00:46:50.030
low fee, and they're working with other organizations
to make sure that's recycled properly.

00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:54.119
There are still horror stories, but there
are becoming fewer of they open up the computer,

00:46:54.119 --> 00:47:14.819
they take the printed circuit board, it goes
to a developing country, there's a pit full

00:47:14.819 --> 00:47:15.819
of acid and someone is putting it in there
and they're getting burned and precipitating

00:47:15.819 --> 00:47:16.819
off the gold.

00:47:16.819 --> 00:47:17.819
That’s still happening.

00:47:17.819 --> 00:47:18.819
We're trying to set up systems so that doesn't
happen, and I'm optimistic in the next three

00:47:18.819 --> 00:47:19.819
to five years, we'll get that right. Bill,
anything you want to add on the computer or

00:47:19.819 --> 00:47:20.819
user side?

00:47:20.819 --> 00:47:21.819
&gt;&gt;Bill: No. I mean, it’s the same issue.
Though, compared to an individual, who might

00:47:21.819 --> 00:47:22.819
have a PC at home and they buy a new one and
then they wanna get rid of the old one, they

00:47:22.819 --> 00:47:26.819
don't know what to do with it. But I think
large companies like Google, certainly, as

00:47:26.819 --> 00:47:29.830
we decommission systems, we have larger numbers
of them.

00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:35.300
We pay very close attention to what happens
to them. But it is a big issue. Where do you

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:39.839
put these things? How do you reuse as much
of the material as possible and so on.

00:47:39.839 --> 00:47:43.099
I think we have time for one more question,
perhaps? Yeah, Ross.

00:47:43.099 --> 00:48:08.640
&gt;&gt;audience #4: [inaudible]

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:15.269
&gt;&gt;Bill: So, the question is about, as population
grows, as people become more prosperous, people

00:48:15.269 --> 00:48:16.269
will be using more energy.

00:48:16.269 --> 00:48:22.140
It seems like we need some kind of Apollo-scale
project to create the energy sources, clean

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:26.369
energy sources, I assume Ross meant, to meet
those needs.

00:48:26.369 --> 00:48:29.181
And what's NRDC doing around that? What's
its strategy?

00:48:29.181 --> 00:48:37.369
&gt;&gt;John Adams: Well, we hoped you had that
strategy. And I think it’s gonna have to

00:48:37.369 --> 00:48:44.960
come, that particular strategy, is gonna have
to be developed by people like the folks at

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.950
Google and from this world.

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:55.910
And then, NRDC will match up our strength
with your knowledge. And that's the strength

00:48:55.910 --> 00:49:05.380
of NRDC is that we have a political operation
and we have a lot of power, but we need the

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:13.630
positions to take with us to be able to make
a big difference and we're watching and learning

00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:18.460
how important it has been to work with Environmental
Entrepreneurs, E2.

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:24.619
They have made a huge difference to us because
they are outlining important political and

00:49:24.619 --> 00:49:29.810
scientific positions and they make the arguments
based on their technology.

00:49:29.810 --> 00:49:41.170
So, when you see an opportunity about an Apollo,
and you come to us and we get a group of Environmental

00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:46.750
Entrepreneurs because they'll see the economic
benefit to them, I think we could put together

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:49.849
a program that would take us over the top.

00:49:49.849 --> 00:49:55.349
And I also think we'll get a climate bill,
too. I mean, this has been pretty disappointing,

00:49:55.349 --> 00:50:01.650
but only when it’s really bad, do you get
a climate bill and then some of the Republicans

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:05.859
are gonna be very sorry and so you'll see
them come our way.

00:50:05.859 --> 00:50:09.410
And I think we'll have a chance at making
some headway on that. But I don't have an

00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:11.410
Apollo plan, yet. Do you, Noah?

00:50:11.410 --> 00:50:12.410
[laughter]

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:19.500
&gt;&gt;Bill: All right. Well, I think we're about
out of time. I just want to say about John

00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:21.740
and Patricia, both of you.

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:26.220
Your story and the story of NRDC, certainly
I find inspiring and I hope other people here

00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:27.829
do as well.

00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:32.009
Your book is titled, "A Force for Nature."
I think that can be applied to both of you

00:50:32.009 --> 00:50:35.559
as well and I really appreciate your coming
to Google.

00:50:35.559 --> 00:50:36.559
Thanks for your time.

00:50:36.559 --> 00:50:38.450
&gt;&gt;Pat Adams: It's very nice to be here.

00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:39.450
[applause]

00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:44.430
&gt;&gt;Winnie Lam: So, John and Patricia are gonna
stick around for a few minutes for those of

00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:47.690
you who want to get your book signed. They'll
be here, over there.

00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:48.690
&gt;&gt;Bill: Thanks, everybody.

00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:52.569
&gt;&gt;John Adams: We want to thank Winnie and
Bill. Thank you very much.

00:50:52.569 --> 00:50:53.800
&gt;&gt;Bill: Yes, my pleasure.

00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:55.020
&gt;&gt;Winnie Lam: You're welcome.
