00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.780
What’s the key to living a happy, fulfilling
life?

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.180
Easy - just lower your expectations!

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:14.990
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and despite
all of the scientific advancements we’ve

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.970
made over the past few centuries - we still
haven’t figured out the formula for living

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:19.990
a happy life.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.480
Common sense says that if we’re unhappy
with our current situation, then we should

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.430
change it - we can change our careers, change
our partners, change our friends.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.440
But maybe we’re looking in the wrong place.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.150
Maybe, the problem isn’t our surroundings
- it’s us.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.620
And that’s exactly what a new study says
is true.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.750
A team of researchers at University College
London have created a formula to predict happiness

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.010
levels, and according to them - being happy
in life isn’t about how things are “going”

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.050
for us, it’s about whether or not they’re
going “better than expected.”

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.960
Which means if we’re not happy, all we need
to do is change our expectations.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.329
Specifically, we should lower them.

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.219
For their study, they invited 26 people to
play a gambling game, where they could choose

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.820
to either receive 40p for each game, or take
a gamble - and receive either 90p or nothing

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.820
at all.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.020
During the experiment, they were repeatedly
asked to answer the question 'how happy are

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.020
you right now?'

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.939
while undergoing fMRI, to see if self-reported
happiness was related to rewards and expectations.

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.639
Researchers developed a model based on that
data, and used it to create a smartphone app

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:20.039
- where they repeated the experiment on over
18,000 participants.

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:25.469
What they found, is that accumulating wealth
didn’t make people happier, but the expectation

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.270
of wealth, did - and especially if people
weren’t expecting to win big.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.829
It makes sense that this would be true, since
lower expectations make it more likely that

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.429
a given outcome will exceed those expectations.

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.539
But what’s interesting, is that positive
expectations can also influence happiness

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:42.539
before we’re even aware of the outcome.

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.270
The example they give, is meeting up with
a friend at a restaurant.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.520
If it’s a restaurant you happen to know
and like, then the simple act of making those

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.109
plans could increase your happiness.

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:55.439
But they can also make you more unhappy down
the line - because your expectations are so

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.399
high, that it really wouldn’t take much
for you to be disappointed.

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.969
Granted, this is all relative - but it’s
a good reminder that we should keep our expectations

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:03.969
in check.

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.809
Assuming it’ll make you happier in the long
run, then what have you got to lose?

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:08.769
I think MadTV may have been onto something….

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.099
What do you guys think?

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.099
Is lowering your expectations as easy as they
make it seem?

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.090
Let us know your thoughts in the comments
below - and as always, thank you guys for

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.319
watching!
