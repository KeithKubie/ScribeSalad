chapter we're going to talk about how to
 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.140
chapter we're going to talk about how to
add leaderboards to your game a lot of

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150
add leaderboards to your game a lot of
 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.430
add leaderboards to your game a lot of
what you're going to see is actually

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440
what you're going to see is actually
 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.350
what you're going to see is actually
fairly similar to the process for adding

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360
fairly similar to the process for adding
 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.689
fairly similar to the process for adding
achievements to your game so hopefully

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699
achievements to your game so hopefully
 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.550
achievements to your game so hopefully
we'll be able to go a little faster in

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560
we'll be able to go a little faster in
 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.740
we'll be able to go a little faster in
this lesson and get some leaderboards

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750
this lesson and get some leaderboards
 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.660
this lesson and get some leaderboards
added pretty quickly we're going to

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670
added pretty quickly we're going to
 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.609
added pretty quickly we're going to
follow the same format as we did last

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619
follow the same format as we did last
 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.450
follow the same format as we did last
time by adding in a button to view all

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460
time by adding in a button to view all
 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.009
time by adding in a button to view all
of our leader boards before we actually

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019
of our leader boards before we actually
 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.650
of our leader boards before we actually
go and create any so let's do that by

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660
go and create any so let's do that by
 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.080
go and create any so let's do that by
going into our game view controller nib

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090
going into our game view controller nib
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.020
going into our game view controller nib
file and oops sorry not our game view

so we can disable this as needed and

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090
so we can disable this as needed and
 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.130
so we can disable this as needed and
let's say how about above our

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140
let's say how about above our
 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.240
let's say how about above our
achievement stuff we're gonna have a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250
achievement stuff we're gonna have a
 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.819
achievement stuff we're gonna have a
pragma mark view achievements and then

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829
pragma mark view achievements and then
 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.319
pragma mark view achievements and then
we can add another one bads few

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329
we can add another one bads few
 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.000
we can add another one bads few
leaderboards

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010
 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.650
and we will add an action here which

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660
and we will add an action here which
 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:20.920
and we will add an action here which
will be leader boards button was pressed

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930
 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.800
and let's just take this full screen

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810
and let's just take this full screen
 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:32.330
and let's just take this full screen
there we go and now in this method

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340
there we go and now in this method
 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.210
there we go and now in this method
basically we're just going to create a

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220
basically we're just going to create a
 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.880
basically we're just going to create a
leaderboards controller and set the

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890
leaderboards controller and set the
 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.650
leaderboards controller and set the
delegate to ourselves and present it

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660
delegate to ourselves and present it
 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.630
delegate to ourselves and present it
this should look very similar to the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640
this should look very similar to the
 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.880
this should look very similar to the
methods we have right above now i'm

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890
methods we have right above now i'm
 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.250
methods we have right above now i'm
going to call gpg leaderboards

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260
going to call gpg leaderboards
 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
going to call gpg leaderboards
controller notice by the way we have

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270
controller notice by the way we have
 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.060
controller notice by the way we have
both a leaderboard controller and a

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070
both a leaderboard controller and a
 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.220
both a leaderboard controller and a
leaderboards controller with an S the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230
leaderboards controller with an S the
 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.050
leaderboards controller with an S the
leaderboard controller this thing here

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060
leaderboard controller this thing here
 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.390
leaderboard controller this thing here
is what you would use if you want to

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400
is what you would use if you want to
 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.250
is what you would use if you want to
bring up the scores for an individual

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260
bring up the scores for an individual
 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.020
bring up the scores for an individual
leaderboard the leaderboards controller

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030
leaderboard the leaderboards controller
 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.360
leaderboard the leaderboards controller
starts by showing you all the possible

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370
starts by showing you all the possible
 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.550
starts by showing you all the possible
leaderboards for this game I'm going to

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560
leaderboards for this game I'm going to
 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.560
leaderboards for this game I'm going to
start by adding an a leaderboards

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570
start by adding an a leaderboards
 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.690
start by adding an a leaderboards
controller and we'll get to that other

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700
controller and we'll get to that other
 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.900
controller and we'll get to that other
one later on in the chapter but we'll

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910
one later on in the chapter but we'll
 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.690
one later on in the chapter but we'll
just say leads controller equals gpg

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700
just say leads controller equals gpg
 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.410
just say leads controller equals gpg
leaderboards controller alloc init 30 we

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420
leaderboards controller alloc init 30 we
 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.210
leaderboards controller alloc init 30 we
will set our delegate to self and now we

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220
will set our delegate to self and now we
 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.900
will set our delegate to self and now we
can present view controller leads

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910
can present view controller leads
 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.940
can present view controller leads

without declaring that we are a
 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.280
without declaring that we are a
leaderboards controller delegate so we

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290
leaderboards controller delegate so we
 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.130
leaderboards controller delegate so we
can do that right here

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140
 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.210
leaderboards controller delegate there

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220
leaderboards controller delegate there
 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.610
leaderboards controller delegate there
we go and now we get a warning that we

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620
we go and now we get a warning that we
 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.610
we go and now we get a warning that we
haven't implemented the required method

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620
haven't implemented the required method
