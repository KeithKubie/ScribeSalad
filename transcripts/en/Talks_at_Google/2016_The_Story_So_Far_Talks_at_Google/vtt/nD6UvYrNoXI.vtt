00:00:02.664 --> 00:00:04.080
ERIN SODERBERG:
Welcome, everyone,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.577
and thank you for coming.

00:00:05.577 --> 00:00:06.660
My name is Erin Soderberg.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.700
And I'm very excited
today to welcome

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.750
Cedric Vallini, professor
at Lyon University

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.290
and the head of the
Henri Poincare Institute.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.080
Cedric is widely regarded
as one of the most talented

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.040
mathematicians of
his generation.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.900
In addition to winning the
Fermat and Henri Poincare

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.050
prizes in 2009, he was also
awarded the prestigious Fields

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.340
Medal for his work on optimal
transport and kinetic theory

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.630
in 2010.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.610
For those who aren't
familiar, the Fields Medal

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.690
is often referred to as the
Nobel Prize of Mathematics

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.470
and is only awarded
once every four years.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.830
Today, he is going to speak
to us about his latest

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.390
book, the "Birth of a Theorem,"
which was released last week.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.824
Let's welcome Cedric.

00:00:45.824 --> 00:00:48.588
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.330
CEDRIC VILLANI:
Thank you very much.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.690
It's a great pleasure to
be here and to continue

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.380
this tour of presentation of
the US version of my book.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.680
The book appeared three years
ago, two years and a half ago,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.700
in France, but somehow
the English translation

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.920
took quite some time.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.880
And in the end, everything
needed to be perfect.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.280
In the meantime, has been
translated into something

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.860
like 12 languages.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.240
And the book was an opportunity
for a lot of outreach

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.860
about our field and what
we do as mathematicians

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.160
at a time in which many
countries consider it

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.420
the single biggest
problem about science

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.890
is to motivate people
to do sciences.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.770
Of course, if you are
in the United States

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.310
or in other countries which
are extremely good at welcoming

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.250
people from all the
world, you can just

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.670
import the mathematicians.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.880
But in most other countries,
it doesn't work this way,

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.490
and you need to train
mathematicians from young age.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.570
And people see the numbers
of aspiring mathematicians

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.510
in the universities going
down and down and down

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:22.090
and wonder how to prevent
this from occurring.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.930
In spite of these
trends, and in spite

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.900
of the bad reputation
of mathematics,

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.750
the time could hardly be
better for mathematicians.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.260
A few years ago-- some of
you probably have seen this.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.500
When "Wall Street
Journal" made its ranking

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.700
of all the jobs
in the world, they

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.170
ranked mathematician as number
1 best job in the world.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.020
This was a ranking based
on a number of parameters,

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.100
including salary, freedom,
possibility of promotion,

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.810
possibility of hiring,
many, many things.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.650
Last year, in 2014,
a company named

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.030
CareerCast, which
started as a spin-off

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.710
of this kind of ranking,
also ranked mathematician

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.140
as number 1 job again.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.680
In a time where nobody knows
what the future jobs will look

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.120
like and where a
mathematician, by definition,

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.750
is a job in which you have
to adapt to any situation,

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.970
in the same sense as mathematics
is the science of working

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.080
on anything, and as a
computer, by definition, is

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.080
a machine able to perform any
task, any mathematical task.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.030
So as computers continue to
invade the world in algorithms,

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.860
mathematical tools
have such resonance

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.830
and are more and more used
in every kind of business,

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:07.010
and applications of mathematics
have never been so large.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.900
In this ranking, by
the way, the definition

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.320
which was taken
for mathematician

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.250
is somebody who applies
mathematical theories

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.209
and formulas to teach
or solve problems

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.100
in a business, educational,
or industrial climate,

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.550
which is not bad in the
sense that it insists

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.960
on solving problems, which is
what mathematics was invented

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.660
for.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.460
However, it misses
a crucial point,

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.520
that there are also people
who not only teach or apply

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.282
mathematics, but there's also
people who do mathematics,

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:44.860
who create it, who change it.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:52.330
And mathematics is changing
at a very fast pace nowadays.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.300
It is often a
surprise to audiences

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.580
when we talk about the numbers.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.630
Here probably, in this room,
people are more familiar.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.300
And if I ask you, what's
the number of researchers

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.530
in mathematics
around the world, you

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.340
will probably get the
right order of magnitude.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.021
What do you think?

00:05:14.021 --> 00:05:16.249
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:17.540
CEDRIC VILLANI: That's not bad.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.595
That's not bad.

00:05:18.595 --> 00:05:19.970
It's a bit more than that.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.520
It's in the hundreds
of thousands.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.750
But maybe it's somewhere
between 100,000 and 200,000,

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.210
something like that.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:34.360
Increasing rapidly, in
particular with India and China

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.740
producing, if I may say,
many more mathematicians.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.280
It's exponential growth.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.480
If you go around, if you look
around at a large time scale,

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.090
in particular it's as usual.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.780
If you take the number
of dead mathematicians,

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.200
it's smaller than the number
of living mathematicians,

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.450
as is always the
case when you have

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.160
fast enough exponential growth.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.830
So mathematics is a field that
is being renewed constantly.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.680
At the same time,
it is also, almost

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.080
by definition, the
science in which things

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.150
last for a very, very long.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.220
There is no other subject,
of course, in which knowledge

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.720
can last thousands of years,
and the theorems of Euclid

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.740
are still accurate nowadays.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.430
Without going that
far, if you look

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.820
at modern applications of
computer and mathematics,

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.520
you will see every day
around the world everywhere

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.100
people are applying
contributions of Laplace,

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.480
like the law of
central limit theorem,

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.730
the normal errors, contributions
by Shannon about sampling,

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.250
contributions by Fourier about
signal analysis processing,

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.510
and so on.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.120
And all this will be mixed
with the modern technology.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:03.890
So at the same time, it is
very contemporary and very old

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.370
at the same time.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.030
In the past, International
Congress of Mathematicians,

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:15.490
so this is the big rendezvous
of mathematicians every four

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.440
years.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:22.850
The past one was in
Seoul, summer of 2014.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:27.740
And as a sign of the times,
one of the plenary talks

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.910
was from a
mathematician expressing

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.640
the pride of mathematics, and
more precisely in big data

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.450
at large.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:38.880
This was Emmanuel Candes
from Stanford University.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:45.470
He was a member of the
French delegation, let's say.

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.730
By the way, in this
International Congress

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:55.970
of Mathematicians, the highest
number of invited researchers

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.470
were from French.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.860
It was, even in absolute
numbers, the most represented

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.630
country in this conference.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:06.950
And so Emmanuel Candes
explained, for instance,

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:12.220
to the audience how he had
collaborated with people

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.120
from hospitals,
medical doctors and so

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.380
on, with a combination of
old and new mathematics--

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:25.380
Fourier transform
analysis, data processing,

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.860
so- called sparse
methods, and so on,

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:36.039
to reduce drastically the time
that you need to get a scan.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:38.520
This machine, getting to this.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.510
Machine makes basically a
Fourier transform of your body.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:47.230
And in particular, when
you are handling children,

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:50.470
it is at stake how
long this should last,

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:52.810
and you don't want
this to last too long.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:55.980
And they managed to reduce
by a factor of eight

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.520
the amount of time
which is needed

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.810
by using the fact that if
you want to reconstruct

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:06.630
a signal with sufficient mixing
from its Fourier transform,

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.990
you need to know only a very
small portion of the Fourier

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.660
transform.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.710
In experiments, they showed
that to reconstruct images,

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:18.050
sometimes you can do it
with the best accuracy

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:22.250
that you need having only
2% of the Fourier transform.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:27.590
And so this was very
significant of the evolution.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:30.940
At the same time good,
old Fourier analysis,

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.740
and at the same time,
very modern methods

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:38.820
of big data related--
here in this audience,

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.630
I guess, for most people
it will be familiar

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:46.480
if I say Netflix problem of
reconstructing the missing

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.860
information, the same
problem reconstructing

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.470
the preferences of
users for movies--

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.530
and reconstructed the image.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.450
If you have a Fourier transform
which has holes in it,

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:00.920
there is common
mathematical structure.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.796
And in all this, again, we
see, as usual, the strength

00:10:03.796 --> 00:10:04.420
of mathematics.

00:10:08.072 --> 00:10:11.450
The same mathematical
structure can be here

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:15.020
in many different problems.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.870
However, the life
of the mathematician

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:24.800
is not that full of
adventures at first time.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.680
This is the typical state--

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.512
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:28.512 --> 00:10:31.860
--you know, not knowing
what is going to happen,

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.630
how you are going to
get out of the problem,

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.210
and waiting for good,
old Henri Poincare

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:40.230
to whisper some
hint in your ear.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.250
Most of our time as a
researcher is spent in failure.

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.220
That is objective fact.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:54.530
My colleague from Berkeley
University, Craig Evans,

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.190
who is a world-famous specialist
of partial differential

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.850
equations, likes to say,
"Every day is a failure.

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:02.630
This is our life."

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:07.320
And however, when you look
back on the amounts of time

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:11.340
everything works and progress
over a 10-year period

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.680
maybe is always enormous,
partly because, of course,

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.690
of the collaborative
nature of science,

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:22.790
which makes it that many things
that you did not understand,

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:25.490
through the work, the help
of other contributions

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:28.230
and so on, you understand
little by little.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:32.640
And every year, the number of
new theorems in mathematics

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.740
is also counted in the
hundreds of thousands,

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.290
number of [INAUDIBLE],
the number

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.570
of new theorems per year.

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:45.030
So there is this
apparent discrepancy.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.740
But also, at the
individual level,

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:52.910
if you look at the process
of proving a theorem,

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:56.670
it is not what
one could believe.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.440
And it, on a wider
scale, it doesn't

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.910
look like this, neither like
the usual view that we may have.

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:11.560
This is a nice drawing I took
from the Electron Cafe blog

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.060
contrasting the public
perception of science

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:17.130
with the actual science.

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:21.400
This is like what we in
school, we learn sometimes

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.320
science is theory, experiment,
conclusions, theory,

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.930
experiment, conclusion.

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.350
It's not the way it works.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.460
And sometimes you may think,
OK, when you have a problem,

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.710
you read hard, you think
hard, you do science as told,

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.150
and then you get a big reward.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.870
In practice, it's
more like this.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:44.580
So do the science,
not quite as expected.

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.210
Amazing result turn
out to be crap.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:49.680
What the hell is going on?

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.310
Wait, think, no, it doesn't.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:51.970
Funny.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.360
This makes sense.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.770
And then you figure out
somebody did it 50 years ago,

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:59.200
and then you go
on and on and on.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.220
And sometimes in
the process, here

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.875
is something that is
worthy of publication.

00:13:04.875 --> 00:13:08.420
A very chaotic process.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:11.350
This picture,
still however we're

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:14.340
missing one so important
point in our life, which

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.340
is collaboration.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.050
So this is at the scale
of one individual.

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:21.260
Take this as the unit
loop and put this

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:25.750
as a string with many,
many, many other loops,

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.030
which are all together,
interconnected,

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:31.210
and you have a better picture.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.860
And that's only one
part of the story,

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.780
of course, which is
when you have something

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.440
that is ready to publish.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:43.490
After you're right in
this step of publishing,

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.690
you still have the
task to convince people

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:50.280
that your theorem is good,
or that your idea is good,

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.260
or that your theory is good.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.620
This can be very
tricky, and sometimes it

00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:01.140
takes long before people
recognize it as interesting.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.490
There are episodes
in science in which

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:08.080
this problem of
having folks recognize

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:12.620
the importance of your discovery
was critical or even completely

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:18.440
dramatic, as is the
case with the sad story

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.250
of this gentleman,
Ignaz Semmelweis.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.710
Any of you heard of him?

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:26.550
Yes, you did.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:31.140
So Semmelweis, as those
who heard about him know,

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:36.510
is, in some sense, the
discoverer of hygiene, the fact

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:40.560
that it's good to wash your
hands in certain situations.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.890
And in particular, if
you're a medical doctor,

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:46.720
and you work in a
hospital and you

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:51.090
train by dissecting
corpses, and after

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:55.660
that you have babies delivered,
it is good in the meantime

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.550
to wash hands.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:00.770
This he discovered, and
this people did not believe.

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:02.380
They were thinking he was crazy.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.490
Look at my hands.

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:04.280
They are clean.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.520
What the hell are you
talking about soap?

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:07.960
What will it change?

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.560
Of course, in those
days, there was

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:14.140
no model for microbes
and bacteria or whatever,

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.472
so it looked like nonsense.

00:15:16.472 --> 00:15:19.940
And he had, with
statistics, he had

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:23.340
how there were good indications
that his discovery was

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.370
important but did not
manage to make his point.

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:28.530
He ended up in an
asylum, by the way.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:29.980
AUDIENCE: Ooh.

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:33.770
So this is a dramatic,
extreme example

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:36.810
of how difficult it may
be to make your point,

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:41.480
even when you have
succeeded in your research.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:46.330
Another thing which is
tricky is when people ask

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:50.870
you to predict what will occur.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:56.030
And it's becoming more and more
so in research institutions,

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:59.420
as governmental
agencies and so on want

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.340
to give you money
only if you tell them

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.820
what you will discover.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:03.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:07.690
Of course, if you are engaged in
a big industrial project and so

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:11.430
on, and which we think is
kind on trail, on track,

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.460
then you can set up
the lines and so on.

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:19.060
Even in that way, it may turn
out to be not as planned.

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:22.230
But when you are in fundamental
research, by definition,

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:25.860
the interesting stuff is
what you do not predict,

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:29.630
and that's a big problem.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:36.100
Here we see in this
journal article from 1900

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:40.610
how people in those
days, already of course,

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:47.720
were trying to have these
mathematicians predict

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.030
the future of their discoveries.

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:53.230
And there was this question
asked of Henri Poincare, who

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:57.090
was, in his day, arguably
the most famous mathematician

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:02.310
in the world, and
people asking him

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:04.540
about science of
the 20th century.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.190
This was 1900.

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:13.329
His answer was, "Sir, your
letter is coming to me today

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:16.010
after having been around.

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:20.359
If, in 1800, one had
asked any scientist what

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:22.660
would science in
the 19th century

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.740
be, how much nonsense
he would have said.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.569
Good heavens.

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:30.860
This thought prevents
me from answering.

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:35.002
I believe that surprising
results shall be obtained.

00:17:35.002 --> 00:17:38.300
And that's precisely the reason
why I cannot tell you anything

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.430
about them.

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:42.510
For if I could predict
them, how could they still

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:44.230
remain surprising?

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.290
So please excuse my silence."

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:50.130
So this was the
answer of Poincare.

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.520
I used this quote of Poincare
a couple of times on television

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.530
when journalist is
asking questions about,

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:02.730
can you predict the future
of mathematics in 2050

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.910
or something like this?

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:09.040
If you think about it,
Poincare is making an answer

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.415
which is deeper than it seems.

00:18:10.415 --> 00:18:12.140
It's not just a joke.

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:15.350
"I believe that surprising
results shall be obtained"

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:17.500
is asserting the
belief in the fact

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:21.790
that there will be renewed
innovation always and always,

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:27.790
and that you will never exhaust
the amount of discoveries.

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:31.670
In those days, 1900s,
some physicists

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:35.550
believed that physics
was essentially complete.

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:39.580
Everything was explained,
except for a few anomalies.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.540
And from the few anomalies,
a few years later

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:46.320
arose quantum
mechanics, relativity,

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.125
and so on, a bunch
of revolutions.

00:18:50.125 --> 00:18:53.120
And so this is a good
example of the fact

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.890
that new discoveries
indeed come.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.000
And if you ask
people, by the way,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.600
now with the
theoretical physicists,

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.800
there are many in
sharing the belief

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:08.620
that some new revolution
is in preparation,

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:10.790
and they have no idea
which it will be.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:13.370
But somehow, they
feel unsatisfied

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:16.410
by the present state
of fundamental physics

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:21.770
and some of the anomalies
and things that bother them.

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:31.180
Here are a few people with
examples of what we said first,

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:36.340
the fact that the fundamental
ideas that say the new ones

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:38.260
are impossible to predict.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:41.180
Also the fact that their
impact can be huge.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:49.780
The fact also that when they
are improved and relayed

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.820
by many, many people, the
ideas of one individual

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.130
can make a tremendous
difference.

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:01.220
And the fact that these
new ideas contributed

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.300
to change, not just
the history of ideas,

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.320
but the history of
mankind in general.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:12.490
Of course, we start to the right
with Alan Turing, who has now

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:16.060
been turned into
a Hollywood star

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.990
with a horrible Hollywood movie.

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:26.890
And Alan Turing, as we know,
was instrumental in cracking

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:30.230
the secret codes used
by the German Army

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.420
during the Second World War.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:36.240
By the way, and this is
forgotten by a bunch of people

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.980
but should be reminded,
Turing could never

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.130
have done anything
if it had not been

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:45.500
for the preliminary work of
three Polish mathematicians who

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:49.750
worked in the '30s
and who participated

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.140
in literally saving the world.

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:58.370
So Turing anyway had
these remarkable ideas,

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:00.380
and it was
mathematical new ideas,

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:03.070
about how to handle this code.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:07.310
And it is generally considered
without the contribution

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:11.550
of Turing and
cracking of the code,

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:14.380
the war would have lasted
at least two more years.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.520
In particular, in
1944, would have

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:21.310
been impossible to do
the Normandy operation.

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:23.070
So this was for Turing.

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:29.550
And here we see it's
fascinating to think

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:33.670
that just one idea in
one brain can have such

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:37.540
an impact on the whole stuff.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:41.830
Well, these ideas,
what motivates them?

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:45.500
I'd say in the case of
Turing, his main motivation

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:49.270
clearly was solving a riddle.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:53.810
He had never strong
political ideas.

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:58.370
The person on the
left of Turing is also

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:02.270
one of the symbols of these
people whose only goal in life

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:03.960
is to solve problems.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.820
They just lived for it.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:11.760
This is Paul Erdos, 20th century
most productive mathematician.

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:17.200
Erdos is part of this
extremely important event

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.090
in the history of ideas.

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:25.030
When a bunch of scores of
Jews immigrated from Europe,

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:28.440
in particular Central
Europe and Eastern Europe,

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:33.250
to this continent, America,
because of the persecutions

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:37.660
of the war and so
on, and here was

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:42.910
Erdos with all the
remaining of his life.

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:50.720
No home, no car, no bank
account, no salary, nothing,

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.900
with just one
suitcase and ideas,

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.765
ideas, ideas, working
for in the theorem,

00:22:56.765 --> 00:22:58.180
theorem, theorem, theorem.

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.530
Whole life was like this.

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:04.720
Whenever he got some money
from some reward or something,

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:09.750
he would always use part of it
to put a reward on the theorems

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:12.400
that he liked best
or give part of it

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.960
to people he thought needed
the money more than him.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.970
Anyway, here was the most
productive mathematician

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:20.460
of 20th century.

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:27.780
No need to motivate these
kind of people particularly.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:30.850
Interesting also to know
that he was representing

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:36.200
the culture of Hungary,
which was, at some point,

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:40.640
the most innovative,
most productive ecosystem

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.610
for ideas in mathematics
and theoretical physics

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:45.340
in the world.

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:49.480
They literally changed
the world, the Hungarians,

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.770
the Hungarian scientists.

00:23:51.770 --> 00:24:01.520
And interestingly enough, also
the amount of idea production,

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.750
let's say, from this part
of the world collapsed

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:07.520
at the same time as
communism collapsed.

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:12.570
This is one of the big
problems that stay contemporary

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:14.940
in the ecosystem of ideas.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:18.180
Let's continue with another
of these Hungarian Jews.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.760
Here, uh uh.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.462
Anybody recognize him?

00:24:21.462 --> 00:24:22.590
AUDIENCE: Pauli?

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:25.930
CEDRIC VILLANI: No, not Pauli.

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:30.360
This is Leo Szilard,
Leo Szilard,

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:36.210
the first human to have
understood the concept of chain

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:40.310
reaction back in 1933.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:41.890
At the time where
it was even not

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:45.030
known whether uranium was
fissile, in those days

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:47.290
he had understood the concept.

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:50.350
The story is a good one.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:54.910
So this guy also was wandering,
going everywhere and so on.

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:59.520
So he had read in the newspaper
the account of a public lecture

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:03.590
by Rutherford, the father
of nuclear physics.

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:07.020
And in that lecture,
Rutherford once had a question,

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:10.540
had said that, yes, there
is some energy in the atom,

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.980
but it's so tiny that you would
never do anything about it.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:19.390
The exact words was,
"It would be moonshine

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:25.840
talking if you are willing to
extract energy from the atom."

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.950
And Szilard liked contradiction.

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:30.630
And so he was very annoyed
with this, and he thought,

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:33.270
I will prove that guy wrong.

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:35.340
And he thought
for days and days.

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:39.110
And at some point, aha, while
crossing a street in London,

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:41.800
he had this illumination
of how to do

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.990
what will be the principle
of chain reaction

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:47.450
and exponential growth
of this energy and so on.

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:51.980
This is the patent
for the atomic reactor

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.400
after Fermi and Szilard.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:26:01.330
And so Szilard is the starter
of the Manhattan Project.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:04.720
There is a famous letter which
Einstein sent to Roosevelt,

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.300
which was the start,
but the letter actually

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.260
was written-- the draft
was written by Szilard.

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:14.340
When Szilard and Teller came
to visit Einstein in Princeton,

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.000
and they told him
chain reaction,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.176
atomic bomb, his answer was, ah,
I had never thought about this.

00:26:21.176 --> 00:26:24.890
This is ironic because
nowadays many people associate

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:26.680
Einstein with the atomic bomb.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.790
The real guy behind
the atomic bomb

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:31.720
is this guy that
essentially nobody knows.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.540
Szilard spent all
the final years

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:38.220
of his life fighting for
pacifism in the world.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:42.760
And also, at some point, was
cured for cancer by radiation,

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:48.220
and changed himself the
protocol of his cure

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.960
so that he would be cured
with higher doses of radiation

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.280
that he was sure were the
correct answer in his case.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:58.250
So fascinating,
fascinating character.

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:03.210
So with all these, we see we
have here examples of people

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:06.190
who changed the world with
just the right idea who

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:10.570
were motivated mainly by
their appetite for ideas.

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:16.020
And here comes the problem.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:19.840
And here I put a picture
of some famous university.

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:24.280
Here comes the problem,
which this arises naturally.

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.900
How to make a good
research institution,

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:29.185
and what is a good
research institution?

00:27:29.185 --> 00:27:31.740
A good research institution,
a good university,

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.340
a great university
is not a university

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:37.660
in which you are taught the
most up-to-date science.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:41.440
It is a university in
which students will later

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:45.680
do science which is better than
the one that they were told.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:50.290
So that's the big problem
of master and student.

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:52.870
How should the student
be taught in such a way

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:55.420
that he will do better
than the master?

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:59.390
Nobody has a real
satisfactory answer to this.

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:02.550
Still, that's the most important
problem that you want to solve.

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:08.900
Henri Poincare
gives us some hints

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:13.110
about how the ideas came
to him, were coming to him.

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:18.000
Poincare was considered the
symbol of the genius type

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.370
with illuminations,
you know, flashes.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:25.380
In one of these famous
takes, he gives us

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:28.540
some diary, some
account, of some

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.410
of these ideas that
made him so famous

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:35.750
and revolutionized
mathematics in those days.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:38.950
And he tried to analyze this.

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:44.170
It's also very unclear
what you can get from this.

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:47.560
So in one of these
most famous passages,

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.600
he talks about the
time when he was

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:55.400
working like crazy on some
problem and can never make it.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:29:00.030
And goes and goes, and, pfft,
doesn't work, and at some point

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:02.430
goes on a trip with his friends.

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:05.310
And when as he's coming
back from the trip

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:09.330
and sets his foot again on the
bus-- it was organized trip,

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:11.750
whatever-- at this
precise moment

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:15.920
came the idea about the
solution of the problem.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:19.140
Here is a longer passage
of the same text.

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.410
"Disgusted from
my failure, I went

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:27.850
to spend a few days near the
sea thinking anything else.

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:34.380
And one day, while walking on
the cliff, the idea came to me.

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:37.950
And as before, it was
very brief, sudden,

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:43.610
with immediate certainty,
that arithmetic transforms

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:45.780
of indefinite ternary
quadratic forms

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:49.710
are identical to those of
non-Euclidean geometry."

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:53.290
So this is the
comment of Poincare.

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:55.740
Let's comment this text.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:30:02.720
First, under which circumstance
does the big idea come?

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.910
In popular culture, there
are these representations

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:09.530
of episodes, like Newton
sees the apple falling down,

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:12.210
and eureka, I get it.

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:15.210
In real life, it's not
the way it happens.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:18.660
You do have the eureka
moment, illumination,

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:22.820
but usually there is nothing
in the environment that

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.800
relates to the problem
that you are working on.

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:30.650
It's like it's a separated,
independent event.

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:34.360
And here is the same, the
[INAUDIBLE], of course,

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:37.250
has nothing to do
with quadratic forms,

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:41.060
even if you forgot what
quadratic forms are

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:46.030
and even more, arithmetic
transforms of blah, blah, blah.

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:51.950
The other noticeable
comment is the process

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:59.600
that Poincare describes is
neither hard work continuously,

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:03.920
nor just waiting for the flash.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.750
It's a combination of both.

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:09.790
Our talents work
very hard, then there

00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:13.400
is something of the relaxation,
and then the illumination,

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.610
and then continue
work very hard,

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:18.150
and then there is
something again.

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:22.900
And if the brain has not been
prepared by the hard work part,

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.320
the illumination will not come.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:29.400
And it's the same in all these
stories I told, no [INAUDIBLE],

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.390
Szilard, or Turing, or whatever.

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:34.540
It's always first
the hard preparation,

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.380
and then something
has to be arranged

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:42.710
by some unconscious process
that nobody really knows about.

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:44.060
Last comment.

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:47.070
One of the reasons why
this text by Poincare

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:50.340
became famous and known by all
people working in committee

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:56.390
sciences is that he used the
big words without explanations.

00:31:56.390 --> 00:32:03.200
It seems paradoxical that the
fact of not explaining things

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.390
adds to the success.

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:09.850
But indeed, assume that Poincare
wanted to share with the reader

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:11.900
the science of this.

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:15.250
OK, my friends, let's explain to
you what the quadratic form is

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:17.130
and the ternary
quadratic form when

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:19.330
it is indefinite and so on.

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:23.650
Even if Poincare had been the
best pedagogue in the world,

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:26.200
it would have taken
pages and pages.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.870
Most of the
audience, if not all,

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:31.800
would have been
lost while reading.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:35.110
But here he gives the big
words with zero explanations,

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:38.230
so you don't even try and
understand what it's about,

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:42.200
and it's just the
circumstances which matter.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:46.340
And in this, this is one
of the testimonies of,

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:48.980
from the inside,
what happens when

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:51.780
you are working on this idea.

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:55.450
So here we are
arriving at the book.

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:58.740
The book which I did
is like an outgrowth

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.570
of the Poincare testimony.

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:03.850
By the way, even though
I knew the Poincare text,

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:07.470
I was not aware at
all that I was here

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:13.070
applying the same kind
of process than Poincare.

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:17.680
But is, as usual everything that
is in your mind you don't know.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:23.390
So the book is like the
diary of the discovery

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:25.020
of the big theorem.

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:29.480
I say big because it took more
than two years of my life,

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:33.350
big because it played a major
role in my Fields Medal,

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:36.440
and because it was
solving a problem of more

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:41.810
than 50 years old about the
behavior of plasma physics.

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:49.470
Let's take just a few moments
to explain what it was about.

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:51.690
Here you see a
picture of Lev Landau,

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:56.306
one of the most [INAUDIBLE]
physicists of the 20th century.

00:33:56.306 --> 00:33:58.510
He doesn't look happy,
and that's normal.

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:00.200
That's the mug shot
when he was taken

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.770
to prison for no good reason.

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:09.489
And these are images of plasmas.

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:13.100
Plasma is any state
of matter in which

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:18.440
electrons have been torn apart
and separated from the nuclei.

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:22.260
And it's an element.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:29.460
It's a state of matter as fluid,
or gas, or solid, or crystal.

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:30.582
It's a very common.

00:34:30.582 --> 00:34:32.290
Even though it was
discovered quite late,

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:34.409
it's very common
in the universe.

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:39.350
And the main equation describing
it is, for the electron motion,

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:43.260
is a statistical variant
of the Newton equations,

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:48.810
which is called [INAUDIBLE]
Poisson equation, whatever.

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:52.150
This equation tells you
about the statistics

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:55.150
of the electrons, of the
electron distribution,

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:57.630
and how it evolves with time.

00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:00.410
People, by the way,
in galactic dynamics

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:02.900
use the same equation
with the idea

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.800
that at the scale
of a galaxy, a star

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:09.650
is something like an electron
at the scale of a plasma.

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:12.730
Of course, it's not
true, but still a star

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:14.990
is so tiny compared
to the galaxy that

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:18.770
may contain hundreds of
thousands of billions of stars.

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:23.560
So that it's OK to have a
statistical treatment of stars

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.480
in a galaxy.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:26.860
So you have this equation.

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:29.630
And it's a problem that
people, for instance,

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:34.770
working on nuclear fusion, for
instance, in working in-- well,

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:38.740
there are many applications
of plasmas, including screens,

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:39.710
as we know.

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:43.050
And it's a problem to
understand how it reacts

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:45.810
to electric stimuli and so on.

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:49.290
And Landau suggested
that there would

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:55.120
be equilibration processes,
that is, spontaneous damping

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:58.060
of electric perturbations
in the plasma,

00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:02.750
even though the plasma is like a
perfect world with no friction,

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:08.250
no entropy increase, as the
second law of thermodynamics

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:09.770
would say.

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:12.470
So it's like you
would have stability

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:18.400
but nothing irreversible,
no friction or whatever,

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.330
which is very paradoxical.

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:25.120
At our scale, the main
factor of stability,

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:29.580
where there are two-- why
do things stop thrusting

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:32.430
is that we are all
attracted by the Earth.

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:35.870
And we see in outer space
how things are unstable,

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:40.000
like when "Philae" wants
to land on the asteroid

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.660
and so on, it's such a big mess,
it goes up it's so unstable.

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:45.610
So first, we're all
attracted by the Earth.

00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:47.660
Second, there's
friction everywhere,

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.730
otherwise nothing would work.

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:52.390
In plasma, there's no
friction, and there's

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:53.820
no common attractor.

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:56.809
However, there's Landau,
still it's a stable media.

00:36:56.809 --> 00:36:58.350
And if you make a
small perturbation,

00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:00.800
it will spontaneously damp.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:05.290
This is the paradoxical
Landau damping effect,

00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:10.390
which, more or less, appears in
one paper of plasma physics out

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:14.740
of three, so common
is it in its use.

00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:18.100
So what we did, the
two of us-- that

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:21.710
is me together with Clement
Mouhot, a former collaborator--

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:23.800
was establish this
Landau damping

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:28.430
in the mathematical world
under nonlinear equations,

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:32.380
so to speak, the true equation
of plasma, so to speak,

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:36.890
while it had always been
treated under approximate linear

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:38.280
equation.

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.750
There was a huge
jump in difficulty.

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:46.590
The linearized treatment
is like three pages.

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:51.930
The nonlinear treatment took
up a whole paper of 180 pages.

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:55.670
And this came at the same
time with new insight,

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:59.250
in particular to the fact that
this problem was connected

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:01.740
to the stability problem,
which was devised

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:05.650
in the '50s for the solar
system, and to a paradoxical

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:08.780
phenomena of
spontaneous response

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:11.620
by the plasma of a
couple of impulses,

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:14.170
known as the plasma echo.

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:17.990
So new insights, new
theorem, and so on.

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:22.800
But in the end,
how did it arrive?

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:28.540
In many cases, I do lecture
about this Landau damping.

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.570
And I give these
lectures around the world

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:33.670
to physicists, to
mathematicians, and so on,

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:38.590
but as if it's something
simple because a posteriori.

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:40.790
It's always simple
when you understand.

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:44.160
When you are in the middle
of it, it's always a mess,

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.660
and it's not simple.

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:49.410
And in the book, it's
precisely the complementary

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:51.490
of the usual talk
that there would be.

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:53.805
I don't explain what
the science is about.

00:38:53.805 --> 00:38:57.160
I only explain about
the discovery process.

00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:59.930
And like in the Poincare,
using the big words

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:02.360
without any explanation,
but that's the way

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:07.750
we talk with each other,
showing all sorts of formulas.

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:11.955
And by the way, this is
the first [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:11.955 --> 00:39:14.040
book that I know of
which has been entirely

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.710
typeset with the word
processor that we

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:18.530
use for mathematical formulas.

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:25.364
That is the TeX software
from Newton Stanford.

00:39:25.364 --> 00:39:30.620
Also showing the moments
where you work, like Poincare,

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:32.630
the moments of hard
work, like when

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:36.320
you are at 3:00 AM
in your apartment

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.380
working like crazy to
make the computation

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:41.280
work, the moments
of illumination,

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.160
like, ah, that's the way
it has to do, the moments

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.160
of interaction, and so on.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.260
The book is like a pregnancy.

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:50.250
"Birth of the Theorem"
is like-- in fact, it's

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:52.900
the last chapter is the
birth because that's

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:55.240
publication for a paper.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:00.960
Publication is when the idea
is out and going in the world.

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:05.820
And all the what comes
before is like the pregnancy.

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.410
The first chapter
is the fecundation.

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:11.740
There is a discussion
between Clement and myself.

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:14.345
And we are discussing,
and this is interaction.

00:40:14.345 --> 00:40:19.410
And like, we wanted to work on
something completely different.

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:21.890
We discuss on the blackboard,
tak, tak, tak, tak.

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:25.090
And oh, this reminds
me of a conversation

00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:28.300
that they had two years ago
in Princeton with a postdoc,

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.000
and that was the question
he had, et cetera,

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.020
and then we think of it.

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:34.380
And then said but
it also rings a bell

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:38.770
with some other conversation
three months ago in Providence

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:41.065
with some other guy,
and we put together.

00:40:41.065 --> 00:40:42.690
And then, ah, but
then this should have

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:44.260
to do with the Landau damping.

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:44.900
What?

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:46.690
It was not the intention
to work on this.

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:50.080
But from the interaction
started the project.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:53.160
And then took two
years to-- first

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.590
took several months
to understand

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:56.490
what we wanted to prove.

00:40:56.490 --> 00:41:01.290
And then took more than one
year to put the proof together

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:04.330
with many mistakes, with
false announcements.

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:05.850
Now we know we can do it.

00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:07.870
Now we cannot do it, et cetera.

00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:12.360
With conversations, discussions,
and also a lot of environment,

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.990
like listening to
this music, doing

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:18.760
this, whatever, and that keeps
you going, keeps you going.

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.990
So by the way, a
word about the title.

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:30.375
Original French title was,
[FRENCH], "Birth of a Theorem."

00:41:30.375 --> 00:41:32.220
And that's really what it is.

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:37.130
Then the French editor was
not so happy about the title.

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:41.442
Why can't you make it a bit more
ambiguous, more romantic maybe?

00:41:41.442 --> 00:41:44.920
And I thought, OK, we
give various tries.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.440
And then "Theoreme
vivant," "Living Theorem,"

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.420
yes, that's more ambiguous.

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:51.440
What does it mean,
"Theoreme vivant"?

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.990
Well, maybe that's a guy
who's a living theorem.

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:57.270
Maybe it's about the
fact that mathematics

00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:58.850
is living, et cetera.

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:02.480
Also it rang a bell
with a book which

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:07.510
I read as a child, Disney
photograph book named

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:10.210
"Desert Leafs," [FRENCH].

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:11.290
Maybe some of you saw it.

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:11.790
No?

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:12.710
Maybe.

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:15.810
And you know the desert,
when you are not there,

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:20.040
you think it's some
boring, dry, dead place.

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:21.350
But you look at the pictures.

00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:23.890
You see when you know where
to look and when to look,

00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:28.390
it's full of color, full
of life, fascinating.

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:30.120
It's the same with mathematics.

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:33.949
For people out there, it's
this desert, dry, dead subject.

00:42:33.949 --> 00:42:35.490
And when you know
where to look, it's

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:38.420
this fascinating,
colorful, living subject.

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:40.280
So the analogy was good for me.

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.130
So "Theoreme vivant" it was.

00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:46.230
But then the English
translators, the publisher,

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:50.500
OK, you know, "Theoreme
vivant" is a bit too ambiguous.

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:53.340
Why don't we use something
more to the point?

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:54.840
Why not "Birth of a Theorem"?

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:56.600
And I said, OK, good.

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.631
OK, if you wish.

00:42:59.631 --> 00:43:01.880
That's one of the great
things when you publish a book

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:04.630
and it's being translated,
you have all the variants.

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:07.480
And by the way, all
the cliches are true.

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:10.494
That's what you learn
with this kind of process.

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:16.330
To finish, what do
you find in the book?

00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:18.500
You find all the
ingredients which

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:22.620
you need to make your
idea stand up on its feet.

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:25.280
We don't know how
the idea occurs, how

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.020
the theorem occurs in the end.

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.920
But we know what you
need, all the ingredients.

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.540
Then the chemical
reaction is a mystery.

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.990
The first ingredient
is documentation,

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:39.100
because you never do
research out of the blue.

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:43.760
It always builds on previous
research and insights.

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:47.310
Documentation can be things
several centuries ago,

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:49.800
can be things very
recent and so on.

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:55.540
Of course, it was transformed
by computers and by internet.

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:57.640
In one example that
I quote in the book,

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:02.870
at some point I need to have a
certain formula, like whatever,

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:05.960
iterated derivatives or
compositions of functions.

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.790
Eh, I have no idea what it is.

00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:12.780
But I remember, it seems to
me that 15 years ago as I

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:15.910
was a student, our professor
was telling of something

00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:18.265
that looks like this.

00:44:18.265 --> 00:44:21.190
Ah, never mind if you
don't remember the formula.

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:24.840
Just a few keywords,
and you get the formula.

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:26.120
You get the history.

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:28.590
You get the conditions
application.

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:31.260
You get everything you
want to know about it.

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:35.600
So the problem becomes not,
what is the formula, but just,

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.600
ah, that's the formula.

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.900
I need a formula of that type.

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:44.810
And still, of course,
it's quite a big deal,

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:48.270
but it helps you a lot to
have all this knowledge which

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:51.170
is dispersed and accessible.

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:54.770
Second ingredient is motivation.

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:57.820
Motivation is maybe the most
important of the ingredients,

00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:59.140
but it's the most mysterious.

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:01.710
Nobody knows what
motivates people.

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:02.760
And it's not rational.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.176
Sometimes you lose
the motivation,

00:45:04.176 --> 00:45:06.000
and there's nothing
one can do about it.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.680
It's like when you are going
into a nervous breakdown.

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:12.400
There's no rational thing
taking you back in business,

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:15.810
and there's no rational argument
keeping you motivated again.

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:18.990
Actually, when
you read the book,

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:22.500
you have the impression
it's completely insane,

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:24.895
the amount of
motivation and faith

00:45:24.895 --> 00:45:26.930
in the final result
that we display.

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:30.480
Like, you think, we
already worked for one year

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:32.480
on this 100 pages.

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:33.980
We still don't know if it works.

00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:35.460
Do you really
think it will work?

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:36.720
Yes, yes, we'll do it.

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.660
We have to do it and so on.

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:40.450
It's just a gut feeling.

00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:42.810
So why do people
become motivated?

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:44.360
Why do people
become researchers?

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:46.260
By the way, a creative process.

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:50.240
Some people say childhood
is so important for this.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:54.100
By the way, both Szilard
and Turing all their life

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:56.150
were influenced,
strongly influenced,

00:45:56.150 --> 00:46:00.040
by a book they read when
they were 10 years old.

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:03.190
In the case of Turing, it's a
book called "Natural Wonders

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:04.770
Every Child Should Know."

00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:08.350
And all his work on
artificial intelligence,

00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:11.150
whatever, you can find
it in German in this book

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:12.710
he read when he was 10.

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:14.580
I don't know what I
read when I was 10,

00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:18.600
but I was watching this movie,
"Donald in Mathmagic Land."

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:21.190
I don't tell you it's
high mathematics,

00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:23.360
but I thought it
was fascinating.

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:26.490
Maybe this played a role in
me becoming a mathematician.

00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:27.910
Who knows?

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:31.290
Here is an interesting
experiment about motivation,

00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:33.260
by the way.

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:35.590
It was made in the UK.

00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:40.020
It was all these [INAUDIBLE]
here as school children,

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:41.940
and there's one
researcher there.

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:45.230
So they all worked on the
experiment and so on, kids

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:47.600
from 8 to 10-year-old.

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:53.500
And they worked on how do
bees get where to forage from

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:56.380
and whether they are
sensitive to patterns,

00:46:56.380 --> 00:47:00.340
and it was published in
a scientific journal.

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:03.650
"We discovered that bumblebees
can use a combination of color

00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:07.380
and spatial relationships in
deciding which color of flower

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:08.190
to forage from.

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:11.090
We also discovered that
science is cool and fun

00:47:11.090 --> 00:47:15.200
because you get to do stuff that
no one has ever done before."

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:19.920
So this is one example
of experiment devised

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.840
to trigger strong motivation.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:23.550
OK.

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:26.260
Third ingredient is ecosystem.

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:30.030
The innovation never
arrives on its own.

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:32.305
The inventor is never
alone, and there's always

00:47:32.305 --> 00:47:35.960
a whole ecosystem
which is around.

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:40.730
Often it comes in
cities, for instance,

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:41.920
or regions of the world.

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:44.240
There was one point in
history in which Persepolis

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:47.355
was the most innovative city in
the world, one point in history

00:47:47.355 --> 00:47:51.860
in which was Paris, one point
in which it was Budapest.

00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:56.700
Of course, everybody is aware
of Silicon Valley innovation.

00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:59.370
And as an ecosystem, it
[INAUDIBLE] and so on.

00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:02.120
If you are a director
of a laboratory,

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:04.220
as is my case with
Poincare, your work

00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:09.970
is to make in the lab an
atmosphere so that people

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:13.890
could be creative and profit,
meet each other, whatever.

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:16.310
So that the fact that
there are many people

00:48:16.310 --> 00:48:19.770
together will make
them, as a whole,

00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:23.310
more productive, more efficient,
more creative than if it's just

00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:27.327
individual, and this other,
and this other, and so on.

00:48:27.327 --> 00:48:28.910
In this case, in the
case of the book,

00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:32.670
the fact that it originated
in Lyon was so important.

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:35.060
My colleagues in Lyon, in
particular, [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:36.490
meet the colleagues
at some point.

00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:39.610
Put me in the right direction
for wrong reasons, by the way.

00:48:39.610 --> 00:48:43.900
But it was in discussion and
so on that the project started.

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:47.140
And later, at some point in
the book, I moved to Princeton.

00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:50.510
And half of the hard
work, or more than that,

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:54.100
is done while I am in
Princeton, and my collaborator

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:55.900
is in Paris.

00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:58.780
And in fact, at some point,
I am in this very particular

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:01.610
atmosphere of the Institute for
Advanced Studies in Princeton,

00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:06.150
in which you can concentrate
like crazy for days and days

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:08.055
on a certain problem
with no obligations

00:49:08.055 --> 00:49:14.800
and so on, also was enormously
important part of the work.

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:16.670
The next ingredient
is the communication.

00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:19.130
I told you when I
was in Princeton

00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:21.300
and Clement was in Paris,
how we would communicate?

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:23.230
Well, email, lots of emails.

00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:27.270
Every day emails, hundred
of emails to work on this.

00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:31.260
And of course, it makes like
your kind of delocalized brain

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:32.110
with this.

00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:34.540
In all my experience
of researcher,

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:37.266
all the time, projects
were originated

00:49:37.266 --> 00:49:40.410
by face-to-face
contact and deepened

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:42.710
by email collaboration.

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:46.100
And these are very different
phases of the project.

00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:48.580
The start, the initiation
of the project,

00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:51.780
and the deepening of the project
requires different environment,

00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:54.160
different skills, and so on.

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:57.260
Tim Gowers in the
UK, by the way,

00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:03.040
who got Fields Medal
in the late '90s,

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:05.550
made experiments of
massive collaboration

00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:09.370
in mathematics, like hundreds of
mathematicians working together

00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:11.620
on a single theorem.

00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:16.950
A bit like, of course, is done
in free software industry,

00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:22.060
but at a very theoretical level.

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:28.190
The next ingredient that
you need for the ideas

00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:29.555
are the constraints.

00:50:29.555 --> 00:50:32.920
If you have no constraints,
then you have no creativity.

00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:37.740
And this is not
particular to science.

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:39.890
In mathematics, we do
feel the constraints

00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:43.100
so strongly because it
needs to be all rigorous.

00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:44.820
It's crazy constraint.

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:47.140
You know, famous
problem in mathematics

00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:48.920
is the Riemann hypothesis.

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:54.910
It was checked on thousands
of billions of experiments.

00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:58.370
But that is not the
proof for mathematicians.

00:50:58.370 --> 00:51:01.105
The proof will only be
a set of logical rules

00:51:01.105 --> 00:51:03.180
at such a crazy constraint.

00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:05.470
And so it's no wonder
that mathematics

00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:07.810
can lose lots of
creativity because you have

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:09.670
to overcome the constraint.

00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:15.230
It's the same in every field
of human culture and so on.

00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:19.550
For instance, poetry, at the
same time, the most constrained

00:51:19.550 --> 00:51:22.930
and the most creative
of literary genres.

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:25.080
Here I put as
illustration of the power

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:27.800
of constraint two
of my favorite, very

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:30.220
innovative pieces of art.

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:36.870
One is the study by Gyorgy
Ligeti consisting of only A's.

00:51:39.956 --> 00:51:42.320
You know, like A, B, C,
D. It's a [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:47.080
Here there's only A. And
still it's not boring.

00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:49.120
That's the surprising
stuff, because you

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:51.250
have to work on all the rest.

00:51:51.250 --> 00:51:53.080
And the other is the
famous thick novel

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:57.050
by Georges Perec, which doesn't
use the single letter e.

00:51:57.050 --> 00:52:01.030
So in each case, you
have the impression

00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:04.250
it's kind of a new kind of
art because of the constraint.

00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:06.978
The constraint in itself
puts the creativity.

00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:13.800
In mathematics, one example,
depending on whether

00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:16.260
you are imposing yourself
to be constructive or

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:17.710
non-constructive.

00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:20.340
Being constructive is an
the additional constraint,

00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:23.850
and it requires
much more creativity

00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:26.290
to find how to estimate
and construct the things.

00:52:26.290 --> 00:52:28.250
I belong to this
strain in some sense.

00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:31.410
For instance, I
always want theorems

00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:34.510
to come with a kind
of recipe, algorithm.

00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:36.750
The next ingredient
is the intuition.

00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:39.560
Intuition is this thing
that we don't understand,

00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:42.270
which comes together with the
hard work, the illumination,

00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:43.020
and so on.

00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:45.320
One story, which I
tell in the book.

00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:49.200
At some point in the process,
after months and months

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:53.020
of work, I am here
in my apartment

00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:56.310
working late at night
trying to fix a proof.

00:52:56.310 --> 00:52:58.590
You have to imagine
the situation.

00:52:58.590 --> 00:53:02.270
I already announced that I can
prove the theorem in public.

00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:05.900
And I discover there's a
big gap here, still there.

00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:08.990
Well, it should not be so
big, but still there is a gap.

00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:11.260
And so it's a big
problem, and so I'm

00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:15.220
working hard to fix the
gap, trying all my tricks,

00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:16.570
years of experience.

00:53:16.570 --> 00:53:21.880
And 1:00 AM, 2:00 AM, 3:00
AM, 4:00 AM, go to bed.

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:24.380
And doesn't work, doesn't work.

00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:26.360
And then I wake
up in the morning,

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:29.000
order the kids to take
to school, or what.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.560
And then there is this
voice in my head--

00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:33.840
take the second term on
the other side and Fourier

00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:34.840
transform.

00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:38.200
And that was the start
of the solution indeed.

00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.300
And I tell you,
having this sensation

00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:43.244
of the voice in your
head is something--

00:53:43.244 --> 00:53:49.850
it's an experience
that-- it's exhilarating.

00:53:49.850 --> 00:53:50.730
I don't know.

00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:55.150
And showing how much the brain
is still working and working

00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:57.860
after this preparation
phase, and so that there

00:53:57.860 --> 00:53:59.950
can be something like a light.

00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:07.320
The last ingredient you
need is chance, is luck.

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:09.490
Because you will
try and try and try,

00:54:09.490 --> 00:54:12.620
and it will always be a failure,
except from sometime where,

00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:15.160
by luck, you have
some good feeling.

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:19.450
And the most important is
recognize when you are lucky.

00:54:19.450 --> 00:54:23.700
So this is so tremendously
important in the research.

00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:27.168
So that's it, seven
ingredients that are there.

00:54:27.168 --> 00:54:31.930
And mix together a reaction,
whatever, luck, whatever,

00:54:31.930 --> 00:54:33.760
after some time get the idea.

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:36.100
In this case, get the theorem.

00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:39.070
And after, it's another process.

00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:42.990
You will go and publishing
it and share it and so on.

00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:48.960
While we are there, let us put
a nice quote of Thomas Jefferson

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:52.810
about ideas here for sharing.

00:54:52.810 --> 00:54:57.190
"If nature has made any one
thing less susceptible than all

00:54:57.190 --> 00:55:00.700
others of exclusive property,
it is the action of the thinking

00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:04.490
power called an idea, which
an individual may exclusively

00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:07.200
possess as long as he
keeps it to himself;

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:10.070
but the moment it is
divulged, it forces itself

00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:12.070
into the possession
of every one,

00:55:12.070 --> 00:55:15.300
and the receiver cannot
dispossess himself of it.

00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:18.830
Its peculiar character, too, is
that no one possesses the less,

00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:21.770
because every other
possesses the whole of it.

00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:25.700
He who receives an idea from
me receives instruction himself

00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:28.110
without lessening
mine; as he who

00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:30.330
lights his taper at
the mine, receives

00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:32.700
light without darkening me."

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:37.188
In those days, politicians did
speak quite well, you know.

00:55:37.188 --> 00:55:40.290
And this is from Poincare.

00:55:40.290 --> 00:55:46.390
"Thought is like lightning
of striking the long night.

00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:50.300
But it is that lightning
which is everything."

00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:54.750
Because, of course, it may
be a big idea, difficulty,

00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:56.110
years of work, and whatever.

00:55:56.110 --> 00:55:58.980
Whatever you have as
an idea, it will only

00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:01.340
be a tiny, tiny,
tiny part of what

00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:05.380
you would like to prove and
to know in the general nature.

00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:07.910
So if you ask, for
instance, mathematicians

00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:10.660
what we understand about
the world around us,

00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:12.810
they will tell you,
pah, so little.

00:56:12.810 --> 00:56:16.760
It's like tiny islands
in ocean of unknown.

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:18.580
And it's exactly
like Poincare said.

00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:21.610
It's like this
lightning strikes,

00:56:21.610 --> 00:56:24.440
so thin in the long night.

00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:27.240
So we know almost nothing,
but the almost nothing

00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:31.050
is so precious because that
something really came out

00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:34.470
of the culture and the
richness of the thought

00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:37.190
of many, many people
and the efforts.

00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.690
OK.

00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:38.290
Thank you.

00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:41.164
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:42.784 --> 00:56:44.200
ERIN SODERBERG:
Thank you, Cedric.

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:47.510
I think we have time for
one question, maybe two.

00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:50.510
AUDIENCE: So some of us here are
software engineers, not quite

00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:51.660
the number 1 profession.

00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:53.490
But we're OK on the list.

00:56:53.490 --> 00:56:57.900
And when we write
180-page program,

00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:00.110
we're pretty sure there's
some problems in it,

00:57:00.110 --> 00:57:03.164
and we have some
tools for fixing that.

00:57:03.164 --> 00:57:04.580
How does that
compare to the tours

00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:07.526
you have to make sure
your 180 pages are right?

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:12.110
CEDRIC VILLANI: It's
pretty much the same.

00:57:12.110 --> 00:57:14.280
We know there are
always mistakes.

00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:18.800
And big problem is to
understand it sufficiently well

00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:21.350
that you are confident
it will work,

00:57:21.350 --> 00:57:24.780
even if there are
these small mistakes.

00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:27.150
From time to time, you fail.

00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:28.880
And there are famous
cases in which

00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:32.780
a famous theorem, for instance,
becomes a conjecture when

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:35.310
the big mistake is discovered.

00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:37.860
And there are some--
in the history

00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:39.360
of 20th-century
mathematics, there

00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:42.240
are some famous cases like this,
in particular, for some reason,

00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:44.720
in the field of
dynamical systems.

00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:52.510
And so we are never really sure
if some important criteria is

00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:56.400
later, when someone simplifies
a proof, when someone gets

00:57:56.400 --> 00:58:00.440
a different proof of the same
result, when the theorem is

00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:04.530
taught, when you get lectures,
et cetera and so forth.

00:58:04.530 --> 00:58:09.040
But it's so difficult to
take the mistakes out.

00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:12.320
So right now, there
is all this trend

00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:18.480
about automatic checking of
proofs, with, in particular,

00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:21.560
research institutions like
[INAUDIBLE] in France.

00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:24.080
And for instance, one
of the leaders in this,

00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:30.190
Georges recently worked
out this challenge.

00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:33.560
He took a famous
proof in group theory,

00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:36.530
I think like a 200-page
proof, a big thing,

00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:40.280
and-or translated it
in this Coq language,

00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:44.320
which supports
automatic verification.

00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:46.980
And showed, indeed, that
even though in the proof

00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:52.040
there were some minor mistakes,
the whole thing was correct.

00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:56.810
Certainly this will
develop and develop.

00:58:56.810 --> 00:59:00.370
In the same group--
because, of course,

00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:04.830
it's a mixture of logic,
computer science, mathematics,

00:59:04.830 --> 00:59:08.740
and so on-- in the same
group there is Xavier Leroy..

00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:09.920
Some of you may know him.

00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:10.810
Yes.

00:59:10.810 --> 00:59:14.210
So he worked on the
certified C compiler,

00:59:14.210 --> 00:59:18.060
and he explains every
single of the C compilers

00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:19.790
which are out there
has some bugs.

00:59:19.790 --> 00:59:23.140
A bug meaning that sometimes
you do the program,

00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:25.690
and the executive
file resulting from it

00:59:25.690 --> 00:59:28.370
is not the one
that you would want

00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:30.870
and in some locations
gives the wrong answer.

00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:33.040
Except his one,
which he developed

00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:35.860
specifically using
this machinery

00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:37.880
of automatic checking.

00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:43.040
So I think it's quite
the same problem.

00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:48.590
With long computer softwares
and long mathematical proofs,

00:59:48.590 --> 00:59:53.600
there are always bugs in there,
except if you can, as you said,

00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:56.449
check them specifically
and systematically.

00:59:56.449 --> 00:59:58.240
ERIN SODERBERG: I thank
you all for coming.

00:59:58.240 --> 00:59:59.781
And let's thank
Cedric one more time.

00:59:59.781 --> 01:00:00.570
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:00.570 --> 01:00:01.653
CEDRIC VILLANI: Thank you.

01:00:01.653 --> 01:00:04.220
[APPLAUSE]
