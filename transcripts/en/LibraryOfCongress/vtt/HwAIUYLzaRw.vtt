and [inaudible] specialist

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.100
I would like to welcome you

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.850

distinguished speaker,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.900
I would like to thank

and setting up the room.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.750
My colleagues in the Hispanic
Division, especially Catalina Gomez

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.920
and our Chief Georgette Dorn.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.600
Also deserve a big thank you for
their support and help in sorting

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.000
out all the details for
making this event possible.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.050
Today we have the honor to
welcome Professor William Egginton

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.660
for what I'm sure will
be a fascinating lecture

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.820
on Miguel de Cervantes
Saavedra and the art of fiction.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.130
This talk is the third
and last in a series

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.100
of events celebrating the
life and work of Cervantes

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.250
in the 400th year of his death.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.550
In case you missed any

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.460
of our previous events you can

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.550
and those events and many other
great talks that we organize

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.370
in the Hispanic Division.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.630
Professor Egginton is the Andrew W.
Mellon professor in the humanities

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.400

and Latin American literature,
literary theory, and the relation

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.330
between literature and philosophy.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.680
He's also the director

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.100
of the Alexander Grass
Humanities Institute at Hopkins.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.030
Professor Egginton's body
of work is a testament

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.370
to the erudition of a true scholar.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.240
His breath and depth of research
demonstrates originality,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.850
theoretical strength and passion.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.050
He is the author of How the
World Became a Stage, Presence,

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.570

of Modernity which is based

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.050
on his dissertation at Stanford
university under the direction

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.560

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.300

And the coeditor with David E.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.000
And I want to take this opportunity

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.110
He's also the author of numerous

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.210

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:06.020 position:56%
And he has written on topics ranging
from neuroscience, law and zombies,

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.820
there's a great title there.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.210
He's here today to talk

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.080

in the Modern World
published in 2016,

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:24.380
an indication that some good
things did happen in 2016 for sure.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.510
Please join me in welcoming
Dr. William Egginton.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:35.730
[ Applause ]

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.250
&gt;&gt; William Egginton: Thank you
Georgette, thank you Talia,

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.860
and all the colleagues at the
Library of Congress, it's an honor

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.780
and a real pleasure to be here.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.350
I've visited our library before,
but never in this capacity

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.540
and it's a real honor as I say.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.980
One brief note just because it's
so hot off the press David Castillo

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.780
and I just published our book
Medialogies, Reading Reality

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.170
in the Age of Inflationary
Media, which had the distinction,

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.120
it came out two weeks
as someone pointed

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.830
out on Twitter soon
thereafter of having --

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.010
we started writing it
three or four years ago.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.310
All of our political examples
were in fact about Donald Trump

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.710
with no knowledge even
that he was going

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.010
to declare himself as a candidate.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.420
So, it's an analysis of
media practices in the 20th

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:25.070
and 21st century from the framework
of media revolutions 400 years ago.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.300
So, the idea that the grounds
were laid for this kind

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.200
of political turmoil 400 years
ago is an interesting one

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.710
and certainly thought-provoking.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.530 position:56%
So, what I plan to do today, is the
sound good for everyone in the room?

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.830
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.130
&gt;&gt; William Egginton: Yeah?

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.980
Is a reading from the
Man Who Invented Fiction.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.350
It'll probably be 45 or 50 minutes,
I'll jump around a little bit here

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.520
and there in the book and
accompany it with some images,

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.600
some of them are in the
book, others supplemented.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.530
Most of the images
if not all have come

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.200
from The George Peabody Library,
our Collection of Rare Books

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.590
at Baltimore which I decided
to focus on in my research.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.410
We have such great
collections from 17th

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.600
and 16th century Spanish literature
that I thought this was a resource

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.660
that really needed to be
brought to the public eye.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.680
So, without further
ado I'll get into it.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.920
Something strange happened
in the winter of 1605,

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.360
at the heart of the world's
most powerful empire in a time

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.650
of economic decline and political
stagnation word started spreading

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.770
about of all things a book.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.130
The dealers quickly sold out,

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.430
those who could read passed
increasingly threadbare copies

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.850
from hand to hand, and those who
could not read began to congregate

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:51.450 position:56%
in inns, village squares and taverns
to hear those pages read aloud.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.280
Packed in tightly around worn
wooden tables, clutching goblets

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.900
of acrid wine and warmed by a smoky
hearth those fortunate enough to be

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.350
in attendance when a literate
benefactor declaimed the opening

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:08.580
words were not treated to an
epic rendering of heroic deeds,

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.340
a lyrical [inaudible]
to a shepherd's love

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.250
or a pious reflection on the
martyrdom of a beloved saint.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.770
Instead, as they washed back
their dregs and squeezed in closer

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.280
to get a better seat
they were among the first

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.220
to hear these now immortal
opening words.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:31.430
Somewhere in La Mancha in a
place whose name I do not care

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:36.080
to remember a gentleman
lived not long ago.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.250
It would not be long in fact,
until the tipsy crowd was cackling

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.270
in delight over the misadventures

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.270
of what would become world
literature's most recognizable

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:49.610
protagonist, a rickety geriatric
member of the lower gentry

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:54.150 position:56%
who foolish enough to have traded in
much of his land for countless books

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.820
of chivalry quote became
so caught up in reading

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.440
that he spent his nights
reading from dusk till dawn

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.440
and his days reading
from sunrise to sunset.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:07.140
And so, with too little sleep and
too much reading his brains dried

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.760
up causing him to lose his mind.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.440
In this state, the pitiful
gentleman has quoting again,

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.840
the strangest thought any
lunatic in the world ever had,

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.450
which was that it seemed
reasonable and necessary for him,

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.780
both for the sake of his honor
as a service to the nation

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.810
to become a knight errant and
travel the world with his armor

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:31.310 position:56%
and his horse to seek adventures and
engage in everything he had heard

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.270
that knight errants engage in.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.760
Writing all manners of wrong
and by seizing the opportunity

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.180
and placing himself in danger

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:41.560
and writing those wrongs
winning eternal renown

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.450
and everlasting fame end quote.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:47.290
How they howled with
laughter as they heard

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:48.940
for the first time the exploits

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:52.790
of this ridiculous geezer wandering
a countryside they recognize

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.860
as their own and coming
face-to-face with the kinds

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.960
of people they spent
their days with,

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.430
the kinds of people they
were likely rubbing shoulders

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.040
with as they listened to this tale.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.880
Mule drivers and scullery
maids, farmers

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.840
and prostitutes, barbers
and innkeepers.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.020
For the first half hour,
our tavern crowd is treated

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.260
to the circus it came for.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:19.560
The aging madman mistakes
a [inaudible] for a castle,

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.750 position:56%
its owner for a noble knight and two
common wenches for exquisite ladies.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:28.850
He requests the boon of an official
dubbing from the wily innkeeper

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.400
who knows his tales of chivalry
enough to keep in character,

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.230
even as the hapless hero
wreaks havoc on his guests

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.990
and provokes giggles in
the ladies of easy virtue.

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:41.930
As he chastises a farmer
and he chastises a farmer

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.450
for beating a servant, but then
trusts in his chivalry enough

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:49.520
to send them off together again
with a mere promise of recompense

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.880
to the farmer's like sly delight
and the servant's enduring agony.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.170
The story our tavern
crowd is hearing

00:09:56.170 --> 00:10:01.350
in other words is pure embodied
satire, an unbridled ribbing

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.840
of an impoverished and
degenerate gentry anesthetized

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:09.290
by the cliched literature
of a previous century.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.590
Well into their second
or third round

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:15.580
of libations our tavern goers
hear how the aged gentleman comes

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.980
to realize he's missing
something and resolves quote,

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.330
to return to his house
and outfit himself

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.310 position:56%
with everything, including a squire.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:27.630 position:56%
Thinking he would take on a neighbor
of his, a peasant who was poor

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:29.930
and had children, but
was very well-suited

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.950
to the chivalric occupation
of a squire.

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:36.510 position:56%
At home for two weeks the delusional
knight convinces his peasant

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:40.530
neighbor to join him
promising him upon completion

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:44.480
of their quest an island,
which he insists on calling

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:49.470
in proper epic form by its
Latinate name an insular.

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:52.490
Insouciant to the geographically
inconvenient fact

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:54.740
that they are wandering
around the arid plains

00:10:54.740 --> 00:11:00.190
of central Spain many days travel
from any significant body of water.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:06.080
The introduction of this stout
simple neighbor changes everything.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.440 position:56%
For the listeners and the tavern and
for us they're literary descendants

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.640
until Don Quixote seeks
out Sancho Panza for these

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.350
of course are the characters
I've been describing.

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:21.030
He is but a foil, a rube, a
brilliantly crafted one to be sure,

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:23.560
but nonetheless an
object of derision

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:28.830
that our tavern fellows would
feel comfortable ridiculing.

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:33.880
At the time of the writing,
the mentally ill were protected

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.190
from prosecution from certain
crimes, but they were not protected

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:41.450
from abuse, marginalization and
being used as the butt of a joke

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:44.760
for a populist star
for entertainment.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:49.220
Having found Sancho Panza though
Quixote suddenly becomes something

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.470
quite different.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:54.970
Within a page or two of setting
off together the two companions

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:58.740
encounter their most
iconic adventure.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:02.020
Good fortune is guiding our affairs
better than we could have desired

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:07.330
for you see here Sancho, 30 or more
enormous giants with whom I intend

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:11.070
to do battle and whose
lives I intend to take.

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:14.510
And with the spoils we
shall now begin to grow rich

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:18.930 position:56%
for this is righteous warfare and it
is a great service to God to remove

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:22.970
so evil a breed from
the face of the earth.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:25.680
What giants said Sancho Panza.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.600
Those over there replied his
master with the long arms,

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.310
sometimes they're almost
two leagues long.

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:36.540
Look your grace Sancho
responded, those things that appear

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:40.010
over there aren't giants,
but windmills and what looks

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.530
like their arms are the sails
that are turned by the wind

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:45.260
to make the grindstone move.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:50.310
Predictably, famously Don Quixote
does not heed his good squire's

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:55.550 position:56%
commonsense admonitions, but instead
charges ahead spearing the enormous

00:12:55.550 --> 00:13:00.080
sail of a windmill's arm with
his lance being lifted horse

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.960
and all off the ground
and smashed back

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.040
down in a miserable aching heap.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:10.230
Sancho's reaction to his mishap
though is different from those

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:13.680
that greeted all his
previous antics.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:18.210
Where the others treated Quixote
as a spectacle, an entertainment

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:22.880
or a nuisance Sancho
responds with compassion.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.160
Seeing his master lying
next to his fallen horse

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.220
and shattered lance Sancho quote,
hurried to help him as fast

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.960
as his donkey could carry him.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.260
And when he reached them,

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.940
he discovered that Don Quixote
could not move because he had taken

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.280
so hard to fall on [inaudible].

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.370
God save me said Sancho,
didn't I tell your grace

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.300
to watch what you were that
these were nothing but windmills

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:50.530
and only somebody whose head was
full of them wouldn't know that.

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:55.000
From the limited outlook of his own
simplicity Sancho sees his master

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.050
fail, sees the calamitous
consequences of his delusions,

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:03.940
and yet decides to
accept him despite them.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:07.020
Quoting again, it's in
God's hands said Sancho,

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.830
I believe everything
your grace says,

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.870
but sit a little straighter
it looks like you're tilting,

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.320
it must be the battering
that you took.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:21.440
In the space of a few pages
what had started as an exercise

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.600
in comic ridicule and
as the narrator insists

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.040
on several occasions, a
satirical sendup of the tales

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:32.140
of chivalry has taken on an
entirely different dimension.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:36.620
It has begun to transform itself
into the story of a relationship

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.550
between two characters
whose incompatible takes

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:43.030
on the world are bridged
by friendship,

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.920
loyalty, and eventually love.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.500
When deep in the second part
published 10 years after the first,

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.490
a mischievous duchess
elicits Sancho's confession

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:56.240
that he does indeed know that
Quixote is mad and then accuses him

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.130
of being quote, more of
a madman and a dimwit

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.400
than his master for following him.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:07.470 position:56%
Sancho replies, if I were clever man
I would've left my master days ago,

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:10.230
but this is my fate and
this is my misfortune.

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.060
I can't help it.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.780
I have to follow him, we're
from the same village,

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.770
I've eaten his bread,
I love him dearly.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:21.660 position:56%
He's a grateful man, he gave me his
donkeys and more than anything else,

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:25.830 position:56%
I'm faithful so it's impossible for
anything to separate us except a man

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:27.470
with his pick and shovel.

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:30.860
As the great German Scholar
Eric Alba [phonetic] wrote

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:34.880
of Sancho's attachment to Quixote,
the former quote, learns from him

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.520
and refuses to part from him

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.170
and in Quixote's company he
becomes cleverer and better

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:43.390
than he was before, end quote.

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:46.050
The fire light flickering
across the faces

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:50.940
of our eager listeners registers
no [inaudible] cast by this change.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.790
The raucous tavern crowd
continues to laugh as before.

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:59.480 position:56%
But as the innkeeper shouts for last
call and starts to close up shop,

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.240
as the stragglers put down
their empty cups and make

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:05.160
for the door chattering about
the tale and making plans

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.000 position:56%
to return the next evening so as not

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.740
to miss what happens next something
imperceptible to them has happened.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:17.280
The crowd that arrived that first
evening was used to ridicule,

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.770
they were fluent in
the language of satire.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:22.960
With Don Quixote they were
learning a new language,

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.770 position:56%
today we call that language fiction.

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:29.810
Most of us if asked would
probably define fiction

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:32.910
as an untrue story we
read for entertainment

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:35.630
in full knowledge that
it's not true.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.850
And certainly, that
much is accurate.

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:40.280
But think about what
actually happens to us

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.930
when our eyes start reading the
words on the page or the characters

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:47.480
in our favorite show start
to interact with one another.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.290
In a memorable scene from F. Scott
Fitzgerald's the Great Gatsby,

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:55.260
Nick Caraway's mind drifts out of
the apartment where he's entangled

00:16:55.260 --> 00:17:00.660
in some debauchery and imagines how
quote, high over the city our line

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.840
of yellow windows must have
contributed their share

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.770
of human secrecy to the casual
watcher in the darkening streets

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:11.380
and I saw him too looking
up and wondering.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:16.400
I was within and without
simultaneously enchanted by

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:21.230
and repelled by the inexhaustible
variety of life, end quote.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:24.900
Like Nick when we engage with
fiction we are both within

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.500
and without the story we
are reading or watching.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:31.730
We are simultaneously ourselves
locked into our own particular view

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:36.430
on the world and someone else,
maybe even someone very different

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.770
from ourselves feeling how he

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:42.040
or she inhabits a very
different world from ours.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.750
And like Nick, we can
on the pages of our book

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:48.750
or on the screen before our
eyes be simultaneously enchanted

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:52.760
and repelled by the
inexhaustible variety of life.

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.660 position:56%
That ability to experience different

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:59.250
and at times even contradictory
realities without rejecting one

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:02.250
or the other is one of the
main reasons we are drawn

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:05.580
to fiction in all its forms.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:10.600
About a half year before on
a hot August day in 1604,

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.600
a man walked through the
dusty streets of [inaudible],

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:17.870
Spain clutching in his
right hand a heavy package.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:22.140
In the absence of any authentic
portraits we must trust his own

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:26.680
words to know that he was
brown haired and silver bearded

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:30.520
with an aquiline, but
well-proportioned he adds,

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:34.670
nose and cheerful eyes
partly hidden behind a pair

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:39.680
of smeared spectacles not shown in
this 19th century rendition here.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.160
Resembling in the words of one

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:46.830
of his literary rivals
badly fried eggs.

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:51.430
Of medium build and missing most of
his teeth, which was common enough

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:54.620
in those times for a man
just shy of 60 years.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:58.980 position:56%
He had lost the use of his left hand
many years earlier when he was hit

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:02.110
by [inaudible] shot while
boarding a Turkish galleon

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:04.090
at the battle of [inaudible].

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:07.840
His clothes from the wide
rough collar around his neck

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.430
to the tight stockings
exposing the hardened muscles

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:15.940 position:56%
of his calves would have broadcast
to his fellow pedestrians his status

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.370
as a member of the gentry.

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:23.480
Just as their ragged state would've
advertised his rather precarious

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.840
financial straits.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.100
Even though only recently arrived,

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.110
the man would hardly have been
a stranger to his neighbors

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:34.250
in [inaudible] meatpacking quarter
[foreign language], where he

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:40.200
and his extended family occupied
the floor above a raucous tavern.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.240
The [foreign language] was
on the outskirts of a town

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:46.870
that in 1604 could not keep pace
with its exploding population.

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:49.830
The rush of newcomers
driven by the transfer

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:53.860
of King Philip the third's court
from Madrid four years earlier

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:57.930
and brought new life and
glamor to [inaudible].

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:01.850
But it has also imposed
a severe housing crisis.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:04.730
While the government tried to
control growth and crowding

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:08.370
by issuing zoning laws limiting the
city's brightly colored buildings

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:12.110
to two stories the city's
savvy landlords responded

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:16.420
by constructing houses with
hidden stories in the back.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:19.030
Thus, this motley family
was not alone

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:21.320
in the landlord [inaudible] house,

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:26.220
all told there were some 20 tenants
living in its 13 rooms almost all

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:30.380
of them friends or relations
of Miguel de Cervantes.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:34.830
As the aging soldier stepped
gingerly over the rivulets of blood

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:38.150
and awful that cut through
the district's packed dirt

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:40.880
and stone streets his
one good arm hugged

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.990
that heavy package
tightly to his chest.

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:47.390
In it were hundreds of sheets
of paper, each sheet packed

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:51.710
to the margins with a neat slanted
hand of a professional scribe.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:55.950
Cervantes' own more round and
slightly meandering script

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:59.500
which would have overflowed
the many more hundreds of pages

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.900
of his blotted, scratched

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:04.390
and corrected manuscripts
can only be seen today

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:07.090
on a few precious remnants.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:12.410
A signed document from his 1597
stay in in Seville's municipal jail

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:15.750
where his thought that he first
dreamt up Don Quixote and a letter

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:20.430
to the Archbishop of
[inaudible] shown here.

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:25.650
The very prologue whose words he
penned only days before both speaks

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:29.950 position:56%
to his evident concern that he be
too closely associated with the book

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:34.240
and bears witness to the style of
writing that its pages initiated.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:39.000
Though I seem to be the father
he tells his idle reader,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.070
I'm the stepfather of Don Quixote.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:44.800
And then he proceeds to inform
the reader that he won't beg him

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.630
to ignore or forgive the
book's faults because quote,

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:52.640 position:56%
you have a soul in your body and a
will as free as anyone's and you are

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.990
in your own house where
you were Lord

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:57.690
as the sovereign is
master of his revenues.

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:00.320
And you know the old
saying, under the cover

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.550
of my cloak I can kill the king.

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:08.390
If the book seems to be to you
readers critical of society,

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:10.790
if it appears to you to
be saying the wrong kind

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:14.030
of thing Cervantes seems
to be telling his readers,

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:16.730
that's your responsibility.

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:20.410
You are free to judge not only the
book, but the world you live in,

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:22.400
free to resist, free revolt

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.910
against the values you've
been forced to believe in.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:28.750
And most shockingly, in a prologue
approved under the royal seal

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:31.200
under the cloak of your
own thoughts you are free

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.310
to kill the king himself.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:38.080
Cervantes is a valiant soldier and
a committed Christian had changed

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.310
over a lifetime of disappointments.

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:42.940
He had grown weary and wary

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:47.030
of his country's vaunted
certainty, cynical of its promises.

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:52.030
But while he could never openly
accuse the crown in Spanish society

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:55.230
of hypocrisy of deceit of
having abandoned all true values

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:59.020
and noble virtues in
exchange for a tissue

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.210
of false convictions
and scapegoated excuses.

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:07.480
He could and did write a book that
showed precisely these things.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:11.010
Like so many around him Cervantes
had been pulled from Madrid

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:14.680
to [inaudible] with a transfer of
the royal court, hoping to benefit

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.190
in some small way from
the constant flurry

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:20.380
of economic opportunity created
by the monarchies granting

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.620
of favors and paid posts.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.080
As he looked around him at the rush

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:28.640
to profit though he must've felt
the sardonic resignation of a man

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.750
who had himself too often
followed this very route,

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:33.050
only to be disappointed.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:37.490
A student and intellectual he had
escaped his homeland as a young man

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:39.860 position:56%
after wounding another man in a duel

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:42.900
and experienced firsthand
the Spanish state's violent

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.020
confrontations with Islam
and the Mediterranean.

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:50.010
Returning to Spain a decorated
hero he had been captured

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:53.610
by barbarous pirates and
held in squalid captivity

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:58.180
for five years during which time
he experienced both the depravities

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:00.980
and the humanity of
an enemy culture.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.870
Ransomed at last he regained
a homeland that seemed

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:06.690
to have forgotten his
sacrifices and that was intent

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:11.050
on covering the patent failures
of its domestic and foreign policy

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:15.450
with a patchwork of religious
fanaticism and ethnic scapegoating.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:18.860
Rebuffed and humiliated
repeatedly in his quest for reward

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:23.650
and recognition for his service the
aging warrior gradually turned back

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:26.020
to his first love, writing.

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:28.230
Eventually producing
Don Quixote along

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:31.110
with a treasure trove
of other great works.

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:34.860
Ironically, it seems his
unparalleled success was forged

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:38.400
by life of almost continuous
failure.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.980 position:56%
A century before Cervantes' birth
time still fresh in people's memory.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.380
Spain was not even a nation
and kings were a little more

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:50.500
than local lords, psions of
landowning families with deep ties

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:53.750
to region language and local
population, the population

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:57.050
that tilled their lands and fed
them in exchange for promises

00:24:57.050 --> 00:24:59.760
of protection from
neighboring powers.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.640
In that time people knew
their place in the world.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.330
It was written into their flesh
and spoken through their words

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:10.650
and gestures, clothes, and
habitats and the rituals

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:13.840
that mark their births,
marriages and deaths.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.460
In the time since then
though a man's place

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.510
in the world had somehow
become more mobile.

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:22.930
New horizons opened up for
exploration and new possibilities

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:26.360
for attaining a higher
rung on the social ladder.

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:32.300
But with that change came questions
and uncertainties, who to become,

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.520
how to get there, how to survive.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.800
Cervantes' own grandfather
had benefited

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:41.110
from that new mobility just
as his father had suffered

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.680
from the needs that it generated.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.000
The former Juan de Cervantes
has been a well-regarded lawyer

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.440
from a family of cloth merchants
in [inaudible], city that while

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.110
under Christian domination since
the early 13th century had been the

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:57.500
capital of the Muslim
caliphate of [inaudible]

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:01.910
and had long exemplified Spain's
unique blend of Christian,

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:04.360
Muslim and Jewish cultures.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.570
As a young man newly
married to the daughter

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:10.690
of a [inaudible] physician he took
a job as an assistant magistrate

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:13.430
in Alcala de Henares,
north of Cordoba

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:15.770
in the high plains of Castile.

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:24.070
This is a beautiful
16th-century painting of Alcala,

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:27.590
a view taken from outside
of its walls

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:32.820
and here is a contemporary
map hand-painted also

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:37.880
from the Peabody collection,
which I've centered Alcala.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.810
It's hard to see from there, but
it's bigger and more important

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:46.550
at the time than Madrid
would have been.

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:48.350
Rodrigo, his second son,

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:52.200
and eventual father Miguel
was born there in 1509,

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:57.290
the same year that the Cardinal
Francisco Jimenez Cisneros founded

00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:59.240
the city's university.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.640
Alcala would become one of
Spain's greatest centers

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.200
of learning during the 16th
century, second only and renowned

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:12.270 position:56%
to Salamanca and home of the first
complete multilingual printed Bible.

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:17.640 position:56%
That Bible would henceforth be known
as the [inaudible] Bible in honor

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.900
of the Latin name for
Alcala [foreign language].

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:24.490
The University of Alcala
would later be moved to Madrid

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:26.930
where it is now the largest
university in Spain and one

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:28.290
of the largest in the
world [foreign language].

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:35.020
Rodrigo's attempt to support
his growing family as a surgeon

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:38.950
in a university town where as
Cervantes would later write quote,

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:41.020
of the 5,000 students
who studied that year

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:45.820
at the university 2,000 were
studying medicine clearly led

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.170
to not.

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:50.450
His money problems followed him
to [inaudible] where he tried

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:53.920
to insinuate himself into
a wealthier clientele

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.180
by padding the family's
lifestyle on borrowed funds.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:01.490
In the summer of 1552, only a few
weeks before his daughter Magdalena

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:04.730
was born he was jailed for
failing to pay his debts

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:07.000
and his property was impounded.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.180
It is during this stint in
debtors' prison that Rodrigo tried

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:13.720 position:56%
to take advantages of the
inequities governing Spanish society

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:17.570
at the time by getting a court
to rule that he wasn't in fact

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:21.270
of noble lineage and not
subject to debtor laws.

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:24.760
At first, he was unable to
establish a legal basis for this

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.050
and the court dismissed his suit.

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:30.780
This initial failure to establish
his exempt status raised the

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:35.390
possibility that Cervantes' family
by and large, educated and literate

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:36.690
and dissenting as they did

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:40.770
from Cordovan merchants
had Jewish forebears.

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:42.560
Back in by [inaudible]
toward the end

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:46.290
of his own life Cervantes
cannot help but have reflected

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:50.840
on his father's failures there, the
lawsuits, the debts, the time spent

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:55.470
in prison whose forbidding walls
he must've passed with frequency.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:29:00.260
He could also not have forgotten
his own scrapes with the law

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.910
and especially the
two months at least,

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:08.460
maybe more he spent among
the wretched inhabitants

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.560
of Seville's municipal jail.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:14.360 position:56%
Indeed, it may have been in its dark
cells that he dreamt up Don Quixote,

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:18.620
which as he tells us in his famous
preface was begotten in a prison

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.710 position:56%
where every discomfort has its place

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:24.010
and every mournful
sound makes its home.

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:27.230
Now, almost 20 years
later, the pages he gripped

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:31.210
in his one good hand would complete
their journey from captivity

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:35.810
to freedom, from darkness
to light via the caustic wit

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:39.790 position:56%
of an inveterate gambler,
adventurer, soldier and storyteller,

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:44.490 position:56%
a man born on the threshold of a New
World who had learned the hard way

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:47.180
that freeing oneself from
history and tradition could lead

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:49.590
to other sorts of bondage.

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:55.580
As the criminalization of
Spanish urban society took route

00:29:55.580 --> 00:30:00.280
over the second half of the
16th century it was accompanied

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:04.020
by the emergence of a
genre of literature devoted

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:07.120
to the social outcast
and criminal deviant.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.580
What has been called the
literature of roguery

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:13.760
or the [foreign language]
reached its acme in Europe

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.480
at the end of the 16th century.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.660
And in Spain with the
runaway success

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:21.640
of Mateo Aleman's novel
Guzman de Alfarache

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:25.130
which was published simultaneously
with the republication

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:27.290
of the famous anonymous book

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:30.670 position:56%
that has been called the first
picaresque novel [foreign language].

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:35.500
[Foreign language] had
been published in 1554,

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.160
although the Spanish
literary historian,

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.970
Americo Castro dates its
composition to the 1530's.

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:43.260
But the censorship of
the inquisition ensured

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:51.400
that it would only be reprinted
once before the end of the century.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:55.690
And in that reprinting, it was a
highly, highly abridged version.

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:59.260
Riding on the coattails of the
Guzman, however, the new edition

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:02.110
of [foreign language] was an
extraordinary success leading

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:06.870
to nine different editions
being in circulation by 1603.

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:09.780
Guzman has clearly tapped
into a real desire on the part

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:13.940
of Spanish readers to delve into
the world of the underclasses,

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:17.750
to experience it from the
perspective of one of its own.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:21.150
Indeed, Aleman's book
immediately sparked imitators,

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:24.990
including a sequel by a [inaudible]
lawyer named Juan Martine

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:28.190
[phonetic], of which 14 editions
were printed before Mateo Aleman

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:32.070
could come out with his
own second part in 1604.

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:35.830
The picaresque as typified by the
Guzman and its followers centered

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:39.890
on a criminal life narrated
by the criminal himself.

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:43.650
The [inaudible] desires only
freedom and the satisfaction

00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:46.650
of his basest desires
and he has no scruples

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:49.930
about how to achieve his goals.

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:54.290 position:56%
When Guzman encounters a sympathetic
priest in Italy who takes him in

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:57.750
and tries to help him he repays
the good man by robbing him

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:59.970
and then loses all
the money gambling.

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:02.780
The fact that this genre
became so popular just

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:06.190
as urban criminality rose
to unprecedented levels

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:10.350
in Spanish society was responding
with an ever-increasing legal

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:14.310
and punitive bureaucracy
should not be a surprise.

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:15.800
Whereas, the inquisition
censored [inaudible]

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:19.700
such that the 1577
edition was printed

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.360
without its fourth
and fifth chapters.

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.150
Guzman, along with [inaudible]

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:27.010
and other highly successful
books made it

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:31.280 position:56%
through the censors unscathed in
the early years of the 17th century.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:36.040
It is clear that the
portrayal of a social outcast

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:41.100
and his parasitic perspective on
society serve the regime's purposes

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:45.100
in the kind of image it wanted
to project to the outside world.

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:48.970
This image was that of
religious, moral public being beset

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:53.020
by parasitic outsiders and whose
only protection was their loyalty

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.390
to the Spanish crown and its laws.

00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:57.900
At the same time, the
reading public and members

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:01.840
of acceptable Spanish society
were titillated by the possibility

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.780
of entering into the
rogue's perspective

00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:06.310
and having their own
prejudices about his evil

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:10.540
and sociopathic ways confirmed.

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:14.470
Sitting in a dank, stinking
cell in Seville choked

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:19.390
by the smoke oil lamps when
lit at all and surrounded by

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:24.800
and unwashed mass of society's
dregs Cervantes spent many months,

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:30.550
we don't know for sure but perhaps
up to a half of a year between 1597

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:37.040 position:56%
and 98, savoring firsthand the
perspectives of rogues and outcasts.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.540
Knowing the truth of his
own story, a hero abandoned

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:43.550
by his country forced to accept
whatever demeaning labor came his

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:46.580
way and then maligned,
libeled and imprisoned

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:50.360
for his efforts gave Cervantes a
different kind of understanding

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:54.330
of the lives of those who
occupy society's bottom floors.

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:57.050
And how they could contrast
with the image painted

00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:59.940
of them by books and the stage.

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:03.280
He could see in them the
gamblers, tricksters,

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:07.310 position:56%
and hopeful social climbers that
would populate his novels and tales,

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:10.580
each and every one of them either
battling against or profiting

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:15.900
from the inability of others to
see them for who they really were.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:19.250
In this world, people lived or
died by the sword of illusion

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:23.550
and Cervantes from the depths
of his disillusion was seeing

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:27.150
that world clearly,
perhaps for the first time.

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:30.480 position:56%
Don Quixote was published only a
few years after Guzman de Alfarache.

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:35.990
But in his 22nd chapter there is
a clear reference to Mateo Aleman,

00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:40.010
the author of Guzman de
Alfarache to Alemon's success

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:43.840
in creating a whole new
genre of literature.

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:47.720
At the outset of that chapter Don
Quixote looks up to see quote,

00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:53.310
coming toward him on the same road
he was traveling approximately 12

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:56.930
men on foot strung together
by their necks like beads

00:34:56.930 --> 00:35:00.720
on a great iron chain and
all of them wearing manacles.

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:08.670 position:56%
Asking or asked by Quixote what they
are Sancho replies, this is a chain

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:12.810
of galley slaves, people forced
by the king to go to the galleys.

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:18.050
What do you mean forced Quixote
shoots back, is it possible

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:20.940
that the king forces anybody.

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:23.750
When Sancho explains that they
have been condemned to the galleys

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:27.220
because of their crimes
Quixote concludes that quote,

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:29.630
because these people are
being taken by force and not

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:32.230
of their own free will
here it is fitting to put

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:35.670
into practice my profession to
right wrongs and come to the aid

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:38.950
and assistance of the
wretched, end quote.

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:42.180
Sancho quickly tries to clarify
that as they are being punished

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:44.930
for their crimes, it's not
exactly accurate to say

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:47.960
that the king is forcing
or doing wrong to them.

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:51.390
But Quixote ignores him and
proceeds upon receiving permission

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:54.670
from the guards to talk
to several of the men.

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:58.940
Each describes to him the crime of
greater or lesser severity that led

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.750
to his having been
condemned to the galleys.

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:07.320
The last one Quixote interrogates
is a certain Geneste Passamonte

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:10.500
who the guards tell the
knight is famous on account

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.580
of the book he has
written about his life.

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:15.890
When Quixote asks if the book
is finished Geneste replies,

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:20.480
how can it be finished if
my life isn't finished yet.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:24.050
Having finished his interrogation
of the prisoners Quixote decides

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:27.510
that it is indeed his
duty to free them all.

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:28.980 position:56%
But after he has attacked the guards

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:31.800
and released their charges
he is rewarded for his mercy

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:35.570
by being stoned by them before they
run off in different directions.

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:38.680
Thus, at the simplest level,
the episode would appear

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.240
to be sending a similar
message to that

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.390
of the Guzman or any
of its followers.

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:46.030
These are criminals, they
are different from you

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:48.240
and me don't feel pity on them.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:52.000 position:56%
And indeed, should Cervantes written
an episode in which prisoners

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.270
on the way to the galley
were shown as truly deserving

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:57.110
of their fate it would certainly
have fallen afoul to censors

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:59.900
and gotten Cervantes
himself in hot water.

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.790
What he did though
was far more astute,

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:05.780
by making the principal
prisoner an obvious stand-in

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:09.770
for the literary character Guzman
de Alfarache who himself ends

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:11.560
up being condemned to the galleys.

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:15.410
Cervantes is telling his reading
public, not that prisoners are evil

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:20.400 position:56%
and deserve no pity, but that what
they think they know about prisoners

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:25.370 position:56%
and outlaws is nothing but illusions
made up for their own entertainment.

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:28.540
The other prisoners who tell their
tales before being overshadowed

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:33.510 position:56%
by Geneste are a hodgepodge of minor
sad characters, an old man serving

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:36.390
as a go-between who is
suspected of sorcery.

00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:39.030 position:56%
Another who had stolen some laundry.

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:42.530
One who failed to withstand
trial by ordeal.

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:45.710
Another who had sexual
relations with his relative.

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:49.600
But all of them convicted on
shady or suspect evidence.

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:52.250
Only the literary character,

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:55.770
only Geneste Passamonte
is an obvious villain

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:58.390
for only Cervantes
seems to be saying,

00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:01.150
only a fiction would be
so obvious and guilty.

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:05.530
In Cervantes' tales when
scalawags and scullions turn

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:09.590 position:56%
out to have been people of quality
these revelations undermine the very

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:14.330
idea of a rapacious but alien
underclass that was being spread

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:16.920
by the literature known
as the picaresque.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.970
Rogues are the projections
of the fears and desires

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:21.990
of an established social order.

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:26.810
Criminality is not something
they do, it is stitched

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:30.710
in the very fabric of society up to
and including the highest echelons

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:33.750 position:56%
of political and ecclesiastic power.

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:37.130
But Cervantes who emerged
from months of imprisonment

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:40.790
in 1598 was a changed man.

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:46.790 position:56%
This was the man who had around that
time would start writing what would

00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:49.460
soon be published as Don
Quixote, along with some

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:51.190
of the stories he would
later publish

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:54.820
in his collection of
exemplary novels.

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:57.470
Regardless of whether the
writing began in prison

00:38:57.470 --> 00:39:00.930
or shortly thereafter the
experiences he accumulated

00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:03.650
in prison had an enormous
impact on the period

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:05.870
of creativity that was to follow.

00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:09.950
But those experiences influenced
him in other ways as well.

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:13.810
The Cervantes who emerged from
that prison no longer believed

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:15.840
in the idea that Spanish society

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:19.470
and its government had been
selling his entire life.

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:23.600
While he had encountered many
reasons to doubt the official story

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:26.730
over the course of the previous
20 years, having been thrown

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:31.240
into prison for doing his job for
his government was the last straw.

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:34.630
The Cervantes who would as
would be expected from a poet

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:37.540
of renowned published
an ode in honor

00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:41.170
of Philip the Second upon
his death later that year.

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:44.110
Would no longer write the kind of
laudatory verse he had produced

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:48.120
for the death of Elisabeth of
Valois 30 years earlier or even

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:51.410
for the felicitous
Armada 10 years earlier.

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:55.360
The poem published for
Philip's death was a masterpiece

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:59.260
of critical irony depicting
not the greatness of Philip,

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:02.780
but a man pompously declaring
the greatness of Philip.

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:06.800
His speech then quickly seconded
by someone Cervantes described

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:11.800
as a bully who calls it true,
accuses all who would question it

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:17.370
as lying like dogs and then
furtively glances both ways before

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:19.280
slipping away.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:22.420
It makes sense that
Cervantes while inspired

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:26.200
by Aleman's remarkable success
with the newly popular genre

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:27.860
of the picaresque would engage

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:32.150 position:56%
that literature an entirely
different way from those around him.

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:37.090
Cervantes who had tried to live by
the rules and follow the ideology

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:40.180
of the Spanish state, who had
been disappointed and rebuffed

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:44.120
at every turn, who had spent five
years among the infidels and come

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:47.160
to know their ways, who would
learn the techniques of the theater

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:51.330
and use them to analyze how
humans buy into illusions

00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:53.140
and work to keep them alive.

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:56.150
And who had now lived on
the other side of the law

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:58.680
and had experience for himself.

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.270
This Cervantes understood
that the picero [phonetic]

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:06.420
like every other category of his
or that his society promulgated

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:10.010
for understanding the world
was a farce, an invention,

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:12.250
an illusion whose purpose
was to ensure

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:14.710
that the crown subjects
kept buying into the myth

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:16.480
of their own superiority.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.350
And that their dependence
and their dependence

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:20.820
on the state for their protection.

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:23.900
He couldn't say all of
this in so many words,

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:27.720
but he could use the tools
he handled best to try to get

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:31.010
that message across in legally
and politically viable ways.

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:36.010
And so, he made his stories
about the society's outcasts,

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:39.210
these stories in fact, about
the fictional framework

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:43.750
that made them outcasts
in the first place.

00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:47.260
The man who walked the
streets of his nation's capital

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:52.270
on that hot August day knew that
he had written something good.

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:57.600
He also certainly understood
that it was something new,

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.150
which he tells us himself
in several places.

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:02.950
There is no way, however,
that either he

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:06.470
or anyone else could have predicted
what would happen in January

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:10.370
of the following year when the
press of Juan de la Cuesta,

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:13.170
a Madrid-based printer whom
Francisco de Robles hired

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:15.940
to produce the actual book
would release the first

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:17.920
of what would be countless editions

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:21.500
of the ingenious gentlemen
Don Quixote of La Mancha.

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:24.390
Within a few months of its original
publication Cervantes needed

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:26.170
to apply for a new license

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:29.600
to have the book distributed
throughout the Iberian Peninsula.

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.430
And Robles and de la Cuesta
began to work on a second edition

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:34.680
to be released that same summer.

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:38.430
Before that edition hit the
bookstores two pirated editions

00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:42.590
appeared in London, along
with two others in Zaragoza.

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:45.750
Already by April Robles
was spending a good part

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:47.770
of his time preparing legal suits

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:51.380
against the purveyors
of pirated copies.

00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:54.960
Within only a few months
stacks of copies were loaded

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:58.340
onto the galleons embarking
from Seville for the New World.

00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:01.150
And by June of the same year
the book's protagonists,

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:02.580
the diluted Don Quixote

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:07.880 position:56%
and his squat simple sidekick Sancho
Panza had become iconic figures.

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:11.070
Their effigies carried in
parades and imitators popping

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:14.140
up in celebrations both
royal and [inaudible].

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:15.530
Upon seeing a student doubled

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:19.180
up in raucous laughter one day
King Philip the Third was reported

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:22.240
to have said, that student
is either out of his mind

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:25.010
or he's reading the
story of Don Quixote.

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:29.820
Cervantes' newfound fame was not
limited to the Spanish world.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:33.090
Spain's cultural influence
of the time was as widespread

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:35.520
as its political and
military presence.

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:38.470
And Spanish works were regularly
disseminated and translated

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:41.910
in England, France and Germany,
not to mention in the Netherlands

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:44.910
and Italy which were still
under Spanish control.

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:48.550
Brussels saw two editions
released by 1611, figures dressed

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:50.600
as Don Quixote and Sancho appeared

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.610
at a procession in
Heidelberg in 1613.

00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:56.960
And in England, John Fletcher
and Francis Beaumont adapted one

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:00.230
of the novel's interpolated
stories into their play,

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:04.300
the [inaudible] Cone written
between 1608 and 1610.

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:08.970
In 1612, Thomas Shelton published
his enormously successful English

00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:11.200
translation, The History
of the Valorous

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.160
and Witty Knight Don
Quixote of La Mancha.

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:17.550 position:56%
And although, it has been lost sadly
William Shakespeare joined forces

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:21.380
with John Fletcher to write a play
called Cardenio that was inspired

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:24.120
by another famous episode
from the novel.

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:27.540
From its publication in
the early days of 1605

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:31.090
to the present Don Quixote has
become perhaps the most published

00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:33.490
work of literature in history.

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:36.500
More than that, its
influence on the writers

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:38.970
that have followed
has been unparalleled.

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:42.840
In the words of the critic Harold
Bloom, Don Quixote is a novel

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:45.630
that quote, contains
within itself all the novels

00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:48.140
that have followed
in its sublime wake.

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:51.210
When the Norwegian Nobel Institute
polled a hundred leading fiction

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:54.350
writers to name the single most
important work of literature

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:58.430
in history more than half
of them named Don Quixote.

00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:01.010
No other author's work came close.

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:04.920
In 1997, Life Magazine declared
the book's publication one

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:09.530
of the hundred most important
events of the entire millennium.

00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:11.740
If Cervantes' direct
influence on the history

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:14.700
of literature is unparalleled
his indirect influence

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:18.370
on intellectual history
is simply immeasurable.

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:21.130
His books were to be found on
the shelves of every intellectual

00:45:21.130 --> 00:45:24.740
in early modern Europe and
many of the Americas as well.

00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:28.140
In 19th century England a
critic could take great umbrage

00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:32.210 position:56%
at a fellow scholar's inadequate
translation of Don Quixote referring

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:36.600
or writing quote, what judgment I
formed of you and your abilities

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:41.140
as an editor of Don Quixote, that's
how it's pronounced in England

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:43.190
of course, may easily be guessed

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:45.340
by this first token
you gave me of them.

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:48.400
It was plain that your book
would prove perfectly useless

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.620
to all classes of readers and
even hurtful to all learners

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:54.750
of that tongue if you
were to be its corrector.

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:59.900 position:56%
And the stories of Don and his
squire were packaged into all shapes

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:03.250
and sizes, including for
the youngest readers.

00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:09.040
And I'm going to skip over a
few slides because I had to cut

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:11.260
out a few pages of my presentation.

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:18.240
So, this is one abridged and
adapted to youthful by Sir Mar --

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:21.890
this is the Sir Marvelous
crack joke.

00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:26.700
This is an early, no late
19th century edition.

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:28.380
Let me show you some of the artwork

00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:34.540
and the plates are really marvelous
here and the colors they're even

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:36.530
on the screen not even
close to what you see

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:41.030
if you hold the edition
in your hand.

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:46.530
This we presume is Quixote himself
with his lance at the ready buried

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:50.050
in his books at the
beginning of the novel.

00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:53.990
While writers like Fielding
and Flaubert and philosophers

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:57.480 position:56%
like Schelling and Hagel have put
down for posterity what they thought

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:02.960 position:56%
of Cervantes, his indirect influence
on thinkers like Locke, Descartes,

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:06.430
Kant and countless others whose
ideas would lay the foundations

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:07.740
for how modern individuals

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:11.500
in societies understand
themselves was just as profound.

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:15.900
In 1787, and this is fitting that
in this building or the building

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:18.080
at least next-door we
would mention this.

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:21.220
Thomas Jefferson wrote to a
nephew about the Spanish language

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:24.910
that he should quote, bestow great
attention on this and endeavor

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:27.000
to acquire an accurate
knowledge of it.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.380
Our future connection with Spain
and Spanish America will render

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:33.060
that language a valuable
acquisition.

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:35.280
Well he no doubt meant
his admonitions

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:39.360
about geopolitics Jefferson's
own interest in Spanish culture

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:42.630
in fact came from his
fascination with Don Quixote

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:46.070
which he had borrowed from John
Cabot in advance of a sea voyage

00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:50.890
to France in 1784 and used
alongside a Spanish dictionary

00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:55.000
to master the language
during his 19-day voyage.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.380
This was noted by John Quincy
Adams in a journal entry he jotted

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:02.380
down after a dinner
with Jefferson in 1804.

00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:05.590
Although Adams then adds
a little note quote,

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:08.890
but Mr. Jefferson tells
large stories.

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:14.030
What is undeniable though is
the importance Jefferson placed

00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:16.480
on the novel of which
he owned several copies

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:21.050 position:56%
that one can still see at Monticello
in which he mentions dozens of times

00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:23.470
in his letters over the years.

00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:27.500 position:56%
What took hold of his imagination,
like it did with that of so many men

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:32.140
and women was that central
idea of reality's pliability

00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:34.080
in the face of political interests.

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:37.560
As he wrote in a pensive
letter to Edmund Randolph,

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:41.730
who would've conceived in 1789
that within 10 years we should have

00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:45.000 position:56%
to combat such windmills, end quote.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.130
Jefferson's comment as superficial

00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:50.040
as it seems nevertheless
leaves us a clue

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:54.090
as to why Cervantes' invention
had the impact it did.

00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:57.650
With the publication of Don Quixote
Cervantes had managed at once

00:48:57.650 --> 00:49:01.210
to encapsulate a problem that had
been encroaching on Western culture

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:04.780
for some time and to
offer a way forward.

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:09.320
The problem was that of how to
freely exercise the imagination

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:12.300
in a culture that strictly
controlled such expressions

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:14.910
by dictating the norms of truth.

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:18.140
The solution was the creation
of a new form of writing

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:21.280
that exempted itself from the
narrowest conception of truth

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:25.890
at the same time as it
revealed an even greater truth.

00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:29.840
That reality itself was subject
to political distortions and that

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:34.060
to change the world one had to
reveal these for what they were.

00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:40.110 position:56%
In 1995, UNESCO declared April 23rd,
the international day of the book,

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:43.320
at least partly in recognition
of the almost simultaneous deaths

00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:47.160
in 1616 of two of the
greatest writers of all time.

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:49.380
That the deaths of
William Shakespeare

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:52.380
and Miguel Cervantes
neither coincided,

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:55.650
the former died some 10 days later,
but England at the time had not

00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:58.670
yet adopted the Gregorian
calendar we use today,

00:49:58.670 --> 00:50:01.040
nor actually fell on April 23rd.

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:03.280
Cervantes probably died the
previous day and was buried

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:06.060
on that date later
etched into posterity.

00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:09.110
Bestows on that date
a fitting irony.

00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:12.630
The date of the book celebrates
those who write fiction.

00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:16.640 position:56%
The glorious artifacts that
aren't, histories that didn't happen

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:18.870
and lies that revealed
truths papered

00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:21.840 position:56%
over by the habits of everyday life.

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:25.440 position:56%
Both Cervantes and his greatest
character die quietly in their beds,

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.220
surrounded by their loved ones.

00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:30.230
But whereas the night of the
mournful countenance admits defeat

00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:32.170
and renounces fantasy for a death

00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:36.470
of stalled virtue his author's
mighty imagination lived

00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:39.340
on in ways no one could
have predicted

00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:41.640
and that few even grasp today.

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:46.040
On April 18th, 1616, Cervantes
was given his last rites at home

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.470
in Madrid, surrounded by
his wife and his sisters,

00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:51.410
although not his daughter Isabel.

00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:54.980
A dedication to the Count of Lemos
he composed the next day begins

00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:59.810
with the words quote, with my
foot already placed in the stirrup

00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:04.470
and full of fear in the face of
death great Lord, I write this.

00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:06.880
Yesterday, they gave
me extreme unction

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:09.000
and today I write these words.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.660
Time is short, my anguish grows,
my hopes diminish and yet,

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:16.750
despite all this I
carry it on my life

00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:20.140
with the desire I have
to keep living.

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:23.310
Desire against reality.

00:51:23.310 --> 00:51:26.790
The theme that resonates throughout
his greatest creations comes

00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:30.520
to the fore in his last
statement to the world.

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:31.850
Critics have made much of the fact

00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:35.100
that Don Quixote renounces
his madness on his deathbed,

00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:37.750
cursing the passion for the
books of chivalry that drove him

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:44.190
out of his sanity and embracing his
real name Alonso Quixano, the good.

00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:46.010
They've insisted that
this ending along

00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:49.050
with the Cervantes' apparent
protestations that his only purpose

00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:52.840
in writing the book was to skewer
the romances of chivalry should put

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:57.470
to rest any suspicions that Don
Quixote can mean anything other

00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:59.010
than that.

00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:03.160
But these critics it seems to
me failed to get his last joke.

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:08.870
It is as if they really believed
that the only alternative

00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:11.760
to this reduction of
the extraordinary wealth

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:15.380
of the world's first and greatest
work of modern fiction would be

00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:18.990
to interpret it as
expressing the opposing thesis

00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:21.740
that somehow we Cervantes'
readers then

00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:26.910
and now should be emulating
the tales of chivalry.

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:30.820 position:56%
But the meaning of Don Quixote
cannot be either Cervantes' distaste

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:34.420
for or his love of
the tales of chivalry.

00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:37.580
Indeed, asking what
Don Quixote means as if

00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:42.270
such a shorthand answer could
ever be given already misses the

00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:43.870
boat entirely.

00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:47.430 position:56%
If we really want to know let us
attend the deathbed scene our author

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:51.110
composed only a year
or so before his own.

00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:53.380
Approaching their village
in the twilight hours

00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:55.670
of their adventure
together the heroes pause

00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:58.370
on a hillside overlooking
their home.

00:52:58.370 --> 00:53:02.570
When he saw it, Sancho
dropped to his knees and said,

00:53:02.570 --> 00:53:06.710 position:56%
open your eyes my beloved country
and see that your son, Sancho Panza,

00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:12.040
has come back to you if not very
rich, at least well flogged.

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:15.250
Open your arms and receive
as well your son Don Quixote

00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:17.150
who though he returns conquered

00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:20.670
by another returns the
conqueror of himself.

00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:25.190 position:56%
And as he has told me, that is the
greatest conquest anyone can desire.

00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:30.320
To conquer oneself, to rein in
the force of desire the pull

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:32.860
of illusion this more
than the imminence

00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:37.360
of death is what Quixote fears and
foresees crying, [foreign language]

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:41.280
as he enters the village
for passing two boys

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:43.050
in the street he overhears
their patter

00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:46.640
and he misinterprets the sentence,
you won't see it in all the days

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:51.580
of your life as referring to
the imaginary lady Dulcinea.

00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:55.660
As he has learned to do, Sancho
hastens to reassure his friend.

00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:59.710
Strangely though this time his
down to earth realism in the face

00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:02.710
of Quixote's superstitions
is intended

00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:06.340
to save his illusions
not to dispel them.

00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:10.170
He gathers from under his donkey
the terrified hair whose flight

00:54:10.170 --> 00:54:12.710
from a pack of dogs
Don Quixote first took

00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:15.140
as an evil omen, a
[foreign language].

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:21.920 position:56%
And carefully hands this shuttering,
shaking hair to his master saying,

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:26.300 position:56%
your grace is a puzzle let's suppose
that this hair is Dulcinea El Toboso

00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:29.130
and these greyhounds chasing
her are the wicked enchanters

00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:30.640
who changed her into peasants.

00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:33.960
She flees, I catch her and
turn her over to your grace

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:36.250
who holds her and cares for her.

00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:40.910 position:56%
What kind of sign is that, what
kind of evil omen can you find here?

00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:43.600
How far we have come
since Sancho sought

00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:47.420
to set a windmill battered
Quixote right in his saddle

00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:49.880
and straighten his
interpretation of reality.

00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:52.810
For Sancho over the course of
his journeys and travails imposed

00:54:52.810 --> 00:54:57.440
on him has learned to love
not only Quixote, the man,

00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:00.630
but also the world
Quixote's dreamed for himself.

00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:03.270
If you follow the errant
knight out of a fool's wish

00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:04.570
to govern an [foreign language],

00:55:04.570 --> 00:55:07.870
his desire to shelter his
master's illusions at the twilight

00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:12.690
of their adventure seems born of
wiser sentiments, almost noble.

00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:16.600
A few days later, Alonso
Quixano having fallen ill and now

00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:20.000
under the loving care of his niece
and housekeeper loudly declares

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.440
that he is cured of his illusions,
renounces the tales of chivalry

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:27.090
and calls for a confessor and
a scribe to take down his will.

00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:28.630
Immediately those around him,

00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:32.310
especially his friend Sanson
Carrasco and Sancho Panza begin

00:55:32.310 --> 00:55:36.380
to protest that he's wrong and
how can he say such things.

00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:41.420
Quote, when we have news of the
disenchantment of lady Dulcinea

00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:44.660
and now that we're on the point
of becoming like shepherds

00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:46.730
and spending our lives in song

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:51.380
like princes now your grace
wishes to become a hermit.

00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:57.340
For God sake, be quiet come to your
senses and tell us no more tales.

00:55:57.340 --> 00:56:01.280
While the knight urges
reason, his companions know

00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:03.590
that such realism is madness.

00:56:03.590 --> 00:56:07.350
They realize that he is giving
up the essence of who he is

00:56:07.350 --> 00:56:11.760
and has become even as reality
tightens its noose the urge

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:14.840
to be free reasserts itself.

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:19.110 position:56%
The narrator, our supposed
ventriloquist of the Arab historian,

00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:24.390
[inaudible] then tells us that the
news of his impending death quote,

00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:27.970 position:56%
put terrible pressure on the already
full eyes of his housekeeper,

00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:32.080 position:56%
his niece and his good squire Sancho
Panza forcing tears from their eyes

00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:36.200
and a thousand deep sighs from
their bosoms because the truth is

00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:37.890
as has already been said,

00:56:37.890 --> 00:56:41.320
that whether Don Quixote
was simply Alonso Quixano

00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:46.130
or whether he was Don Quixote of La
Mancha he had a gentle disposition,

00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:48.200 position:56%
was kind in his treatment of others,

00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:51.530
and for that reason he was
dearly loved not only by those

00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:54.410
in his household, but by
everyone who knew him.

00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:57.870
Just as a character Don Quixote
had espoused and emulated the tales

00:56:57.870 --> 00:57:02.200
of chivalry, another character
Alonso Quixano [inaudible] them

00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:03.990
deciding that one is right

00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:08.410
and the other wrong is exactly what
Cervantes' book doesn't allow us

00:57:08.410 --> 00:57:09.710
to do.

00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:12.850
For the space it opens,
the space of fiction is one

00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:17.950 position:56%
in which exactly those questions can
never be resolved because the space

00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:21.810
of fiction does not refer
to the reality in question,

00:57:21.810 --> 00:57:25.460
to the place where either
books of chivalry are evil

00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:29.390
or they are harmless fun, the space
of fiction refers to that place

00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:33.100
where such debates take place
and where we are called upon

00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:36.940
to make a judgment about
them and about ourselves.

00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:39.960
Whether Quixote was Quixano or
Quixano Quixote Cervantes seems

00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:44.140
to be telling his present-day
interpreters he was still good one

00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:45.580
way or the other.

00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:47.790
And so, in a last joke

00:57:47.790 --> 00:57:52.500
on his readers Cervantes has the
priest draw up a document stating

00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:57.360
for posterity that quote, Alonso
Quixano the good commonly known

00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:02.760
as Don Quixote had passed from
his life and died a natural death

00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:08.880
and that he and only he could
ever be recognized as his author.

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:12.440
But of course, Cervantes didn't
name himself as that author,

00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:16.920
but someone else, the fictional
historian [inaudible] whose

00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:21.280
historical account has ostensibly
been the source of the book

00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:25.040
and who's owed to his
own pen now ends it.

00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:30.340
Here is the ode, for me alone was
Don Quixote born and I for him,

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:36.130
he knew how to act and I to write,
the two of us alone are one.

00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:41.660
So, idol listeners as Cervantes
might say, if you really want

00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:45.410
to believe that as the author
writes one last time quote,

00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:49.470
my only desire has been to have
people reject and despise the false

00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:52.690
and nonsensical books
of chivalry, end quote.

00:58:52.690 --> 00:58:56.860
By all means be my guest after
all, it's [inaudible] who told you

00:58:56.860 --> 00:59:00.210
so himself and he always
tells the truth.

00:59:00.210 --> 00:59:02.010
Thank you very much.

00:59:02.010 --> 00:59:11.050
[ Applause ]

00:59:11.050 --> 00:59:12.720
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:19.130
Professor Egginton will
take some questions.

00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:23.410
But I want to remind you
also that [inaudible].

00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:32.850
&gt;&gt; I read your book and
I liked it very much.

00:59:32.850 --> 00:59:39.850 position:56%
The fact that it started [inaudible]
to understand to the general reader.

00:59:39.850 --> 00:59:52.060 position:56%
And I also appreciated the fact
that [inaudible] not content centric

00:59:52.060 --> 01:00:00.630 position:56%
which focused more on Quixote itself
and just illuminated the cultural

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:03.280
like history [inaudible]
on the book,

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:07.550
so I thought that was
refreshing as well.

01:00:07.550 --> 01:00:11.290
And my question to you
is have you ever thought

01:00:11.290 --> 01:00:16.030
of the economic relationships in
the book and how it correlates

01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:17.330
to [inaudible] in the book?

01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:21.450
&gt;&gt; William Egginton:
Thank you and thank you

01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:24.040
for the nice comments on the book.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.770
I mean to a certain extent as
you know since you've read it,

01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:33.880
I try and balance this analysis
of what fiction is and how came

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:38.850
about at this particular time with
this larger geopolitical history

01:00:38.850 --> 01:00:41.890
of a kind of pivotal moment
in Western history not just

01:00:41.890 --> 01:00:44.960
in Spanish history, but where the
Spanish Empire was also playing a

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.260
pivotal role.

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:49.140
And of course, that role is
economical to a certain extent.

01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:54.250
I mean we talk about discussing
the book, the question of inflation

01:00:54.250 --> 01:01:00.750
for example that racks the
Spanish economy leading to maybe

01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:03.270
over the course of
Philip and his son

01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:09.980
and his grandson six
bankruptcies of the Spanish crown.

01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:14.070
And these clearly had a direct
impact on Cervantes' life,

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:18.040
the question of debt is
constant in Cervantes' writing.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:23.670
As you know, gambling is
obviously an economic issue as well

01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:25.680
and Cervantes was as
I say in one point

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:28.650
of this reading today
an inveterate gambler.

01:01:28.650 --> 01:01:33.960
And he writes he shows enormous
knowledge about the gambling world

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:39.150
and the skills that the
cardplayers in particular need.

01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:43.050
And so, he played a lot in
prison surrounded by people there

01:01:43.050 --> 01:01:47.490
for economic crimes as well and
he was a tax collector for a time

01:01:47.490 --> 01:01:50.630
in his life and a requisition
for the Armada.

01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:52.530
So, he was deeply embedded

01:01:52.530 --> 01:01:58.210
in this massive blooming early
modern imperial economy with all

01:01:58.210 --> 01:02:02.280
of its incredible ups and downs.

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.570
Thanks for the question.

01:02:04.570 --> 01:02:09.480
&gt;&gt; I appreciated how
much you pointed

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:16.360
out that Don Quixote was clearly
influential [inaudible] the western

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:23.200
world and that it reflects
Spain at that time

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.930
and it's a very [inaudible] book.

01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:29.460
But I'm going to just look at
one particular aspect of it.

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:33.820
You said at the beginning Don
Quixote [inaudible] person,

01:02:34.970 --> 01:02:36.580
also a geezer.

01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:40.850
Okay, I was wondering
what is the perception

01:02:40.850 --> 01:02:46.970
of Don Quixote being depicted that
way and by [inaudible] for example,

01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:51.500
Native America example
where I don't think

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:55.460
such a character would
be part of their culture.

01:02:55.460 --> 01:03:00.330
&gt;&gt; William Egginton: Yeah, no
it's quite possible and in fact,

01:03:00.330 --> 01:03:02.720 position:56%
our reception -- if you think about,

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:07.200
if you kind of reconstruct the
history and the age Quixote much

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:10.090 position:56%
like Cervantes at the time that
he's writing Quixote would have been

01:03:10.090 --> 01:03:14.880
from our perspective
a middle-aged man.

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:21.320
But the period if you've
made it to your late 50's

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:24.210
or early 60's you're
an outlier at the time.

01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:28.110
As Cervantes talks about in his own
self-description, I've lost most

01:03:28.110 --> 01:03:31.890
of my teeth, but you know
hey so has everyone else.

01:03:31.890 --> 01:03:37.280
He was known as the [foreign
language], so he was a cripple.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:43.330
In many ways he himself was, in
some ways I should say a model

01:03:43.330 --> 01:03:46.280
for the kind of physical appearance
that he describes for Quixote,

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:48.670
but then he exaggerates it right.

01:03:48.670 --> 01:03:57.080
He elongates Quixote, he makes
Sancho squatter, he intensifies,

01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:59.790
enhances this representation
in certain ways.

01:03:59.790 --> 01:04:03.880
So, I'm not sure that it had
any in its many translations

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:07.290
into the eastern world towards the
end of the century that this was

01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:11.020
in any way looked upon as
different or particularly adverse

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:14.350
as a representation
of the character.

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:17.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah, just a quick,
a very quick question.

01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:19.180
I haven't had the privilege
yet of reading your book,

01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:23.480
but I was wondering did Miguel de
Cervantes did he become wealthy

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:24.780
from publishing this book?

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:26.080
&gt;&gt; William Egginton: No.

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:28.870
&gt;&gt; And his stature within the
society was it raised at all?

01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:30.950
&gt;&gt; William Egginton: It
was, his stature was raised

01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:32.870
to a certain extent,
but not to the extent

01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:36.330
that he would've wanted it to be.

01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:41.800
And this is something I do go
into quite some depth in the book

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:44.750
because it's a fascinating story.

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:50.000 position:56%
You know the literary world, in
particular in Madrid, but in Seville

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.760
as well he frequented
both literary worlds.

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.190
This was very cutthroat.

01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:57.510
He knew everybody and
everybody knew him.

01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:59.680
So, you were all, you were
writing for a broader public,

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:03.250
but you were also writing for
your peers, the other playwrights.

01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:05.240
That was his first attempt
was to become a playwright.

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:08.460
A poet was considered
kind of the highest level

01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:11.090
and then the playwrights
because they were poets also.

01:05:11.090 --> 01:05:15.220
And then what he was doing this
strange hodgepodge of prose

01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:18.950 position:56%
and throwing some poems in there
and occasionally this was, you know,

01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:21.550
he was clearly a scraper in a way.

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:25.060
And comedy was considered
sort of the lowest form.

01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:28.700
So, his books were
extraordinarily successful,

01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:34.980
but you know he would sell the
rights for 1,500 reales which was,

01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:37.820
you know, a couple months'
rent or something like that.

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:41.120
And then before you knew it he was
back borrowing money to live again.

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:45.200
And he was constantly making
reference in his prologue

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:48.800
as he was trying, the way that he
figured he could get by is finally

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:52.030
to get a sponsorship
essentially from a great lord.

01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:55.870
And he did fine one [inaudible],
but it was in a sense too late.

01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:59.970
That selling his wit in
his prologues was the way

01:05:59.970 --> 01:06:04.580
that he was going to
finally make it, get by.

01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:11.390
But he was always making
fun of his own poverty.

01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:13.890
Well, there's a great -- let
just give you an exact example

01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:18.920 position:56%
because in the preface to the second
volume which he rushed to press,

01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:27.680 position:56%
not in the preface excuse me, I take
it back, in the censor's approval,

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:30.220
the approbation given
by the official censor.

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:35.250
The censor ostensibly is
telling a story about Cervantes

01:06:35.250 --> 01:06:38.480
in which the censor says I
was working, I had this book.

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:40.630
Now censors don't usually
go into these long stories,

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:42.600
but suddenly this censor
starts telling this story

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:43.990
and his approbation.

01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:49.450
I have this book on my desk because
I was working on censoring it.

01:06:49.450 --> 01:06:53.260
And these French dignitaries came
to visit and one of them said,

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:55.090
oh are you working on a book

01:06:55.090 --> 01:06:57.360
by Miguel de Cervantes
tell us about him.

01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:01.510
What is his station, how is he
doing and I was forced to answer?

01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:03.490
Well his station is quite
low, he's quite poor

01:07:03.490 --> 01:07:07.210
and he's always complaining
about his lack of funds.

01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:10.530
Now what we've pretty much
established that Cervantes

01:07:10.530 --> 01:07:14.250
at this point knew the censors
as a literary community so well

01:07:14.250 --> 01:07:17.310
that he actually wrote this
under the censor's name

01:07:17.310 --> 01:07:19.080
and then had him slide it in.

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:22.350
So, he's always finding a way to
point out that look I should be,

01:07:22.350 --> 01:07:24.500
I'm world-famous at
this point right.

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:27.740
That they know me in China as
he says in one of his prefaces.

01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:30.850
They're asking me to come
and form a school in China.

01:07:30.850 --> 01:07:33.790
I told the Emperor of China
how much are you going to pay

01:07:33.790 --> 01:07:35.090
because I can only
come if you're going

01:07:35.090 --> 01:07:36.980 position:56%
to really give me some money for it.

01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:39.280
So, he's always making this point.

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:51.930
&gt;&gt; Don Quixote is the first modern
novel, but also it has as air

01:07:51.930 --> 01:07:58.260
of postmodernism [inaudible],
kind of metafictional attitude

01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:00.110
to greatness [inaudible].

01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:06.930
And most general a quite skeptical
view of the established view

01:08:06.930 --> 01:08:10.200
of things and an objective truth,

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:14.830
putting objective truth
itself into question.

01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:20.210
I mean, what is real, what is not

01:08:20.210 --> 01:08:23.590
and the deceptiveness
of [inaudible] itself.

01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:26.110
&gt;&gt; William Egginton: So that's
in some ways one of my points is

01:08:26.110 --> 01:08:31.390
that what we have sometimes been
taught to call postmodern is

01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:34.780
in fact already there from the
beginnings of the genre itself.

01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:38.380 position:56%
It's already there in the very first
works of modern fiction everything

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:40.870
that we're calling postmodern play,

01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:42.480
kind of encapsulating
representations

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:44.450
within representations
that make one unsure

01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:46.730
about what reality once
[inaudible] it's all there,

01:08:46.730 --> 01:08:50.750
it's all from the very
beginning yeah.

01:08:50.750 --> 01:08:52.050
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

01:08:52.050 --> 01:08:53.850
&gt;&gt; William Egginton:
Thank you, my pleasure.

01:08:53.850 --> 01:08:57.980
[ Applause ]

01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:01.630
