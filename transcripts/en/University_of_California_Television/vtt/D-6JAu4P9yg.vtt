00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:08.150
(electronic music)

00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:26.277
- We're talking about brain development.

00:00:26.277 --> 00:00:29.772
As you know, there are many
ways this can get screwed up.

00:00:29.772 --> 00:00:32.147
It can get screwed up by heredity,

00:00:32.147 --> 00:00:35.004
as you'll hear about
from Matt State later.

00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:36.915
It can get screwed up by disease

00:00:36.915 --> 00:00:38.889
or environmental deprivation.

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:41.736
A convenient way of
conceptualizing this is that,

00:00:41.736 --> 00:00:43.437
imagine that we have a
number of different measures

00:00:43.437 --> 00:00:45.742
of brain maturation in
different parts of the brain,

00:00:45.742 --> 00:00:48.110
and so on different processes,

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.626
but all these processes improve with age,

00:00:51.626 --> 00:00:55.181
and in the case of a
developmental brain disorder,

00:00:55.181 --> 00:00:59.833
it's a derailment, and you
see an accumulated deficit

00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:01.666
as the person matures.

00:01:02.963 --> 00:01:06.283
The question that we're really
interested in now is whether,

00:01:06.283 --> 00:01:09.771
at the time of diagnosis, which often is

00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:12.421
in early childhood in
many of these diseases

00:01:12.421 --> 00:01:15.376
or even later, can we initiate a treatment

00:01:15.376 --> 00:01:19.268
that can reverse the
consequence of the disease.

00:01:19.268 --> 00:01:23.944
We can imagine, conceptually,
three potential outcomes.

00:01:23.944 --> 00:01:27.610
The most dismal outcome is the
one illustrated on the top,

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.210
and that is that I can only intervene

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.740
during an early critical period,

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.772
and then if you miss that period,

00:01:33.772 --> 00:01:36.523
maybe the damage has already
been done in utero prior

00:01:36.523 --> 00:01:39.983
to birth, it's just too late
to initiate a treatment.

00:01:39.983 --> 00:01:42.021
That's the most pessimistic point of view.

00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:44.653
The most optimistic point
of view is that, indeed,

00:01:44.653 --> 00:01:47.843
we can apply our great knowledge
of neurobiology to come up

00:01:47.843 --> 00:01:51.057
with good treatments that may
actually reverse the course

00:01:51.057 --> 00:01:53.865
of the disease and actually
restore normal function.

00:01:53.865 --> 00:01:57.306
Probably, a realistic possibility
is the one in the middle,

00:01:57.306 --> 00:02:00.550
the hopeful scenario, that
we can initiate treatments

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.300
that may prevent further decline.

00:02:04.902 --> 00:02:07.824
The work in my lab is
addressing these questions

00:02:07.824 --> 00:02:09.171
in different ways.

00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:10.306
One of the ways we look at is

00:02:10.306 --> 00:02:12.602
the genetically defined
disease called fragile X.

00:02:12.602 --> 00:02:14.346
We've done a lot of work on that,

00:02:14.346 --> 00:02:16.662
but we're also interested
in the consequences

00:02:16.662 --> 00:02:19.090
of environmental deprivation,

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.654
particularly a disease called amblyopia,

00:02:21.654 --> 00:02:25.332
and I'm gonna you about that work today.

00:02:25.332 --> 00:02:29.109
Amblyopia is a not-uncommon
visual disability.

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:33.172
It affects approximately
3% of the world population,

00:02:33.172 --> 00:02:35.552
and it's more prevalent in nations

00:02:35.552 --> 00:02:40.163
where there's poor early-childhood
pediatric screening,

00:02:40.163 --> 00:02:42.898
is this a consequence
of poor-quality vision

00:02:42.898 --> 00:02:45.071
during infancy and early childhood,

00:02:45.071 --> 00:02:46.374
and that poor quality could arise

00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:48.871
because the eyes aren't
properly aligned at birth,

00:02:48.871 --> 00:02:51.244
so the child is seeing double.

00:02:51.244 --> 00:02:53.910
It can arise 'cause there's
a dense cataract in one eye

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.375
or a droopy eyelid, or it could arise

00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:58.219
because there are different
refractive indices

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.932
in the two eyes, so you
can't focus an image

00:03:00.932 --> 00:03:03.055
on both eyes at the same time.

00:03:03.055 --> 00:03:04.775
The consequence is the same,

00:03:04.775 --> 00:03:07.641
and it is usually a fairly
severe visual impairment

00:03:07.641 --> 00:03:09.224
in one of the eyes.

00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:15.038
If that optical abnormality
or what have you is corrected

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:17.859
very early in life, there's a good chance

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.994
to see some recovery of function,

00:03:19.994 --> 00:03:22.575
but if that correction occurs later,

00:03:22.575 --> 00:03:25.242
there's a very dismal prognosis.

00:03:27.837 --> 00:03:31.816
Luckily, there are animal
models for this amblyopia.

00:03:31.816 --> 00:03:35.495
In fact, every mammal
with binocular vision

00:03:35.495 --> 00:03:38.661
will show a susceptibility to
poor-quality visual experience

00:03:38.661 --> 00:03:40.315
during early life.

00:03:40.315 --> 00:03:43.923
I'm gonna show you a cat
video; it's always popular;

00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:45.208
(audience laughs)

00:03:45.208 --> 00:03:49.456
to illustrate the visual
disability in a kitten.

00:03:49.456 --> 00:03:53.562
What we're looking at is, that's
the top of a kitten's head,

00:03:53.562 --> 00:03:56.353
and this kitten had been
deprived of normal vision

00:03:56.353 --> 00:03:59.069
through one eye for only seven days

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.961
at about the fourth post-natal week,

00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:04.267
and then that eye was unpatched,

00:04:04.267 --> 00:04:06.437
and then now we're gonna
measure the consequences.

00:04:06.437 --> 00:04:09.558
First, we're gonna measure
the vision in the good eye.

00:04:09.558 --> 00:04:12.016
The way we do this, and when I
say we, it'd be very liberal.

00:04:12.016 --> 00:04:13.989
This is actually worked
on by Donald Mitchell,

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.848
a collaborator of mine
at Dalhousie University,

00:04:16.848 --> 00:04:19.466
and Don's been studying
this for many, many years.

00:04:19.466 --> 00:04:22.561
He puts the animal in
a box on a jack stand,

00:04:22.561 --> 00:04:25.198
and the animal learns to
jump down onto a placard

00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:27.475
with the vertical stripes,
so the animal is reporting

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:29.658
whether it can resolve the stripes

00:04:29.658 --> 00:04:32.362
by choosing the correct
placard to jump on,

00:04:32.362 --> 00:04:34.011
and he gets a pat on the
back and a little bit

00:04:34.011 --> 00:04:38.210
of kitten food, and they're
very happy to perform this task.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.039
First we're gonna look at a
kitten performing the task

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.321
through the good eye that
had not been deprived.

00:04:46.321 --> 00:04:48.034
You can see they're quite keen to do this.

00:04:48.034 --> 00:04:51.693
They jump down, they
find the right stripes,

00:04:51.693 --> 00:04:53.693
get a little liverwurst.

00:04:58.833 --> 00:05:00.696
They can make the
stripes closer and closer

00:05:00.696 --> 00:05:02.438
to get a measurement of visual acuity.

00:05:02.438 --> 00:05:04.258
This is a way that they can determine

00:05:04.258 --> 00:05:07.858
how well the animal can
resolve visual stimuli,

00:05:07.858 --> 00:05:10.877
the same way you would at the eye doctor.

00:05:10.877 --> 00:05:12.214
Now this is the same animal,

00:05:12.214 --> 00:05:14.823
but now we're gonna do
this test through the eye

00:05:14.823 --> 00:05:17.261
that had been only temporarily
deprived of vision,

00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:19.889
only for seven days, and
what you're gonna see is,

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.464
this is a very severe visual impairment.

00:05:23.464 --> 00:05:26.314
The good eye is being occluded
with a black contact lens,

00:05:26.314 --> 00:05:29.910
so that the kitten is forced
to look through its lazy eye,

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.275
and you can see that it's
having great difficulty

00:05:33.275 --> 00:05:37.442
in even seeing the stripes
versus the empty chamber there.

00:05:38.602 --> 00:05:41.328
It's a significant visual
disability, and as I said,

00:05:41.328 --> 00:05:44.519
this is a type of disability
that affects up to 3%

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:46.614
of the human population.

00:05:46.614 --> 00:05:49.611
The visual disability will persist even

00:05:49.611 --> 00:05:51.171
when the eye has been reopened

00:05:51.171 --> 00:05:55.590
and the animal is allowed
to see through both eyes.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.721
This is shown in this graph.

00:05:57.721 --> 00:06:00.142
This is now a plot of the visual acuity,

00:06:00.142 --> 00:06:02.978
the ability of the animal
to resolve those stripes

00:06:02.978 --> 00:06:07.145
as a function of time after
the bad eye has been opened.

00:06:08.645 --> 00:06:12.006
The green symbols show vision
through the non-deprived eye

00:06:12.006 --> 00:06:13.523
and the blue symbols show the vision

00:06:13.523 --> 00:06:15.573
through the deprived eye.

00:06:15.573 --> 00:06:18.001
You can see that, although
there is a slight recovery,

00:06:18.001 --> 00:06:19.996
there's not much, and there's actually

00:06:19.996 --> 00:06:22.228
fairly severe visual disability compared

00:06:22.228 --> 00:06:25.145
to the vision through the good eye.

00:06:26.377 --> 00:06:29.557
This model of temporary
monocular deprivation

00:06:29.557 --> 00:06:33.664
has been around for over
50 years, and many others,

00:06:33.664 --> 00:06:37.091
probably maybe hundreds
of other scientists

00:06:37.091 --> 00:06:38.818
have been studying this very intensively.

00:06:38.818 --> 00:06:41.547
We've actually learned quite
a bit about the mechanisms

00:06:41.547 --> 00:06:46.535
that serve this disruption
in the cortex, and yet,

00:06:46.535 --> 00:06:48.134
our work has had very little impact

00:06:48.134 --> 00:06:51.165
on how the clinical
management of amblyopia.

00:06:51.165 --> 00:06:53.139
The question that I want
to address today is,

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:55.626
can the understanding
of the synaptic basis

00:06:55.626 --> 00:06:59.510
for amblyopia suggest novel
treatments to promote recovery

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.582
that are better than
current standard of care?

00:07:02.582 --> 00:07:05.865
The simple answer to
that question is, yes.

00:07:05.865 --> 00:07:06.782
Here it is.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.645
These are kittens that were
visually impaired in one eye,

00:07:11.645 --> 00:07:13.358
a stable visual disability,

00:07:13.358 --> 00:07:15.628
and a treatment was
initiated based on principles

00:07:15.628 --> 00:07:18.545
of synaptic plasticity at this age;

00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:20.929
this is now two months

00:07:20.929 --> 00:07:24.081
after the deprived eye had been opened,

00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:26.058
so about three months of age.

00:07:26.058 --> 00:07:28.740
You can see that there is a
very rapid recovery of vision

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.652
through the deprived eye,

00:07:29.652 --> 00:07:33.817
so essentially curing this
form of visual disability.

00:07:33.817 --> 00:07:35.029
Hopefully I've gotten your attention

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:37.810
with this amazing result,
and now I'm gonna unpack it

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:42.490
for you and tell you what
that magical treatment was,

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:44.658
but to do so, I need to walk
you through a little bit

00:07:44.658 --> 00:07:48.825
of background, which is the
visual system of mammals

00:07:51.697 --> 00:07:55.697
with two eyes, often
kittens or mice or monkeys.

00:07:56.716 --> 00:07:58.410
The visual pathway originates

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.703
with these retinal ganglion
cells in the two eyes.

00:08:00.703 --> 00:08:01.786
They project centrally.

00:08:01.786 --> 00:08:04.688
They relay in the lateral
genicular nucleus or LGN.

00:08:04.688 --> 00:08:06.335
Then they go on and synapse on neurons

00:08:06.335 --> 00:08:09.126
in primary visual cortex.

00:08:09.126 --> 00:08:11.913
When visual experience is
normal through the two eyes,

00:08:11.913 --> 00:08:16.057
those connections mature and
we have binocular vision.

00:08:16.057 --> 00:08:18.731
When there's an imbalance
in vision to the two eyes,

00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:21.645
it sets in motion a
stereotype choreography

00:08:21.645 --> 00:08:24.807
of synaptic changes where the
inputs carrying information

00:08:24.807 --> 00:08:27.040
from the deprived eye are weakened,

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.767
and the inputs carrying information

00:08:28.767 --> 00:08:31.400
by the open eye eventually show

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.817
a compensatory strengthening.

00:08:34.684 --> 00:08:36.588
We can measure these consequences

00:08:36.588 --> 00:08:40.234
of that anatomical plasticity
functionally as well.

00:08:40.234 --> 00:08:43.312
We can put a microelectrode
in primary visual cortex,

00:08:43.312 --> 00:08:45.186
and we can record the
activity that's evoked

00:08:45.186 --> 00:08:48.435
by stimulation of the
right eye or the left eye.

00:08:48.435 --> 00:08:49.523
I'll just direct your attention

00:08:49.523 --> 00:08:51.314
to these histograms on the top.

00:08:51.314 --> 00:08:54.672
This is now the number of
nerve impulses triggered

00:08:54.672 --> 00:08:56.776
in response to stimulation
of the right eye

00:08:56.776 --> 00:09:00.339
and the left eye, prior
to any deprivation.

00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:02.412
You can see this is a
neuron that responds happily

00:09:02.412 --> 00:09:04.574
to stimulation of both eyes.

00:09:04.574 --> 00:09:06.254
Fact, there's a slight ocular dominance,

00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:09.079
slight preference for
stimulation of the right eye.

00:09:09.079 --> 00:09:10.987
Now this right eyelid is closed,

00:09:10.987 --> 00:09:13.985
and then the neuron is
recorded again later,

00:09:13.985 --> 00:09:14.818
and what you can see is,

00:09:14.818 --> 00:09:17.084
it's essentially lost all responsiveness

00:09:17.084 --> 00:09:19.501
to stimulation of the eye
that had been deprived.

00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:21.320
No wonder the kittens can't see.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.987
We've disconnected the
cortex from that eye.

00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:29.299
I mentioned that it is possible

00:09:29.299 --> 00:09:32.188
to correct these visual disabilities

00:09:32.188 --> 00:09:34.441
if you intervene early enough.

00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:36.512
The current standard of care is

00:09:36.512 --> 00:09:39.110
a therapy called patching therapy.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:42.778
Essentially, that
comprises putting a patch,

00:09:42.778 --> 00:09:45.884
usually an opaque patch,
over the strong eye

00:09:45.884 --> 00:09:48.717
to force the weak eye to function,

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:51.219
and that can be successful.

00:09:51.219 --> 00:09:53.130
When you patch the strong eye,

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.317
you'll get a recovery of
vision through the weak eye.

00:09:55.317 --> 00:09:58.838
There are a number of
limitations to this approach,

00:09:58.838 --> 00:10:00.422
not least of which is compliance,

00:10:00.422 --> 00:10:03.643
because children don't like
to have these eye patches,

00:10:03.643 --> 00:10:08.442
but also, the gains in the
amblyopic eye often come

00:10:08.442 --> 00:10:09.763
at the expense of the good eye,

00:10:09.763 --> 00:10:11.609
'cause you're now patching it.

00:10:11.609 --> 00:10:13.811
There's little improvement
in binocular vision,

00:10:13.811 --> 00:10:15.934
so no stereopsis, and again,

00:10:15.934 --> 00:10:18.137
it's only effective if you
initiate this treatment

00:10:18.137 --> 00:10:20.220
prior to age eight or so.

00:10:22.632 --> 00:10:23.465
Let's get under the hood

00:10:23.465 --> 00:10:27.215
and see what happens
during reverse patching.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.606
Again, we're recording
now from a single neuron

00:10:30.606 --> 00:10:32.689
in primary visual cortex.

00:10:34.181 --> 00:10:36.325
We're gonna start with a
situation after a period

00:10:36.325 --> 00:10:39.094
of monocular deprivation,
so we have a neuron here

00:10:39.094 --> 00:10:41.467
that's responding only to the left eye.

00:10:41.467 --> 00:10:43.012
There's no response to the right eye.

00:10:43.012 --> 00:10:44.625
That's because we've already performed

00:10:44.625 --> 00:10:48.541
a monocular deprivation,
so the kitten is amblyopic.

00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:49.429
Now what we're gonna do is

00:10:49.429 --> 00:10:51.614
we're gonna patch the strong eye

00:10:51.614 --> 00:10:54.715
and we're gonna open the weak
eye and see what happens.

00:10:54.715 --> 00:10:57.947
What happens is that
initially, you get a loss

00:10:57.947 --> 00:11:01.097
of responsiveness to
the newly deprived eye,

00:11:01.097 --> 00:11:04.571
but with time, you start to
get a gain of responsiveness

00:11:04.571 --> 00:11:07.988
in the formerly deprived, now seeing eye.

00:11:09.205 --> 00:11:10.605
This is good.

00:11:10.605 --> 00:11:13.524
We can get a recovery, but it's not ideal.

00:11:13.524 --> 00:11:16.724
It's not ideal because it
actually is a zero-sum game.

00:11:16.724 --> 00:11:18.489
The gains that we're getting in this weak,

00:11:18.489 --> 00:11:22.656
lazy eye are coming at the
expense of the strong eye.

00:11:23.636 --> 00:11:27.095
As in the case of patching
therapy in humans,

00:11:27.095 --> 00:11:29.137
this reverse patching in animal models

00:11:29.137 --> 00:11:31.678
also shows a sensitive period.

00:11:31.678 --> 00:11:33.068
This is a classic study done

00:11:33.068 --> 00:11:35.921
by Blakemore and van Sluyters in cats,

00:11:35.921 --> 00:11:37.683
showing that the ability to reverse

00:11:37.683 --> 00:11:41.896
this ocular-dominance shift,
or this change in physiology

00:11:41.896 --> 00:11:45.117
in the cortex, diminishes
greatly with age,

00:11:45.117 --> 00:11:47.188
that by eight weeks of
age, it's very difficult

00:11:47.188 --> 00:11:49.485
to get a reversal, and
it's essentially gone

00:11:49.485 --> 00:11:51.870
by 12 to 14 weeks of age.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.419
This same sort of pattern
is seen in any species

00:11:54.419 --> 00:11:56.888
that's been looked at.

00:11:56.888 --> 00:12:00.401
So, there are problems
with patching therapy,

00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:02.678
but, these limitations notwithstanding,

00:12:02.678 --> 00:12:06.389
they do demonstrate that we
can rejuvenate weak synapses,

00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:08.248
we can rejuvenate these inputs

00:12:08.248 --> 00:12:12.640
that previously were incapable
of invoking a response.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.534
What we'd like to do is
understand that process

00:12:14.534 --> 00:12:16.396
a little bit better, so
that maybe we could devise

00:12:16.396 --> 00:12:19.521
a better way to restore function.

00:12:19.521 --> 00:12:21.570
To understand where we're gonna go,

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:22.663
I have to introduce some of the some

00:12:22.663 --> 00:12:26.950
of the simple principles
of synaptic plasticity.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:30.044
The excitatory synapses in
our brains use glutamate

00:12:30.044 --> 00:12:31.693
as a neurotransmitter.

00:12:31.693 --> 00:12:33.578
Glutamate activates two types

00:12:33.578 --> 00:12:35.971
of post-synaptic glutamate receptor,

00:12:35.971 --> 00:12:38.124
glutamate-gated ion channels.

00:12:38.124 --> 00:12:41.416
The AMPA receptor mediates
fast synaptic transmission,

00:12:41.416 --> 00:12:44.647
and the NMDA receptor
is an important trigger

00:12:44.647 --> 00:12:47.830
for modification of synaptic strength.

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.514
What we've learned over 30 or 40 years

00:12:50.514 --> 00:12:55.320
of intensive effort is
that we can indeed modify

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.453
the strength of synaptic transmission,

00:12:57.453 --> 00:13:01.742
and we do so by activating NMDA receptors.

00:13:01.742 --> 00:13:04.986
Strong activation of
NMDA receptors will make

00:13:04.986 --> 00:13:07.031
a synapse stronger,
and that's a phenomenon

00:13:07.031 --> 00:13:10.369
we call long-term potentiation or LTP.

00:13:10.369 --> 00:13:13.242
Modest activation of NMDA receptors leads

00:13:13.242 --> 00:13:15.346
to the reverse form of plasticity called

00:13:15.346 --> 00:13:17.679
long-term depression or LTD.

00:13:18.638 --> 00:13:20.609
The NMDA receptor has an unusual property

00:13:20.609 --> 00:13:21.912
that's actually very sensitive

00:13:21.912 --> 00:13:25.334
to how well correlated pre-
and post-synaptic neurons are,

00:13:25.334 --> 00:13:28.060
so strongly correlated
activity strongly activates

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.070
NMDA receptors, and you're more likely

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.880
to get a synaptic strengthening.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.388
This is one fundamental feature

00:13:33.388 --> 00:13:36.436
of what we call bidirectional
synaptic plasticity.

00:13:36.436 --> 00:13:37.968
Another fundamental feature is

00:13:37.968 --> 00:13:42.449
that that learning rule
actually is also modifiable.

00:13:42.449 --> 00:13:46.784
If neurons are quieted
for a long period of time,

00:13:46.784 --> 00:13:49.025
there's a shift in this function.

00:13:49.025 --> 00:13:51.454
For example, the function
will shift to the left

00:13:51.454 --> 00:13:54.025
if we put animals in
the dark, for instance.

00:13:54.025 --> 00:13:56.429
This function will shift to
the left in visual cortex,

00:13:56.429 --> 00:13:57.440
which has the net effect

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.799
of making the potentiation
more readily observed

00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:03.981
and making depression more difficult.

00:14:03.981 --> 00:14:06.645
We call that property metaplasticity.

00:14:06.645 --> 00:14:08.907
It's a type of homeostatic plasticity

00:14:08.907 --> 00:14:11.597
to make sure the network of synapses keeps

00:14:11.597 --> 00:14:13.514
within a dynamic range.

00:14:14.669 --> 00:14:17.537
Now, how are we gonna explain this effect

00:14:17.537 --> 00:14:20.034
of reverse patching?

00:14:20.034 --> 00:14:21.166
Let's go through this again.

00:14:21.166 --> 00:14:24.057
We have a situation where we have a neuron

00:14:24.057 --> 00:14:27.290
that responds only to
stimulation of one eye.

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:30.178
This eye has been
functionally disconnected.

00:14:30.178 --> 00:14:34.035
Now we're going to close that strong eye,

00:14:34.035 --> 00:14:35.701
and the first thing that happens is

00:14:35.701 --> 00:14:38.644
that the neuron loses responsiveness

00:14:38.644 --> 00:14:40.811
to the newly deprived eye.

00:14:42.068 --> 00:14:45.068
This is believed to be a consequence

00:14:45.991 --> 00:14:48.101
of these mechanisms of
long-term depression.

00:14:48.101 --> 00:14:49.627
In fact, there's very, very good evidence

00:14:49.627 --> 00:14:51.549
to support that statement.

00:14:51.549 --> 00:14:55.329
This initial loss of responsiveness
is due to a diminution

00:14:55.329 --> 00:14:58.661
of the strength of excitatory
synaptic transmission

00:14:58.661 --> 00:15:01.254
from inputs carrying
information for that eye,

00:15:01.254 --> 00:15:03.338
but something else has happened as well.

00:15:03.338 --> 00:15:04.410
The other thing that's happened is,

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:05.896
imagine we have a situation

00:15:05.896 --> 00:15:09.328
where the seeing eye is not strong enough

00:15:09.328 --> 00:15:14.326
to evoke a response, and the
strong eye is not seeing.

00:15:14.326 --> 00:15:17.573
As a consequence, the
activity in the cortex falls,

00:15:17.573 --> 00:15:19.271
and this is the condition required

00:15:19.271 --> 00:15:21.771
to induce this metaplasticity.

00:15:23.477 --> 00:15:25.939
Eventually what we see is
the change in the rules

00:15:25.939 --> 00:15:29.555
of the game, so this function
will slide to the left,

00:15:29.555 --> 00:15:32.800
and this will allow the recovery

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.217
of the formerly-deprived, now seeing eye.

00:15:37.264 --> 00:15:39.884
It can recover 'cause it's got

00:15:39.884 --> 00:15:41.907
reasonably correlated activity.

00:15:41.907 --> 00:15:44.459
It was very weak, and now
this weak activity is enough

00:15:44.459 --> 00:15:48.626
to start to gain a toehold
and drive those synapses up.

00:15:49.649 --> 00:15:52.558
I mentioned that there are
issues with patch therapy.

00:15:52.558 --> 00:15:54.199
It's not ideal, and the question is,

00:15:54.199 --> 00:15:56.597
can we use these principles
of metaplasticity

00:15:56.597 --> 00:16:00.764
to restore function without
resorting to patching?

00:16:02.459 --> 00:16:05.699
There is good reason to
believe that that's the case.

00:16:05.699 --> 00:16:10.505
First, there have been a couple
of studies done by others,

00:16:10.505 --> 00:16:13.744
where they've put animals
into complete darkness

00:16:13.744 --> 00:16:17.077
after a period of monocular deprivation,

00:16:18.289 --> 00:16:22.512
literally one or two weeks
of complete darkness.

00:16:22.512 --> 00:16:24.687
Then the animals are
brought back into the light

00:16:24.687 --> 00:16:27.023
with both eyes open, and
what they've observed is,

00:16:27.023 --> 00:16:28.465
they can get a recovery of vision.

00:16:28.465 --> 00:16:30.355
It can be quite dramatic,

00:16:30.355 --> 00:16:32.599
but it does require weeks of darkness,

00:16:32.599 --> 00:16:34.710
and that darkness cannot be interrupted,

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:38.055
even temporarily, by light exposure.

00:16:38.055 --> 00:16:40.676
We wondered if we could
do better, again, based on

00:16:40.676 --> 00:16:43.955
what we knew about this
metaplasticity property.

00:16:43.955 --> 00:16:48.173
The experiment that we did
was to use an anesthetic

00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:51.303
and inject both eyes with this anesthetic.

00:16:51.303 --> 00:16:54.135
It's an anesthetic called tetrodotoxin,

00:16:54.135 --> 00:16:55.820
but really, any drug that would block

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.968
sodium-dependent action
potentials would work.

00:16:57.968 --> 00:17:00.445
Essentially what we're
doing is, in essence,

00:17:00.445 --> 00:17:02.495
we're rebooting the visual system.

00:17:02.495 --> 00:17:04.183
We are turning it off,

00:17:04.183 --> 00:17:08.022
and then we're gonna let
it turn back on again.

00:17:08.022 --> 00:17:10.845
The rationale here is that
we put this tetrodotoxin

00:17:10.845 --> 00:17:13.579
into the eyes and we block
all impulse activity.

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:15.398
This curve slides to the left,

00:17:15.398 --> 00:17:20.031
and this will promote
recovery of the weak input.

00:17:20.031 --> 00:17:21.674
So what happens?

00:17:21.674 --> 00:17:23.390
I wouldn't be telling you
this if it didn't work.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.151
(audience laughs)

00:17:25.151 --> 00:17:28.177
It works amazingly, amazingly.

00:17:28.177 --> 00:17:30.260
This is work from mice here,

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:31.523
so I have to introduce a little bit.

00:17:31.523 --> 00:17:33.152
Essentially, the only
thing that matters is

00:17:33.152 --> 00:17:37.259
that the blue bars represent
the strength of one eye,

00:17:37.259 --> 00:17:39.528
the eye on the opposite side of the head,

00:17:39.528 --> 00:17:42.555
the contralateral eye, and
the yellow bar represents

00:17:42.555 --> 00:17:45.318
the strength of the other
eye, the ipsilateral eye.

00:17:45.318 --> 00:17:48.238
If you don't do anything
to a mouse, the heights

00:17:48.238 --> 00:17:51.977
of these bars wax and wane,
but they don't change too much.

00:17:51.977 --> 00:17:55.433
If you monocularly deprive
a mouse, as we've done here,

00:17:55.433 --> 00:17:58.203
it goes from here, where
we've closed the blue eye,

00:17:58.203 --> 00:18:01.671
so this response is depressed,
and it stays depressed.

00:18:01.671 --> 00:18:04.039
It never recovers spontaneously,

00:18:04.039 --> 00:18:06.193
but if we follow that
monocular deprivation

00:18:06.193 --> 00:18:08.724
with this bilateral
injection of tetrodotoxin

00:18:08.724 --> 00:18:12.214
to turn the eyes off,
when the TTX wears off,

00:18:12.214 --> 00:18:16.816
we see a rapid recovery of
vision to the deprived eye.

00:18:16.816 --> 00:18:20.160
This is the magic treatment
that we did in the kittens.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.691
In these animals, tetrodotoxin
was injected bilaterally.

00:18:23.691 --> 00:18:27.291
In this case, we did two
injections into both eyes,

00:18:27.291 --> 00:18:29.077
'cause we didn't want to take any chances,

00:18:29.077 --> 00:18:29.946
but you can see, which is

00:18:29.946 --> 00:18:33.701
a really remarkable recovery of sight.

00:18:33.701 --> 00:18:36.178
This is an example of one experiment

00:18:36.178 --> 00:18:38.726
where initially we failed.

00:18:38.726 --> 00:18:41.561
We failed because the
injections weren't successful

00:18:41.561 --> 00:18:43.605
and they didn't block the
pupillary light reflex,

00:18:43.605 --> 00:18:47.019
so we knew we hadn't
blocked impulse activity.

00:18:47.019 --> 00:18:48.260
We were disappointed.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.010
Animal kept maturing.

00:18:50.868 --> 00:18:52.281
We wondered what we were gonna do with it.

00:18:52.281 --> 00:18:53.967
We said, oh, let's try it again.

00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:56.960
So we tried it again, by
now at the ripe old age

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:00.249
of five months, with a
single injection of TTX,

00:19:00.249 --> 00:19:02.193
and again we saw this great recovery.

00:19:02.193 --> 00:19:03.721
We're excited about that,

00:19:03.721 --> 00:19:07.057
because it's a brief
manipulation, even very late.

00:19:07.057 --> 00:19:10.855
Just to compare, this is five
months of age or 20 weeks.

00:19:10.855 --> 00:19:12.719
You can see, that's way
beyond what's possible

00:19:12.719 --> 00:19:15.320
with reverse occlusion.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.487
Just to wrap up, we're
seeing recovery at older ages

00:19:21.014 --> 00:19:23.576
than is possible for reverse occlusion.

00:19:23.576 --> 00:19:25.358
Recovery is very rapid;

00:19:25.358 --> 00:19:26.961
it occurs over the course of a week;

00:19:26.961 --> 00:19:28.929
it's 100% complete,

00:19:28.929 --> 00:19:30.664
and the recovery of the
weak eye does not come

00:19:30.664 --> 00:19:32.585
at the expense of the strong eye.

00:19:32.585 --> 00:19:35.095
Of course, what we wanna
know now is precisely,

00:19:35.095 --> 00:19:37.948
how did this retinal activation work,

00:19:37.948 --> 00:19:41.165
and can we actually
translate this knowledge

00:19:41.165 --> 00:19:43.865
into better therapies for human amblyopia?

00:19:43.865 --> 00:19:45.865
And with that, I'll just thank the people

00:19:45.865 --> 00:19:48.536
who did all the work,
and our funding sources.

00:19:48.536 --> 00:19:49.369
(audience applauds)

00:19:49.369 --> 00:19:52.286
