00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.786
Take a look at this very, very simple pedigree for red-green

00:00:04.786 --> 00:00:07.550
color blindness. I'm going to tell you a lot of things here,

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.750
right? This is a very small pedigree. I don't want you

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.100
to have to make a lot of assumptions. We know that

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.930
the trait we're talking about is red-green color blindness, which means

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.750
we know it's X-linked. We also know that it's recessive. We

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.130
see the father is affected by the trait and the mother

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.470
is unaffected. I'm also going to give you the information that the mother

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.920
is homozygous for whatever genotype she is. What is the probability

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.304
of this male and female having an affected child? The probability

00:00:36.304 --> 00:00:38.650
goes from 0 to a 100%. I want to you pick

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.550
up a percentage and put it in a box right here.
