00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.530
So what we have plotted here is
some function-- let's call it

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.030
f of x-- and its
derivative, f prime of x.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.470
And what we need
to figure out is

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.860
which one is f of x and
which one is f prime of x?

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.620
So let's take a stab at it.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.240
Let's think about what
would be the situation

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.000
if the green
function were f of x.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.450
So let's see if this works out.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.640
If the green function were f
of x, does the orange function

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.229
here, or the yellow function,
could that be f prime of x?

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:31.770
So let's think about
what's happening

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.160
to this green function
at different points.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.337
So this green function
right over here,

00:00:36.337 --> 00:00:38.170
right at this point if
we start at the left,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.695
has a positive slope.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.160
If this orange
function were f prime

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.590
of x, if it were the derivative
of the green function,

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.999
then it would have
to be positive

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:57.540
because the green
function's slope is

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.820
positive at that point.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.670
But we see that
it's not positive.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.980
So it's pretty clear that the
green function cannot be f

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.822
of x, and the yellow function
cannot be its derivative,

00:01:06.822 --> 00:01:08.280
because if this
was its derivative,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.450
it would be positive here.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.150
So that quickly, we found out
that that can't be the case.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.200
But let's see if it could
work out the other way.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.640
So it's starting to feel--
just ruling that situation

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.490
out-- that maybe that this is
f of x and the green function

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.900
is f prime of x.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.420
So let's see if this
holds up to scrutiny.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.170
So what we have when we
start off at the left,

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.420
f of x, or what we
think is f of x,

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.364
has a reasonably positive slope.

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:39.155
Is that consistent?

00:01:39.155 --> 00:01:40.070
Well, yeah, sure.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.580
Our green function is positive.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.500
In fact, at the
point, it's telling us

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.040
that the slope of the tangent
line is around 2 and 1/2.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.910
And it actually does look like
the slope of the tangent line

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.405
is exactly 2 and 1/2 of
this function right here.

00:01:55.405 --> 00:01:56.780
Actually, let me
erase this, just

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.196
so we don't look
like we're trying

00:01:58.196 --> 00:02:00.960
to take the slope of the
tangent line of the derivative.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.160
So it looks just like that.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.610
So we see the slope of the
tangent line right over here

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.980
looks like about 2 and 1/2,
and the value of this function

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.910
up here looks like
it's about 2 and a 1/2.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.990
So, so far this
green function looks

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.320
like a pretty good
candidate for the derivative

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.490
of this yellow function.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.086
But let's keep going here.

00:02:19.086 --> 00:02:20.460
So let's think
about what happens

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.140
as we move to the right.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.100
So here, let's see.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.630
It looks like the slope
of this yellow function--

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.560
let me just use a color we
can see-- it keeps going up.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.020
It keeps going up,
keeps going up.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.090
And then at some point, it
reaches some maximum slope,

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.140
and then it starts
to go down again.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.030
The slope starts to go
down again, all the way

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.980
to the slope going all the
way down to 0 right over here.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.000
Well, does this green
function describe that?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.666
Well, let's see.

00:02:52.666 --> 00:02:54.940
The slope is positive
and increasing up

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.440
to this point, which seemed
pretty consistent with what

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.760
we just experienced.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.780
Then the slope stays
positive, but it's

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.324
positive and decreasing.

00:03:02.324 --> 00:03:03.490
And that's what we saw here.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.910
The slope is positive and
decreasing all the way

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.460
to the slope getting to 0
at this maximum point here.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.950
And we see, indeed, that
on this green function,

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.410
the green function hits 0.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.110
So it seems like it's doing
a pretty good job of plotting

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.230
the slope of the tangent
line of the orange function.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.140
And then our slope becomes
more and more negative.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.420
And then it hits some
point, some minimum point

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.750
right over here.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.490
The slope hits some minimum
point right over here.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.156
And then it becomes
less and less negative.

00:03:35.556 --> 00:03:36.930
Let's see how well
I can draw it.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.480
The slope becomes
less and less negative

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.160
until it hits a 0 slope again.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.860
And then it starts
becoming positive

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.860
until it hits some
maximum slope.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.070
But then it stays positive,
but it becomes less positive.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.850
It becomes less
and less positive.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.070
So it looks pretty clear that
the orange function is f of x,

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.710
and the green function
is f prime of x.
