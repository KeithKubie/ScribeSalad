00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.350
Inside each one of your cells there is six
feet of DNA, made up of 6 billion letters

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:14.350
of genetic code. Now your DNA is split into
46 pieces, each 3-4cm long, called chromosomes.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.060
Now normally we think of chromosomes as looking
like this, but they only take that form when

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.460
a cell is ready to divide. So usually DNA
is just a wiggly thread within the nucleus.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.369
Now, if you can imagine DNA is only about
2nm wide but a chromosome is centimetres long.

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.780
So you would think that it would get tangled
worse than the headphones in your bag. So

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.620
the DNA is actually wrapped around proteins
called histones. Now those histones have wiggly

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.699
tails, which will come in handy as we'll see
in a moment.

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.829
Your unique set of DNA first formed when 23
chromosomes from your mom mixed with 23 from

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:52.870
your dad.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.469
Now 22 of those chromosomes from each parent
form matching pairs, but the 23rd set is the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.900
sex chromosomes - so two x-chromosomes make
you female, and an x and a y make you male.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.170
Now since the male sex chromosomes are different,
both can remain active for the rest of your

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.680
life, but for females, one of the x-chromosomes
needs to be inactivated for proper development

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.969
to occur.

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:22.899
This happens when a female embryo is just
four days old and consists of only 100 cells.

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:28.000
Right now in this cell the x-chromosome from
Dad and the one from Mom are both active.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.030
But through a tiny molecular battle, one of
the x-chromosomes wins and remains active

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.969
while the other is inactivated.

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:41.820
This is done by packing the DNA closer together
and making modifications to those dangly histone

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.390
tails that signal this inactivation. New structural
proteins are also added to bind everything

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.659
closer together. And finally methyl groups,
these tiny little molecular markers are added

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.049
to the DNA, to basically signal to the cell
that this DNA shouldn't be read. All of this

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.420
together makes the DNA very difficult to access
for the molecular machinery that would harness

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.170
the code in this DNA. It is switched off;
this DNA is silenced.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.880
In contrast the active x-chromosome DNA is
more spread out. This allows better access

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.880
to the genes on the chromosome. Histones can
be slid along the DNA or removed entirely,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:34.440
and the histone tails have a different modification
signalling this DNA is active. Now all of

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.080
this makes it possible for RNA polymerase
to access and transcribe this DNA into messenger

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.780
RNA which then goes out into the cell and
is used to make a protein.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.390
Now what's surprising about x-chromosome inactivation
is that it's seems kind of random which x

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.690
chromosome wins - I mean in some cells Dad's
x-chromosome wins and in others, Mom's x-chromosome

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.260
wins. So this 100 cell embryo ends up with
a mixture of active x-chromosomes. But from

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.530
this point forward, as these cells divide,
they maintain the active x-chromosome that

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.600
they had inside. So all of the cells with
Dad's active x-chromosome give rise to further

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.290
cells with Dad's active x-chromosome.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.760
And this continues on into adulthood. So if
you could look at a woman's skin and see which

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.240
x-chromosome has been inactivated, you would
see a stripy pattern, which shows the growth

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.670
and migration of all these first a hundred
cells, when the embryo was just four days

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:41.670
old.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.340
Now of course you can't actually see that
in humans, but you can see this with calico

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.270
cats and that's because the gene for coat
colour is actually on the x-chromosome.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.160
So just by looking at the pattern of her spots
here, her dark and light spots, you can see

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.840
where her mom or dad's x-chromosome has been
inactivated. And this also shows us that only

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.350
female cats can be calico cats, and that's
because well only female cats can inherit

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.680
two x-chromosomes with two different colour
genes.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.159
Now this is just one really cool example of
epigenetics but epigenetics doesn't normally

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:22.710
work on one whole chromosome. In fact, it's
at play in all of your chromosomes turning

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:29.460
on and off your genes. For example it's epigenetics
which makes a pancreatic cell capable of producing

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.860
insulin because that gene is switched on there
but switched off everywhere else. What's more

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.740
interesting is that it seems the behaviours
you take can actually affect your epigenetics,

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.430
and even weirder perhaps the things that your
parents or grandparents did can affect your

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.210
epigenetics now, can affect your DNA. So you
are not just a product of your genetic code,

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.669
you're not just a product of your DNA, you
are also a product of your epigenetics and

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.909
that is influenced by your behaviour and the
behaviour of your ancestors.
