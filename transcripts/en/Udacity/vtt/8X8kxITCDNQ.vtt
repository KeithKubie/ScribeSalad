All species with the genus name, Homo, indicates a form of human. And our

00:00:05.464 --> 00:00:10.294
closest human relatives are technically neanderthals or Homo neanderthalensis,

00:00:10.294 --> 00:00:16.445
even though they recently went extinct several tens of thousands of years ago.

00:00:16.445 --> 00:00:21.065
Homo erectus and Homo habilis, our more distant human relatives, but they went

00:00:21.065 --> 00:00:27.356
extinct a long time ago. It turns out that our closest living relatives are in

00:00:27.356 --> 00:00:33.224
fact chimpanzees. One of the main ways we know that humans are most closely

00:00:33.224 --> 00:00:37.128
related to chimps is that a remarkable amount of our genetic information

00:00:37.128 --> 00:00:45.506
between humans and chimps is the same. An amazing 98%. But those few genetic

00:00:45.506 --> 00:00:49.660
differences are responsible for the important structural differences,

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:56.230
especially with regards to the brain, which is what makes us uniquely human.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.019
This change over time is referred to as evolution. And it's achieved through a

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:07.686
well-established mechanism of mutation and natural selection. Let's learn a bit

00:01:07.686 --> 00:01:10.229
more about how natural selection works.
