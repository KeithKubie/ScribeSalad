TAL SCULLY; Experimental
physics is cool.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.170
J-Lab has a very wide
range of experiments

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.760
that you can do, actually.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.450
So my partner and I, we did
a biophysics experiment,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.840
we did a spectroscopy
experiment, which

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.910
is like physical
chemistry, and then

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.970
we did an experiment
with cosmic ray muons.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.480
So particle physics.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.630
So we covered a
wide range of ways

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.870
to apply physics
to the real world.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.590
And it was really neat to see
that range and interact with it

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.120
and analyze data for lots of
different fields of physics.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.000
So that was nice.
