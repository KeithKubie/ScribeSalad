00:00:00.112 --> 00:00:03.140
All right, so can you use this Bayes net to help work things out?

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually it make it a lot easier. I

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.800
was, I was thinking about how I would do this and,

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.520
and wouldn't involve writing a whole lot of equations and doing

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.840
a whole lot of stuff but actually, just by writing out

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.210
the Bayes net we ended up, and filling out these tables

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.050
we ended up doing that. So, the, the bottom table is,

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.250
basically tells me the probability of, ball two being some color.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.290
In a world where ball one is known to be green.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.750
Because we just broke down that part of the table, so

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.811
we don't have to do it for every other one. And,

00:00:29.811 --> 00:00:32.880
you know, if I knew that I were in box one,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.480
then the probability of it being blue in a world where

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.450
ball one was green is in fact zero. And if I

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.090
knew I were in box two. Then the probability of it

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.920
being blue in, where ball one is green, and where box

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.570
two is three quarters. So I only care about that last column.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.820
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.480
&gt;&gt; And now I just

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.740
have to choose the row or choose how to

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.710
distribute the likelihood over the row. So all I

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.760
really need to know is, what's the probability of

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.102
me being in box one and being in box two.

00:01:02.102 --> 00:01:03.940
&gt;&gt; All right, which we have in the table as well, as a half.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.290
&gt;&gt; Right. So that means the probability of

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.570
it being ball two. Being, ball two being

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.540
blue in a world where ball one is green, is just the probability of ball two

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.290
being blue, given that ball one is green. And we want to

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.370
know the probability two is blue given that one is green

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.440
but when you look at the table and all we care

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.580
about is that last column, all we really want to know is, well,

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.620
we know the answer when box one, when we're in box

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.280
one, when box equals one, it's zero, and we know the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.410
answer when box equals two, it's 3 4s. So if we

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.840
were going to do a sample, for example, which we talked about earlier,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.450
we would just sample a bunch of times, and we would get

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.050
0 sometimes and we would get 3 4s sometimes. And that would

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.280
be great, except of course, we want to compute this exactly. And

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.700
we know how to compute it exactly, because we actually know the distribution

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.850
over, how many times box would be equal to 1 and how

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.190
many times box would be equal to 2. It would be half

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.060
in each case. So, I really like, I think you've made this

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.072
easier by giving us the table. So, actually writing out the Bayes net.

00:02:06.072 --> 00:02:09.132
So we want to know the probability that the second ball

00:02:09.132 --> 00:02:13.290
is blue given that the first ball is green. And that's

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.540
just equal to the probability that the second ball is blue.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.640
Given that the first ball is green and we were in

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.960
box one. Because if we knew that, we knew we were

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.910
in box one and the first ball we drew was green,

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.460
it'd be really easy to compute the probability of the second

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.880
ball being blue. It's right there in the table at zero.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.200
&gt;&gt; Is this, is this the

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.480
way that you think it should be written?

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.980
&gt;&gt; Almost, but not quite. That would be the easy thing to do because we know

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.390
that answer. We know the probably that box is equal to 1. It's just a half. But

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.420
it's not just the probability that box is

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.370
equal to one, it's the probability that box

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.710
is equal to one in a world where we knew the first thing we drew was green.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.720
&gt;&gt; Gotcha.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.490
&gt;&gt; And if we had that then it would be easy to figure out the, the products

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.370
there to figure out two is blue in a

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.110
world where the box one is green. Boxes equal

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.150
to 1 and the first ball that we pulled was equal to, was green. And then we will

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.170
just add that to the probability that the second

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.510
ball we drew was blue. Given that the first

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.170
ball that we drew was green. And we were

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.486
in box two. We were drawing from box two.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.810
And that would have to be weighted by the prober-, probability that box was

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.970
two in a world where the first ball that we grew, drew was green.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.700
&gt;&gt; Good. Very good. And in fact, this

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.870
rule that you kind of worked through follows

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.930
just algebraically from two of the rules that

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.950
we just talked about. It's the combination of

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.620
the marginalization rule, which let's us introduce this

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.330
box variable. But the way that we wrote

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.260
it before, it was, you have to and it in. But then we actually then applied

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.770
the chain rule to split that into a conditional probability. So, so this is

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.800
all valid at the moment. And are these quantities that we, that we know?

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.170
&gt;&gt; Well, we certainly know the very first term in each

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.555
of the two summands. Can it be summands? Let's say they're

00:04:06.555 --> 00:04:10.158
summands. If they're not, we'll get nasty emails from people. The

00:04:10.158 --> 00:04:13.290
first part's probability. Second ball is blue given that the first

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.870
one is green in red box one. And

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.600
the probablity that the second ball is blue given

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.990
that the first one is green in red

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:21.079
box two. That's easy, that's actually in the table.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.270
&gt;&gt; That's easy, that's in the table. And it's

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.260
zero in this case, and three quarters in this case.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.980
&gt;&gt; Right, so it's zero in the first case and

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.600
it's three quarters in the second case, straight outta the table.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.220
Now all we have to do is figure out how

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.360
often we're in box one and how often we're in box

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.950
two and if you didn't think it through you would just have

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.140
the probability of box equals one and the probability of box equals two.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.230
But we have to remember we're in a world where the first ball

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.080
we picked was green. So now we just have to compute each of

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.940
those terms. So how do we do that? So we want to

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.557
know what the probability is that boxes, we're in box 1 given that

00:04:55.557 --> 00:05:00.340
we picked a green ball first. Well that one's actually much easier to

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.600
think about because Bayes' rule will give us, will allows us to express

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.450
this in quantities where we do know the answer. Because we have the tables. So

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.350
that would be the probability that the first ball was green given that we were

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.900
in box 1 times the probability

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.730
that we're in box 1 divided by the probability that the first thing we picked

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:29.210
is green. So, the probability that we get a green ball if

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.070
we pick box one, is just well, it's three quarters.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.890
&gt;&gt; Yep. It's.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.480
&gt;&gt; A different three quarters than the other one though.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.290
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Those, those two three

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.320
quarters aren't the same three quarters. This,

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.400
this way. Because sometimes, two three quarters

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.491
are not the same two three quarters.

00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:45.217
&gt;&gt; In this case, there are three green balls and one, what

00:05:45.217 --> 00:05:49.132
we're pretending to call yellow because it's easier to write than orange, ball.

00:05:49.132 --> 00:05:51.469
And so three of the four of them are green, so if we

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:54.440
were in box one, we close our eyes, we'd get three of those.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.914
So what the probability that we're in box one? Well, it's

00:05:56.914 --> 00:06:00.201
right there in the table, to Bayes' net, it's one half. Now

00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:03.945
we just have to figure out well, what's the probability that

00:06:03.945 --> 00:06:07.080
I would get a green ball the first time I picked one?

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.602
&gt;&gt; Right. And so one easy way to do

00:06:08.602 --> 00:06:12.080
that is, we actually do this, this whole process again

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.780
on box two, and then just normalize. Or we

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.240
could break this apart using the, using the marginalization rule.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.350
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.810
which one do you want to do?

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:21.690
&gt;&gt; The first one I think.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.000
&gt;&gt; Okay. So figuring out the probability the first

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.840
one is green isn't, isn't as easy as it

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.620
looks. You can't just say, well there are five

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.000
green balls, but there's a total of nine balls,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.020
and so it's 5 9th, because those nine balls

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.920
aren't distributed equally on both sides of the boxes.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.480
So you really have to, you still have to

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.960
know which box that you're in, in some sense.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.340
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.370
&gt;&gt; But we can kind of skip that step. Okay,

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.490
so I like this, so what's the probability that the first ball

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.262
is green given that we're in box two, well it's just 2

00:06:50.262 --> 00:06:55.740
5ths. Prove by looking at the screen. And what's the prior probability

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.640
that we're in box two? Well, it's just a half because that

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.010
was given to us on the table. And so, we still don't

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.170
know the prior probability of, of the first ball being green, but

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.880
it turns out we don't have to because there are only two

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.040
boxes and so we can just normalize and the right thing will happen.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.506
So, three quarters times one half is equal to three eighths. And 2/5 times

00:07:15.506 --> 00:07:20.790
1/2 is equal to 2/10 or 1/5. And

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:26.270
that's right. So 3/8 is also 15 over 40. 1/5 is 8 over 40. Why do

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.610
we do that? Because we want to be able

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.420
to add them up and normalize and so that means

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.100
if you added those two together and put them

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.780
in the denominator, that would give you 23 over 40.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:41.890
And, so how much is 15 40ths of 23 over 40ths well, it's 15 out of 23.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.830
And so, without ever directly computing the probability that

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.880
1 equals green. We know that the probability of

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.240
us being in box 1, given that the first

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.300
ball pulled was green is 15 over 23. Which

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.390
was a lot of work to do considering that

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.130
we knew we were going to multiply it by zero.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:59.793
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:07:59.793 --> 00:08:01.130
&gt;&gt; Which meant none of this work mattered.

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:02.240
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.900
&gt;&gt; Or we did it because we love probability.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.140
&gt;&gt; No it was, it was kind of helpful because

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.110
we needed to know how to normalize these two numbers.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.560
&gt;&gt; Right, so it was useful but, I

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.610
mean, just the whole thing we already kind of knew.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:13.050
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.200
&gt;&gt; That [LAUGH] that was going to be zero.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.720
&gt;&gt; But this one we didn't know.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.710
&gt;&gt; Right, this one we didn't know, and so now we know that the, the

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:26.220
other case is 8 23rds, and we're done. So 0 times 15, divided by 23 is

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:32.799
0, and three quarters times 8 23rds is 24 over 92.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:35.049
&gt;&gt; Right, and we can, there's a factor of

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:39.070
4 in both of those. So it's actually 6 23rds.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:40.010
&gt;&gt; That's what I said.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.895
&gt;&gt; Woohoo!

00:08:41.895 --> 00:08:42.842
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:08:42.842 --> 00:08:45.680
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.240
Boy it would be nice if we had an algorithm to do this for us.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.246
&gt;&gt; Man, and the algorithm shou, shou, should not involve me. [LAUGH]
