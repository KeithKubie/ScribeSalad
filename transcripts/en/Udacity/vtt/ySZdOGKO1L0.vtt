00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.540
Alright so now that we have a sense of what tit for

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.180
tat does against various strategies, let's try to think about what we

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.350
should do against tit for tat, so what do we do if

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.300
we're facing tit for tat. So I'm just going to break it down

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.690
to two possibilities it turns out there's actually more, but these these

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.830
two are pretty instructive. So let's pretend that we have to choose

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.480
between always defect as a way of playing against tit for tat,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.140
or we have to be always cooperate playing against tit for tat.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.690
So what I've written down here is what the total discounted reward is going to

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.850
be or the total reward in this case. As a function of gamma. So, let's

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.300
start with what happens if you play

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.780
always cooperating against tit for tat. Well, you

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.440
already told me that it. Such a thing

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.860
will result in tit for tat always cooperating.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.260
&gt;&gt; Mm Hm.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.570
&gt;&gt; And that means we're going to play in

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.320
this box. The cooperate-cooperate box. And that means on

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.750
every single round, we're going to to get

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.986
a minus one. Which means over an infinite

00:00:54.986 --> 00:01:00.510
run we're going to get an average of one, sorry minus one over one minus Gamma.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.730
&gt;&gt; Mm Hm. That makes sense.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.510
&gt;&gt; Okay? You agree with that?

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.920
&gt;&gt; I do. Just minus one repeated over and over again.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.960
Now always defect as you recall you told me that, that will

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.300
result, well for the always defect agent against tit for tat, the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.530
first thing that is going to happen is it's going to defect

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.480
while the tit for tat cooperates right? So we're

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.160
going to get zero for playing that strategy on the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.480
first round. Zero doesn't sound very good but look

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.620
at the alternatives. They're all negative so zero's pretty good.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.810
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.610
&gt;&gt; So it does this sort of you know good thing in the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.090
first step then after that tit for tat responds by always defecting in

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.840
response. Right? And that means we're going to be stuck in this box

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.960
the defect defect box where you get minus sixes for the rest of ever.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.890
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.670
&gt;&gt; So that means minus six over one minus gamma. But that

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.220
starts one step from now so we multiply it by another gamma.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.160
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.880
&gt;&gt; Alright. So these are two different

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.220
expression that represents what our pay off

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.540
would be for adopting two different strategies.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.900
And in fact, if gamma is really high,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.800
very close to 1, then this is a really good answer, right? Because it sort of

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.900
grows, it's like, minus over one minus gamma. So, for high gamma, we're talking

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.155
about something that's minus one times a really big number.

00:02:09.155 --> 00:02:10.100
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.360
&gt;&gt; Whereas this first one is not so good

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.900
for high gamma because what's going to happen is it's

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.790
going to get, end up getting minus six on every

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.310
step. So it's going to do worse overall. But if, if

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.660
we're talking about the low gamma. Then, let's say,

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.836
you know, zero for example. A gamma of zero will,

00:02:24.836 --> 00:02:27.610
will always defect. We'll get zero plus zero. But

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.911
always cooperate, we'll get negative one over one. And zero

00:02:31.911 --> 00:02:34.760
is better than minus one. So for really small

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.650
gamma, like if the games unlikely to last many

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.360
rounds, you should defect. But is the game is

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.270
going to last a long time, then you should cooperate.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.520
&gt;&gt; I believe that.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.700
&gt;&gt; Cool! Alright, so then my question to you is: What's the value of gamma

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.010
for which these two different strategies to

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.900
play against tit for tat are equally good.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.580
&gt;&gt; I think I know the answer.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.940
&gt;&gt; Woah! That was fast. Let's give everybody else

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.740
a chance to think about it.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.270
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.500
&gt;&gt; Go.
