00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:05.789
Serious Questions...spoiler alert!

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.440
In Jurassic Park,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.870
was Nedry under some kind of a deadline to get those embryos smuggled out because otherwise

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.750
why choose the night of a tropical storm with tourists on the island for the first time, dude?

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.539
You control the whole park. Take a rain check, try again tomorrow. So you crashed your Jeep in a ravine

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.060
Take a mulligan, Newman

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:38.219
"Hello, John" Would the real John Hammond have had to interact with himself every single time tourists did the automatic tour ride?

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.700
"John, that hurt."

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.749
It only works if he's talking to himself. Did he have to hire a staff of John Hammond impersonators? *gasp*

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.719
Did they clone John Hammond?

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.680
So what happens if you pay a visit to Jurassic Park and no dinosaurs show up?

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.670
You know, kind of like what happened with the test group

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:04.110
Do you get a refund? Do you get a rain check? And why are all of the dinosaur cages so packed with foliage?

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.219
It's a zoo. Don't you want people to see them? To see or not to see. That is the question

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:19.109
In Lost World, wouldn't you need a lot of permits before putting a dinosaur zoo in San Diego?

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:24.749
He says they're planning to open in like less than a month. The city council really signed off on this?

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.839
Roland the game hunter has a single earring on his right ear

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.469
Is this the closest we'll come to gay representation in the franchise?

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.529
Or does it count that all the dinosaurs are bred to be female and still start families together?

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.989
Why was Jeff Goldblum's daughter cut from the gymnastics team school cut you from the team?

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.320
I'd like to see Simone Biles kick a raptor through a window

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.599
Hey in Jurassic Park 3, what was Dr. Grant's first name again? ALAN. Oh, yeah

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.180
This is T-rex pee?

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.560
-Where'd you get it?

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.660
-You don't want to know.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.880
I've got a theory. Let a t-rex piss on you. Release the t-rex pee tape

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.709
Shouldn't Alan be more concerned about those 3 Pteranodons flying toward the mainland at the end

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.268
I can't bring a papaya back from Hawaii, but the flying lizard monsters get a pass

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.179
So in Jurassic world, we're supposed to believe that the general population is bored with Dinosaurs

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.249
I mean people still go to zoos, right? It's not like little kids get bored with tigers and monkeys and stuff

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.189
What happened to Isla Sorna, it's a whole other dinosaur island

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.440
Are we just gonna pretend that Lost World and Jurassic Park 3 never happened? Yes

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.480
So they designed a new dinosaur to boost attendance and yet they made it invisible

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.120
IT CAN CAMOFLAUGE!

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.980
How am I taking a selfie with that?

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.049
So these gyrospheres can be piloted off the rails by guests around the entire park?!

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.049
They're rolling into restricted areas and I can't even take one freakin shopping cart out of the Whole Foods parking lot

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.239
Okay, Fallen Kingdom. You're telling me they built a theme park on an island with an active volcano

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.320
Twice. That is a really big oversight. If you're gonna spare no expense, maybe hire a geologist

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.710
Jimmy Fallon

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:47.630
Why didn't Dr. Ian Malcolm testify for the Senate lying across the table with his shirt unbuttoned? That seems a lot more like his style.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.709
It's now been two movies of people talking about sending dinosaurs into war zones

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.939
And we haven't seen one armored dinosaur eating terrorists

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:05.029
When are we gonna get to the fireworks factory and buy fireworks factory? I mean a Dino riders movie

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.799
So, how do I get invited to a black-market dinosaur auction? Is there a mailing list? Is there a secret handshake?

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.279
Do we do orgy mass? I'm just trying to get the feel here

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.510
Four million dollars seems awfully cheap for a live dinosaur then again

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.569
How do you even start to set a baseline price for a dinosaur?

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.230
Do you just check what Tigers are selling for and add a couple of zeros?

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.529
What would a slovenian arms dealer want with a personal murder dinosaur?

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.419
What kind of operation is this guy running where a raptor would be better than like a guy with a gun?

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.080
He wants to assassinate a rival via Raptor attack?! Well, I guess it would send a message

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.240
And that message is that I am this completely responsible...

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.280
Also after your Raptor finishes killing its target, how do you get her back into her cage

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.429
We never saw a signal for go back home and don't kill me or anyone else or get noticed by the cops

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.800
It's gonna be in part three

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:10.639
So when the little girl lets all the dinosaurs out at the end, that's basically murder, right? Yes

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:19.399
After two movies do we actually know anything about Owen Grady or is played by Chris Pratt enough of the character trick?

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.400
I don't know. He likes vests

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.830
Could Rocky beat up a dinosaur?

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.120
Yeah, I could

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.760
