00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.350
When a table invokes
the cellForRowAtIndexPath method,

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.260
it passes the control
object in index path.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.420
An index path is a struct
that holds the row number.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.530
In order to populate our table cells,

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.870
there are a few steps we need
to perform in this method.

00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:18.345
The first step is to dequeue
a reusable cell from the table,

00:00:18.345 --> 00:00:20.715
using the correct reuse identified.

00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:24.155
The second step is to find the model
object that corresponds to the row

00:00:24.155 --> 00:00:24.705
in question.

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:27.745
The third step is to set the images and

00:00:27.745 --> 00:00:31.080
labels in the cell,
using the data from the model object.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.970
And last but not least, return the cell.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.330
For the favorite things app,
we'll use a standard TableViewCell.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.800
It comes with a UI label
property named textlabel.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.465
And our reuse identifier
will be FavoriteThingCell.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.110
Here are three different implementations
of cellForRowAtIndexPath.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.540
Which of these three accomplishes all
four of the steps previously outlined?

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.090
