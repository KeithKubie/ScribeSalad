00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:04.970
In the depths of our solar system there is
a suburb.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.530
No… not that kind of suburb.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.550
Instead of McMansions…This neighborhood
is home to ancient space rocks, the ominous

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.840
planet nine and clues about the formation
of the universe.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.769
It’s called the Kuiper Belt.

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:22.210
It was named after a pioneering astronomer
who worked with Carl Sagan on a secret mission

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.669
to detonate a nuclear bomb on the moon.

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:27.109
But that’s another story.

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.660
The Kuiper Belt can be found beyond the farthest
planet from the sun which is why objects in

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.940
the belt are referred to as trans-Neptunian.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.410
This is where you’ll find Pluto and some
of the other members of the Dwarf Planet Squad.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.220
Most of the objects in the Kuiper Belt are
really really really old.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.580
When the solar system formed billions of years
ago, the gravitational tug from the new planets

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.010
swept all surrounding objects into the sun
or out of the solar system.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.559
But objects that were far enough away were
safe and they grouped together in orbit forming

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.649
the Kuiper Belt.

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.309
This region has, for the most part, been a
mystery to astronomers.

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.070
But they’re actively working to find out
if the Kuiper Belt contains secrets about

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.060
the formation of the solar system.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.980
And if it is home to what many believe might
be the ninth planet which is sadly not Pluto.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:14.980
Make sure to share this video with your friends!

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:15.980
And follow Galactic Glossary to see more crafts
in space.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.980
In this video, you’ll learn the difference
between celestial rocks.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:17.980
Thanks for watching!

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.980
You can catch more episodes of Space Crafts
right here.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.420
In this episode, you’ll learn all about
the phases of the moon so you’ll know exactly

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.420
when look out for the next full moon.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.680
