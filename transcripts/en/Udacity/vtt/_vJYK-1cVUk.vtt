Linear regression is pretty complicated in general. There are a lot of things

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:09.660
to learn. So finally, we've included some links to a lot of great applet's for

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.500
understanding correlation and regression. You;ll see them in the instructor

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.500
notes section. So play around with them if your interested. And keep up the

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.400
great work.
