everything the storytelling some of the

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670
everything the storytelling some of the
 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.340
everything the storytelling some of the
character relationships and just the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350
character relationships and just the
 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.650
character relationships and just the
first season overall I think was very

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660
first season overall I think was very
 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.790
first season overall I think was very
trying to find its footing and it never

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800
trying to find its footing and it never
 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.920
trying to find its footing and it never
really found it I think maybe season 2

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930
really found it I think maybe season 2
 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.150
really found it I think maybe season 2

for the most part we were talking about

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850
for the most part we were talking about
 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.030
for the most part we were talking about
comparing it to Supergirl and I think I

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040
comparing it to Supergirl and I think I
 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.980
comparing it to Supergirl and I think I
think DC's legends of tomorrow is

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990
think DC's legends of tomorrow is
 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.900
think DC's legends of tomorrow is
overall a little bit better than the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910
overall a little bit better than the
 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.520
overall a little bit better than the
first season of Supergirl but I think

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530
first season of Supergirl but I think
 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.830
first season of Supergirl but I think
Supergirl hit higher highs and sunk to

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840
Supergirl hit higher highs and sunk to
 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.220
Supergirl hit higher highs and sunk to
lower lobes so you know take that how

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230
lower lobes so you know take that how
 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.040
lower lobes so you know take that how
you will but I still I'd still enticed
