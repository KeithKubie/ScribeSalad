positive Network and then what happens
 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.040
positive Network and then what happens
is you're working away and then you

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050
is you're working away and then you
 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.860
is you're working away and then you
start to get frustrated you can't figure

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.869
out what's going on and what's happening
is you're focusing and you're using one

resting States you can only be in one
 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.789
resting States you can only be in one
mode at the same time so you might

wonder is there a certain task that is
 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.430
wonder is there a certain task that is
more appropriate for focus mode or

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440
more appropriate for focus mode or
 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.290
more appropriate for focus mode or
diffuse mode the reality

certain sort of load that information
 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.880
certain sort of load that information
into your brain and then you do

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890
into your brain and then you do
 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.560
into your brain and then you do

processing occurs and this this happens

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330
processing occurs and this this happens
 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.090
processing occurs and this this happens
no matter what you're learning whether

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100
no matter what you're learning whether
 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.590
no matter what you're learning whether
you're learning something in math and

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600
you're learning something in math and
 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.090
you're learning something in math and
science you're learning a new language

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100

back up a car and think about it this
 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.840
back up a car and think about it this
way here's a very important important

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850
way here's a very important important
 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.260
way here's a very important important
related idea and that is that when

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270
related idea and that is that when
 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.000
related idea and that is that when
you're learning something new you want

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010
you're learning something new you want
 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.480
you're learning something new you want
to create a well practiced neural

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490
to create a well practiced neural
 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.360
to create a well practiced neural
pattern that you can easily draw to mind

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370
pattern that you can easily draw to mind
 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.770
pattern that you can easily draw to mind
we need it

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780
we need it
 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.660
we need it
so this is called a neural chunk and

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670
so this is called a neural chunk and
 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.060
so this is called a neural chunk and
chunking theory is incredibly important

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070
chunking theory is incredibly important
 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.030
chunking theory is incredibly important
in learning so for example if you are

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040
in learning so for example if you are
 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.280
in learning so for example if you are

of pattern that's well practiced so all

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700
of pattern that's well practiced so all
 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.850
of pattern that's well practiced so all
you have to do is think I'm going to
