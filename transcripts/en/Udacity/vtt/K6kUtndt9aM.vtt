00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.830
However, there are some gotcha's here.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.510
What happens, for example,
if the length of the document is zero?

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.310
All of sudden, you have divided by zero.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.580
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.080
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.430
&gt;&gt; So we would have to consider that as

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.980
a special case.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.670
Also, what exactly do we mean
by the size of the handle?

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.640
As we said,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.190
we probably from the GUI toolkit would
get some pixels, a number of pixels.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.470
But we'd need to translate that into
something like a percentage, or

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.230
an integer count of things.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.060
And then there's an even
more subtle situation.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.486
Let's say that we've scrolled
to the end of the file.

00:00:41.486 --> 00:00:42.418
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:42.418 --> 00:00:46.870
&gt;&gt; And we re-sized the window
to make it bigger.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.070
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.760
&gt;&gt; What happens?

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.020
What do we expect to
see in the viewport?

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.330
So one possibility is we would
see exactly the same lines, but

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.790
now some blank lines at the bottom.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.570
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.489
&gt;&gt; Another possibility is
that the line that was at

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.720
the bottom of the viewport before stays
at the bottom of the viewport, and

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.050
we see some more lines at the top.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.590
And, in fact, if you go play around
with actual web browsers out there, and

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.000
with word processing editors and so on,
you can see both of these behaviors.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.010
However, if we're
designing the application,

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.470
we have to make the decision about
which one of those two behaviors

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.040
we actually intend that
the text browser to have.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.540
Okay?

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.260
So, this process of modeling has forced
us into thinking about something

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.010
which we might not have,
otherwise, thought about,

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.910
which is one of the benefits
of doing the modeling.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.720
It forces you to think
through subtleties of things.
