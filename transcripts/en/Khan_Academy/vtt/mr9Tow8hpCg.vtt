00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.190
I've got a transformation T.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.670
When you apply the
transformation T to some x in

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.890
your domain, it is equivalent to
multiplying that x in your

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.220
domain, or that vector.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.380
by the matrix A.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.950
And let's say we know the linear
transformation T can

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.940
be-- that's transformation
matrix when you put it in

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:29.220
reduced row echelon form-- it is
equal to an n by n identity

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.560
matrix, or the n by
n identity matrix.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.230
Well this alone tells
a lot of things.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.800
First of all, if when you put
this in reduced row echelon

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.000
form, you get a square
identity matrix.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.650
That tells us that the
original matrix

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.230
had to be n by n.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.600
And it also tells us that T is
a mapping from Rn to Rn.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.530
And we saw in the last video,
all of these are conditions,

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.010
especially this one right here,
for T to be invertible.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.790
So If we know that this is
true-- T is a linear

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.390
transformation, it's a reduced
row echelon form of the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.460
transformation matrix of the
identity matrix right there--

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.620
we know that T is invertible.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.910
Let's remind ourselves what it
even means to be invertible.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:23.910
To be invertible means that
there exists some-- we used

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.720
the word function before, but
now we're talking about

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.580
transformations, they're
really the same thing.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:35.760
So let's say there exists some
transformation-- let's call it

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:46.050
T-inverse like that, or T to
the minus 1-- such that the

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.750
composition of T-inverse with
T is equal to the identity

00:01:51.750 --> 00:02:00.350
transformation on your domain,
and the composition of T with

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.010
T-inverse is equal to the
identity transformation on

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.390
your codomain.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.620
Just like that.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.720
And just to remind you what this
looks like, let's draw

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.700
our domains and codomains.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.310
Our domain is Rn, and our
codomain is also Rn.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.520
So if you take some vector
in your domain, apply the

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.420
transformation T-- you're
going to go into your

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.310
codomain, so that is T.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.310
And then if you apply the
T-inverse after that, you're

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.670
going to go back to
that original x.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.680
So this says, look,
you apply T and

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.090
then you apply T-inverse.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.810
You're just going to get back
to where you started.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.593
It's equivalent to the identity
transformation.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.560
Just like that.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.990
This is saying if you start
here in your codomain, you

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.080
apply this inverse
transformation first, then you

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.670
apply your transformation,
you're going to go back to the

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.280
same point in your codomain.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.350
So it's equivalent to the
identity transformation in

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.640
your codomain.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.710
It just happens to be in this
case that the domain and the

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.470
codomain are the same set, Rn.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.740
Now we know what a
transformation-- what it means

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.420
to be invertible. we know what
the conditions are for

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.040
invertibility.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.280
So this begs the
next question.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.570
We know this guy is a linear
transformation, in fact that's

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.760
one of the conditions
to be able to

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.910
represent it as a matrix.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.000
Or any transformation that can
be represented as a matrix

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.550
vector product is a linear
transformation.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.950
So this guy's a linear
transformation.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.920
But the question is, is
T-inverse a linear

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.170
transformation?

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.750
Let's review what the two
conditions are that we need to

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.610
have to be a linear
transformation.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.400
So we know T is a linear
transformation.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.150
So we know that if you apply
the transformation T to two

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.530
vectors-- let's say x and y--
if we apply to the sum of

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.390
those two vectors, it is equal
to the transformation of the

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.650
first vector plus the
transformation

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.030
of the second vector.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.650
That's one of the conditions,
or one thing that we know is

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.220
true for all linear
transformations.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.709
And the second thing we know
is true for all linear

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.560
transformations is, if we take
the transformation of some

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.500
scaled version of a vector in
our domain, it is equal to the

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.680
scaling factor times
the transformation

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.270
of the vector itself.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.906
These are both conditions for
linear transformations.

00:04:34.906 --> 00:04:38.130
So let's see if we can prove
that both of these conditions

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.860
hold for T-inverse, or
this guy right here.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.925
So to do this, let's do this
little exercise right here.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.890
Let's take the composition of
T with T-inverse of two

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.730
vectors, a plus b.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.585
Remember, T-inverse is a mapping
from your codomain to

00:05:04.585 --> 00:05:05.980
your domain, although they're
both going to

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.580
be Rn in this case.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.870
But T-inverse maps from
this set to that set.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.310
Let's write it up here.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.470
T-inverse is a mapping from your
codomain to your domain.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.100
Although it looks identical,
just like that.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.560
OK, so what is this going
to be equal to?

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.820
Well we just said, by definition
of your inverse

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.040
transformation, this is going
to be equal to the identity

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.360
transformation on
your codomain.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.860
So assuming these guys are
members of your codomain, in

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:41.180
this case Rn, this is just going
to be equal to a plus b.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.640
This thing, the composition
of T with its inverse, by

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.090
definition is just the identity
transformation on

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.270
your codomain.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.110
So this is just whatever
I put in here.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.950
If I put in an x here,
this would be an x.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.370
If I put in an apple here,
this would be an apple.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.870
It's going to be the identity
transformation.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.130
Now what is this equal to?

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.940
Well I could use the same
argument to say that this

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.290
right here is equal to the
identity transformation

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.630
applied to a.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.750
And I'm not writing the identity
transformation, I'm

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:13.330
writing this.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.580
But we know that this is
equivalent to the identity

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.320
transformation.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.100
So we could say that is
equivalent to the composition

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.640
of T with the inverse applied
to a, and we could say that

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.900
this is the equivalent to the
identity transformation, which

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.510
we know is the same thing as T,
the composition of t with

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.210
T-inverse applied to b.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:42.360
So we can rewrite this thing
right here as being equal to

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.240
the sum of these two things.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.760
In fact we don't even
have to rewrite it.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.040
We can just write it's equal
to-- this transformation is

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.770
equal to this.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.520
And maybe an easier way for you
to process it is, we could

00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:02.340
write this as T of the T-inverse
of a plus b, is

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:10.700
equal to T of the T-inverse
of a plus T of the

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.860
T-inverse of b.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.990
And this should-- I don't know
which one your brain processes

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.500
easier, but either of these,
when you when you take the

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.120
composition of T with T-inverse,
you're going to be

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.530
left with an a plus b.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.210
You take the composition of
T with T-inverse, you're

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.180
left with an a.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.500
You take the composition of T
with T-inverse, you're just

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.750
left with a b there.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.550
So in either case you get a
plus b-- when you evaluate

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.350
either side of this expression
you'll get the vector a plus

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:37.980
the vector b.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.370
Now what can we do?

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:46.500
We know that T itself is a
linear transformation.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.190
And since T is a linear
transformation, we know that T

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:58.490
applied to the sum of two
vectors is equal to T applied

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.030
to each of those vectors
and summed up.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:01.360
Or we can take it
the other way.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.970
T applied to two separate
vectors-- so we call this one

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:07.360
vector right here, and this
vector right here.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.540
So in this case I have a T
applied to one vector, and I'm

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.700
summing it to a T applied
to another vector.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.790
So it's this right here, which
we know is equal to T applied

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.480
to the sum of those
two vectors.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.294
So this is T applied to the
vector T-inverse of a-- let me

00:08:24.294 --> 00:08:33.610
write it here-- plus
T-inverse of b.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.409
It might look a little
convoluted, but all I'm saying

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:39.630
is, this looks just like this.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:45.435
If you say that x is equal to
T-inverse of a, and if you say

00:08:45.435 --> 00:08:47.970
that y is equal to
T-inverse of b.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:49.660
So this looks just like that.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.730
It's going to be equal to the
transformation T applied to

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.340
the sum of those two vectors.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.360
So it's going to equal the
transformation T applied to

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.160
the inverse of a plus
T-inverse of b.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.130
I just use the fact that T
is linear to get here.

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:04.960
Now what can I do?

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.130
Let me let me simplify
everything that I've written

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:08.840
right here.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.660
So I now have-- let
me rewrite this.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.160
This thing up here, which is
the same thing as this.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:23.290
T, the composition of T, with
T-inverse, applied to a plus b

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:27.350
is equal to the composition--
or actually not the

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:34.450
composition, just T-- applied to
two vectors, T-inverse of a

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:38.680
plus T-inverse of vector b.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.700
That's what we've
gotten so far.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.220
Now we're very close to proving
that this condition is

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.790
true for T-inverse, if we can
just get rid of these T's.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:50.740
Well the best way to get rid
of those T's is to take the

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.080
composition with T-inverse
on both sides.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.180
Or take the T-inverse
transformation of both sides

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.095
of this equation.

00:09:57.095 --> 00:09:58.910
So let's do that.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:02.300
So let's take T-inverse of this
side, T-inverse of that

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:06.030
side, should be equal to
T-inverse of this side.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:07.620
Because these two things
are the same thing.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.950
So if you put the same thing
into a function, you should

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.410
get the same value
on both sides.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.470
So what is this thing on
the left-hand side?

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.970
What is this?

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.640
This is the composition-- let me
write it this way-- this is

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:24.650
the composition of T-inverse
with T, that part, applied to

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.210
this thing right here.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.160
I'm just changing the
associativity of this--

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:36.070
applied to T-inverse of the
vector a plus the vector b.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.640
That's what this left
hand side is.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.795
This part right here, T-inverse
of T of this, these

00:10:42.795 --> 00:10:45.090
first two steps I'm just writing
as a composition of

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:50.240
T-inverse with T applied
to this right here.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.590
That right there is the same
thing as that right there.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.580
So that was another
way to write that.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:59.280
And so that is going to be equal
to the composition of

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.730
T-inverse with T-- I'll write
that in the same color-- a

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:05.330
composition of T-inverse
with T.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.470
That's this part right here,
which is very similar to that

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:16.900
part right there-- of this stuff
right here, of T-inverse

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:22.150
of a plus T-inverse
of the vector b.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:27.460
Now by definition of what
T-inverse is, what is this?

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.480
This is the identity
transformation on our domain.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.910
This is the identity
transformation on Rn.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:37.690
This is also the identity
transformation on Rn.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:41.100
So if you apply the identity
transformation to anything,

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.070
you're just going
to get anything.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:45.480
So this is going to be equal
to-- I'll do it on both sides

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.380
of the equation-- this whole
expression on the left-hand

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:54.360
side is going to simplify to the
T-inverse of the vectors a

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.250
plus the vector b.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:57.530
And the right-hand side
is just going to

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:59.190
simplify to this thing.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:01.050
Is equal to-- because this
is just the identity

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:04.830
transformation-- so it's just
equal this one, T-inverse of

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:09.660
the vector a plus T-inverse
of the vector b.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:13.460
And just like that, T-inverse
has met its first condition

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:14.860
for being a linear
transformation.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.636
Now let's see if we can do
the second condition.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.010
Let's do the same
type of thing.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:32.850
Let's take the composition of
T with T-inverse, let's take

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:38.740
the composition of that on some
vector, let's call it ca.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:39.850
Just like that.

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:41.790
Well we know what this is equal
to, this is equal to the

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:44.090
identity transformation on Rn.

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:48.510
So this is just going
to be equal to ca.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:50.575
Now what is a equal to?

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:57.070
What is this thing right there--
I'll write it on the

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.710
side right here, let me do it
in an appropriate color.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:04.620
Or we could say that a, the
vector a is equal to the

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.450
transformation T with the
composition of T with

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:12.790
T-inverse applied
to the vector a.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:14.950
Because this is just the
identity transformation.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:17.840
So we can rewrite this
expression here as being equal

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:27.410
to c times the composition of
T with T-inverse applied

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:31.440
to my vector a.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.830
And maybe it might be nice to
rewrite it in this form

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:36.620
instead of this composition
form.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.690
So this left expression we can
just write as T of the

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:45.020
T-inverse of c times the
vector a-- all I did is

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:49.520
rewrite this left-hand side this
way-- is equal to this

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.510
green thing right here.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:51.620
Well I'll rewrite similarly.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:57.080
This is equal to c times the
transformation T applied to

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:01.690
the transformation T-inverse
applied to a.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:06.400
This is by definition what
composition means.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.950
Now T is a linear
transformation.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:17.190
Which means that if you take c
time T times some vector, that

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:22.050
is equivalent to T times c times
T applied to c times

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:22.520
that vector.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.130
This is one of the conditions
in your transformation.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.980
So this is always going
to be the case with T.

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.860
So if this is some vector
that T is applying to,

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:31.890
this is some scalar.

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.180
So this thing, because we
know that T is a linear

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:39.680
transformation, we can rewrite
as being equal to T applied to

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:44.110
the scalar c times T-inverse
applied to a.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.790
And now what can we do?

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.560
Well let's apply the T-inverse
transformation to

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.400
both sides of this.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.190
Let me rewrite it.

00:14:53.190 --> 00:15:02.580
On this side we get T of
T-inverse of ca is equal to T

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:07.080
of c times T-inverse times a.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.500
That's what we have so far.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.850
But wouldn't it be nice
if we could get rid

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:10.960
of these outer T's?

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.980
And the best way to do that
is to take the T-inverse

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.230
transformation of both sides.

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:17.850
So let's do that.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:22.440
T-inverse-- let's take that of
both sides of this equation,

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.850
T-inverse of both sides.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.300
And another way that this
could be written.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.130
This is equal into the
composition of T-inverse with

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:38.090
T applied to T-inverse applied
to c times our vector a.

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:41.050
This right here, I just decided
to keep writing it in

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:43.140
this form, and I took these two
guys out and I wrote them

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:44.560
as a composition.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.590
And this on the right-hand side,
you can do something

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:47.610
very similar.

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:49.630
You could say that this is equal
to the composition of

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:54.820
T-inverse with T times--
or not times,

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.380
let me be very careful.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:59.060
Taking this composition, this
transformation, and then

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:06.680
taking that transformation
on c times the inverse

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.390
transformation applied to a.

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.660
Let me be very clear
what I did here.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.710
This thing right here is
this thing right here.

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:15.710
This thing right here is
this thing right here.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:20.440
And I just rewrote this
composition this way.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:24.000
And the reason why I did this
is because we know this is

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.060
just the identity transformation
on Rn, and this

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:31.540
is just the identity
transformation on Rn.

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.880
So the identity transformation
applied to anything is just

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.940
that anything.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:40.360
So this equation simplifies to
the in T-inverse applied to c

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:45.070
times some vector a, is equal
to this thing, c times

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.660
T-inverse times some vector a.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:51.370
And just like that, we've met
our second condition for being

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.630
a linear transformation.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:58.070
The first condition
was met up here.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:58.870
So now we know.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:02.130
And in both cases, we use the
fact that T was a linear

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:05.630
transformation to get to the
result for T-inverse.

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:13.880
So now we know that if T is a
linear transformation, and T

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:25.710
is invertible, then T-inverse
is also a linear

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:26.960
transformation.

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.480
Which might seem like a little
nice thing to know, but that's

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.730
actually a big thing to know.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:37.250
Because now we know that
T-inverse can be represented

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.580
as a matrix vector product.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:44.270
That means that T-inverse
applied to some vector x could

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:48.330
be represented as the product
of some matrix times x.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.090
And what we're going to do is,
we're going to call that

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:56.230
matrix the matrix a-inverse.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:58.900
And I haven't defined as well
how do you construct this

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.890
a-inverse matrix, but we
know that it exists.

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:05.870
We know this exists now,
because T is a linear

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:07.000
transformation.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.060
And we can take it even
a step further.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:14.090
We know by the definition of
invertibility that the

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:19.710
composition of T-inverse with
T is equal to the identity

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.320
transformation on Rn.

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:26.280
Well what is a composition?

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.870
We know that T, if we take--
let me put it this way.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:35.730
We know that T of x
is equal to Ax.

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:40.710
So if we write T-inverse, the
composition of T-inverse with

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:48.350
T applied to some vector x is
going to be equal to first, A

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:51.380
being applied to x is going
to be equal to Ax, this

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.960
a right here, Ax.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.300
And then you're going to apply
A inverse-x, you're going to

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.140
apply this right here.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.190
And we got that this is the
equivalent to-- when you take

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:06.810
the composition, it's equivalent
to, or your

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:10.160
resulting transformation matrix
of two composition

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.700
transformations is equal to this
matrix matrix product.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.840
We got that a long time ago.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.170
In fact that was the motivation
for how a matrix

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:18.770
matrix product was defined.

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:20.680
But what's interesting here is,
this composition is equal

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:26.610
to that, but it's also equal to
the identity transformation

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:30.170
on Rn applied to that vector
x, which is equal to the

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.600
identity matrix applied to x.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.250
Right?

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:37.380
That is the n by n matrix, so
when you multiply by anything,

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.200
you get that anything again.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.740
So we get a very interesting
result.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:47.460
A-inverse times A has to be
equal to the identity matrix.

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:51.350
A-inverse, or the matrix
transformation for T-inverse,

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:54.410
when you multiply that with the
matrix transformation for

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:59.580
T, you're going to get
the identity matrix.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.660
And the argument actually
holds both ways.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.640
So we know this is true, but
the other definition of an

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.650
inverse, or invertibility, told
us that the composition

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:12.390
of T with T-inverse is equal to
the identity transformation

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:15.480
in our codomain, which
is also Rn.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.380
iRn.

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:19.500
So by the exact same argument,
we know that when you go the

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.430
other way, if you apply
T-inverse first and then you

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:26.460
apply T-- so that's equivalent
of saying apply T-inverse

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:31.150
first, and then you apply T
to some x vector, that's

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:35.280
equivalent to multiplying that
x vector by the identity

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.260
matrix, the n by n
identity matrix.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.500
Or you could say, you could
switch the order.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:45.590
A times A-inverse is also equal
to the identity matrix.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:47.710
Which is neat, because we
learned that matrix matrix

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:50.140
products, when you switch the
order they don't normally

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.260
always equal each other.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.140
But in the case of an invertible
matrix and its

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.840
inverse, order doesn't matter.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.920
You can take A-inverse times A
and get the identity matrix,

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.140
or you could take A times
A-inverse and get

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.490
the identity matrix.

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.910
Now we've gotten this far, the
next step is to actually

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:07.220
figure out how do
you construct.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:09.010
We know that this thing exists,
we know that the

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:11.350
inverse is a linear
transformation, that this

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:12.220
matrix exists.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.360
We see this nice property,
that when you multiply it

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.530
times the transformation
matrix you get

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:18.940
the identity matrix.

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.820
The next step is to actually
figure out how to

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.330
figure this guy out.
