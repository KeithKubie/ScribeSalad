00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So what is kinetic energy? Well, it's ½ mv². I hope that right now you're seething.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I hope you're writhing in your chair and saying, Andy, that's not what kinetic energy is.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
That's an equation that describes kinetic energy. What is kinetic energy?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Oh, what is kinetic energy? Well, it's the energy associated with motion.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Well, I hope now you were saying something like this,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
because using energy to define kinetic energy isn't helping anything.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Well, this question has a short answer.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The short answer is, I don't know what energy is, but luckily, I know what energy does.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If you've had enough of this philosophical mumbo jumbo,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
why don't we go ahead and actually solve some problems.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We had this idea, this work energy theorem.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It says that the total work on an object is equal to it's change in kinetic energy.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and since this is the equation for kinetic energy, well the change is just this.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The F means final velocity and Vi means initial velocity.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So why don't we solve a problem that we've solved previously using motion considerations,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
but this time, let's solve it using the work energy theorem.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So, I want to know what is the ball's final velocity, if it's dropped from rest?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
You can enter your answer here, and I know I haven't actually shown you

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
how to use this equation yet but you might be able to figure it out just by looking here,

00:01:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and if you can, I think you still have the skills to answer this question.
