00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.220
So what does it mean to
be a first-class type?

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.687
It means that you can use closures just
like any other type, such as ints,

00:00:07.687 --> 00:00:09.288
floats, strings, etc.

00:00:09.288 --> 00:00:13.910
You may assign them to variables and
constants.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.450
You may put them inside arrays,
or dictionaries,

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.640
or actually any collection.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.948
You can return them from functions and
closures.

00:00:22.948 --> 00:00:27.760
And you can receive them as parameters
of another function or closure.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.230
This last part sure sounds weird, so
let's get started with the easy ones.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.930
Grab a playground, and let's play.
