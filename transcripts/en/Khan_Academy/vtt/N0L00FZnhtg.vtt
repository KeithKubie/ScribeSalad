00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.070
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.650
get a better understanding
of oligopolies.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.930
And we'll be talking
about it, oligopolies.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.460
We'll be talking about
it more in future videos.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.080
And as we've already
talked about,

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.770
this part of oligopolies,
the oligo-- and I

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.379
know I'm completely
mispronouncing

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.990
it-- comes from the
Greek word for few.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.054
And the poly comes from
the Greek word for sellers.

00:00:24.054 --> 00:00:25.470
And I don't want
to confuse anyone

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.700
because the prefix poly,
like in terms of polynomial

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.540
or polymath, when
it's a prefix poly

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.712
often means or it
does mean many.

00:00:35.712 --> 00:00:37.670
But in this context, this
comes from the Greek.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.440
And once again, I know I'm
mispronouncing it, poll-e-in,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.100
I think, or polein, which
actually comes from seller.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.250
So this means few sellers.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.920
And what's interesting
about oligopolies

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.620
are that they can sometimes
act much more like monopolies

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.540
if they coordinate.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.620
Or they can still, even if
there are few sellers, even

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.570
two sellers, they can compete
fiercely and look much closer

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.280
to perfect competition.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.740
So an example is
if they-- so let's

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.274
say there are these
few competitors.

00:01:04.274 --> 00:01:06.190
And let's say they
coordinate with each other.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.330
They say, hey, look, we're going
to be-- because there's a few

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.000
of, enough of them, that they
can coordinate-- they say, hey,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.500
look.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.240
Why don't we restrict quantity
so that we can raise price?

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.910
And then we're
essentially maximizing

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.730
our collective economic profit.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.520
So they are agreeing
to coordinate.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.870
And this is illegal, within
the context of most countries.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.870
Most companies are not allowed
to do this in most countries.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.260
But when this is
going on, this kind

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.280
of coordination between the
players in an oligopoly, this

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.175
is called collusion.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.990
Or we were saying that
they are colluding.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.190
And if they have a formal
agreement to collude,

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:55.400
we call these players right over
here, we call them a cartel.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.300
And they're approaching,
their behavior,

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.519
is much closer to a monopoly.

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:03.060
They're essentially
trying, at least,

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.700
to act together like a monopoly.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.919
And at the most famous of
all of the cartels is OPEC.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.700
You sometimes hear
about the drug cartel.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.779
I'm not an expert there.

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:14.320
I guess, that's
implying that there's

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.110
some form of coordination there,
some form of price setting,

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.050
some form of
quantity restriction.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.740
But the most famous,
and maybe the one

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.190
with the largest
impact, is OPEC.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.640
And OPEC stands for Organization
of Petroleum Exporting

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.630
Countries.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:39.320
And it's a group of 12 countries
that collectively control 79%--

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.320
this is as of 2012-- that
collectively control 79%

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.780
of the world's oil reserves.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.850
So oil reserves
are the actual oil

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.502
that's in the ground or the oil
that we know is in the ground.

00:02:52.502 --> 00:02:54.960
Obviously there's other oil
that we don't know where it is,

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.918
but it's in the ground.

00:02:55.918 --> 00:02:58.540
But this is 79% of
the oil that we're

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.630
aware of that is in the ground.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.730
And they control about 44%
of the production, of oil

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.870
production, of current
oil production.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.390
So in a given month, 44%
of all the oil in the world

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.099
is coming from these
OPEC countries.

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.390
And they're predominately
countries in the Middle East,

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.880
but they now include
countries that

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.460
are outside of the Middle East.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.480
And they have a
formal agreement where

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.150
they try to restrict
output so that they

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.360
can get the price to whatever
price they want it to be.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.810
So they are at least
attempting to act somewhat

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.900
like a monopoly.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.740
They don't control all
of the oil reserves.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.800
They don't control all
of the oil production.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.410
But by coordinating it they
can act like a bigger player

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.220
than they are individually.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.960
But what we'll see
in future videos

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.110
is that even though it
is good, collectively,

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.064
for them to do this-- for
them to coordinate it this way

00:03:48.064 --> 00:03:49.730
and it can't be
illegal, because they're

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.521
all countries coordinating
with each other.

00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:53.170
So no one can say,
hey, what you're

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.550
doing is illegal because
they are essentially

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.572
acting outside of any
one country's laws.

00:03:58.572 --> 00:04:00.030
But what we'll see
in the future is

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.950
that there's a huge incentive
for any one of these 12

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.240
countries to break the
agreement secretly.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.350
To say, OK, I'm going to
restrict quantity just

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.940
like all the rest of you
guys but then secretly keep

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.630
producing more and getting
that higher price that

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.117
is being achieved because
everyone else is restricted.

00:04:17.117 --> 00:04:19.700
So it's actually very hard, even
if you have formal agreement,

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.460
to maintain discipline
within a cartel.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.140
Now that was an example
of trying to coordinate,

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.710
trying to be collude, trying
to become more like a monopoly.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.750
There are many, many
cases of oligopolies,

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.740
at least as far as I know,
that are fiercely, fiercely

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.640
competitive.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.590
Probably the most famous
of them are Coke and Pepsi.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.510
So this would, I guess, fall
under the sugar water market.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.730
They both take
water, and they place

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.690
a lot of sugar in
that water, and then

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.480
they spend millions,
or maybe even

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.740
billions in some
circumstances, on marketing

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.380
to make you convinced
that somehow

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.610
that sugar in that water will
make you cool, or trendy,

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.870
or you'll have more friends,
or you'll be better looking,

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.070
or whatever else.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.590
But they are
fiercely competitive.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.650
These-- they could
coordinate and say, hey,

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.190
let's raise the price of
12 ounces of sugar water

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.895
to $1 or $5, and if you
do it, I'll do it as well.

00:05:17.895 --> 00:05:18.520
But they don't.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.300
They compete fiercely on price.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.650
They compete fiercely
on marketing.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.060
And that's actually where
they really, really, compete.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.220
And this is actually a
special case of an oligopoly

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.124
where you only have two
players, two major players.

00:05:30.124 --> 00:05:31.540
And this you would
call a duopoly.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.650
Other examples of
duopoly, you could

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.680
imagine Boeing and Airbus.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.190
If you fly on a commercial
aircraft, especially

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.990
a new commercial
aircraft, and especially

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.060
a large commercial
aircraft, it is

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.330
going to be either a Boeing
aircraft or an Airbus aircraft.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.810
Boeing is the US manufacturer.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.810
Airbus is the
European manufacturer.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.830
And although Boeing
is always complaining

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.580
that Airbus is getting support
from the European Union,

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.410
and Airbus is always complaining
that Boeing is getting support

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.370
from the US, they do compete
quite fiercely on price.

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.340
They're both wining and dining
countries and airlines that

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.480
are looking to buy new
planes, or whatever.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.610
Other examples of
oligopolies that

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.960
are more competitive, especially
more competitive than something

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.220
like OPEC-- you have
something like the airlines.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.630
Just going with that airplane
theme, you have the airlines.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.500
In fact, I gave
airlines as an example

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.550
of an industry that
seems to behave

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.670
in a kind of perfectly
competitive way.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.600
A seat, an economy class
seat on most airlines

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.430
is fairly undifferentiated.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.530
There's a lot of very good
price information in the airline

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.620
industry, better than in
almost every industry.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.620
But you do have not
too many competitors.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.284
They're all aware of each other.

00:06:50.284 --> 00:06:51.700
They all know each
other's prices.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.060
To some degree, they're
looking at each other's prices

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.439
to figure out what their
own prices should be.

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:58.730
It's not like they have a
million competitors out there

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.510
and they can't keep
track of everyone.

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.610
So airlines, they're
not a duopoly-- so

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:03.610
let me make a line here.

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.020
Airlines are not a duopoly
but they are definitely

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.000
an example of an oligopoly
where the market is

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.669
approaching perfect competition.

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:13.460
And there's others.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.350
You could have something like
the credit card networks.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:24.390
You have Visa, MasterCard,
and American Express.

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.740
And really these first
two are the dominant ones.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.955
But once again, very few players
and they are not coordinating,

00:07:30.955 --> 00:07:35.160
or at least we don't know
they're coordinating.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.720
And so they are competing.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.990
But there have been
cases of companies,

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.220
especially in oligopolies,
where all of a sudden someone

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.940
does find out that there's some
type of a back room deal where

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.720
they say, hey, why don't
we coordinate and not raise

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.430
our production?

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.790
Or we keep our prices
high and both of us

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:54.800
kind of hold that discipline?

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.806
And that's where
the governments have

00:07:56.806 --> 00:07:58.430
to get involved, and
regulate, and make

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.450
sure that between
parties that there really

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.270
isn't this type of thing.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.470
Because from most
governments' point of view,

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.820
they want to push the
parties out there as

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.154
close to perfect
competition as possible.

00:08:12.154 --> 00:08:14.570
And we've seen, the closer you
get to perfect competition,

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.480
the further away you get from
being a monopoly, the more

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.140
efficient production you have.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.350
The larger total
surplus you have,

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.570
and the more of that total
surplus goes to the consumers.
