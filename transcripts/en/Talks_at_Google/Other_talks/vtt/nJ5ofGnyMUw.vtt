TANYA: Thanks,
everybody, for coming.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.260
My first interaction with Eric
at the recent Wildlife Center

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.490
Summit was-- there was a speaker
speaking about technology

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.220
to help rhinos for
rhino conservation.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.750
And he was correcting a speaker
while they were talking.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.540
And every few minutes, he
had a more official statistic

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.770
to give to this speaker.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.320
And I was like,
this guy is amazing.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.920
He really knows his rhinos.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.070
So I'd like to welcome
Dr. Eric Dinerstein.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.440
He's the Director of the
Biodiversity and Wildlife

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.200
Solutions Program at RESOLVE.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.230
He focuses on applying
new technologies

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.320
to better protect and
monitor endangered wildlife.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.630
For much of the
past 25 years, he

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.760
was the Chief Scientist at
the World Wildlife Fund.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.770
Beginning in 1975,
he conducted studies

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.010
of tigers and their prey,
and led conservation programs

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.150
for large mammals, such as
greater one-horned rhinoceros

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.140
and tigers with the
National Zoo's Terai Ecology

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.470
Project in Nepal.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.370
Along with Dr. David Olson,
he's the Co-Architect

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.120
of the Global 200 Terrestrial
Eco Regions of the world.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.100
And Dr. Eric Wikramanayake,
mapped tiger conservation

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.170
landscapes, designed
the Terai Arc Landscape

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.900
in Nepal and India, and came up
with the idea of a Global Tiger

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.410
Summit staged in November
2010 to double the wild tiger

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.680
population in the world.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.570
He has conservation
experience in many countries

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.580
and has published
wildly and widely

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.200
on biodiversity, eco regions,
and large mammal biology.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.510
His most recent effort is to
promote the concept popularized

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.000
by Dr. E.O. Wilson
of Nature Needs Half,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.360
setting aside half of the
earth's terrestrial eco regions

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.620
to save a living planet
and avoid the extinction

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.410
and climate crises.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.400
He's published over a hundred
papers in scientific journals

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.440
and has co-authored
several books

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.660
on conservation
assessments of eco regions

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.840
around the world,
a scientific book

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.300
on rhinos, two
popular science books.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.470
And most recently, a novel
for children and adults

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.990
called "What Elephants Know."

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.200
Please join me in welcoming
Dr. Eric Dinerstein to Google.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.158
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.540
ERIC DINERSTEIN: Thank
you so much, Tanya.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.390
And it's great to be here.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.370
What I'm going to try
to do in my short talk

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.190
is to give you a
sense of what it

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.440
was like to be-- a long
time ago-- 21 years old

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.889
and to be sent to the
wildest place on earth.

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.930
And to have the adventure
of my lifetime, which I

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.630
tried to capture in this novel.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.560
And also, to make all
of you tiger experts.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.220
I'm going to condense 45
years of tiger research

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.370
into about five minutes.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.120
So you're going to
leave here knowing more

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.820
about tigers than 99% of all
the biologists in the world.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.990
And then also, for those
of you who have not

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.970
gotten a PhD in
conservation biology,

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.180
I'm going to summarize
the whole discipline

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.470
in about two sentences.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.160
So I'll save you that heartache,
too, of getting a new degree.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.260
So in 1975, I had the
unbelievable good luck,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.430
good fortune, of being sent
to the country of Nepal.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.420
The kingdom of
Nepal at the time.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.960
And I got my information packet.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.520
And in it was information--
and I loved the idea of Nepal.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.030
I had just finished my
undergraduate degree.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.820
And I loved-- it was
in Washington state.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.960
And I loved climbing mountains.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.320
And I thought, fantastic.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.220
I'm going to Nepal, the
country of Mount Everest.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.470
I'll live with Sherpas.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.290
I'll study Tibetan Buddhism,
and maybe I'll never come back.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.230
And then I got the
information packet.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.270
And in it were
pictures of things

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.440
like elephants, and
tigers, and rhinos.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.630
And I knew enough
about biogeography

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.150
to know that, oh, these probably
don't live in the Himalayas.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.700
They are flat-land
creatures, for the most part.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.650
Although, tigers do go up to
timberline in some places.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.160
But I wasn't prepared
that I was actually

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.420
going to a part of Nepal
that I didn't know existed

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.500
called the Terai,
the flat lowlands.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.269
It's the extension
of the Gangetic Plain

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.926
that is only 600 feet elevation.

00:04:20.926 --> 00:04:22.300
And this gives
you a sense of it.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.536
So here it is.

00:04:24.536 --> 00:04:25.910
This is from
Chitwan, but this is

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.290
sort of like to where
Bardiya where I was sent,

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.400
with the elephant grasses.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.402
This is about 600
feet elevation.

00:04:35.402 --> 00:04:37.110
These are the world's
tallest grasslands.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.792
They get to be 25 feet tall.

00:04:38.792 --> 00:04:40.500
So you need elephants
to get through them

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.730
or you walk
carefully, either way.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.720
And then behind it, Mount
Annapurna at 26,000 feet

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.120
collapsed in only
about 60 miles.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.190
So this is probably the only
place in the world you can be

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.670
sitting on an elephant with
a rhino in front of you with

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.800
26,000-foot peaks
in the background.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.430
And I thought somehow if I
could capture this experience,

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.380
it would be great.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.260
But mostly, I
wrote in a journal.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.890
Getting out here was
really interesting.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.220
It was 1975.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.470
There was no road
across lowland Nepal.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.490
And so we tried taking
a Jeep on dirt tracks.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.080
And the monsoon had
just started when most

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.820
of the rain of the year falls.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.380
And we got about 10
miles towards the reserve

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.630
and we got stuck in a river,
had to winch our way out.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.212
So we tried a different
route, got stuck again

00:05:30.212 --> 00:05:32.170
in another river, and
had to winch our way out.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.090
And we just gave up and
said, you know what?

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.660
Let's go back to the main city.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.740
You're going to have to wait for
your vehicle to get you there.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.090
It's going to be an elephant.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.810
So I went on a 50-mile trek on
an elephant to get to my post.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.930
And one of the reasons why I
called the book "What Elephants

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.240
Know--" the novel-- is that
I'm convinced that elephants

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.660
know a lot more than people
about a lot of things

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.600
in the world.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.970
And one of them was when we
got to the edge of a river

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.440
like this, except it was a
flooding torrent with trees

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.940
coming down, like toothpicks
washing down the river.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.090
I knew this probably wasn't
a good idea to try to cross.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.310
But the drivers were in a
hurry to drop me off and get

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.897
back home to their stable.

00:06:09.897 --> 00:06:11.480
And so they kept
pushing the elephant.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.780
The way you drive
an elephant is you

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.644
kick behind the ears, which
is like the gas pedal.

00:06:16.644 --> 00:06:18.810
And they kept driving it,
driving it into the water.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.520
And this is an older female.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.070
And she didn't want to go in.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.440
She tried to shake us off,
but they kept pushing.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.780
And she was up to her toenails,
and then up to her elbows.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.370
And then, up to her shoulders.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.940
In the next instant,
we were swept away.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.100
Next slide.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.580
It's going much
faster than that.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.121
And that wasn't my
elephant, but just

00:06:39.121 --> 00:06:40.800
to remember what it was like.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.110
It turns out we had
crossed in the wrong place.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.630
Elephants, fortunately,
are very good swimmers.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:47.250
Very buoyant.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.490
So she swam back to shore.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.390
We got out.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.477
And I asked some locals.

00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:52.310
They said, oh, yeah.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.630
You crossed in the wrong place.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:54.890
You should have gone up here.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.430
And wait till the sun rises
higher and the river level

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.730
will go down and you can cross.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:59.710
So I made it.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.190
I got to my post, and then
had the greatest adventure

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:03.690
of my life.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.880
And I thought, well,
somehow if I could hark back

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.190
to that first experience
of trying to get to my post

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:12.390
and put that in a novel, it
might be a fun story to tell.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:16.384
As well, the way that I
studied-- my assignment

00:07:16.384 --> 00:07:18.800
was really one sentence from
the head of the National Park

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.690
system in Nepal.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.270
You will go and you will
census the tiger population

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.760
and do other wildlife
surveys as is necessary.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.130
And this park,
called Bardiya-- now

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.480
called Bardiya National Park--
was first a royal hunting

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.440
reserve for the king.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.850
And one of the places set up
a newly created tiger reserve.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.970
And I was the first
biologist to go out there.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.120
And probably, the
first Westerner

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.020
to live in this area
for a long time.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.980
And Nepal had been closed to
the West for about 100 years.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.420
And the way that I was going
to try to census tigers

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.710
was to take pictures of them.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.126
Because as you'll
see in a moment,

00:07:52.126 --> 00:07:54.380
you can tell them apart
by stripes on their bodies

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.100
and other patterns.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.850
And the way to do
that would be to be

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.889
out in the jungle at dawn and
dusk and take pictures of them.

00:08:00.889 --> 00:08:02.930
And be above them where
they couldn't detect you.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:04.500
And at least 15
feet above them so

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.000
they wouldn't try to
climb the tree after you.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.750
So over the course of-- I
built a number of tree houses

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.330
with the locals helping me.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:16.402
About 13 of these scattered
along roads on routes

00:08:16.402 --> 00:08:17.360
that tigers would take.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.150
Tigers are highly territorial.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.530
And they like to
mark their territory.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.972
So the idea was if you were on
the place where tigers marked,

00:08:25.972 --> 00:08:27.680
you would be able to
take their pictures.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.720
So in the course of
spending two years there,

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.150
I spent over 120
nights in tree houses

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.169
so I could be there to
take their pictures.

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:39.710
And I guess in some way,
I became the Peace Corps

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.990
first semi-arboreal volunteer.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:46.250
Sometimes though, when I
woke up, I would see this.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.390
A tiger below me
tracking the deer

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.670
or stalking and
trying to catch them.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:54.070
And here was one of the
species they were after.

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:57.370
This is a swamp deer, a
highly endangered species,

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.760
that is only-- there's
probably about 5,000

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.450
left in a couple of parks,
but is an important prey item

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:04.960
for deer.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.350
So one of the first-- I'm
going to condense tiger biology

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:08.900
in a very short amount of time.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.600
Tigers go after large prey.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.100
They need that to survive.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.850
The swamp deer is the
ultimate tiger species.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.127
If tigers had the menu,
like you have out here,

00:09:18.127 --> 00:09:19.960
of all the different
species they could eat,

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.660
they would always pick swamp
deer because they're big

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.520
and they occur in
really big herds.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.980
And they're easier to catch.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:26.950
There just aren't
that many of them,

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:28.325
so they eat other
kinds of things

00:09:28.325 --> 00:09:30.540
that we'll see in a second.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.490
I didn't have the
chance to actually

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.962
live around elephants the
first time because there

00:09:34.962 --> 00:09:36.170
were no elephants in Bardiya.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:37.660
I did everything on foot.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.350
But when I came back later
to work with the Smithsonian,

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:44.870
we had five elephants at our
disposal for doing research.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:47.270
And I got to live with the
drivers, learned the 40

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:50.097
different elephant commands,
how to drive the elephants,

00:09:50.097 --> 00:09:51.180
how to utter the commands.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:55.390
Everything from [? agat, ?]
which means go forward.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.464
And the most important one,
[? rat, ?] which means stop.

00:09:58.464 --> 00:10:00.880
Because you have to get them
to stop sometimes if they get

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.300
scared.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.180
So I learned those.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.560
It was such a fascinating
and now declining

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.119
culture of elephant
husbandry and living

00:10:10.119 --> 00:10:11.910
near elephant stables
that I wanted to make

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.350
that part of the book as well.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.400
This is Dr. John
Seidensticker, the Dean

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.897
of Tiger Biologists in 1972.

00:10:18.897 --> 00:10:20.980
He looks a bit like Indiana
Jones in this picture,

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.870
but it's a little
different nowadays.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:23.650
He's retired now.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:26.710
But this was the first
captured tigeress--

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.966
the first radio-collared
tiger in Chitwan

00:10:29.966 --> 00:10:31.590
that I was fortunate
enough to help out

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.880
on this study in the early days.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.420
And it kind of whetted my
appetite for tiger research.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.420
But also, for now
applying technology.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.100
So this is the first time that
radio telemetry was really

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.640
being introduced in
a big way into Asia.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.040
And the important thing we
learned from this research

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.660
is that tigers are
highly territorial.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.490
And they have-- in areas
with very high prey density,

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:55.377
like in Chitwan, here they
have the smallest home ranges

00:10:55.377 --> 00:10:56.960
of tigers anywhere
in the world, where

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.380
tigers can live in an area
of about 20 square kilometers

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.710
and keep other males out.

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:05.850
And within his home
range, there may

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.880
be four females that will
have their own territories

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.510
and won't intersect at all.

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:13.000
And he'll surround those.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.600
Now, that's at one
end of the extreme.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.510
The other is the Russian Far
East with much, much more lower

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.290
prey densities, where a same
male tiger would have a home

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:23.370
range of 600 square kilometers.

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.010
So you get a sense of it
takes a lot of habitat

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.750
to maintain a healthy
population of tigers

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:31.640
when they're territorial.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.230
So one of the
things though, that

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:37.400
happened when I first moved
there and worked in Nepal,

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.590
is that the reason why these
tiger reserves were sent up

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:44.130
is because they were hunting
reserves for the royal family.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:47.140
So the kings of Nepal used
to come and shoot tigers

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.900
annually in the parks.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.140
And the quid pro quo for us is
they did set up these parks.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.440
And the rest of the year--
they only took one or two--

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.580
the tigers would recover.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.360
And so they were
doing quite well.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.290
But I thought this was
such an interesting part

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:06.700
that I timed my book to be in
1975 during one of these tiger

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.400
hunts.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.250
And I'm going to just
introduce the book to you.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:14.710
The character, my
protagonist, is a young boy

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.580
who is only 12 years old.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.650
And with some homage
to the "Jungle Book,"

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:21.940
he was found in the
jungle not by wolves,

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:25.090
but by a pack of wild
dogs, called [? dole. ?]

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:27.230
And cared for them
for a very short time

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:30.520
until he's found by the head
of an elephant stable who

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.520
has only one arm, who
lost it in a fight

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:36.250
with a tiger, who finds him in
the jungle and brings him back

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.990
and raises him as his own son.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:42.850
And they're about to go
on-- he's now 11 years old

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:47.370
and he's going on the hunt with
the king to go after a tiger.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:48.480
Chapter 1.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.600
"My mother is an
elephant and my father

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.500
is an old man with one arm.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.770
Strange, I know, but true.

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:57.830
For a short time, I was under
the care of [? dole, ?] wild

00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:59.830
dogs that live in the jungle.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.580
Before the [? dole, ?] I had
a different mother and father

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.530
who tied a red
string around my neck

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.570
and left me alone in the world.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.520
They believed the red string
would give me protection.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.110
I do not know what became of
them or why they abandoned me.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:14.680
My father is the
head of an elephant

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.300
stable in the southernmost
part of Nepal.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.410
He is called Subba-sahib,
a title of great respect

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:22.740
that everyone
uses, including me.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.360
The older drivers also
call him Old One Arm,

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.360
but never to his face.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:31.370
I also call him Father,
but only inside my head.

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:34.020
For 50 years, our
elephant stable

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.820
has been maintained by
order of the King of Nepal.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.890
Also, that once a year
the King and his family

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:43.920
can ride into the jungle on
our elephants to hunt tigers.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.030
The stable exists
in the borderlands,

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:49.390
a region far from
Kathmandu, the capital city.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.750
Our camp is at the edge
of the forest, where

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:55.610
tall trees and dense vines
push right up to our stable.

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:58.980
Our jungle is wild,
beautiful, and dangerous,

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:02.480
filled with rhinos, tigers,
leopards, crocodiles, snakes,

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.210
and every kind of bird.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:09.610
I have learned to be wary of
wild animals, but never afraid.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.570
The sight of 100 elephants
gathered together,

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.490
trumpeting, rumbling,
and snorting

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:17.390
to each other filled
everyone with excitement

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.080
to ride elephants and
hunt tigers with the King.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.280
For many, today would be
the most adventurous day

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.720
of their lives.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.770
At last, the trio of
elephants began to move.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:29.100
We crossed the [INAUDIBLE]
River by the stable

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.910
and headed off into the jungle.

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:34.100
It would be a half hour's march
West towards the great Sandbar

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.590
River to reach the Western
edge of the borderlands.

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:40.970
The familiar swaying movement of
my body riding Devi Kali-- that

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:44.880
was the name of his elephant
and his adopted mother--

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.480
and the sound of branches
breaking under her feet

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.210
calmed my nerves.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:52.210
When you ride an elephant,
you are a king, no matter

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:54.190
your rank in the world.

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:56.920
I was deep in thought when
a monkey screeched above us,

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.230
making the government
official on my elephant jump.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.410
I looked up into
the tall fig tree,

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:04.690
trying to keep from
making a sound.

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:07.580
A trio of monkeys sat
together eating figs,

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:09.305
watching us march
under their world.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.180
We entered a large,
open area in the jungle,

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.260
and I leaned over to look
for tiger tracks in the sand.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.300
The sun had climbed
higher in the sky,

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.080
and its warmth felt good
on my wet shoulders.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.240
We were 10 elephants
behind the King,

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.220
who rode on my father's lead
elephant, the great tusker

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:29.980
named [? Bim Prasad. ?]

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:32.170
Every time the elephant
turned his head,

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:34.960
his huge ivory tusks
glowed like crescent moons

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.590
in the morning sun.

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:40.040
I looked back to see the long
ribbon of elephants following.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.740
It struck me then
how lucky I was

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:46.430
to be the only 11-year-old
boy in Nepal, perhaps the only

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:51.182
11-year-old boy ever, to ride in
the hunting party of the King.

00:15:51.182 --> 00:15:52.890
When we reached the
river's main channel,

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:55.730
we crossed over to the islands
where the tall, thin Rosewood

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:57.860
trees stood staring at us.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:59.500
My father turned to me.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.060
His look told me that
he had picked up a sign.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:05.250
I stood on Devi Kali again and
saw the fresh track of a tiger

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.020
in the sand along the beach.

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:10.120
I could clearly make out
its great footprints.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.010
If you rested a
man's hat on one,

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:15.670
the print would
barely be covered.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.310
My father nodded
to us and pointed

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.300
to where he thought
the tiger was hiding.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.270
He steered [? Bim Prasad ?] to
position his majesty for his

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:26.280
shot, and signaled our driver,
[? Ramji, ?] to move Devi Kali

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.740
just behind them.

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:30.250
I saw the government official
smile for the first time

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:34.090
that morning, pleased to be
stationed so close to the king.

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:36.920
We were near enough that I
could hear my father whisper,

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.600
the tiger's tracks lead
into that patch of grass.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.750
We will wait here.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:44.180
When I give the signal, my
team will drive the tiger out.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.430
You will need to take your
shot quickly, Your Majesty.

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:49.020
King [? Virendra ?] nodded.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:52.110
My father waved his arm and
70 elephants with their riders

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:55.570
quietly fanned out to encircle
the tiger's hiding place.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:57.330
The government official
licked his lips

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:59.050
and kept his eyes
on the clearing,

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:02.510
as if he were the one
readying to take his shot.

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.910
My father handed
the King his rifle.

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:07.619
I silently prayed
to the jungle gods

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:10.210
that his majesty would miss.

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:13.010
My father whistled, signaling
for the elephants and drivers

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:14.680
to start shouting
and banging sticks

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.569
to drive the tiger
from its hiding spot.

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:20.440
The tops of the tall grasses
swayed back and forth,

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.270
from the breeze or the moving
elephants or the moving tiger,

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:24.960
we could not tell.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.440
The grass hid even the heads
of the spotters standing

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.610
on the backs of the elephants.

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:32.350
A sudden roar sent two of the
younger elephants squealing

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:35.700
in panic into the forest, their
drivers and riders bouncing

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.430
helplessly on their backs.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.560
I wanted to tell
the official that he

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:43.110
was lucky to be on my Devi
Kali who never flinched,

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:45.090
but I kept silent.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:47.560
Suddenly, a tiger of
at least 300 pounds

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.890
leapt into the open
area and stopped.

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:52.610
The King hesitated, and
then raised his rifle.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:53.810
The animal turned.

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:57.020
And right away, I recognized
the one we called [? Tutchi. ?]

00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:00.160
Instead of shutting my eyes,
as my father had told me,

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.610
I leaped up and hurled
my small hand ax

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:05.890
straight at the tigress, and
shouted at the top of my voice,

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:07.503
run, [? Tutchi, ?] run."

00:18:07.503 --> 00:18:09.700
And I'll stop there.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.190
So you have to
read it if you want

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:12.950
to know what happens to him.

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:13.450
OK.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:16.420
So back with real tigers.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.740
So we've learned so much
about their biology.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:24.120
And when I finished my
PhD, I had the great chance

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.230
of coming back to Nepal with
the Smithsonian Institution

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:30.070
to lead the Tiger Ecology
Project where we studied

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:31.720
rhinos as well as tigers.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.810
So another first.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:36.454
This is us in 1996
capturing the first greater

00:18:36.454 --> 00:18:37.370
one-horned rhinoceros.

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:40.330
And here, we have attached
the blue belt is a radio

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:43.330
collar, where we learned a
great deal about their behavior

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:44.759
as well.

00:18:44.759 --> 00:18:45.800
This is not a dead tiger.

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.740
It's a live tiger
that's been immobilized.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.380
So people think that the
largest tigers in the world

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.960
live in the Russian Far East.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.380
The so-called Siberian tigers.

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:54.710
They're all one species.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:56.200
But that's not true.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.540
The largest tigers
in the world live

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.370
in the parts of where
this novel takes

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:02.150
place in the Nepalese Terai.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:04.759
This male that we captured was
over-- we couldn't weigh it.

00:19:04.759 --> 00:19:06.300
It was over the
weight of our scales.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.620
It was at least 560 pounds.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:12.297
So the tigers in
the Siberian part--

00:19:12.297 --> 00:19:14.380
it's not really Siberia,
but the Russian Far East.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:17.004
They're just bigger and fluffier
because they live in the snow.

00:19:17.004 --> 00:19:20.070
But if you took the body
mass of the males on average,

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:22.540
the ones in this part of
Nepal in Northern India

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:26.400
are much bigger than-- or
bigger than the ones in Russia.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.570
So you can get a sense--
they are the world's largest

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:31.092
predators.

00:19:31.092 --> 00:19:32.800
And this one, you can
see just for scale.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:36.710
There are three Nepalese behind
trying to hold the head up.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:37.990
Now, what they eat.

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:39.650
This is not a good idea.

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:41.490
So here's another
piece of technology.

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:43.250
You can see the
infrared camera trap

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:46.810
in the middle there taking the
picture of this tiger closing

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.352
in on an Asian or
Indian porcupine.

00:19:49.352 --> 00:19:51.310
It looks very similar to
the African porcupine.

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:53.950
And often, when tigers
become-- the rare times

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:56.000
they become man-eaters,
it's because they

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.100
have attacked a
porcupine and get shot up

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.850
in their paws and jaws with
quills and can't get them out

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:02.020
and can't feed.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:05.100
So a better choice-- and this
is not a good one either.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.760
This is a tiger
with a sloth bear.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.200
The sloth bears also
figure into my novel.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.980
You'll read about
them if you read it.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.960
Very aggressive bear that
either comes right at you

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.520
or runs away.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:20.230
They live on termites and
ants and honey and fruit.

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:22.260
But you can see
the claws on them.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.190
They're quite ferocious.

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.670
This is a better choice
of food for the tiger.

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.850
This is the sambar,
the Indian forest deer.

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:32.180
And this is the
right-sized body shape

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:35.370
and less aggressive
as a prey item.

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:38.830
So tigers feed
mostly on swamp deer.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:42.020
On sambar deer
across their range.

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:46.050
And they need to eat-- a
breeding female tigress needs

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:50.020
to eat about one sambar a week,
or something equivalent in body

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.250
mass to be able to reproduce.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:54.830
So that's a very important
piece of tiger biology

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:57.130
that we learned in the
course of this work.

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:58.630
Less than that and
they won't breed.

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:00.110
They'll still stay
alive, but they

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:02.630
need that much energy
to produce more tigers.

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:05.202
Just to give you a sense of
scale to how big tigers are,

00:21:05.202 --> 00:21:06.410
I just found this on the web.

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:09.280
Somebody took this recently
in one of the Indian parks.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.910
But here's a leopard
in comparison

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:12.122
with the size of the tiger.

00:21:12.122 --> 00:21:13.580
One of the things
we've learned too

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:16.410
is that where tigers
are really dense,

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.090
leopards tend to be scarce.

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:21.254
So leopards tend to occupy more
of the edges of tiger ranges

00:21:21.254 --> 00:21:22.920
and areas close to
villages because they

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.690
eat a wide variety of things.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.190
Leopards could live on
small birds, rodents

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:28.740
if they had to,
where a tiger never

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:31.780
could eat anything smaller
than pretty much a wild boar

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:32.700
and still be breeding.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:36.220
But you can see the tremendous
size difference there.

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.380
Tigers have declined
dramatically

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.280
across their range.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:43.040
The biologist that I
showed the picture of,

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.500
Dr. John Seidensticker,
early on in 1972,

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.080
he was sitting in
my office about--

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.180
oh, about eight years ago.

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:51.596
And I said, John,
what we're doing

00:21:51.596 --> 00:21:52.880
is not working for tigers.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.410
Their numbers are going down.

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:56.790
We thought there were
probably no more than 3,200

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:57.910
left in the wild.

00:21:57.910 --> 00:21:59.620
To put that in
perspective, there

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.850
is more tigers alive in private
hands in the state of Texas

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:04.180
than there is in the wild.

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.680
And so we thought, OK, what
are the two things that we

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:11.390
need to do to try and
dramatically recover the tiger

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:12.000
population?

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.510
And one is to get
support of government

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:16.970
at the highest levels,
the heads of state.

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:18.650
And then, to
mobilize an order of

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:21.450
magnitude more resources
for tiger conservation.

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:23.990
So we came up with the idea
for the first-ever Global Tiger

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:26.394
Summit, which was
hosted by Vladimir Putin

00:22:26.394 --> 00:22:28.310
back in the days when
he was the good Vladimir

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:30.440
Putin in Saint Petersburg.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.620
And we had the heads of state
of the 13 tiger range states.

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:34.800
Most of them had come.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:38.660
And sign a declaration to
double the number of wild tigers

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.539
by 2022, which is the
next year of the tiger.

00:22:41.539 --> 00:22:43.955
So 2010 was the year of the
tiger in the Chinese calendar.

00:22:43.955 --> 00:22:48.100
'22, the next year of the tiger.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:53.200
So the idea was in 12 years, to
try and go from 3,200 to 6,500

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.780
across the range.

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:57.780
And so that became
shortened to instead

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:01.440
of double the wild tiger
population between 2010

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.640
to 2022 as T times 2, a
shorthand, which people

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.320
have now bought into.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.220
And we've made
remarkable progress.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:12.610
So tigers and wolves--
another very important point

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:15.510
of tiger biology-- are
the two top predators

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:18.410
that can breed as fast or
faster than their prey.

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:22.640
So if there's enough prey there,
like the sambar, the wild boar,

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.150
that are out there for--
swamp deer for tigers to eat.

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:28.140
They can potentially
have a litter every year

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.530
with four to five cubs in it.

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:31.140
So they can recover
very quickly.

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:33.450
Tigers are basically
very big cats

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:35.149
that just breed like crazy.

00:23:35.149 --> 00:23:36.690
They give them
contraceptives in zoos

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:38.330
to keep them from breeding.

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:41.210
So if we just protect their
habitat, provide enough prey,

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:43.630
stop the poaching,
they come roaring back.

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:45.770
And that's basically
what we've found.

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:47.504
This is a totally
gratuitous slide.

00:23:47.504 --> 00:23:49.170
Nothing to do with
the rest of my topic,

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:50.584
I just love these [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:50.584 --> 00:23:51.750
They're not even crocodiles.

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:53.500
They're ancient
crocodilians that

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.450
also live in where
this novel takes place.

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:58.450
It was one of the last
strongholds of the world.

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:00.520
There's only a few places
left where they live.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.689
They get to be 20 feet long.

00:24:02.689 --> 00:24:04.230
They only eat fish,
so you don't have

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:06.690
to worry about them,
like Nile crocodiles.

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:08.010
Back to the tigers.

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:11.760
So if we are able to
protect enough area,

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.050
then we can see this doubling.

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:18.150
And I'll get to how we're
tracking that in a moment.

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:20.760
The same thing is true with
rhinos that I was studying,

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:24.180
is their population-- there's
about 2,900 individuals left.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:27.590
There's five species of rhinos,
about 25,000 left in the world.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:30.020
They are under tremendous
pressure from poachers.

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:33.770
But Nepal has done an
unbelievably magnificent job

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:36.237
of protecting their tigers,
elephants, and rhinos.

00:24:36.237 --> 00:24:37.820
In the last three
years, there has not

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.350
been a single one
poached in Nepal.

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:44.790
And tiger numbers have gone up
by 61% in the last five years

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:46.690
from the two
censuses we've done.

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:48.870
Rhinos by 31%.

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:52.310
In India, the tigers have
gone up by 30% as well.

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:54.840
So in some countries, we're
making tremendous progress

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:59.004
on our goal towards T times 2.

00:24:59.004 --> 00:25:00.920
One of the species that's
not doing very well,

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:04.087
this is the Sumatran rhino,
the second most endangered

00:25:04.087 --> 00:25:05.170
large mammal in the world.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:06.503
The first being the [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:06.503 --> 00:25:08.680
There's probably only
100 left scattered

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.350
around parts of Sumatra.

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:12.120
This is one that's
a few days old.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.860
They're very primitive
rhinos, the most ancient.

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:17.510
These are kind of hairy-like
coconuts when they are born.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:19.550
They had this shaggy fur.

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:21.880
They had been bred in
captivity in a Cincinnati Zoo.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.662
Unfortunately, where they had
the gorilla that was killed.

00:25:24.662 --> 00:25:26.620
But the only zoo that's
been able to breed them

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:28.680
through artificial insemination.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.776
And the strategy
here for a species

00:25:30.776 --> 00:25:33.400
like this where there are so few
is to bring them all together,

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.160
so they can breed.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.750
And we just produce more babies
than are dying in A short time

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:40.490
to be able to try to save them.

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:44.100
So a lot of my work at
Biodiversity and Wildlife

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.850
Solutions is trying--
and how I first met

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:51.310
Tanya is our work through
this Google-organized group

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:52.450
of wildlife centers.

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:56.001
And coming up with applying new
technologies to save endangered

00:25:56.001 --> 00:25:56.500
wildlife.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.280
So I'm going to talk to you
a little bit about that right

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.640
now.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.840
We're working in Africa
with a number of groups

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:06.010
to try to address head-on
the poaching crisis.

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:09.210
With elephants, we have
lost 100,000 elephants

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:10.320
over the last five years.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.760
That's one fifth of the
population of wild elephants

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.806
in a relatively short time.

00:26:14.806 --> 00:26:16.430
They're going to
disappear in the Congo

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:20.260
basin and other places unless
we are able to stop poachers

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.580
before they kill.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.370
There's a lot of
effort placed on,

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:25.400
what do we do with
like tracking the ivory

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.830
or shutting down demand?

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:28.540
And that's all
critically important.

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:31.840
But we have to be able to
stop the poachers before they

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.490
get to the animals
in the first place.

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:34.990
And there's a number
of technologies

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:38.480
we're working on that have
the promise to do that.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.990
I'm just going to
show you-- so there's

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:46.520
two parts to the aspect
of saving elephants.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.690
And one is to stop the poaching.

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:52.690
And the other is that
elephants are moving into--

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:55.217
are living in habitats
that they always lived in

00:26:55.217 --> 00:26:56.550
and people are moving into them.

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:58.860
So they're disrupting
traditional migration routes

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:00.350
and habitats of the elephants.

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:01.900
And they're planting
crops there.

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.620
So the other big
problem to solve--

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:07.000
and in fact, if you talk to most
heads of state of governments

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.710
or national parks
departments, they'll

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:11.220
tell you our biggest
problem is not poaching.

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.910
It's human-elephant conflict.

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:14.800
Of elephants coming
into crop lands,

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.700
destroying crops, killing
people, antagonizing everybody,

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.480
and then making
them very unwelcome.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.440
We all love elephants
in our country.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.740
But if you went to
Tanzania or Kenya

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.302
and talked to a
roomful of villagers,

00:27:26.302 --> 00:27:28.260
they would not be very
happy about the presence

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:29.020
of elephants.

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:30.600
So how can we resolve that?

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.630
Well, one is-- I'm going
to get to in a second,

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:35.660
is using drones to scare
elephants out of croplands.

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.780
But another aspect
of the poaching

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:42.200
is that because of
poachers being detected

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.320
by shooting elephants
with high-powered weapons,

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.960
they've gone back to the
traditional approach of killing

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.229
elephants by shooting
them with poison arrows.

00:27:50.229 --> 00:27:52.270
And then, tracking them
for days as the elephants

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:53.670
wear down and die.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:55.510
It's just horribly cruel.

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.340
And then, hack out the tusks.

00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:59.640
Hack out the ivory and move on.

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.510
This was the case of an
elephant in the Mara, part

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:05.930
of the northern extension
of the Serengeti,

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:08.210
with our colleagues and
partners, the Mara Elephant

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:12.030
Project, that was hit by
several poison arrows.

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:13.990
And how we used
drones that we're

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:16.830
using to drive elephants out
of croplands in a creative way

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:18.420
to save this elephant's life.

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:19.944
So let's watch this.

00:28:19.944 --> 00:28:20.682
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:20.682 --> 00:28:22.140
-My name is Mark
[? Golson. ?] I'll

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.030
be narrating this short film.

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:25.490
Here we see a
wounded bull elephant

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:26.490
crossing the Mara River.

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:30.490
We were able to treat
him some days later.

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:32.803
Here is a [? quadcopter ?]
David [? Olsen ?] gave me.

00:28:32.803 --> 00:28:36.924
We used this machine to move
the same bull elephant out

00:28:36.924 --> 00:28:38.840
of a water [INAUDIBLE]
some three weeks later.

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:43.214
We wanted to treat him again.

00:28:43.214 --> 00:28:45.130
ERIC DINERSTEIN: He
probably has a high fever,

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:48.504
so he's staying in
the water to cool off.

00:28:48.504 --> 00:28:50.420
It was too dangerous to
go on foot to get him.

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:53.140
-So that the vet could dart him.

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:56.900
Here he is moving along
the water [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.338
We were able to move
him into an open area.

00:28:59.338 --> 00:29:02.110
And this part of the
operation was a success.

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:12.090
The [? M99 ?] took eight
minutes to start taking effect.

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:15.230
Now, the bull is going to sleep.

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:17.720
The [INAUDIBLE]
vet team was then

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:20.980
able to move in to
start the treatment.

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:24.076
Dr. [? Linmore ?]
examines the elephant.

00:29:24.076 --> 00:29:26.230
We actually have
a metal detector

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:29.570
to check for any
foreign objects.

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:31.440
And here comes the arrowhead.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.120
It actually took three
weeks to move right the way

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.660
across his leg.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:38.350
Dr. [? Linmore ?]
flushes out the wound.

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:41.640
After administering antibiotics
and the reversal drug,

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.790
the elephant was
up and on his way.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:45.810
This operation was
made easier by the use

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:48.497
of the $500 [? quadcopter. ?]

00:29:48.497 --> 00:29:49.080
[END PLAYBACK]

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:52.440
ERIC DINERSTEIN: So
that rescue actually

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.720
was a spin-off, an
unintended consequence,

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:58.120
of using drones to drive
elephants out of croplands.

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.120
This elephant may be
thinking, oh my god, that's

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.480
the world's largest tsetse
fly, or whatever he's thinking.

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.760
But he's alert.

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.570
But in the next second,
he's about to run.

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:12.960
What we have been doing over
the last year and a half,

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.840
we've now sent an
article [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.860
the journal "Oryx"
for publication,

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:20.450
of using low-cost,
easy-to-maneuver,

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:23.650
easy-to-train [? Rangers ?]
drones, the DJI phantom,

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:27.210
the same model that went over
into the White House lawn

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:30.580
that banned drone flying in
the D.C. area for some time.

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:32.110
[INAUDIBLE] at a certain radius.

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:34.690
That we've been using this
to drive elephants out

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:35.500
of croplands.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.680
And the litmus test is
driving them out at night

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.810
when they're already in
the maize fields feeding.

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:42.970
Because just during the
daytime like this is great,

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:46.739
but the real test is when
they're destroying crops.

00:30:46.739 --> 00:30:48.280
The results are sort
of unbelievable.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.690
As a scientist,
we've done 51 trials.

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:52.740
And we've had 100% success rate.

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:55.420
Within 20 seconds, the
elephants turn and run.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.340
And we have great
videos of-- which

00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:00.310
I won't show now, but of
herds being driven away back

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:02.930
into a national park
over several kilometers

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:05.550
by this little, tiny $500 drone.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:08.060
If the drones themselves
don't scare them, attach

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:10.880
the very high-tech device
at the bottom of the drone

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.970
is a plastic bag full of chili
powder with holes poked in it.

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:16.700
And we just jiggle the drone
and out comes the chili powder.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:18.167
And they hate the
smell of chili.

00:31:18.167 --> 00:31:19.250
And that drives them away.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:20.890
We haven't had to use that yet.

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:23.530
But the reason we think
this is so effective

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:26.140
is that the propellers
make a sound very

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:29.500
similar to the frequency of
swarming angry bees or hornets.

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.730
And elephants have this
out-sized fear of bees.

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:33.200
It's not mice they're scared of.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.600
It's bees.

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.780
Maybe they're afraid
they'll fly up their trunks

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:39.600
or in their ears, but I think
this is genetically hardwired.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.930
We don't think they're going
to get habituated to this,

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:42.840
but we'll see.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.630
But we've done this now for
two different crop seasons.

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:47.160
And it's we're incredibly well.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.430
So we're now trying to scale
this to other parts of Africa.

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:52.420
Where we're going
next in two more weeks

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.500
is to Tsavo National Park.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:57.780
He mentioned, Mark [? Gos, ?]
the Sheldrick Trust.

00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.770
We're working with
them to deploy

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:01.340
these anti-poaching devices.

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:04.590
So one of the
things-- as I said,

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:07.087
we have to stop poachers
before they kill.

00:32:07.087 --> 00:32:09.420
All of the devices, the camera
traps that are out there.

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:11.860
These kind of big, bulky boxes
that are above the ground.

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:14.180
They can be camouflaged,
but sharp-eyed poachers

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:15.750
can find them and smash them.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:17.420
Elephants will smash them.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.150
Our device is a
little, tiny unit

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:21.340
that is simply above ground.

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:23.756
And the rest of it is hidden
away either underground or up

00:32:23.756 --> 00:32:24.520
in the tree.

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.670
But this can be hidden in a
fake vine in a rain forest.

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:29.980
Or you'll see in a
second, where we do it.

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:32.030
And it sends an
image of the poacher.

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:33.890
It has human detection
algorithms in it.

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:36.490
And sends out either
satellite, cell,

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:42.270
or through a long-range radio
frequency to the headquarters.

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:43.940
This is actually
smaller than this now,

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.402
but this was the
first prototype.

00:32:45.402 --> 00:32:46.610
This is just the camera head.

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:49.810
It's as big as your thumb
that sits above ground,

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:51.590
but that's cryptic and hidden.

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:54.050
And then, there's a
passive infrared beam here.

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:56.330
It's broken, wakes
up the camera.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:33:00.060
It takes the pictures,
and then sends them all.

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:02.640
Only those though,
that are humans

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.030
so that we save
energy and battery

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:06.900
life of not just
sending branches,

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:10.980
or birds, or other creatures.

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:12.960
So I'm going to
ask you now, where

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:16.354
do you think that
camera head is hidden?

00:33:16.354 --> 00:33:18.020
This is the interactive
part of my talk.

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:18.980
So is it here?

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.970
Is it in this knot?

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:25.010
Or in this knot?

00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:27.160
How many you vote for here?

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.600
Raise your hands.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.840
How about here?

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.730
How about here?

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:35.040
OK, it's a trick question.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.740
None of those.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.130
It's right there.

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:41.590
So the point being that you
could walk-- even really

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:43.590
sharp-eyed poachers would
probably walk by this.

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:46.064
And they're pretty much
going by dusk or evening

00:33:46.064 --> 00:33:47.480
and they won't be
able to find it.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.200
So it's totally cryptic.

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:52.100
The rest of the computer
is hidden down here.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.500
Don't feel bad, because even
these Kenya Wildlife Service

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.120
rangers couldn't find it either.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:59.510
So we demoed this last summer.

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:02.960
And now, with a new
version is going out there

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.750
that we're ready to
go to scale with this.

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:07.850
The other device that we
have is called AmbushCam.

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:10.790
So all those rangers, they
told us most of what we do

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:15.840
is we protect-- we go after
poachers by sending ambushes.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:16.920
We get some intelligence.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.020
We're just not
wandering aimlessly.

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:22.520
And the idea here is
that being on an ambush

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:23.505
is really dangerous.

00:34:23.505 --> 00:34:26.130
And also, really boring because
they could be for hours or days

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:29.889
on end on the trail waiting
for poachers to come down.

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:33.840
Our new idea of AmbushCam is you
put the eyeballs on the trail.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:38.550
So we have the passive
infrared sensor here.

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:41.940
We have a flare [INAUDIBLE]
camera here that

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:45.290
streams the video
to rangers who are

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:48.870
off the trail in their bivouac,
probably not talking loudly,

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:50.510
but they could be
eating, sleeping.

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:52.600
One ranger is on duty.

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.530
And he's wearing
these goggles that

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:56.710
have an earpiece in
them that sends a beep

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:58.830
if the beam is broken.

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:01.200
And then, streaming video
to see how many poachers

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.520
are coming down the trail.

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:05.640
And they can then
set the ambush.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.650
As a spin-off of
that, we've also

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:09.470
created the world's
cheapest night

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:13.140
vision goggles that we can
make, we think, for about $400.

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:15.530
Rather than the sort
of $3,000 to $4,000

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:18.570
that military-grade night
vision goggles go for.

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:20.550
With the idea being
that every ranger that

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:23.940
is out on night patrols to
protect wildlife in Africa

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:26.760
should be-- a standard equipment
should have these cheap night

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:27.410
vision goggles.

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:30.721
So we're taking those over
now to do one more prototype.

00:35:30.721 --> 00:35:32.720
And we hope to go into
production-- [EXPLOSION].

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.590
The other idea-- if we want
to go more militaristic--

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:40.900
is a very heavily-armed
group of poachers come down

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:44.410
with AK-47's, either you
can just let them go.

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:47.790
Or the next passive
infrared sensor

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:50.440
could then remotely trigger
a flashbang stun grenade.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.690
And then, disarm the poachers.

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:54.080
Because typically,
the rangers tell us

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:56.830
you often only catch
one of the poachers

00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:58.410
because the rest run away.

00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:00.520
This way, you'd be able
to-- where you're allowed

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.340
to do this-- immobilize them.

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:05.540
And then, safely disarm
them and arrest them.

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.660
So what we're trying
to do though--

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:08.990
and this is a friend of ours.

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:11.620
One of our donors at the David
Sheldrick Wildlife Trust.

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:13.370
Those of you who know
of this in Kenya,

00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:16.430
near Nairobi National Park,
they have an elephant orphanage.

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:18.650
These are all young
elephants whose mothers

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:19.980
have been poached.

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:22.520
And they take them there,
raise them, resocialize them,

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.747
and reintroduce them.

00:36:23.747 --> 00:36:25.330
We're working with
the Sheldrick Trust

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:26.530
on their anti-poaching side.

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:29.070
This is the first place
we're deploying them widely

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:32.040
with the trail guards and ambush
cams and night vision googles,

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:34.760
with the idea of not
making any more orphans.

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:37.310
So that's really our mission.

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:40.160
Very quickly, I'm just going
to talk about two more things.

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.160
So one is about--
back to tigers,

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:45.960
is the fate of tigers is tied
up with humans, of course.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:49.930
In India, we have 60% of the
world's tigers living amidst

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:51.560
a billion people.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.060
And how do we configure
the landscapes

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:56.520
so that we can leave
space for tigers

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.240
and leave space
for humans as well?

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.070
So part of our study
that we're doing

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:02.950
that's powered by Google Earth
Engine published in "Science

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:06.932
Advances" last
April, was a paper

00:37:06.932 --> 00:37:08.765
called "Tracking Changes
and Preventing Loss

00:37:08.765 --> 00:37:10.420
in Critical Tiger Habitat."

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:13.850
So these are the 76 tiger
conservation landscapes

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:16.430
scattered across Southeast
Asia and the Russian Far

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:18.370
East in an inset here.

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:21.130
And the 76 are scored
either as what we call T

00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:23.970
times 2, TCLs or non-T times 2.

00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:26.171
Meaning the ones in
magenta here are the ones

00:37:26.171 --> 00:37:28.670
that are going to contribute
most to doubling the wild tiger

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:30.100
population in 12 years.

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.700
They have the healthiest,
largest populations.

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.790
What we can do using Google
Earth Engine and the data

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:38.380
from Matt [? Hansen ?]
is to track changes

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.040
in the habitat of tigers.

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:42.890
Because to get to
T times 2, we need

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:44.580
to have a certain
amount of habitat.

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:48.090
Because tigers are territorial,
different size territories.

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:50.470
How much area do we
need to set aside

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:52.750
to be able to protect them?

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:55.140
And what we found, the
results were remarkable.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:59.250
Over the 14 year period, we
expected a tremendous amount

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:00.642
of loss of habitat.

00:38:00.642 --> 00:38:02.600
Because these are the
fastest-growing economies

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.870
in the world, high
rural population

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:07.880
densities in India, Nepal,
Bangladesh, and a few others.

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:13.940
We've only lost about
7% of the tiger habitat

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:15.020
over this 14-year period.

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:17.460
We thought it would
be more like 21%.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:19.770
So that's a really
great finding.

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:22.920
Equally important is there
is still enough habitat

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:26.010
left in the tiger range
to allow for not only

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:29.030
a doubling of wild tigers,
but almost even a tripling.

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:32.880
Which we only found out because
of the value of Google Earth

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:36.390
Engine and Global Forest Watch
to be able to compute this,

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:38.440
which we couldn't
do two years ago.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:41.490
So we're now doing-- to show
this can work at the Terai Arc

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:46.101
landscape where-- my book
takes place right here.

00:38:46.101 --> 00:38:48.350
We're going to zoom in on a
couple of these corridors.

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:51.510
So another critical important
piece of tiger biology,

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:54.650
tigers have to-- male
tigers have to disperse.

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:56.730
They can't stay in
their natal home range

00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:58.690
or the adult male
will kill them.

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:00.840
And tigers are relatively
poor dispersers,

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.340
unlike, say, wolves.

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:05.140
So you have to have relatively
interconnected forest

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:08.490
corridors for tigers to
go from A to B to C to D.

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:13.424
So we can use the new
approach we have to zoom in.

00:39:13.424 --> 00:39:14.840
This is really the
most-- not only

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:17.390
look at the whole scale
of the tiger habitat

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:20.080
and look at changes
annually, but move in

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:23.270
and look at changes in
these critical corridors.

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:26.140
And to show that
here in this one,

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:28.800
in the [? Basanta ?]
Corridor, we've actually lost

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:33.400
habitat here in this critical
connector piece right here.

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:35.030
And here in the
[? Kata ?] Corridor,

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:37.530
we've actually
gained habitat, which

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:40.710
you can see not so well here.

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:42.225
But there's a
number-- right here.

00:39:42.225 --> 00:39:45.550
Yeah, these blue polygons here
are where community forestry

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:48.930
programs have helped reestablish
connectivity with India.

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:52.580
The tigers in this park
have gone from 18 to 50

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:53.900
in the last five years.

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:55.470
In part because of
better protection,

00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:58.390
but also because of movement
back and forth from India.

00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:00.600
So we have a whole new
tool at our disposal

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.100
now to better manage tigers.

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.830
And look across which
of the 76 landscapes

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:06.400
are the ones that
have lost the most

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.510
amount of absolute habitat.

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:10.260
And what percent of it?

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:12.519
And now, the tiger range
states-- most important--

00:40:12.519 --> 00:40:14.310
they're using this as
their monitoring tool

00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:16.570
to measure progress
towards conserving that.

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:19.220
We're just about to receive a
grant this week from the Arcus

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:21.570
Foundation in working with
the Jane Goodall Institute

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:25.670
to do the same analysis
for African and Asian apes

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:26.540
in the next year.

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:29.140
So very useful way
of looking at that.

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:31.570
And now, I'm going to
end with just saving you

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:34.360
the heartache of going and
doing a PhD in conservation

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.540
biology at Stanford, say.

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:40.030
I'm going to reduce conservation
biology into one sentence.

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:41.970
One phrase, even.

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:44.440
Pay attention to the
landscapes and beta-diversity.

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:47.370
So the first part was--
I showed you on tigers

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:49.950
and the apes is-- some
of the critical species

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:52.390
we have to save, you
need to take a landscape

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:53.850
approach to conservation.

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:56.610
That protected areas by
themselves are too small.

00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:58.370
There's not a single
protected area

00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:01.350
in the entire tiger
range large enough

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:03.630
to maintain a viable population.

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:06.620
So what you need to do is
to have linked reserves

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:09.840
where tigers are managed as a
meta-population, a population

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.510
linked by dispersal.

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:14.590
That's what we have to do at
one extreme for what we call

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:16.050
"area-sensitive species."

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:19.860
Tigers, elephants,
jaguars, et cetera.

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:21.500
Harpy eagles.

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.090
At the other extreme
is beta-diversity.

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:25.820
Of species that
are highly endemic,

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:28.810
what beta-diversity is-- it's
just a piece of eco jargon

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:32.090
that means the turnover
of species along gradients

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:33.480
or with distance.

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.630
And what you have
to do then is if you

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:39.070
have a high turnover of
species is to put reserves

00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:42.440
in enough places where
they're distinct to protect

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.380
those populations.

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:45.630
So whether they're
chameleons in Madagascar

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:49.450
or highly-endangered parrots
in Colombia, bird wing

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:53.540
butterflies, or rare
plants, spacing the reserves

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:55.380
in the right places is critical.

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:59.070
That if we can capture this
pattern of turnover species

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:03.240
with distance and these vast
areas we need for conservation,

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.070
then we've pretty
much conserved 90%

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:06.950
of all species and processes.

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:09.830
And that's the crux of
conservation biology.

00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:12.170
How that's playing
out is a new project

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:15.260
that we hope to involve
our colleagues at Google

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:17.150
with that's called
Nature Needs Half.

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:21.310
And Tanya said at the
end of my introduction

00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:22.850
the Pope of
Conservation Biology,

00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:24.850
E.O. Wilson, has come out
with a new book called

00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:27.410
"Half Earth," which
calls for putting half

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:30.010
of the terrestrial realm
and half of the marine

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:32.510
under some form of
conservation management

00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:35.250
if our species is
to survive and if we

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:37.520
are to save all the
other species on Earth.

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:41.200
So our approach of doing that
is to revisit a map that we

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.950
published in 2001 in the
"Journal of Bioscience"

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:46.160
called "Terrestrial Eco
Regions of the World,"

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:49.100
where we divide eco
regions not by countries--

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:52.280
not look at it by country,
but by eco regions.

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.970
And you can see how,
like here is Brazil.

00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:55.720
The boundary here.

00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:58.610
How eco region boundaries
or natures boundaries don't

00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:00.800
follow political boundaries.

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.830
What we've done is to
apply this idea of nature

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:07.050
needs half to the
846 eco regions

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:10.740
that will be in this new
map called Eco Regions 2.0.

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:13.590
And to see how far we
are on our progress

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:15.970
of saving half of wild nature.

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:18.280
So we divide them
into four categories

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:22.340
of places that have already
exceeded 50% protection, places

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:25.730
that could do that, places
that with a lot of restoration

00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:27.970
could do that, and
places that-- good luck,

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:29.710
its nature is really imperiled.

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:33.630
You know, the idea of taking the
Tallgrass Prairie of Illinois,

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:37.980
which is 99% soybeans
and corn would probably

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:40.110
require the end of
the civilized world

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:42.680
to ever get back
to nature in this.

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:44.720
So we're not being naive.

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:47.190
There are a lot of places--
not a lot of places

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:48.340
that can't do that.

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:50.840
But the surprising
and positive finding

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:53.400
is there are many eco
regions, perhaps a third

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:56.230
already, that either
have the ability

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:59.160
to protect-- that have already
protected half or close to it,

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:01.430
40%, or could do so.

00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:03.840
So that it's not as
far-fetched as we think.

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:06.810
And so we're hoping
that this becomes,

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:10.190
really, the new conservation
paradigm of the next century.

00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:13.280
That if we are to leave
behind a living planet,

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:15.770
we have to undertake
the exercises to plan--

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:17.940
to zone for
conservation and zone

00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:21.050
for intensive human development
in the right places.

00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:24.640
So that we leave space for the
tigers and rhinos and elephants

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:28.760
of Bardiya that I had the great
chance to study when I was 21.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:31.800
And leave things for
future generations as well.

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.218
So thank you very much.

00:44:33.218 --> 00:44:37.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:41.410
AUDIENCE: So for the
Nature Needs Half,

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:47.540
how much of the success there
is dependent on governments

00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:49.495
buying into it?

00:44:49.495 --> 00:44:50.870
ERIC DINERSTEIN:
So the question,

00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:53.225
how much of Nature Needs
Half is getting governments

00:44:53.225 --> 00:44:53.850
to buy into it?

00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:55.160
Absolutely.

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.910
So one of the things we
talk about in the paper

00:44:57.910 --> 00:45:02.210
is that almost every government,
except the United States

00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:05.470
and Bhutan has signed on to
the Convention of Biodiversity.

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:08.930
And in that are a set of
targets that they're supposed

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:10.760
to reach by a certain date.

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:13.040
And so in this case,
they're codified

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:14.920
as the [? Ichee ?] targets.

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.820
And [? Ichee ?]
target 11 is aiming

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:22.580
for 17% of the terrestrial
realm conserved by 2020.

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:27.820
Right now, the global
amount is 15.4%.

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:31.770
We're trying to suggest that is
a really important and useful

00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:35.070
milestone, but not
the end target.

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:38.300
Just because it's
nowhere near enough.

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:40.180
But governments have
bought into that.

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:42.940
So we're trying to
say, great milestone.

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:47.130
But over the next 10, 20, 30,
50 years, let's get to 50%.

00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:48.820
But without the help
of the governments,

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:50.860
it won't be possible.

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:53.810
And however, the 50%
can also incorporate--

00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:55.550
and will incorporate
indigenous reserves,

00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:58.760
which are vast expanses of
some parts of the world.

00:45:58.760 --> 00:45:59.822
Private reserves.

00:45:59.822 --> 00:46:01.280
So there are other
ways that we can

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:05.180
get to 50% besides
just protected areas.

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:07.700
But that will be
certainly the cornerstone.

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:11.830
AUDIENCE: Let's say you take
an area and divide it in half.

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:15.230
And you have 50%
preserved, or conserved,

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:17.580
or managed in some way.

00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:19.830
Now, let's say that you
take each of those halves

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:22.550
and divide it in half like
a checkerboard pattern.

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:24.210
And you keep doing that.

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:28.290
And eventually, you get a very
dispersed pattern that still

00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:31.840
represents 50% of the area.

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.447
Which of those is better?

00:46:33.447 --> 00:46:34.780
ERIC DINERSTEIN: Great question.

00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:37.380
So what you've just
described is really

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:39.460
fragmentation of habitat.

00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:43.344
And depending on where
you are-- so the answer,

00:46:43.344 --> 00:46:45.093
like everything in
science, is it depends.

00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:53.470
But in most cases, the more
connected, the more there

00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:56.110
is habitat integrity,
the better the chances

00:46:56.110 --> 00:46:59.360
are of conserving not
just the species there

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:02.720
that need big areas, but the
phenomenon that occur there

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:04.040
that drive the whole ecology.

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:07.670
So for example, if we were in
the Boreal Forest in Canada

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:10.160
right now, it's
these-- well, somebody

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.160
would call it cataclysmic,
but others would just

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:15.680
say extensive forest fires that
really drive those systems.

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.770
So your protected area
should be large enough

00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:22.030
to contain either giant
insect outbreaks that

00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:26.090
lead to a loss of trees or
these giant forest fires.

00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:29.400
To be big enough to contain
those ecological events

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:30.850
and still persist.

00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:31.600
And still recover.

00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:35.940
For rain forest
versus grasslands,

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:38.900
like-- one of the things
we say in our paper

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:42.770
is that 50% is a
guideline, an aspirational.

00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:45.270
But it's also not prescriptive.

00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:48.270
It's an empirically-derived
estimate

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:51.199
that should come from studying
the biology of the species

00:47:51.199 --> 00:47:51.990
in that eco region.

00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:55.480
So to give you an example,
in a lot of rain forests

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:58.580
where you have very
high beta-diversity,

00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:01.350
you want lots of
reserves spaced depending

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:04.000
on where the distributions
of those species are.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.980
But in the Amazon
basin, there's estimates

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:09.830
that if we don't maintain
80% forest cover in those eco

00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:14.840
regions, we lose the biophysical
function of the Amazon

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:16.880
as a weather machine
that makes its own rain.

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:20.130
Of how the rainfall that
comes off of the trade winds

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:23.230
gets recycled 10 times
before it hits the Andes,

00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:27.350
and then moves back to provide
the precipitation for the corn

00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:31.080
crop in South Africa or
the wheat crop in Canada.

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:32.740
A small part of it
makes its way back.

00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:36.990
So there are some eco regions
that need a lot more area.

00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:40.830
For some grasslands, because in
grasslands most of the species

00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:42.380
there tend to be
pretty widespread,

00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:45.680
it could be that a few whopping
big reserves would do better

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.220
than lots of small ones.

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:49.630
But in general, big
and well-connected

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:52.600
is better than small
and fragmented.

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:55.521
AUDIENCE: I was just curious on
the tigers and other predators.

00:48:55.521 --> 00:48:57.270
Just curious on the
detail of, how do they

00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:58.430
interact with other predators?

00:48:58.430 --> 00:49:00.471
Do they need range separate
from other predators,

00:49:00.471 --> 00:49:03.170
or do they kind of
not interact at all?

00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:05.500
You know, wild dogs, and
leopards, and all that.

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.230
ERIC DINERSTEIN: So
they do interact.

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:10.030
And mostly, when you have a
top predator like a tiger,

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:13.620
the wild dogs and the leopards
try to stay away from them.

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:16.640
But leopards being much
smaller in body size,

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:19.450
they have much
smaller home ranges.

00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:23.050
And wild dogs on the opposite
have enormous ranges.

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:25.360
Whether they're Asian
wild dogs, or they're

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:27.200
African painted
dogs or wild dogs,

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:28.440
they have gigantic ranges.

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:30.700
Because they're often
on the move and they're

00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:32.129
hunting over big areas.

00:49:32.129 --> 00:49:34.170
And probably, in part
they're trying to stay away

00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:36.980
from the top predators.

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:38.907
So you see that phenomenon.

00:49:38.907 --> 00:49:41.240
I mean, the wild dogs are
also different because they're

00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.570
social hunters.

00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:45.690
And they can take down, like the
sambar deer, when all of them

00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:47.540
converge on a prey item.

00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:49.870
So they can take things
much bigger than them.

00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:53.630
Leopards, typically, don't
take prey bigger than

00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:57.250
like, say, a sambar deer.

00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:59.480
Some tigers are specialists
on killing things

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:03.410
like the Indian bison,
which is over 2,000 pounds.

00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:05.590
So even though the
tigers are smaller,

00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:07.870
they're very effective hunters.

00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:11.746
TANYA: I find it very inspiring
and an incredible bright spot

00:50:11.746 --> 00:50:15.270
that Nepal has not seen
an incident of poaching.

00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:18.210
Is that something that
you think could be

00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:20.415
replicated in other countries?

00:50:20.415 --> 00:50:21.290
ERIC DINERSTEIN: Yes.

00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:22.640
And it should be.

00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:26.440
So in Nepal-- I've been
working there since 1975.

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:32.160
But it's taken years to
introduce new policies

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:35.650
and programs that the Nepalese
government, which really

00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:37.600
is incredibly innovative
in a lot of ways,

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.070
has taken and run with.

00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:43.030
One, for example, is we know
that we need to do conservation

00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:44.210
outside the parks.

00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:47.470
And we need to get local people
on our side for conservation

00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:50.120
if it's to have
any lasting value.

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:53.290
They passed legislation
in the mid-90s to not only

00:50:53.290 --> 00:50:56.020
hand over the forests
outside protected areas

00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:57.770
to local communities
if they could come up

00:50:57.770 --> 00:51:00.240
with good management
plans, but then

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:03.110
to recycle the revenue--
half the revenues generated

00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:06.820
by the national parks
back to local communities

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:09.820
for development
for their own use,

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:12.450
if they come up
with good proposals.

00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:14.230
And that's turned
people around the parks

00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:18.270
who were anti-park before to
conservationists overnight.

00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:21.120
And so in fact, why we
had the recovery of some

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:23.620
of those wildlife corridors
I showed between the parks

00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:26.710
is because community forestry
programs are actively

00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:29.820
protecting and monitoring
their own community forests.

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:32.360
And the wildlife is
coming back in them.

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:33.590
So that's been amazing.

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:35.090
The other thing
they do is they have

00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:36.670
the army in the national parks.

00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:40.090
And that acts as
a major deterrent.

00:51:40.090 --> 00:51:41.847
That's problematic
in some countries.

00:51:41.847 --> 00:51:43.680
But I think the biggest
difference is really

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:47.820
our successful anti-poaching
information network.

00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:50.550
So intelligence is critical.

00:51:50.550 --> 00:51:53.490
Back in the old days,
we would pay informants

00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:55.290
more than the
poachers would get.

00:51:55.290 --> 00:51:58.410
That's now leveled off a bit
with the value of rhino horn.

00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:02.210
But still, the
transfer of revenues

00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:05.050
from the parks themselves
back to communities

00:52:05.050 --> 00:52:07.340
has given people an
investment in conserving

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:08.720
rhinos and tigers.

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:10.276
Such that, as I
say, there has not

00:52:10.276 --> 00:52:11.900
been a single rhino,
tiger, or elephant

00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:12.930
poached in three years.

00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:14.971
And there's no other
country that can match that.

00:52:14.971 --> 00:52:17.110
So clearly, Nepal is
doing something right.

00:52:17.110 --> 00:52:19.530
Well, thank you very
much for your attention.

00:52:19.530 --> 00:52:20.407
And--

00:52:20.407 --> 00:52:21.990
TANYA: Thank you for
coming to Google.

00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:25.315
