00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.130
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Good afternoon, Googlers!

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.160
Welcome to Authors @ Google, Cambridge edition.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.200
It's my great pleasure to introduce to you
today Beatrice Peltre who I had the honor

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.010
of working with years ago at a different software
company.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:33.930
Since then she has parlayed her passion for
food and cooking into an amazing career as

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.070
a blogger, food photographer, food stylist,
and now best-selling cookbook author.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.880
This book is outselling Jacques Pepin and
Julia Child at this moment andâ€”

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.400
&gt;&gt;Beatrice: Right now.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.730
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Not now?

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:49.730
&gt;&gt;Beatrice: Yeah.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.730
Right now, but it might not last.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.730
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: OK, right now.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.730
[laughter]

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.890
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: It's a wonderful book, Beatrice,
or Bea, is a wonderful person and I know you're

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:05.309
gonna enjoy this demo of one of the recipes
in the book which is a rice pudding with lemongrass.

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.000
&gt;&gt;Beatrice: We stew the strawberries with
lemongrass, lime and ginger.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.030
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Afterwards there will be
time for Q and A, tasting, and book signing.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.310
So, please join me in welcoming Bea.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.310
[applause]

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.310
&gt;&gt;Beatrice: Thank you.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.000
I'm very happy to be here.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.770
The recipe I chose to demonstrate today with
you is a very simple one.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.310
I'm sure that you all have already in your
repertoire rice pudding recipe.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:43.180
This one is specific to me and is quite special
because in traditional recipes I typically

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:51.569
like to combine different flavors that can
be surprising and particularly here the lemongrass

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:58.289
that is going to be used to flavor the rice
as well as the strawberries.

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.159
So it is a very simple recipe.

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.390
Something that I think is always nice to make
at this time of year when you have seasonal

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.679
fruit like berries.

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.630
Here strawberries, but you could definitely
do that right now with rhubarbs and other

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.630
fruit.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.020
And it's also a recipe you can do in the winter
when you have apples.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.360
It's I think the quintessence of comfort food.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.460
If you want my opinion.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.080
So, the recipe has three major steps.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.630
One, in which you're going to lightly toast
almonds.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.170
These are sliced almonds.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.970
You could also use slivered almonds.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.640
I actually just recently found out that this
was called a sliced almond.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.460
I used to think that they were slivered almonds.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.860
So, always room to learn.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.220
The second thing is, stewing the fruit, which
has been diced here finely.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.590
The purpose here of dicing them finely is
so that specifically for small servings like

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.690
that, they actually gonna fit well the glass
I can use.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.550
This is obviously a sampling portion.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:15.130
But you can at home use small water glasses.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:23.140
There are a great selection of glasses, I
don't know if I could say names, but Ikea's

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.770
got good ones.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.650
And the third one is obviously the rice.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:35.001
The rice takes the longest time, so I suggest
that you get it going and get--.

00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:41.860
I mean, in the book, I actually mention doing
the almonds, the fruit and then the rice.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:48.000
But you can really change the order as you
wish.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.740
The recipe, I believe, is best eaten lukewarm.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.880
But some prefer, and again that's a question
of preference, some people prefer when it's

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.880
cold.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.710
Some people keep that in the fridge.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.190
I, myself, like that when it's lukewarm.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.120
So, you just choose again what's best for
you.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.730
Bearing in mind that once the rice is cooked,
if you put it in the fridge, it's going to

00:04:11.730 --> 00:05:17.510
thicken more and absorb more of the liquid.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:06:46.419
Which is why my tendency goes to eating it
lukewarm, so 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:07:05.240
it's more of 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:15.510
the silky texture.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:36.060
So let's get cooking.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:08:27.169
So the first thing is, putting the fire on
your stove.

00:08:27.169 --> 00:08:41.570
If I can do that.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:45.370
Right.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:09:41.640
So you just take those almonds and you put
them in your pan, making sure that you are

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:48.910
check regularly so that they just stay toasted.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:53.170
So this is a very [inaudible] important thing
to do.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:10:05.740
So, I would do like three to four, making
sure, once actually it starts getting brown,

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:17.870
you don't want to let it burn.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:24.040
So you just really should not forget that
on the stove.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:34.410
And the result is these things here.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:40.330
Where are my almonds?

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:41.810
Here.

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:55.630
So this is what you end up having.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.620
OK?

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:08.310
Just going to put that down.

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:10.459
And then turn the heat down.

00:11:10.459 --> 00:11:11.459
I can't get that to simmer, but that's alright.

00:11:11.459 --> 00:11:12.459
[chuckles]

00:11:12.459 --> 00:11:16.711
The second thing is doing the strawberries.

00:11:16.711 --> 00:11:18.470
So you take a big pot once you have diced
your strawberries, you put them in the pot

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.709
like this.

00:11:21.709 --> 00:11:27.180
[thumping and clanging]

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:31.000
OK.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:54.380
It's starting already here.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:12:20.250
I have to keep an eye on this one because
I can't really turn that down, so.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:43.880
Here you're gonna add some water, some sugar,
some lemon zest, lime zest, sorry.

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.570
Lemongrass.

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:54.010
You've all used lemongrass before.

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:55.700
No?

00:12:55.700 --> 00:13:00.540
So the way to do it, you just remove the,
this very thick part.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:06.830
Clean it as much as you can like this.

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.630
Watching my strawberries there.

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:12.430
See they're already burning.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:13.430
So I'm gonna put them here.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:14.430
So the lemongrass is like this.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:15.430
You remove the thick part here.

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:17.780
And I'm going to cut in half.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:20.650
Remove the hard part here.

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:30.279
And when it's just for the purpose of flavoring
something, you can basically just cut like

00:13:30.279 --> 00:13:31.610
this.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:39.630
And discard what you don't need.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:48.220
For the purpose of the strawberries, you want
to be able to eat that, and obviously this

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:58.470
would not be very pleasant to eat.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:22.910
So my trick to do this, you put the flavor
and not be annoyed by just eating pieces of

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:24.610
lemongrass like this.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:32.990
I use a coffee grinder which is dedicated
to non-coffee flavored things.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:34.220
[laughter]

00:14:34.220 --> 00:15:02.540
And then you end up with something very, kind
of, a bit like hay.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.380
Right.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:19.540
But it's going to disintegrate.

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:32.320
And then you add a little bit of it.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.490
In your pot.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:37.610
[spoon clanging]

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:53.290
And then, you just put this to medium to low,
just a very gentle simmer.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:56.970
And you're going to stew this very lightly
for five minutes maximum, because obviously

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:57.970
strawberries are very soft.

00:15:57.970 --> 00:15:58.970
You want them to keep still their shape.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:15:59.970
But still feel soft and stewy.

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:00.970
So just you know, stir like this.

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:01.970
[spoon clanging]

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:04.029
OK, so that's going.

00:16:04.029 --> 00:16:05.750
It's very hot.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:07.470
And the rice.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:11.250
So the first thing is to take your milk.

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:21.870
So this is like two cups and a third of warm
milk.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:31.330
The same little bit of lime.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:59.290
And for this part, I actually do not mind
using like I said, this, because I will discard

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:00.723
it once the rice is cooked.

00:17:00.723 --> 00:17:02.649
So, I add this to my pot and a piece of ginger.

00:17:02.649 --> 00:17:04.549
So about an inch.

00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:10.100
Again, doesn't matter how you slice it because
this will be discarded.

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:11.130
Like this.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:12.130
[pause]

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:16.949
And you should actually get this to a boil.

00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:18.679
So.

00:17:18.679 --> 00:17:22.130
A pot.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:25.589
[spoon clanging]

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:28.370
I'm going well so far?

00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:29.370
[laughter]

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:30.370
OK.

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:40.270
So, test the strawberries maybe a little bit.

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:45.380
This heat is quite high, so I need to watch
it.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:52.870
And what you need to do then is to prepare
your rice, so, this recipe or inside the book,

00:17:52.870 --> 00:18:00.510
I actually mention carnaroli rice, which is
a type of risotto rice.

00:18:00.510 --> 00:19:12.870
You could also use arborio, which might be
this one.

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:45.030
It doesn't really matter.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:20:17.340
Some actually countries, I'm just back from
Ireland.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.340
And I actually found a bag specific for rice
pudding.

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:19.850
Just to show you actually, that in some countries
rice pudding is just a whole institution.

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:20.950
[chuckling]
So just to prep it.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:21.950
I suggest rinsing.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:22.950
Rinsing the rice under cold water and once
your milk has reached boiling point, which

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:23.950
it will in a minute.

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:24.950
And this is way too hot already, so.

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:25.950
I am just removing that now.

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:28.330
So once this reaches boiling point, I'm going
just to slowly pour the rice in.

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:29.330
Lower the heat.

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:30.330
And stir regularly until most of the liquid
is absorbed.

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:31.330
So.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:32.330
Tricky.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:33.330
It's really hard to make that simmer, the
milk.

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:34.330
[sound of whisk in pot]

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:35.330
Alright.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:36.330
Obviously, you do not want milk just to get
all over the pan.

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:37.330
This is a really good pan.

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:38.330
[spoon banging on pan]

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:39.330
OK.

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:40.330
So, this will take about 30 minutes.

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:41.330
And obviously for the purpose of this demo
I'm not gonna make you wait until the rice

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:42.330
is cooked.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:43.330
[laughter]

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:44.330
It's just.

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:45.330
It's nice to see them actually.

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:46.830
Somehow, whenever I make this recipe I always
think "Oh, there's really too much liquid."

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:47.830
But it falls together.

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:48.990
So don't feel scared, that you think there's
too much liquid in comparison to how little

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:50.870
rice you put in.

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:51.870
Eventually it will come together.

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:53.169
And it's actually nice to keep it on the runny
side, because again, once it's cooling off,

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:54.169
cooling down, it will get thicker.

00:20:54.169 --> 00:20:55.169
It's actually the same principle, if you've
ever made risotto.

00:20:55.169 --> 00:20:56.169
You know, if you let it cool and sit, it will
get thick.

00:20:56.169 --> 00:20:57.169
So.

00:20:57.169 --> 00:20:58.169
So, I'm just stirring.

00:20:58.169 --> 00:20:59.169
And [inaudible].

00:20:59.169 --> 00:21:00.169
[clanging]

00:21:00.169 --> 00:21:01.169
This is a real favorite at home.

00:21:01.169 --> 00:21:02.169
So, we make that often.

00:21:02.169 --> 00:21:03.169
[plastic crinkling]

00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:04.169
OK.

00:21:04.169 --> 00:21:05.169
Just coming back to this one.

00:21:05.169 --> 00:21:06.169
And again, I just worry in the kitchen when
they were preparing, to burn it.

00:21:06.169 --> 00:21:07.169
Meaning that you again, do not leave that
unattended, thinking you have other things,

00:21:07.169 --> 00:21:08.169
it's going to happen on its own.

00:21:08.169 --> 00:21:09.169
Sometimes, especially, depending on the kind
of pot you use, the heat is really, or if

00:21:09.169 --> 00:21:10.169
the pot conveys much more heat than other
pots, you could actually end up with burned

00:21:10.169 --> 00:21:11.169
rice.

00:21:11.169 --> 00:21:12.169
It's best to go slower.

00:21:12.169 --> 00:21:13.169
So put it on as low as you can.

00:21:13.169 --> 00:21:14.169
As low as your stove can.

00:21:14.169 --> 00:21:15.169
Rather than burn.

00:21:15.169 --> 00:21:16.169
[spoon clangs on pot]

00:21:16.169 --> 00:21:17.169
This is the rice that you end up having.

00:21:17.169 --> 00:21:18.169
In this one, I already added the coconut milk
'cause at the end I finish with coconut milk

00:21:18.169 --> 00:21:20.200
and sugar.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.090
OK?

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:23.090
And I also have discarded in this one the
lemongrass and the ginger.

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:24.090
The lime stays in because it's been finely
chopped so it's been absorbed by the rice

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:25.090
again, so that you do not get tiny bits that
are uncomfortable to eat.

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:26.090
This is the rice.

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:27.090
You can see.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:28.090
This one, I just prepared before coming here.

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:29.090
I'm gonna stop this because it's goingâ€”

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:30.090
[spoon banging on bowl]

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:31.090
And I like it at this temperature because
it's not too hot.

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:32.090
So, pretty much your recipe is done.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:33.090
You have the rice pudding ready.

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:34.090
Sweetened.

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:35.090
Flavored with lemongrass and lime and ginger.

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:36.090
You have your stewed strawberries.

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:37.090
And the finishing touch is actually to take
the stewed strawberries here.

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:38.090
And that actually gives you this very lovely
juice, you know.

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:39.090
It's very nice.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.090
And add some fresh ones for contrast of texture
and temperature.

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:41.090
So, typically, we'd let that cool a little
bit.

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:42.090
This is hot, obviously, but I'm going to do
that anyway.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:43.090
Alright.

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:44.090
So again, you would do that with any kind
of fruit.

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:45.090
This is actually, by the way, lovely in the
morning too, if you like granola and plain

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:46.090
yogurt.

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:47.090
I always have a pot of these things in the
fridge for my breakfast in the morning.

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:48.090
So imagine you have a big serving glass.

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:49.090
And I am actually going to put it on the plate
here.

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:50.090
But you could serve it for more dressed up
dessert, again layered in a small glass.

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:51.090
Which is very lovely.

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:52.090
Or in a more rustic kind of way, you're going
to just plate your rice like this.

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:53.090
[pause]
[spoon clanking]

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:54.090
The fruit.

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:55.090
[pause]

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:56.090
And the toasted almonds.

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:57.090
And voila.

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:58.090
This is your rice pudding.

00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:59.090
So, that's it.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:00.090
[applause]

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:01.090
So, for you to sample here, I have small individual
portions.

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:02.090
And feel free just to have one, I'm just going
to pass it around.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:03.090
Maybe you have questions as well, so I'm very
happy to answer questions about this recipe

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:04.090
or anything else about the book or whatever
you want to know.

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:05.090
Yes?

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:15.300
&gt;&gt;male #1: How hard is it to separate out
your ginger and lemongrass from the rice?

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:20.789
&gt;&gt;Beatrice: From the rice?

00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:21.789
&gt;&gt;male #1: Yeah.

00:22:21.789 --> 00:22:22.789
&gt;&gt;Beatrice: You mean, once it's cooked.

00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:23.789
It's not.

00:22:23.789 --> 00:22:24.789
Actually, what you need to do is like, it,
that's why I prefer to cut very thick piece

00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:26.849
and not make it so small that you're not able
to find it in the rice.

00:22:26.849 --> 00:22:27.849
So my way sometimes is even just to cut like
this, slice it, and then you just take, either

00:22:27.849 --> 00:22:28.849
like a fork or what's that called?

00:22:28.849 --> 00:22:29.849
Tongs?

00:22:29.849 --> 00:22:30.849
And take it out.

00:22:30.849 --> 00:22:31.849
Yeah?

00:22:31.849 --> 00:22:32.849
This one is a little cold because I made it
last night, so.

00:22:32.849 --> 00:22:38.820
If you want a warmer version I'm happy to
give you one as well.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.710
Any other questions?

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:41.710
No?

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:42.710
Yes?

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:43.710
&gt;&gt;female #1: I was wondering what your favorite
recipe is.

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:44.710
&gt;&gt;Beatrice: Say that again?

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:45.710
&gt;&gt;female #1: I was wondering what your favorite
recipe is.

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:46.710
&gt;&gt;Beatrice: From the book?

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:47.710
&gt;&gt;female #1: Of course, they're all delicious.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:48.710
&gt;&gt;Beatrice: Well, I really like them all.

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:49.710
I mean, they're all in the book for different
reasons.

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:50.710
And I think some of the favorites actually
are in the dessert, baking section, because

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:51.710
I love to bake.

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:52.710
Something that you also maybe might be curious
to know is that the book is all gluten free

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:53.710
so if it is something that you are actually
interested as well.

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:54.710
You know, like the muffins, the tart crusts.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:55.710
Everything has been made with different kinds
of flour that I basically learned to use.

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:56.710
But the recipes are very much French inspired.

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:57.710
Because that's where I'm from.

00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:58.710
But they are inspired by, my travels.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:59.710
The fact that I lived in New Zealand.

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:00.710
Places like this.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:01.710
So I like to take a French recipe that I know,
that I work with, and revisit it with my preferences

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:02.710
and flavors that I've learned to cook with.

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:03.710
Like, to this day, I don't believe that my
mother has ever cooked with coconut milk.

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:04.710
That's something that I learned by coming
outside the French countryside where it's

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:05.710
like more traditional, I suppose.

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:06.710
Do you like it?

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:07.710
[audience chatter]

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:08.710
&gt;&gt;Beatrice: Yes?

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:09.710
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Why did you decide to make gluten
free recipes?

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:10.710
&gt;&gt;Beatrice: Well, when I traveled to Peru,
many years ago I developed some stomach issues

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:11.710
that I basically couldn't identify.

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:12.710
And doing different research I just realized
I actually had the gluten intolerance.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:13.710
So it was a bit of a challenge because being
French, we have the baguette, the bread.

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:14.710
But I was determined.

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:15.710
I thought, if this is the price to pay, I'm
going to try.

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:16.710
And in the end, came a wonderful enrichment
in my cooking repertoire, because I learned

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:17.710
to use flours that I didn't know much about.

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:18.710
Most of those flours also have much more nutrients,
protein.

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:19.710
So in the end, it made me a better cook, made
me a better baker.

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:20.710
It was challenging at the beginning, because
obviously, if you like to bake.

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:21.710
Especially I love to make tarts.

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:22.710
The French really love vegetable tarts.

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:23.710
The crust, if you just think about the ratio
that you are used to working with, and trying

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:24.710
to convert it to gluten-free flours, sometimes
it is crumbly, doesn't stay together.

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:25.710
So it's just basically, I had to learn to
create a lot of formula for what I knew how

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:26.710
to cook before.

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:27.710
So that's such, you know, and then, I could
have perhaps try to go back to eating with

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:28.710
gluten but I-- . First of all I felt so much
better.

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:29.710
That there was no question.

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:30.710
And then one thing I really enjoy is the flavors.

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:31.710
It became really a plus rather than a minus.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:32.710
Yes?

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:33.710
&gt;&gt;male #2: Looking through the book initially,
I was like, wow, [inaudible], her food photography

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:34.710
is just awesome.

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:35.710
But I just, how did you learn food photography
and what got you into that?

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:36.710
&gt;&gt;Beatrice: Well, just by doing.

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:37.710
Like Jonathan said, you know I worked in a
completely different field before, but I was

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:38.710
always someone who was very much attracted
to visual arts.

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:39.710
And I love to cook.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:40.710
So the day I decided to start a food blog,
funnily enough, the first article I ever wrote

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:41.710
was about food photography.

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:42.710
And I was fascinated, I remember, reading
about the fact that people had a profession

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:43.710
of food photographer.

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:44.710
So I thought "Wow, that's very cool."

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:45.710
So I did like perhaps a lot of people do.

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:46.710
When you want to do something, you just look
at who are the people you admire or what would

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:47.710
you like to achieve.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:48.710
So I looked at the food magazines that I liked.

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:49.710
Because all along before even starting blogging
I had tons of, I was subscribed to so many

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:50.710
food magazines.

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:51.710
Like cookbooks, I had tons of cookbooks at
home.

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:52.710
And I just thought "OK, I like those pictures
and I want to be able to do that."

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:53.710
So I started with a point and shoot camera
which very quickly became a little frustrating

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:54.710
because I could not achieve the results that
I wanted.

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:55.710
And I moved to SLR.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:56.710
And I did funnily enough, in my previous life,
I used to translate manuals.

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:57.710
And I used to hate to read manuals.

00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:58.710
But when I bought my camera, I realized actually
the best way just to learn is just to read

00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:59.710
the manual, you know, how to use this thing.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:00.710
[laughter]

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:01.710
So it was bit of an irony because I used to
think nobody every reads those things.

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:02.710
[laughter]

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:03.710
You know, and I'm actually using them.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:04.710
So I just worked hard.

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:05.710
I will say like really put a lot of my passion,
a lot of effort.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:06.710
It's a trial and error process.

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:07.710
You know my first pictures are horrible.

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:08.710
But then I learned to understand light because
picture and specifically food photography

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:09.710
is all about the light.

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:10.710
But I exclusively choose natural light.

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:11.710
So I learned to know when is the best time
of the day to shoot.

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:12.710
And how to make food look yummy by working
with the light.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:13.710
But it's basically, I'm completely self taught.

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:14.710
I think my passion was my drive.

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:15.710
And I love to cook and eat, so.

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:16.710
Thank you.

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:17.710
Yes?

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:18.710
&gt;&gt;female #3: I'm curious where you look for
inspiration.

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:19.710
For so long you've made many, many recipes
by now.

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:20.710
Where do you go to look for new inspiration
in your recipes?

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:21.710
&gt;&gt;Beatrice: Well, one of the things, I think
everyone I'm sure, when you do something a

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:22.710
lot, like you suggested you get saturated.

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:23.710
Obviously, I'm constantly in touch with trends,
or what other people do in magazines.

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:24.710
But my biggest actually inspiration is actually
traveling.

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:25.710
You know, whenever I travel, it's almost like
you break the pattern.

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:26.710
You just disconnect a little bit with this
kind of routine that you put yourself in.

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:27.710
And you know, like I said, I'm just back from
a trip to France and Ireland.

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:28.710
And even, like, of course here I eat very
similarly to the way I would eat in France,

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:29.710
but of course I have different ingredients.

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:30.710
I have different meals that I enjoy.

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:31.710
And when you go to people's house and then
all of a sudden this woman makes this granola

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:32.710
and you think "Oh, she make that.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:33.710
And what's this in your granola?"

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:34.710
So it's just basically pulling inspiration
by being curious about what you eat.

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:35.710
You know, at other people's house, or in a
restaurant.

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:36.710
So it's a combination of those things and
like I said, I think travel is a big one.

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:37.710
Because it just gives me a different perspective
and understanding and trying to be creative

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:38.710
again.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:39.710
That's it?

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:40.710
Yeah?

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:41.710
Well, thank you very much for coming.

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:41.711
[applause]
