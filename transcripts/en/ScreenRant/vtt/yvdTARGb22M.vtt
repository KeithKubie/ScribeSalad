00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.379
Film props and costumes really help make a
film feel alive.

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.019
Every little detail we see on screen has been
carefully curated by the director and the

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:13.389
production team to fit the aesthetic of the
production.

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.040
Sometimes however, they sneak something into
the background that may cause you to pause

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.220
and ponder if you had seen it before.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.670
Whether due to budget restrictions or having
some fun on set, here are 10 movies that recycled

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.789
props and costumes from other movies
Marvel’s The Avengers/true lies

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.470
Remember the awesome final scene in True Lies?

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.760
The 1994 James Cameron film saw Arnold Schwarzenegger
duking it out in a jet in the final scene.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.540
Well turns out you have actually seen that
jet more recently that you realize as the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.480
fighter jet made a brief appearance in the
background of 2012’s The Avengers, during

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.380
the scene where Hulk and Thor have their epic
fight.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.380
Joss Wheadon revealed his tidbit on the blu
ray commentary of avengers.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.790
Terminator 2/predator
A double dose of classic Arnold is never a

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:57.790
bad thing.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.420
But you may have thought to yourself “have
I seen that before” when it comes to the

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.120
T-800’s mini gun from T2?

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.720
In the scene, John Conner tells the terminator
not to kill anyone, resulting in fiery chaos

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.810
that spared all those police offers.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.630
The same can’t be said of the same gun in
the predator, the 1987 alien film also starring

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.630
Arnold.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.250
In that film, Bill Duke’s Mac sports the
same mini gun as that Arnie would use a few

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.250
years later.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.890
Spiderman/army of darkness, evil dead, evil
dead 2, darkman/drag me to hell

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.530
Sam Raimi has a knack for reusing the same
prop in all his films.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.090
Can you guess what it is?

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.220
Turns out, the yellow oldsmobile that Uncle
Ben was driving in Spider Man is actually

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.490
Sam Raimi’s own car, a 1973 oldsmobile delta
88.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.240
Nicknamed “the classic”, Raimi has used
this prop in all his films, including his

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.170
evil dead franchise, darkman and drag me to
hell.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.259
Starship troopers/Firefly/planet of the apes
Soon to be remade, Starship troopers is a

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.030
cult classic science fiction film that sees
humanity rally together to fight the bugs,

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.369
terrifying insectoid aliens hell bent on destroying
us humans.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.180
In order to combat such a threat, humanity
wore some pretty nifty armor.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.670
They’re so nifty in fact that you may have
wondered where else you saw them.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.740
Chances are it was when you last binged Joss
Wheadon’s excellent Firely series, where

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.330
the Alliance soldiers used the same exact
armor as seen in Starship troopers.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.500
The armor was also briefly used a year earlier
in the 2001 reboot of Planet of the Apes.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.530
Evil dead 2/ Nightmare on Elm Street
A fun piece of double trivia, keen eyed fans

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.420
of 1984 Nightmare on Elm Street may have noticed
that the horror classic Evil Dead was playing

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.610
on Nancy’s TV set.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.550
Flash-forward to 1987 and director Sam Raimi
conjured up Evil Dead 2, the campier entry

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.550
in the series.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.300
Knowing that his film was shown in Wes Craven’s
slasher classic, Raimi decided to subtly place

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.671
the original Freddy Kruger’s glove above
the shed door before Bruce Campbell’s does

00:02:45.671 --> 00:02:49.530
some damage with his signature chainsaw.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.540
Raiders of the lost ark/the majestic/spy kids
2

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.240
Raiders of the lost ark has some of the most
famous and most celebrated moments in cinema.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.340
One of them comes early on when Harrison Ford’s
Indiana Jones takes the golden idol off the

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.430
pedestal in the temple.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.480
Jump ahead more than twenty years and the
idol has been rediscovered in the film within

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.230
a film, Sand Pirates of the Sahara, which
was part of the 2001 film The Majestic.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.930
The golden figure can also be seen in an episode
of Star Trek Deep Space Nine as well as Spy

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.840
Kids 2.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.620
A New Hope/The Empire Strikes Back
A well-hidden prop in the original Star Wars

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.040
film actually became a character in its sequel,
The Empire Strikes Back.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.590
In the cantina in A New Hope, large metallic
drink dispensers can be seen behind the counter,

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.950
completely blending the background and not
making any sort of impression for the audience.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.210
That is until the sequel, when those metallic
canisters would become the head for the bounty

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.210
hunter, IG 88.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.960
The hunter would become a fan favourite in
the former Expanded Universe.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.870
Sin City/Kill Bill Vol. 1
That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.310
That may have been what crossed your mind
when you watched 2005’s Sin City and noticed

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.010
some familiar props in the “big fat kill”
chapter.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.140
In it, Devon Aoki plays Miho, a deadly silent
assassin who favours blades as a means to

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.420
terminate her foes.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.760
But her coveted samurai swords actually had
their debut in another film two years earlier.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.710
After filming the Kill Bill films, director
Quentin Tarantino stashed swords used by the

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.960
Crazy 88 in his garage, only to be used by
his buddy Robert Rodriguez shortly after.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.699
On the Sin City commentary, Rodriguez even
stated that in the film’s cinematic universe,

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.360
Hanzo did indeed craft Miho’s swords as
well.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.629
Forbidden planet/gremlins/invisible boy/earth
girls are easy/ tv’s the twilight zone/tv’s

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:31.340
lost in space/adams family/big bang theory
If you’ve seen Forbidden Planet, then you

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.919
know Robby the Robot was the standout from
that film.

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.180
So much so that he has in fact made his way
into other films as the prop was passed between

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.690
productions over the years.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.669
The prop has appeared in dozens of productions,
including Earth Girls are Easy, Invisible

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.599
Boy, the TV shows Twilight Zone and Lost in
Space and the Adams Family as well as randomly

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:49.639
showing up in Gremlins.

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.719
He most recently made an appearance in season
8 of the Big Band Theory.

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:58.969
Star Wars 4-6/Rogue One
Gareth Edwards’ Rogue One: A Star Wars story

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:02.710
takes place shortly before the events of Episode
4, A New Hope.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.620
So in keeping with the spirit of the original
trilogy, costume designer David Crossman stated

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.659
that some of the costumes in Rogue One are
in fact the same costumes that were used in

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:11.840
the original trilogy.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.970
That’s our picks for 10 movies that recycled
props and costumes from other movies.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.979
Did you notice these often hidden and reused
props and costumes before?

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:20.120
Which ones did we miss?
