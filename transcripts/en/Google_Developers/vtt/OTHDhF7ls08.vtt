[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.840
JEREMY WALKER: Hello.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.610
Welcome to YouTube Live.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.720
We have a pretty interesting
talk today around Docs, so let

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.690
me introduce our guests.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.820
We, of course, have Jeff
Posnick, who's over in the New

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.740
York office, and with him we
have Andy Diamondstein, who's

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.025
actually our tech writer
for YouTube.

00:00:58.025 --> 00:00:59.260
ANDY DIAMONDSTEIN:
How's it going?

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.700
JEFFREY POSNICK: Hey, Jeremy.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.630
Apologies that we are
sequestered in our little

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.460
closet instead of our normal
lush studio in New York City.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.225
We're happy to have Andy
visiting New York and showing

00:01:13.225 --> 00:01:14.810
him a good time.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.980
ANDY DIAMONDSTEIN:
Yes, so far.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.760
I'm happy to be here.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.270
JEREMY WALKER: Nice.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.920
Rumor's out there was some
concert or something that

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.990
kicked you guys out or something
along those lines.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.260
JEFFREY POSNICK: Yeah.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.320
We were bumped for Blondie,
the band Blondie.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.717
That's the first time and
probably the last time I will

00:01:34.717 --> 00:01:37.190
ever be able to say that.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.280
So we're broadcasting from a
special undisclosed location

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.790
for one week only.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:46.600
JEREMY WALKER: Nice.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.770
Well, let's jump in, because
this is pretty exciting.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.380
We're going to start asking Andy
some questions and he's

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.020
going to fill us in
a little bit.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.180
Tell us a little bit about
what are the improvements

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.300
coming with the V3
documentation?

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.470
Just give us a little overview
and what we can expect.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.220
ANDY DIAMONDSTEIN: Sure.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:14.590
When I think about documenting
YouTube services, I really

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.680
want us to be able to do three
things with our documentation.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.360
And I think right now, we're
doing maybe one of them in

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.490
some places or we're doing two
of them in some places, but

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.880
we're not really doing all
three across the board.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.040
Those three things are,
we want to tell you

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.440
how something works.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.860
That's what documentation
is for.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.670
It's going to explain
things to you.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.890
We do a really good job of that,
I think, or I hope, with

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.580
the current documentation
for the Version 2 API.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.170
Then the next step is we want
to, in addition to telling you

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.750
how it works, to show
you how it works.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.810
That would involve integrating a
lot of code samples into the

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.090
documentation so that when you
read about, OK, well you've

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.150
told me how to upload a video.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.000
Show me how to upload a video.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.660
Give me some code, and give me
code in different languages

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:17.350
and code samples that I can
actually use in my own code.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.730
Showing you how it works would
involve code samples and

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.860
non-interactive demos.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.990
The third thing is we want to
actually let you play with the

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.760
functionality yourself, and test
it out, and see how it

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.610
works by using it.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.820
That would involve interactive
demos.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.640
In the new API, we have
something called the API

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.690
Explorer, which lets you fill
out parameter values for

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.140
different requests, and you
can see the request that's

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.780
being submitted and the response
that would come back.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.086
An example of somewhere where
we do that right now is with

00:03:57.086 --> 00:03:59.900
the YouTube Player demo, which
I think we'll talk about a

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.530
little bit later.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.930
That's something where you can
test out a player, and see how

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.690
it works, and configure it
yourself, and then take the

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.100
code and apply it in your
own application.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.350
Being able to do all three
of those things is really

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.940
important for a complete
set of documentation.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.910
To get there, we're going
to build on some of the

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.720
advantages of the platform that
the API is using, that

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.230
it's a standard platform for the
current Google APIs that I

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.925
think you guys have
talked about in--

00:04:35.925 --> 00:04:36.460
JEFFREY POSNICK:
Yeah, we have.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.160
Specifically, Andy's talking
about what's going to apply to

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.670
the Docs for Version 3 of the
data API and for the new

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.740
YouTube Analytics they've got,
both of which were built on

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.895
this standard platform.

00:04:47.895 --> 00:04:52.420
We could make use of the API
Explorer and a bunch of other

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.230
standard resources.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.530
Another nice thing about having
a standard platform--

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.420
if you are using multiple
Google APIs in the same

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.280
projects, things should
look familiar to you.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.020
If you've read through the
Google+ Docs, the new YouTube

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.970
API docs should also have
a very similar format.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.260
That helps, too.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.510
ANDY DIAMONDSTEIN: Good point.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.850
With the new APIs, we're going
to be able to update client

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.120
libraries really frequently,
which I know has been a

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.180
challenge with the old APIs.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.540
If it's a bank holiday in France
and the person who

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:37.760
updated, the person who wrote
that client library is there.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.900
We'll be able to update client
libraries really quickly.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.390
And then because they're nice
and nicely integrated with the

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.260
API, we can produce code
samples really quickly,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.880
integrate those directly
into the Docs.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.700
Documentation for the new API
is also generated in large

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.020
part from the code base.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.880
One of the challenges with
an API that has a lot of

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.680
functionality and a lot of
developers working on it is

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.440
just the flow of information
and when developers make a

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.220
change, knowing that that's
happening and communicating it

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.000
to you guys, the developers,
as soon as it's available.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.420
Being able to generate
documentation from the code

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.560
base will make that a much
simpler process so that as

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.420
changes go into the code base,
we'll be able to update the

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.700
documentation almost
automatically and get that

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.540
functionality documented
for you really quickly.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.090
JEFFREY POSNICK: That, in
particular, will be great.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.160
Right now, the flow sometimes
looks like some external

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.415
developer happens to notice that
one of the responses in

00:06:46.415 --> 00:06:48.440
the API isn't quite the same
as it used to be, and then

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.510
they will open a bug or they'll

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.670
post about it somewhere.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.553
Then I'll find out about it and
I'll tell Andy about it

00:06:53.553 --> 00:06:58.320
and Andy will make the changes
and we'll publish it.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.080
Being able to make sure that
the documentation is almost

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.440
always authoritative--

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.440
obviously, there's still some
manual intervention to say,

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.630
get published, more or less.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:12.560
We don't want docs just flying
out every night willy-nilly.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.302
We do not want to obsolete
Andy among other things.

00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:19.340
But it's going to
a nice automated

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.000
process to a lot of extent.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.060
ANDY DIAMONDSTEIN: This
isn't a farewell tour.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.730
You might be saying
goodbye to me.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.520
JEREMY WALKER: One thing you
did call out was the API

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.030
Explorer which I know when I've
given some talks has been

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.820
pretty exciting.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:42.320
For folks out there that are
new to the V3 APIs, it's

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:47.650
really nice if you want to get
an idea of how it works.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.750
We're RESTful with our V3 API,
but the neat thing is you can

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.440
go to this API Explorer.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.660
You can fill out the fields and
it'll generate the URL for

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.080
you and then show you what
the response is.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:05.170
So you can start to see what
different flags do and what

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:05.820
they bring in.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.960
And so you can cut down your
information and things like

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.110
that before you even
jump into the code.

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:14.060
I know when I was learning it,
at least V3, that really

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.670
helped me, because then I
had a great idea before

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.820
I even jumped in.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.000
For instance, I worked a little

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.920
bit on the Java samples.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.120
Before I even jumped in, I knew
what to look for, and it

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.220
helped me identify and work
through things a lot quicker

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.900
than just going at it blind.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.549
So definitely check those out.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:36.610
Those were pretty popular
in some of our sessions.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:37.260
JEFFREY POSNICK: Sure.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.120
Would you mind if we take
a few minutes and

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.520
demonstrate that live?

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.400
JEREMY WALKER: That would
be great, actually.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.090
Let's take a look.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:44.340
JEFFREY POSNICK: Cool.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:49.070
I'm going to pull that
up now on our screen.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:52.205
There are a couple different
ways that you could get to the

00:08:52.205 --> 00:08:54.530
API Explorer.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.570
What you'll be able to do moving
forward is go to a

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.350
specific section of the Docs.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:02.810
Right now, I don't know if the
URL is very clearly visible,

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:10.180
but this is developers.googl
e.com/youtube/v3 for Version 3

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.430
of the data API.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:17.700
For instance, right over
here, drilling down--

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.950
maybe even a little
bit bigger.

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:23.410
Drilling down to a specific
method in

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.130
the Docs search list.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.990
This is how you do
a video search.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:33.490
So Andy pushed out some right
before we started this show.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.960
I'm not positive of that.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.490
And I'm also not positive this
has anything to do with Andy.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:43.070
Ideally, down here at
the bottom, there

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.530
in this Try It section.

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:48.290
They would be in an embedded
version of the API Explorer

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:52.770
where whenever you're looking at
the method for a particular

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:56.650
call, there's an API Explorer
specifically for that method

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:58.780
on the same page as the docs.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.470
That'll be great.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.550
We'll just figure out why the
current version of the docs

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.460
that was just pushed out
doesn't have that.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.910
But there's also a standalone
version of the API Explorer

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:09.770
which is exactly the
same functionality.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:14.530
It's actually nice having the
on-page version, because you

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:18.350
can see a description of all the
different parameters and

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:21.760
then quickly go down to the
bottom of the page and say,

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.490
OK, this is the possible values
for order and then plug

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:25.920
it right in on the same page.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.890
That being said, we'll just go
to the standalone version

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:32.530
which is part of the overall
Google APIs Explorer.

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:34.335
There's a bunch of different
APIs that you

00:10:34.335 --> 00:10:35.730
can try this with.

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:39.840
We're on the version for
the data API right now.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.600
I'll also just quickly
mention--

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.890
we might talk a little bit
more about this later--

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:47.980
Version 3 of the data
API is still not

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.630
fully publicly available.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:51.675
It's still protected by a
whitelist, and there's a

00:10:51.675 --> 00:10:54.090
sign-up process.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:58.300
Despite that, people can use
this API Explorer even if you

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.270
haven't been whitelisted.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.060
Anybody out there who's
interested in getting started

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:05.150
and just playing around with the
API, you can do it using

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:07.570
this API Explorer.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:08.710
So that's kind of cool.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.370
Even if you've been patiently
waiting for the full public

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:15.730
release, you don't have
to wait to use this.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:17.770
JEREMY WALKER: When do you think
that will be lifted,

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.020
that whitelist?

00:11:20.815 --> 00:11:23.400
JEFFREY POSNICK: I think we had
an answer from Vladimir,

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.690
who joined us in one of these
sessions probably a month or

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:34.130
so ago, who made a promise that
was big but was along the

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:35.890
lines of soonish.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:40.010
Soonish, still a
kind of a buzz.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:41.920
No specific dates to
announce right now.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.945
We are making exciting
announcements all the time.

00:11:48.945 --> 00:11:51.620
And I think we'll talk a little
bit more at the very

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.560
end of the show about another
exciting announcement related

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.180
to a launch that we just made.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.680
JEREMY WALKER: So soonish.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:05.440
Follow our Google+ account,
and you'll know as soon as

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.445
that whitelist has
been lifted.

00:12:08.445 --> 00:12:11.980
JEFFREY POSNICK: So just to give
an example of how the API

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:12.810
Explorer works.

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:16.515
This is for the
youtube.search.list method.

00:12:16.515 --> 00:12:18.960
I'm going to search for YouTube

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.790
API as my query string.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.930
I could put in some other
parameters over here.

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:24.880
This is actually really nice.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.800
I didn't even realize
it did this.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.100
When you click on one of the
fields, it gives you the

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:33.880
possible values which is cool.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.150
So I can sort by--

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:36.560
ANDY DIAMONDSTEIN: It might
not be needed after all.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.290
JEFFREY POSNICK: Not at all.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:42.350
So some cool things over here.

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:46.530
But then if I just click
Execute, I get back the JSON.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:49.560
So the default response
form [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.270
all the new APIs is JSON.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:56.930
There's 82,000 videos that match
YouTube API, and you get

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:59.140
back the information about
the first five--

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:03.520
get back the video
IDs over here.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.700
So play around using
the API Explorer.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:13.580
I think it's a great way to get
started or satisfy your

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.245
hunger to use the Version
3 of the API before

00:13:16.245 --> 00:13:17.690
it's publicly released.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.880
JEREMY WALKER: Also, V3--

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:24.330
one of the other cool things is
you can reduce the amount

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:28.055
of information you get back
just to get what you need.

00:13:28.055 --> 00:13:31.470
So if you just need a couple
of those fields, you can

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.110
actually, in the API Explorer
specify, I just

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:34.880
need this and this.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:35.890
You can see it come back.

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:39.180
So you can see it pared down
exactly to just what you need.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:43.060
Obviously, that will be less
traffic coming back and forth

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.040
so your app will be faster.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.290
JEFFREY POSNICK: Totally.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:51.410
JEREMY WALKER: Cool.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:55.070
I know you talked a little bit
about the documentation being

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:58.500
dynamic from the code base.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.690
Could you tell us a little more
information about the

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:05.130
actual code samples
being dynamic?

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.740
JEFFREY POSNICK: Yeah.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.080
Andy and I are still working
out the whole--

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.540
ANDY DIAMONDSTEIN: We're working
out the details, but

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.680
Jeff really produced--

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.620
has tested a bunch of different
functions and been

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:18.900
the first person to do so.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.940
He's produced a lot of--

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:21.925
JEFFREY POSNICK: Jeremy
has, too.

00:14:21.925 --> 00:14:22.600
[INAUDIBLE]

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.994
full credit [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:23.994 --> 00:14:25.650
the rest of the team
[INAUDIBLE].

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:29.830
ANDY DIAMONDSTEIN: I try to suck
up to the people who I'm

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:30.940
going to spend the most
time with in the

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.860
next couple of days.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.190
JEREMY WALKER: I'd say Jeff
has done the biggest--

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.670
the most languages by far.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:42.370
JEFFREY POSNICK: Well, OK.

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:43.624
ANDY DIAMONDSTEIN:
So we all agree.

00:14:43.624 --> 00:14:44.874
OK.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:52.380
Whoever has been working on
the API has been producing

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.120
some great code samples.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.840
So we want to make those code
samples available to

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:02.235
developers just as, give me the
Python code for uploading

00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:05.410
a video, or the Ruby
code, or whatever.

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:08.260
But also we want to have that
same code available in the

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:08.660
documentation.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:14.700
And one of the challenges with
that type of approach is if

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:17.930
the code sample changes, how
do you make sure that the

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:21.000
documentation changes
to reflect the

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.500
change in the code sample?

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:25.780
So we're working out a system
where basically, the code

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:29.750
sample will be updated in one
place, and it'll be integrated

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.480
directly into the
documentation.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.060
So when the code sample changes,
the documentation

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:38.440
changes, but also that the file
that's made available to

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.025
developers is changing at
the same time, and it's

00:15:41.025 --> 00:15:43.160
all the same file.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.720
So that'll be, I think, really
helpful and a key component of

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.730
this documentation strategy of
showing you how to do things

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:54.890
and making the code available
in different places.

00:15:54.890 --> 00:16:03.620
One of the things that I've
learned-- and I'm a relatively

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.510
bad programmer who knows enough
about programming to do

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:12.512
a lot of things, but the wrong
way in many cases.

00:16:12.512 --> 00:16:16.860
So it's always helpful to
me to see examples of

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.480
how people do things.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.520
And I know that one of the
things that I'd like to do is

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:29.340
make the APIs accessible to
as many people as we can.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:33.030
So when I look at the Player
demo, I think that's something

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:36.850
that makes the Player API
accessible to someone who

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:42.470
really doesn't know very much
about programming at all.

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:49.640
I think that the people who
are watching this video

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.730
probably have a very different
range of programming skills

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:56.840
and probably approach their
development in different ways.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.380
Some people will go and read the
documentation and try to

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.280
figure out how something
works.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.780
Some people will start with a
code sample and then they'll

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:08.940
say, OK, well I have this code
example, but how do I do this

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.890
one thing that's missing
in the code sample?

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:16.200
For documentation to be helpful
to all those people,

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:24.190
it has to really support all
these different approaches to

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:25.420
development.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.530
So no matter which of those
approaches you take, if you're

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:30.880
the person who wants to just
start with the code samples,

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.800
you should be able to just go
and get the code samples.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:38.050
If you're the person who wants
to read about how something

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.080
works first, you should
be able do that.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.610
If you're someone who just wants
to toy around and play

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:46.010
with how the functionality
works, you should

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:48.780
be able to do that.

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.210
The integrated code samples
are all part of that.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:53.220
I'm excited about it.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.470
I think it's going to be cool.

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:57.710
JEFFREY POSNICK: So they're
live in documentation yet.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.570
They will be [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:01.780
hopefully soonish.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.140
Also soonish.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:03.980
JEREMY WALKER: Also soonish.

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:05.236
[INAUDIBLE].

00:18:05.236 --> 00:18:06.200
JEFFREY POSNICK: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.190
slightly before the
public launch.

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:10.530
We're not exactly sure.

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:12.580
JEREMY WALKER: That's
great to hear.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:15.380
I know there's something else
coming with it, something

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.890
called Google Developer
Academy.

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:19.940
I'm guessing, Jeff, you're
going to cover this.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.770
But tell us a little bit what
it is for people that don't

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.960
know and what we can expect
that's coming soon.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.600
JEFFREY POSNICK: Sure.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:34.830
Google Developer Academy is an
initiative across a bunch of

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.310
teams in developer relations.

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:41.555
It's not something specific
to the YouTube API.

00:18:41.555 --> 00:18:49.780
And the idea is to provide
more structured

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:53.990
educational-type resources,
things structured around the

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:58.110
concept of a course that you
might take that's divided into

00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:58.830
different lessons.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:03.240
And each lesson teaches you
one specific skill.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:07.220
I think the overall idea is you
might pick up individual

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.575
skills in the lesson, but you
also really need the framework

00:19:10.575 --> 00:19:14.900
of a larger course to show how
everything fits together.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:19.220
It's fine if you know how to do
YouTube embed, but if you

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.950
don't know what the significance
of doing a

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:25.550
YouTube embed is, when it comes
to then using a YouTube

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:29.040
Player API to make changes to
that embed or control the

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.560
embed, it's only so valuable.

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:35.880
So we wanted to give an
end-to-end example for folks

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:40.100
to work through on their own
pace and end up with some

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.640
working pretty cool
code, hopefully.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.590
So we've done that already for
one specific course, and

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:51.870
that's been a course around
the YouTube Player APIs.

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:55.310
I put that out a
few months ago.

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:56.450
And you can get to it from

00:19:56.450 --> 00:20:01.800
developers.google.com/academy, I believe.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.510
That's the landing page that you
can go to and see all the

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:07.895
courses that are available for
a bunch of different APIs

00:20:07.895 --> 00:20:10.010
including YouTube APIs.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:14.340
So that existing course walks
you through doing an embed,

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:19.710
using the iFrame Player API to
actually jump to specific

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:23.530
portions of the video, and at
the same time, have some HTML

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:27.750
on the page that will give you
the ability to define chapters

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:29.530
within a video.

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:31.660
This might be an
example video.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:34.256
If you wanted to embed what
you're watching right now on a

00:20:34.256 --> 00:20:37.320
page, there's different
sections of our talk.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:41.590
And you might say, OK, at the 15
minute mark, that's when we

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:44.080
did the demo of the
API Explorer.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.720
So you want to make it easy
for folks to jump to that

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.840
specific portion of the video.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.940
So if you go through the whole
course that we have available,

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.355
you'll know how to build an
embedded Player that lets you

00:20:55.355 --> 00:20:56.900
do that sort of thing.

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.320
That's what's out
there right now.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.550
I'm also working on
a new course.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:06.050
And I believe it's going to be
focused on the Analytics API.

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:09.390
It's going to walk
folks through a

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:10.480
more hands-on example.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.056
This is a little bit above and
beyond the code samples that

00:21:13.056 --> 00:21:17.070
we were talking about earlier
when Andy was saying how he

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:21.070
wanted to include code samples
in line with the docs.

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:23.900
Those will be stand-alone
programs.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.940
They're mainly stand-alone
programs that illustrate how

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:29.230
to do one specific thing
with the API.

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:33.480
This new Analytics API course
will show you how to do a full

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.930
integration using both
the Data API and

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:37.740
the Analytics API.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:41.950
The idea is to show you how you
could take Analytics data

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:45.390
and store it in a
local database.

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:46.940
That's on top.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.640
Hopefully, we'll get that
done pretty soon.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.255
Lot of other stuff
going on, too.

00:21:52.255 --> 00:21:55.070
But check out that in
the near future.

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:55.680
JEREMY WALKER: Cool.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.570
The new Analytics API is pretty
neat, especially for

00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:02.510
anybody that's used the
old inside one.

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:07.520
Before, you'd get a zip file
with a bunch of CSV files, and

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.060
you'd have to go through
those and handle those.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:12.530
But now, you can get directly a
JSON or a CSV response back

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:14.510
which makes your life
a lot easier.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:20.660
I think we've talked about when
all these changes are

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:21.850
coming out.

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:24.490
There seems to be a buzzword,
I've been hearing.

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:27.840
Did you guys want
to cover that?

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.412
Is it still soonish?

00:22:30.412 --> 00:22:33.120
JEFFREY POSNICK: I didn't want
to give any specifics on this.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:33.420
JEREMY WALKER: OK.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.930
So we're still at soonish.

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:36.980
JEFFREY POSNICK: Soonish.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.070
JEREMY WALKER: Actually, there's
one more thing I'd

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:41.530
like to cover with the
documentation.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:45.200
You showed the API Explorer
which is really cool and helps

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.580
you get a great start
with the Data API.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:51.830
But of course, we have another
API that's used for consuming

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:55.120
video, which is the
Player API.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:58.620
If any of you have used the
iFrame embed, it's a pretty

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:05.110
neat little API that switches
between flash and HTML.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:07.820
So you can support a lot
of environments.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.760
But you may want to customize
it a little bit.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:15.510
So can you guys tell us what
resources we give for that?

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:16.000
JEFFREY POSNICK: Sure.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.125
I'll let Andy drive this one
since this is very much a

00:23:21.125 --> 00:23:22.375
child of his creation.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.640
That's a fair description.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.920
ANDY DIAMONDSTEIN: This is
the YouTube Player demo.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:39.290
I looked at this, again,
as someone who's not an

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:41.300
expert-level programmer.

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:45.080
When I was asked to document the
Player APIs or to update

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.580
the documentation for
the Player APIs, I

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.070
always found myself--

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:51.510
I would create a page, and it
would have a player in it, and

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:56.110
then I would go in and have to
keep editing the code to see

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:56.790
how the Player looked.

00:23:56.790 --> 00:24:02.750
It would just take a really long
time to see what worked

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:05.600
and see how it looked.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.420
There's just a lot of opening
a file and updating it.

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:10.570
JEFFREY POSNICK: It was
something like 20 different

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:12.150
player parameters.

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:13.850
ANDY DIAMONDSTEIN: And they're
supported on different--

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:19.230
we have an AS2 Player,
an AS3 Player.

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:20.665
The AS2 Player is deprecated.

00:24:20.665 --> 00:24:21.915
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:29.090
ANDY DIAMONDSTEIN: We
had an AS2 Player.

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:32.300
There's the AS3 Player and now
there's the iFrame Player.

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:36.110
Different Players support
different parameters.

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:41.710
It was just really time
consuming to test anything.

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:44.210
I figured if it's time consuming
for me and it's hard

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:46.900
for me to figure out what's
a good way to do it, well,

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:52.030
people who don't spend their
entire work days at YouTube

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:55.970
probably can't just walk over
and ask people on the Player

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:57.760
team what to do.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.470
It's probably even
harder for them.

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:02.490
Can I expand this?

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:05.340
JEFFREY POSNICK: Yeah.

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:13.240
ANDY DIAMONDSTEIN: This is
a way, basically, to--

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:18.890
there's also two different
components of the Player APIs.

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:21.190
There's a content component,
so you're controlling what

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:23.880
content shows up and how
it plays back or

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.820
pauses or when it starts.

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:29.220
And then you can also control
the display of the player.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:34.110
There's different parameters
to do that.

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:38.860
What this demo lets you do is
basically customize a player

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.750
and see how it looks.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:44.450
You can see the API calls
that it's making.

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.400
You can also see the embed
code that if you want to

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.660
display that same player on your
own page, that you can

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:59.850
just copy the embed code and
stick it right on your page.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:04.070
If I can do a quick example,
when you get to--

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:08.460
I probably moved our computer,
which I wasn't supposed to do.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.485
If you get to the URL,
it's developers.googl

00:26:10.485 --> 00:26:11.735
e.com/youtube/yo
utube_player_demo.

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:20.870
It just comes with a
video preloaded.

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:25.840
But let's say I want to
instead load a list of

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:30.960
uploaded videos for the Google
Developers user.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:31.640
I can do that.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.180
I can click Update Player.

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:42.705
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:49.030
ANDY DIAMONDSTEIN: You're
seeing that the Google

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:51.910
Developers user's videos
are coming up.

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:55.770
As you scroll down on the page,
you'll see that it's

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:58.130
loaded a playlist of
that user's videos.

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:01.470
Here's all the videos
in the playlist.

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:07.620
If you scroll further down,
you can see all the events

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:11.640
that were triggered and the
function calls that the API

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:16.340
was doing to load that
information.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:20.510
If you scroll down even
further, you can

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:22.160
see the embed code.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.770
And you can just copy this
directly into your page if you

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:30.300
want to show an iFrame Player
that shows a list of the

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.160
Google Developers user's
uploaded videos.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.670
If you want the AS3 Player,
you can use the

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:36.932
Object Embed code.

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:43.840
Again, for me, the goal was
both self-interested--

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.460
I want to make this easier
for myself to test--

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:52.050
but also I want our things to
be accessible to people who

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:55.290
aren't really experienced
programmers.

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:59.450
I think that hopefully, this is
the type of tool that will

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:02.910
be really helpful to those
people, and then also really

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:05.250
helpful to people who are
experienced programmers, but

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:07.280
maybe in a different way--

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:11.890
and just helping those people
be more efficient.

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:20.420
The other thing that this demo
does, if I go ahead and--

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:23.310
you'll see that on the right
here, there's a list of player

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:24.150
parameters.

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:26.680
These are things that you
would use to control the

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.720
display of the player.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.210
So you could say, when my player
loads, what I really

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:37.620
want it to do is start playing
the video immediately, and

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:41.860
instead of using the dark
theme, I want to

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.690
use the light theme.

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:48.360
So you'll see that the
dark bar is here.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.950
When we update it to the
light theme, you should

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:52.930
see a light bar there.

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.010
So we've done that.

00:28:57.010 --> 00:28:59.210
This is the second video
in that playlist.

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:02.980
You can see that it's light and
the video starts playing

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:04.610
automatically.

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:10.040
If you go down here, you'll see
that the embed code has

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:14.740
updated to include those
parameters, so that when you

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:18.670
put this player on your page,
it's going to function with

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:19.920
that functionality.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.000
The goal was to make it easy
to just test things out and

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.660
see how they work.

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:34.340
So you might say, OK, well,
let me play this.

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:36.490
And you'll see that there's
a red bar here.

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:39.120
You might say, I don't
like that red bar.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.420
I want to go with the
white instead.

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:47.685
JEREMY WALKER: I can see
how that would save

00:29:47.685 --> 00:29:49.920
you a lot of time.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:50.490
ANDY DIAMONDSTEIN: And
then you'll see

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:52.270
that it's white there.

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:54.590
Just a way to test things
out really quickly.

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:57.730
And so now that we have that
for the Player, I'd like to

00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:02.250
hopefully have that same type
of functionality for the new

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:04.130
data API as well.

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:04.830
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:07.910
I can see how that would
reduce your time a lot.

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:10.800
I know I've had to do that on
not just video players, but on

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.190
pages when you're trying
to get the look

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:13.710
and feel just right--

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:15.870
refreshing and changing,
editing, refreshing,

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:16.830
refreshing.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:18.150
So that's great.

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:24.120
That should help reduce your
time skinning the player.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:27.050
We covered a lot of changes
which is great.

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:29.320
And these are all coming soon.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:32.390
Is there anything else we
should be looking for?

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:34.780
I feel like there's so much
great stuff coming.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:36.260
I couldn't imagine there
being anything more.

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:39.950
But is there anything
we missed?

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:41.480
JEFFREY POSNICK: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.371
Do you have anything secret?

00:30:44.371 --> 00:30:44.850
ANDY DIAMONDSTEIN: Yeah.

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:48.230
I probably shouldn't
talk about it.

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:49.800
JEREMY WALKER: So you got
the API Explorer.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.810
You've got the Player,
basically,

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:52.970
explorer to edit those.

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:57.070
And then we have dynamic code
that will show up as well as

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:58.350
dynamic documentation.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:01.180
So definitely start checking
that out now and start playing

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:01.920
with it again.

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.230
Check out the API Explorer.

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:04.220
It's really awesome.

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:09.130
And if you're using the Player
API, check out the Player API

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:10.980
demo that he just did.

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:14.490
It'll help you save
a lot of time.

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:16.450
So actually, I was going to talk
a little bit about the

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:18.170
Silicon Valley code camp.

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:21.270
I just did that last week.

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:23.970
I did a presentation
for beginners.

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:27.390
What I basically covered was how
you want to use the Data

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:30.650
API and the Player API--

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:34.270
a lot of what you
guys covered--

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:37.050
the API Explorer and then a
little bit just about the

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:39.490
player in general.

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:42.390
We're going to be
coming around.

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:47.226
A lot of the material that I
covered, it was [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:47.226 --> 00:31:49.680
A lot of the material I covered
is actually in a lot

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:54.880
of these Google Developer
Live meetings we have.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.920
So if this is your first time,
definitely go back through to

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.540
some of the videos and
check them out.

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:02.000
You'll get a lot of that
information if you weren't

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.420
able to show up to
one of these--

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:08.320
whether it was last weekend's
event or any future events.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.505
This is just a quick way that
we wanted to be able to give

00:32:11.505 --> 00:32:13.770
you the same information
without you

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:15.430
having to go to an event.

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:18.550
So definitely check old
videos as well.

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:20.070
Let's see.

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:21.240
Any questions?

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.730
Let's check out the questions
while I'm here.

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:28.090
Actually, Analytics
API, whitelisted.

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:30.380
When will that be
lifted, Jeff?

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:33.340
JEFFREY POSNICK: So we did have
a question about that.

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:36.640
I don't know if it was from
someone anonymous or what.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.390
It was somebody who wanted to
know on the Google Moderator

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:45.070
when the YouTube Analytics API
would be publicly available.

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:46.820
Again, this is not Version 3.

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.310
The data API that we're talking
about now, this is a

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:51.750
separate YouTube
Analytics API.

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:57.160
And for folks who follow us
on Google+ or are on our

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.560
announcement mail group, you
probably got a message earlier

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:04.080
today from me saying that we are
publicly available at this

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.180
point, the Analytics API.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:11.170
So if you had previously tried
to sign up and you've been

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:15.200
waiting on the wait list,
that wait list is gone.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.240
Everybody can go and
turn on the API

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.020
now in the API console.

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:24.770
We have a great set of docs
by Andy [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:28.480
for getting started with
the Analytics API.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:33.010
I think we have one somewhat
complete code sample in the

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:35.740
docs that you can work
through now.

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:38.850
We have that course for Google
Developers Academy that I'm

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:39.760
working on.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.570
We'll have a little bit more
sample code in different

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:46.070
languages coming soon.

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:50.690
It's kind of important to note
that we are launching this API

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:53.190
right now in experimental
mode.

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:57.230
So it's flagged as an
experimental API.

00:33:57.230 --> 00:34:00.900
It has some legal meanings
according to our Terms of

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:05.780
Service which I won't try to
fully interpret in a live

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:09.620
talk, lest I say something
inaccurate.

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:12.120
But we are in experimental
mode.

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:16.230
One of the main things that will
probably be changing with

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:20.500
the API over the next
couple of months--

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:23.330
this hopefully should not be a
breaking change, but what will

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:25.600
be happening is that we're
going to be rolling out

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.370
additional metrics.

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:29.659
So for folks who are looking
through the docs right now,

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:33.070
you'll see a somewhat limited
set of metrics that you can

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:36.650
use in your reports in
comparison to what you can do

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:39.090
via the website right now.

00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:40.880
When you run the YouTube
Analytics report through the

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:44.422
website, there are certain
things that are available that

00:34:44.422 --> 00:34:46.679
you can't do in the API.

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:49.500
That's one of the criteria
for moving out of

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.250
experimental mode.

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:55.179
Once we do add in those
additional metrics and we have

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:58.070
more parity, I think you'll
see the experimental label

00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:04.300
drop and it'll be a fully
launched, supported API.

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.510
But I don't want to scare
people away with the

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:07.360
experimental label.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.720
Definitely get out there and
start trying things out.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.695
Let us know what your
feedback is.

00:35:13.695 --> 00:35:16.430
We're still early enough with
the life of the API that your

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:20.570
feedback really matters and can
affect design decisions

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:21.830
and things like that.

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:26.420
So let us know probably via
the Issue Tracker with any

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:27.955
future requests or
bug reports.

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:34.660
If you have any general
questions about using the API,

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:36.860
programming-type questions,
you should use Stack

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.286
Overflow for that.

00:35:39.286 --> 00:35:41.000
Don't use that for feature
requests or for

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.070
bug reports, though.

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:45.190
It's more like, how
do I do this?

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:47.760
And you give me a sample code,
and I'll say hey, you need to

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.520
change X-Y-Z.

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:52.200
JEREMY WALKER: That's
good to hear.

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.490
I'm excited for that.

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:55.220
JEFFREY POSNICK: Yeah, me too.

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:56.140
JEREMY WALKER: All right.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:36:00.240
The last question is
Google Developers--

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.190
are we hiring?

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:03.150
The question is yes.

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:06.390
If you're interested in being a
developer advocate or being

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:08.870
in a developer relations
role, just check out

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:12.150
developer.google.com/jobs.

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:15.550
There's a lot of positions open
including, I believe, a

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:16.620
YouTube one.

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:18.730
So definitely if you're
interested, check that out.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.490
ANDY DIAMONDSTEIN: We are also
looking for tech writers.

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:24.580
JEREMY WALKER: Oh.

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:27.290
Great.

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:29.270
That doesn't mean Andy's
leaving, though.

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:31.110
ANDY DIAMONDSTEIN: No.

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:35.240
JEFFREY POSNICK: This is all
part of a very elaborate prank

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.180
which we make Andy
[INAUDIBLE].

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:37.625
ANDY DIAMONDSTEIN: This
is hilarious, guys.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:41.550
JEREMY WALKER: All
right, Andy.

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:43.480
Thanks a lot for taking
the time to join us.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:48.600
We really appreciate giving us
a preview of all the exciting

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.770
things that are coming.

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:53.770
I really look forward to the
next quarter and seeing a lot

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:55.160
of things roll out.

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:57.310
So thanks, everyone,
for joining us.

00:36:57.310 --> 00:37:00.190
Thanks, Jeff, too, for all the
great information and we will

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:03.000
see you here next week.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.800
Bye.
