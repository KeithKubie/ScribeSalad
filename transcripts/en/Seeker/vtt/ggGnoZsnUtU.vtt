00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.740
A new study finds that healthy foods are three
times more expensive than unhealthy foods.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.049
You know what, screw this, I’m going to
McDonalds.

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:17.980
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and I dunno
about you guys, but one of the excuses people

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.480
always love to give for eating like crap,
is that it’s more expensive to eat healthy

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.730
than it is to eat unhealthy.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.160
And naturally, I assumed it was just that
- an excuse.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.350
But apparently, it’s actually true - and
according to a new study out of the UK, healthy

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.320
food is three times more expensive per calories,
than less healthy foods.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.320
Who knew?

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.000
This was a study published recently in PLOS
One, that tracked the prices of 94 key food

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.250
and beverage items from 2002 to 2012.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.930
Now to clarify, these are foods you would
find at any supermarket - so we’re not talking

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.660
about McDonalds or Taco Bell, which are definitely
more expensive.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.860
These are foods specifically used by the UK’s
Office of National Statistics, to measure

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.370
the rate of inflation year over year.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.180
Researchers then matched the prices of those
foods, with their caloric content - and classified

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.580
them as either healthy or unhealthy, based
on their nutritional value.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.010
What they found, is that not only have the
prices of food risen in the UK faster than

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.810
the price of other goods, healthy foods specifically
have experienced a much sharper price hike

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.850
in recent years: about $2.95 for every thousand
calories, compared to unhealthy foods which

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.420
have only risen $1.17 in the same amount of
time.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.659
So each year, healthy foods are getting progressively
more expensive.

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.690
And studies from other high-income nations
have found similar results.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.710
Obviously, for countries with obesity epidemics,
like the US and especially the UK, where obesity

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.560
is one of the leading causes of preventable
deaths, it’s important that people realize

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.550
the effects of eating unhealthily.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.130
According to the National Health Service,
diet-related health problems cost an estimated

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.280
9 trillion dollars every year.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.630
But for households that are straddling the
poverty line, it can be difficult to convince

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.090
people that spending more money now on eating
healthy, will actually pay off in the long

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.090
run.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.200
So the researchers in this study, are calling
on public health officials to address the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.729
rising prices of healthy foods, in hopes that
they’ll regulate them - and provide subsidies

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.930
to those in need - for the good of the nation’s
health.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.470
What do you guys think?

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.500
Especially those of you on a tight budget
- does the price of food influence how healthy

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.500
you eat?

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.969
Let us know your thoughts in the comments
below - and as always, thank you guys for

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:16.349
watching!
