00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.170
- So we have different definitions

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.600
for d of t on the left and the right

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.210
and let's say that d is
distance and t is time,

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.700
so this is giving us our
distance as a function of time,

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.620
on the left, it's equal to 3t plus one

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.180
and you can see the graph
of how distance is changing

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.760
as a function of time here is a line

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.230
and just as a review from algebra,

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.120
the rate of change of a line,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.550
we refer to as the slope of a
line and we can figure it out,

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.500
we can figure out, well,
for any change in time,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.450
what is our change in distance?

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.367
And so in this situation,

00:00:37.367 --> 00:00:40.890
if we're going from time
equal one to time equal two,

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.786
our change in time,
delta t is equal to one

00:00:44.786 --> 00:00:47.030
and what is our change in distance?

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.260
We go from distance is
equal to four meters,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.760
at time equals one,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.110
to distance in seven
meters at time equal two

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.836
and so our change in distance
here is equal to three

00:00:58.836 --> 00:01:00.410
and if we wanna put our units,

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.560
it's three meters for
every one second in time

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.310
and so our slope would be
our change in our vertical

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.297
divided by our change in our horizontal,

00:01:09.297 --> 00:01:13.471
which would be change in
d, delta d over delta t,

00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:15.507
which is equal to three over one

00:01:15.507 --> 00:01:19.679
or we could just write that
as three meters per second

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:22.590
and you might recognize this as a rate,

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.970
if you're thinking about
your change in distance

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.620
over change in time,
this rate right over here

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.460
is going to be your speed.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.760
This is all a review of
what you've seen before

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.890
and what's interesting about a line,

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.180
or if we're talking
about a linear function,

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.120
is that your rate does
not change at any point,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.810
the slope of this line
between any two points

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.500
is always going to be three,

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.670
but what's interesting about
this function on the right

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.260
is that is not true,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.690
our rate of change is constantly changing

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.852
and we're going to study
that in a lot more depth,

00:01:52.852 --> 00:01:55.160
when we get to differential calculus

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.840
and really this video's a little bit

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.350
of a foundational primer
for that future state,

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.870
where we learn about differential calculus

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.390
and the thing to appreciate here

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.010
is think about the instantaneous
rate of change someplace,

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.490
so let's say right over there,

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.260
if you ever think about
the slope of a line,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.640
that just barely touches this graph,

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.420
it might look something like that,

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.760
the slope of a tangent line

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.840
and then right over here,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.360
it looks like it's a little bit steeper

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.800
and then over here, it looks
like it's a little bit steeper,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.350
so it looks like your rate of change

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.790
is increasing as t increases.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.580
As I mentioned, we will build the tools

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.950
to later think about
instantaneous rate of change,

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.050
but what we can start to think about

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.800
is an average rate of change,

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.960
average rate

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.740
of change,

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.024
and the way that we think about
our average rate of change

00:02:41.024 --> 00:02:44.700
is we use the same tools, that
we first learned in algebra,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.480
we think about slopes of secant lines,

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.010
what is a secant line?

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.080
Well, we talk about this in geometry,

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.810
that a secant is something
that intersects a curve

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.160
in two points, so let's
say that there's a line,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.030
that intersects at t equals
zero and t equals one

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.590
and so let me draw that
line, I'll draw it in orange,

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.830
so this right over here is a secant line

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.100
and you could do the
slope of the secant line

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.020
as the average rate of change

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.068
from t equals zero to t equals one,

00:03:16.068 --> 00:03:19.740
well, what is that average
rate of change going to be?

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.442
Well, the slope of our
secant line is going to be

00:03:21.442 --> 00:03:25.660
our change in distance
divided by our change in time,

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.962
which is going to be equal to,

00:03:26.962 --> 00:03:31.310
well, our change in time is one second,

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.238
one, I'll put the units here, one second

00:03:33.238 --> 00:03:35.420
and what is our change in distance?

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.098
At t equals zero or d of zero is one

00:03:40.098 --> 00:03:41.600
and d of one is two,

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.050
so our distance has
increased by one meter,

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.375
so we've gone one meter in one second

00:03:46.375 --> 00:03:49.170
or we could say that our
average rate of change

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.340
over that first second from t equals zero,

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.532
t equals one is one meter per second,

00:03:54.532 --> 00:03:56.430
but let's think about what it is,

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.920
if we're going from t equals two

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.100
to t equals three.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.440
Well, once again, we can
look at this secant line

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.200
and we can figure out its slope,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.150
so the slope here,
which you could also use

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.620
the average rate of change

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.180
from t equals two to t equals three,

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.030
as I already mentioned,

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.315
the rate of change seems
to be constantly changing,

00:04:17.315 --> 00:04:20.000
but we can think about
the average rate of change

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.170
and so that's going to
be our change in distance

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.170
over our change in time,

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.730
which is going to be equal
to when t is equal to two,

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.430
our distance is equal to five,

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.910
so one, two, three, four, five,

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.840
so that's five right over there

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.066
and when t is equal to three,
our distance is equal to 10,

00:04:40.066 --> 00:04:44.750
six, seven, eight, nine, 10,
so that is 10 right over there,

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.185
so our change in time, that's
pretty straightforward,

00:04:47.185 --> 00:04:50.230
we've just gone forward one
second, so that's one second

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.787
and then our change in
distance right over here,

00:04:51.787 --> 00:04:55.560
we go from five meters to
10 meters is five meters,

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.070
so this is equal to five meters per second

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.660
and so this makes it very clear,

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.030
that our average rate
of change has changed

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.880
from t equals zero, t equals one

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.320
to t equals two to t equals three,

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.920
our average rate of change is higher

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.690
on this second interval,
than on this first one

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:14.825
and as you can imagine,

00:05:14.825 --> 00:05:16.790
something very interesting to think about

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.940
is what if you were to take the slope

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.746
of the secant line of
closer and closer points?

00:05:21.746 --> 00:05:23.880
Well, then you would get closer and closer

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.820
to approximating that
slope of the tangent line

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.653
and that's actually what we
will do when we get to calculus.
