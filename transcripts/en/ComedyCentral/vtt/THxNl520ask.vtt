00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:08.274
(hard industrial rock)

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:19.352 align:start position:0%
- I'm here in front of the
Comfort Inn in Alton, Illinois.

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:21.287 line:0%
On the houseboat
in the parking lot.

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:25.158 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
I have a rash between
my balls and my asshole.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:27.293
(laughter)

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:28.595
Guys, let me just
explain something.

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:31.031
Wetsuit etiquette, you
pee in your wetsuit,

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.832
it's just a thing
you do, all right?

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:34.934 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's great, it's the only
time you get to pee in pants.

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:38.571
Now normally I'm in the water
when I'm wearing a wetsuit.

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:42.008 align:start size:97% position:3%
What I've never done is peed
in a wetsuit and then sat

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:45.512 align:start size:84% position:16%
on a jet ski for eight
hours, totally dry.

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:49.883 align:start size:84% position:16%
Because then what
happens next morning,

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:52.185 align:start position:0%
wake up and it looks like
someone's taken a cheese grater

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:54.354 align:start size:88% position:13%
to inside of your thighs
and your butt-hole.

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:55.188
Right?

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:56.790
That's right! Yeah!

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:05.098 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You wanna cover the rash
and everything surrounding it.

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:06.566
- Ugh.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.736 align:start size:97% position:3%
And then even worse, you have
to have another grown man

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:13.273 align:start size:94% position:6%
help you apply ointment
to your balls and asshole.

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:15.275 align:start size:88% position:13%
- We're gonna apply
this a few times today.

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:16.676
- Oh, wow, a lot.

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:19.612
- All right, let's go.

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:21.448
We are fucking late.

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:25.118
(rollicking western guitar)

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:33.393
We've launched!

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:34.861
Yeah!

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:36.362
Mississippi River!

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:39.232
Take me to your lover!

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:52.479 align:start size:97% position:3%
First day of the trip,
fucking disaster, all right?

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.982
Ran out of gas, stuck in
a lock, butt-hole rash,

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:58.885 align:start size:97% position:3%
we didn't even make it half
as far as we needed to.

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:02.322 align:start position:0%
So day two, we need to
seriously make up for lost time.

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:06.192
I needed to meet Jon Daly to
do a lunchtime comedy show

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:10.130
in St. Louis, which
was 80 miles away.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.999 align:start size:88% position:13%
Now, 80 miles in a car,
it's nothing, easy.

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:15.768 align:start size:88% position:13%
But 80 miles of jet
ski on the Mississippi?

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:18.705
Riding a jet ski 80 miles
is kinda like straddling

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:22.275 align:start size:97% position:3%
a horrible bucking horse
that shoots industrial waste

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:24.043
out of its own asshole.

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:27.447
It becomes a battle
against the river.

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:31.284
What do you need when you're
battling a force of nature?

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:33.086
Human companionship.

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:34.621
Wait a second, who's that?

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:35.588
Oh, shit!

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:37.357
It's Jon Daly!

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:38.191
- Ahhhh!

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.927
Let's go to St. Louis!

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:42.695
- Let's go to St. Louis!

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:45.932
(emotional rock music)

00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:51.471
- Oh man, I love you America!

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.979
Welcome to St. Louis!

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:01.147
We made it!

00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:02.982
The Windy City!

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:04.918
Arch, Arch, Arch, Arch!

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:07.921
- [Both] Arch! Arch! Arch!

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:12.158
(driving country rock)

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:18.298 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Get some petroleum
jelly on them?

00:03:18.298 --> 00:03:19.532
- Supposed to dry it out,

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:20.867
but I don't know
why you would want

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:23.436
to dry your ball area out.

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:25.238 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I have a theory about
you, and I think it's true.

00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:26.072
- Really?

00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:27.307
What?

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:28.441
- You wanna make
your balls famous.

00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:29.676
(laughter)

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:31.277
You want everyone in the world

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:32.712
to know how big your balls are.

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:34.914 align:start size:97% position:3%
- It's one of the most
interesting things about me.

00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:36.983
- Well now it's an open secret.

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:39.452 align:start size:97% position:3%
- This is the water that
makes the horrible smell here.

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:41.521 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Does all St. Louis
smell like shit garbage,

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:43.423 align:start size:84% position:16%
or just this one
alley that we chose?

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:45.925 align:start size:97% position:3%
- It's definitely the one
alley we chose to walk down.

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:46.859
Ready to do this?

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.061 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Yeah.
- All right.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:50.029 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Never been more ready
to do jet ski show.

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:51.598
- After you, buddy.
- Thank you sir.

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:55.101
- [Announcer] Give it up
for our dude, Jon Daly.

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:57.637
(audience cheers)

00:03:57.637 --> 00:03:58.438
- Oh yeah!

00:03:58.438 --> 00:03:59.272
Hey!

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:00.206
How's it going?

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:02.242
Big Daddy, give it up!

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:04.844
All right, thank so
much for coming out!

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:06.279
You enjoying those ribs?

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:07.380
- [Audience Man] Oh yeah!

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.514
- Oh yeah!

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:10.350
Got those ribs and bibs.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.685
For every rib you eat today,

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:16.422
there's a person in Africa
that is not eating a rib.

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:18.491
(laughter)

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:23.229
The importance of what we're
doing cannot be overstated.

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.498
We're here because
of Kurt Braunohler,

00:04:25.498 --> 00:04:27.533
the Bono of the new century.

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:31.037
This guy's taking over, he's
Bono without that dumb accent.

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:34.440
And he's not all slick and
Hollywood and full of shit!

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.345 align:start position:0%
Wearing dumb sunglasses and
getting out of limos like this.

00:04:39.345 --> 00:04:42.181
(audience laughs)

00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:45.852
Enjoy your ribs,
and wear your bibs.

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:48.488 align:start size:97% position:3%
Here he is, one of the best
people I've ever known,

00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:49.822
Kurt Braunohler.

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:53.359
Ladies and gentlemen, Jon Daly!

00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:57.430
Guys, thank you so
much for coming out.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.865
Hello!

00:04:58.865 --> 00:05:00.633 align:start size:94% position:6%
Guys, I did some
research about St. Louis,

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.168 align:start size:81% position:19%
and I dunno if you
guys knew this.

00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:06.072
In 2012, 150 people were
murdered in St. Louis.

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:11.978
But in 2013, only 120 people
were murdered in St. Louis.

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:14.947
(audience applauds)

00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:16.883
Get your shit together!

00:05:16.883 --> 00:05:19.285
This show is for you,

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:23.356 align:start position:0%
the 30 people who were not
murdered in St. Louis this year.

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:25.191
(audience laughs)

00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:26.993
You did it, St. Louis!

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:31.698 align:start size:88% position:13%
And I wanna propose
something to all of you

00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:33.733
who are here with us right now.

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:36.369
I'm gonna do a publicity
stunt to get the word out

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:37.737
about this charity effort.

00:05:37.737 --> 00:05:40.773
So I want you guys, the
30 people not murdered

00:05:40.773 --> 00:05:45.645
in St. Louis this year, to pull
Jon Daly and I on a jet ski,

00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:47.680
underneath the St. Louis Arch.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.349
(laughter)

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.183
Who's in?

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:52.051
(audience cheers)

00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:53.720
All right, half of you are in!

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.321
That's enough!

00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:57.490
Let's go to the Arch soon!

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:03.196
(the storm rumbles)

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:06.632
(foreboding electronica)

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:09.369
- [Minnow] Hey guys.

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:10.803
- [Man] What's up?

00:06:10.803 --> 00:06:12.538 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
- [Kurt] Our jet ski arrived
before we were ready.

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:14.073 line:0%
- We got busted.

00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:16.909 line:0%
- We're getting in trouble
with the Parks Department.

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:18.144
It's for Comedy Central,

00:06:18.144 --> 00:06:20.980
it's a charity show
called Roustabout.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.249
So here we are, we're just
trying to get media attention

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:25.017
for the whole charity
effort, all right?

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:27.720
And it never occurs to
us that, I don't know,

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.990
maybe the National Parks
Service might worry about

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.194 align:start position:0%
a bunch of weirdos wheeling
stuff under a national monument.

00:06:35.194 --> 00:06:36.562
Maybe they think we're towing

00:06:36.562 --> 00:06:38.998
a hilarious jet ski shaped bomb.

00:06:38.998 --> 00:06:40.099
(audience laughs)

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:42.201
But, we're gonna get it done.

00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:44.704
- Pull it through, but we
pull it through illegally.

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:46.506
- Yeah, let's talk to them.

00:06:46.506 --> 00:06:48.040
- Hey, I'm Kurt.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.742
Hey nice to meet you man.

00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:51.244
Yeah, so--

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:53.212
- This is when he's gotta
work that Braunohler magic.

00:06:53.212 --> 00:06:54.847
- Yeah, work that
Braunohler charm.

00:06:54.847 --> 00:06:56.315
- The whole thing is about like,

00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:58.284 align:start size:97% position:3%
what's the dumbest way to
make the world a better place,

00:06:58.284 --> 00:06:59.986
and so we were gonna make
the world a better place

00:06:59.986 --> 00:07:02.221 align:start size:94% position:6%
in St. Louis by jet
skiing underneath the Arch

00:07:02.221 --> 00:07:03.890 align:start size:84% position:16%
and kind of
celebrating St. Louis.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.658
We just literally
just wanna like,

00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:07.093
roll it through and that's it.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:08.261
(thunder cracks)

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:10.596
- Holy shit!
(laughter)

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:12.732
Wow, that was insane.

00:07:12.732 --> 00:07:14.200 align:start size:84% position:16%
- And we're sitting
there, we're all like,

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.101
no way is this happening.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.002
What's your name again?

00:07:16.002 --> 00:07:16.836
Jay, Kurt.

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:18.337
Thank you so much man.

00:07:18.337 --> 00:07:22.642 align:start size:97% position:3%
And then this guy Jay, is just
like, sure, we can do that!

00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:24.343
Right on, Jay!

00:07:24.343 --> 00:07:27.246
(epic orchestral music)

00:07:27.246 --> 00:07:29.482
(laughter)

00:07:30.716 --> 00:07:33.019
I can't believe this
is actually happening.

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:34.220 align:start size:81% position:19%
- [Crew Man] Heads
up, everybody.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.355
- St. Louis, we love ya!

00:07:36.355 --> 00:07:37.457
- Woo!

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:39.392
(laughter)

00:07:39.392 --> 00:07:42.061
- Now it was time to
break a world record,

00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:46.232
and jet ski two comedians
under the St. Louis Arch.

00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:48.634
(laughter)

00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:50.736
The first to jet
ski under the Arch!

00:07:50.736 --> 00:07:51.838
- [Jon] Yeah!

00:07:51.838 --> 00:07:52.705 align:start size:84% position:16%
We're under the Arch!
- St. Louis!

00:07:52.705 --> 00:07:53.873
We did it for you!

00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:56.375
- [Jon] We're under the Arch!

00:07:56.375 --> 00:08:00.580 align:start position:0%
- Now, this seemed like a great
idea when we thought it up.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.814 align:start size:84% position:16%
- There's children!
- What?

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:04.684 align:start size:84% position:16%
To be honest,
nobody gave a shit.

00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:06.719
The only person who
was excited about it

00:08:06.719 --> 00:08:08.888
was a six year old girl
who didn't even know

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:11.824
what the fuck was going on.

00:08:11.824 --> 00:08:13.192
- [Crew Man] Whoa.

00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:15.261
(laughter)

00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:19.432
But hey, sometimes you gotta
have bad ideas, all right?

00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:23.936
Here's the four people from
St. Louis that showed up!

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:25.438 align:start size:81% position:19%
Although I did
make some friends.

00:08:25.438 --> 00:08:27.373
Yeah, big hug, big group hug!

00:08:27.373 --> 00:08:29.809
Including a nice homeless
man who just really seemed

00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:31.377
like he wanted a hug.

00:08:31.377 --> 00:08:32.345
- [Homeless Man] Thank you!

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:33.279
It has been real!

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:34.747
- One two three, St. Louis!

00:08:34.747 --> 00:08:36.249
- [All] St. Louis!

00:08:37.583 --> 00:08:38.484
- STL baby!

00:08:39.719 --> 00:08:41.220
- Stay close to the shore.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.655
Watch out for the bodies.

00:08:42.655 --> 00:08:43.756 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Watch for the bodies?
- Bodies?

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:44.991
- And cor-uhps.

00:08:44.991 --> 00:08:45.925
- Do the bodies
go in the middle?

00:08:45.925 --> 00:08:46.792
- I couldn't tell you that.

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:48.194
(laughter)

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:50.463
- In short, the Arch.

00:08:50.463 --> 00:08:51.764
Nailed it.

00:08:51.764 --> 00:08:55.368
(ringing guitar chord)

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:58.771
(heavy industrial music)

00:09:12.485 --> 00:09:14.620 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Okay, so the Arch
was a bad idea.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.088
But you know what's a good idea?

00:09:16.088 --> 00:09:17.690
You, clicking on this link,

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:19.425
and donating to
Heifer right now!

00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:20.693
Do it!

00:09:20.693 --> 00:09:22.428
Give some money to
these good people.

00:09:22.428 --> 00:09:23.262
Come on!
