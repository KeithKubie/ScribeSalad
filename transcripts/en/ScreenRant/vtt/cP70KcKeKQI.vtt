00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.650
The X-Men Universe is still going strong,
with not just solo stories following some

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.430
of the most fan-favorite characters, but massive
event films calling on nearly every character

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.700
in the X-Men movies.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.430
And as the stakes get higher, the action gets
more elaborate - which means more amazing

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.259
mistakes and unbelievable errors slip through
for fans to enjoy.

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.310
We've run down some of our favorites in our
latest rapid-fire dose of trivia, Know Your

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.110
Movies: 15 Most Shocking Mistakes From X-Men
Movies.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.620
X-Men
Fans may never know why Wolverine's metal

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.010
claws and bone claws look so different, but
we know this much: audiences weren't supposed

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.660
to see the screws in them in the first movie.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.050
Cyclops may have an awesome power, but he
needs to manually fire his optic blasts by

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.710
pressing his visor - except in the movie's
opening, when it fires a controlled blast

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.720
all by itself.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.730
It turns out Magneto can't just control metal
- he can control time itself, going by the

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.040
reversed footage sold out by the exhaust flowing
back into a police cruiser's tailpipe.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.720
Most comic fans have a hard time remembering
Iceman's real name - including his co-star,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.720
Anna Paquin.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.990
When the two meet on a school bench, the word
"Bobby" is heard, even though she's clearing

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.820
saying "Shawn," as in actor Shawn Ashmore.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.939
X-Men 2
Watching Wolverine take a bullet to the head,

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.049
and then watching his body push it out is
unforgettable.

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.789
Until you realize his skull is made of the
world's toughest metal, meaning the bullet

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:31.909
wouldn't have had anywhere near enough flesh
to lodge in, and should have just ricocheted.

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.319
When Mystique tries to romance Wolverine pretending
to be Jean Grey, it's her scars that give

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:39.389
her away - scars made by his claws in the
first movie.

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:43.049
But the scars are now lined up vertically
along her stomach - not horizontally, like

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.130
they clearly were in the first movie.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.920
Nightcrawler's teleporting helps him rescue
kidnapped children, but instead of filming

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.250
the scene twice, they did it once - which
means even before he BAMFs into the cell,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.380
you can spot his silhouette in the shadows.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.039
X-Men 3
Wolverine might heal, but apparently his clothes

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:01.039
do, too.

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.560
Judging by the bloody holes torn in his undershirt
by a pair of bone horns (1:06:00) - which

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.579
completely disappear later in the scene.

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.110
During the final battle on Alcatraz Island,
overhead images show the Golden Gate bridging

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.930
easily reaching from the shore.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.560
That's because the island in the image is
actually way bigger, and closer than in real

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.519
life - Google it yourself.

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.120
Mutants have powers, but they can't all read.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.290
Not Pyro anyway, who gets Multiple Man's cell
number wrong, despite the fact that he's standing

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.030
right in front of it.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.319
X-Men: First Class
When Hank McCoy is teaching Banshee to use

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.810
his scream to fly, he gives an easy instruction.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.659
Oh, make the sound waves travel faster than
sound, that totally makes sense.

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:38.659
Add another superpower to Magneto's list,
since he's able to not just throw an armed

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.459
guard into the air, but apparently keep him
flying into the stratosphere, since he never

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.349
drops back to Earth again.

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:45.860
He will be missed.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.540
X-Men: Days of Future Past
The effects team of Days of Future Past painstakingly

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.620
recreated Robert F Kennedy Stadium in Washington,
down to the groundskeeper painting the baseball

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.620
diamond.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.439
But nobody double checked the year: in 1973
the Senators had already become the Texas

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:04.460
Rangers, leaving it only for the NFL's Redskins.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.180
The Paris Peace Accords play a major role
in the story, but the famous signing took

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.909
place in January of 1973 - but you won't find
any snow anywhere in the film.

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:17.599
Wolverine uses his bone claws to keep Magneto
from reading about those same Peace Accords

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.750
- but he wasn't missing much: the opening
paragraph is taken straight from the agreement's

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.520
Wikipedia page.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.430
Those are some of our favorite mistakes, leaving
us wondering how they never got caught - and

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.969
adding another reason to rewatch the old movies,
as well as the new.

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:32.159
Which ones have we missed?
