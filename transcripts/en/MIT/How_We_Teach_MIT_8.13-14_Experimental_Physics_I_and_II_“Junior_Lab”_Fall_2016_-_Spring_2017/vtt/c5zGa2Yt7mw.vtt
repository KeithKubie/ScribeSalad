GUNTHER ROLAND: The
writing skills are, I

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.860
think of, essential importance
for any of the physics majors

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.710
here.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.170
It doesn't do you
much good if you

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.496
do the science just for itself.

00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:18.870
You want to tell
people about it,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.500
and you want to
be able to do that

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.860
in a professional
manner that really

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.620
gets the appropriate
appreciation

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.090
for your scientific work.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.390
And to do that, you
need to understand

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.280
what is really the
form of communication

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.520
that scientists, physicists use.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.050
And that is, I think, one of
the key elements in junior lab--

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.620
to really explain
how this is done,

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.730
and then through practice,
really develop that skill.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.720
So two of the things that the
students do in 8.13 and 8.14,

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.490
in addition to performing
the experiments, is to,

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.620
A, give 15-minute presentations
on the experiments

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.110
in the style of an
APS parallel session

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.340
and write four-page papers on
each experiment in the style

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.960
of Physical Review Letter.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.400
And I think there are
two elements to this.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.340
And one is, of course, that this
is a large part of their grade.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.270
So this is a skill
that we judge.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.730
But I think it is also a
skill that the students really

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.880
develop in 8.13 and 8.14.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.860
Most of them, before
joining the lab,

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.360
have never written a paper.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.020
And many of them have not given
presentations in that style

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.650
before.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.400
Some of them have.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.170
Some of them haven't.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.360
And so this is a skill
that they get to practice.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.300
It's a skill that they
really need later on.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.905
And it's also something
that many of them

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:50.260
are rather worried about
when starting the class.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.030
One of our teaching--

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.290
one of our writing
instructors likes to say,

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.290
fear of public speaking
is one of the top fears

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.600
that people list when asked what
they are really worried about.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.190
And what we tell the students,
and what they really find out

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.310
during the class, is
that public speaking

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.920
is a skill that you can really
perfect through practice.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.200
And for me as an
instructor-- and I hope also

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.530
for the students-- seeing
the progression of them

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.652
during the semester
from really not knowing

00:02:22.652 --> 00:02:24.610
what to do with the 15
minutes of speaking time

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.420
to having professional
presentations at the very end

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.050
is really one of the most
gratifying things in 8.13,

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.700
and then later in 8.14, to see
how much their skill really

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.510
improves over the course
of three, four months.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.290
So there are many
ways in which we

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.440
try to help the students really
develop these communication

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.990
skills.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.160
One is, of course,
instruction and examples.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.850
Before they do their
first presentation,

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.920
then they give the presentation.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.680
They meet with the
writing instructors

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.620
afterwards to go
over the presentation

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.850
and get feedback from them.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.200
Typically, what we do is we
have 15-minute presentations

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.780
and then a 15-minute
question and answer session

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.100
that we also use to give
feedback on the presentations.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.900
And then at the very
end of the semester,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.560
the students take their favorite
of the three presentations

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.170
they gave during the
semester, refine it a bit,

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.220
and then give it in front
of the whole class--

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.830
again, after getting feedback
from the writing instructor.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.320
So there's a lot of
practice, and there's

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.440
a lot of back and forth between
the students, the writing

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.060
instructors, and the lab staff.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.610
In 8.13, obviously, at the
beginning of the semester,

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.660
there's an extremely
wide spectrum

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.360
in terms of their
communication skills.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.690
Some people are
just naturally more

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.720
inclined to talk to
a large audience,

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.070
to present themselves,
whereas others

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.620
are mortified doing that.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.250
And I think by the end
of 8.13, that spread

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.650
becomes much narrower.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.570
Of course, not everybody
will have the same spirit

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.230
when giving a presentation.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.780
But I think by the
end of 8.13, everybody

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.149
is at a level where they
have no problem giving

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:19.209
a 15-minute professional
presentation.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.810
I think 8.14, the
focus really moves

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.840
from just being able to
fill the 15 minutes somehow

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.340
to a much more
detailed discussion

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.910
of the professional elements
of the presentations--

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.800
the uncertainty analysis,
really the depth

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.890
in which they examine the
data that they've taken,

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.820
and the sophistication
of the analysis methods.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.940
I think that is more
of the focus in 8.14

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.390
after 8.13 has really
prepared them to--

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.900
just the basic tools.
