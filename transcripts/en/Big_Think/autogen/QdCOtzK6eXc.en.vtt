developed a whole expertise of being

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309
developed a whole expertise of being
 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:44.979
developed a whole expertise of being
able to set up health plans and

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989
able to set up health plans and
 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.740

insurance and housing and you know labor

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750
insurance and housing and you know labor

insurance and housing and you know labor
was really entrepreneurial because it

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789
was really entrepreneurial because it
 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:51.970
was really entrepreneurial because it
had to take care of its own members and

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980
had to take care of its own members and
 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.250
had to take care of its own members and
one of the biggest problems is that the

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260
one of the biggest problems is that the
 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.740
one of the biggest problems is that the
UAW negotiated for health and pension

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750
UAW negotiated for health and pension
 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.340
UAW negotiated for health and pension
and then it was delivered by you know

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350
and then it was delivered by you know
 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.040
and then it was delivered by you know
big insurance carriers and the big

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050
big insurance carriers and the big
 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.770
big insurance carriers and the big
problem is this runaway costs and the

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780
problem is this runaway costs and the
 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.749
problem is this runaway costs and the
inflation associated with health care

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759
inflation associated with health care
 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.650
inflation associated with health care
and so that's one of the reasons why it

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660
and so that's one of the reasons why it
 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.109
and so that's one of the reasons why it
became very expensive if let's say there

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119
became very expensive if let's say there
 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.440
became very expensive if let's say there

practitioners and physicians assistants
 

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:21.999
practitioners and physicians assistants
and there was like real attention to

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009
and there was like real attention to
 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.639
and there was like real attention to
wellness and attention to diabetes and

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649
wellness and attention to diabetes and
 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.730
wellness and attention to diabetes and
obesity and high blood pressure and we

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740
obesity and high blood pressure and we
 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.139
obesity and high blood pressure and we
really managed it we did these

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149
really managed it we did these
 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.749
really managed it we did these
innovative things if a union has the

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759
innovative things if a union has the
 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.449
innovative things if a union has the
membership and has the control over its

00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:34.459
membership and has the control over its
 

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:38.650
membership and has the control over its
own business of the insurance it's going

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660

to see to it that the members get those
 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.639
to see to it that the members get those
things because their economic interests

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649
things because their economic interests
 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.859
things because their economic interests
are aligned when you're just negotiating

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869
are aligned when you're just negotiating

are aligned when you're just negotiating
for it you don't really care all you

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580
for it you don't really care all you
 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.540
for it you don't really care all you
know is that this is how much that piece

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550
know is that this is how much that piece
 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.260
know is that this is how much that piece
of insurance or that pension costs and

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270
of insurance or that pension costs and
 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.370
of insurance or that pension costs and
you just want to make sure that the

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380
you just want to make sure that the
 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.290
you just want to make sure that the
workers not bearing that cost and I

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300
workers not bearing that cost and I
 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.850
workers not bearing that cost and I
don't I'd say that the problem is that

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860
don't I'd say that the problem is that
 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.010
don't I'd say that the problem is that
labor was one piece of a whole system

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020
labor was one piece of a whole system
 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.279
labor was one piece of a whole system
that wasn't managing those costs but it

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289
that wasn't managing those costs but it
 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.229
that wasn't managing those costs but it
was never asked to manage those costs in

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:05.239
was never asked to manage those costs in
 

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:09.330
was never asked to manage those costs in
the collective bargaining system

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340
 
 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.460
 
you know i would say that in the 80s was

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470
you know i would say that in the 80s was
 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.140
you know i would say that in the 80s was
really you know if you remember back to

really you know if you remember back to
 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.229
really you know if you remember back to
nineteen eighty or 81 or 82 with packed

oh you know ronald reagan came in and

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069
oh you know ronald reagan came in and
 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.470
oh you know ronald reagan came in and
made sure that that was you know one of

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480
made sure that that was you know one of
 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.020
made sure that that was you know one of
the top items on his agenda and when you

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030
the top items on his agenda and when you
 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.490
the top items on his agenda and when you
look at what happened to labor you know

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500
look at what happened to labor you know
 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.990
look at what happened to labor you know
that there definitely is a connection

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000
that there definitely is a connection
 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.220
that there definitely is a connection
between that and the way our labor laws

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230
between that and the way our labor laws
 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.059
between that and the way our labor laws
work you know if you are an employer in

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069
work you know if you are an employer in

the middle of an organizing Drive it

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230
the middle of an organizing Drive it
 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.100
the middle of an organizing Drive it
makes very good sense to fire the the

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110
makes very good sense to fire the the
 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.809
makes very good sense to fire the the
key workers because there's no penalty

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819
key workers because there's no penalty
 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.729
key workers because there's no penalty
the penalty means that the worker

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739
the penalty means that the worker
 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.680
the penalty means that the worker
eventually might get their job back and

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690
eventually might get their job back and
 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.930
eventually might get their job back and
you just have to quote make them whole

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940
you just have to quote make them whole
 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.970
you just have to quote make them whole
and what make them whole means is just

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980
and what make them whole means is just
 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.949
and what make them whole means is just
pay them back with inflation there's not

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959
pay them back with inflation there's not
 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.920
pay them back with inflation there's not
any real damage to it whereas if you're

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930
any real damage to it whereas if you're
 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.860
any real damage to it whereas if you're
an employer and you don't pay wages the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870
an employer and you don't pay wages the
 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.600
an employer and you don't pay wages the
department of labor will come after you

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610
department of labor will come after you
 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.979
department of labor will come after you
and there are potentially criminal

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989
and there are potentially criminal
 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.750
and there are potentially criminal
charges attached to that so clearly

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760
charges attached to that so clearly
 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.129
charges attached to that so clearly
we've had a government that has not

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:14.139
we've had a government that has not
 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.410
we've had a government that has not
necessarily wanted to see the rise of

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420
necessarily wanted to see the rise of
 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.479
necessarily wanted to see the rise of
unions in a way that lets say FDR

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489
unions in a way that lets say FDR
 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.380
unions in a way that lets say FDR
certainly did

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390
 
 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.090
 
well you know it's funny because in

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100
well you know it's funny because in
 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.730
well you know it's funny because in
France they the French labor movement

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740
France they the French labor movement
 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.270
France they the French labor movement
actually has about the same low rates of

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280
actually has about the same low rates of
 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.040
actually has about the same low rates of
unionization that we have it's just

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050
unionization that we have it's just
 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.870
unionization that we have it's just
everybody's out on the street and you

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880
everybody's out on the street and you
 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.790
everybody's out on the street and you
know another interesting kind of

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800
know another interesting kind of
 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.750
know another interesting kind of
factoids is that unions tend to grow

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760
factoids is that unions tend to grow
 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.310
factoids is that unions tend to grow
during prosperity not during times like

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320
during prosperity not during times like
 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.590
during prosperity not during times like
these because people are scared of their

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600
these because people are scared of their
 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.449
these because people are scared of their
jobs the only exception was you know the

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459
jobs the only exception was you know the
 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.190
jobs the only exception was you know the
20s and the 30s so I think it's more

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200
20s and the 30s so I think it's more
 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.140
20s and the 30s so I think it's more
like it needs to be more tactical and

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150
like it needs to be more tactical and
 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.130
like it needs to be more tactical and
you know in this this is really

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140
you know in this this is really
 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.259
you know in this this is really
relatively new we really haven't seen it

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269
relatively new we really haven't seen it
 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.870
relatively new we really haven't seen it
and I do think that people are ready and

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880
and I do think that people are ready and
 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.210
and I do think that people are ready and
I think they're ready for for its not to

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220
I think they're ready for for its not to
 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.590
I think they're ready for for its not to
sound ridiculous but they're ready for

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600
sound ridiculous but they're ready for
 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.199
sound ridiculous but they're ready for
change mostly because the alternative is

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209
change mostly because the alternative is
 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.810
change mostly because the alternative is
is worse
