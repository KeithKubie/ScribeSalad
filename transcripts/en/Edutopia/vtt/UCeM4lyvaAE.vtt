00:00:03.376 --> 00:00:06.116
&gt;&gt;Student: If you invest in us,

00:00:06.856 --> 00:00:11.916
we're asking for $25,000
with 16 percent equity.

00:00:12.076 --> 00:00:16.836
&gt;&gt;Advisor: I'm going to propose that you
sell your baskets for maybe like $40,

00:00:16.836 --> 00:00:20.286
and I'm prepared to give you 50,000.

00:00:20.936 --> 00:00:24.526
&gt;&gt;Chae: The whole focus of Personalized
Learning is the students see the

00:00:24.526 --> 00:00:26.146
relevance of what it
is that they're doing.

00:00:26.146 --> 00:00:29.476
And so the outcome is
students are engaged.

00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:31.226
They're enjoying the learning process.

00:00:31.626 --> 00:00:33.476
They're working collaboratively
with others.

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.406
They're able to share what
it is that they've learned.

00:00:36.406 --> 00:00:38.046
And have their own successes.

00:00:45.636 --> 00:00:50.386
&gt;&gt;Chae: Here at Nashville Big
Picture High School, we offer rigor,

00:00:50.586 --> 00:00:54.876
we offer relevance, we offer
relationships, and all of it is centered

00:00:54.876 --> 00:00:57.196
around students and their
Personalized Learning.

00:00:57.196 --> 00:01:00.066
&gt;&gt;Gary: Who would be the ideal
target for somebody who's trying

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.346
to recruit for a group like this.

00:01:01.606 --> 00:01:05.076
&gt;&gt;Student: Really, it's just
anyone who has like a gap

00:01:05.486 --> 00:01:07.686
in their life that they need to fill.

00:01:07.976 --> 00:01:10.076
&gt;&gt;Gary: Oh, man, that's
a killer statement.

00:01:10.346 --> 00:01:13.386
&gt;&gt;Gary: I think the essence of
Personalized Learning is understanding

00:01:13.386 --> 00:01:15.686
where the students is and
where they want to go.

00:01:15.756 --> 00:01:17.936
We use a lot of project work in class.

00:01:18.196 --> 00:01:21.106
And with the project work, I try
to give them Voice and Choice.

00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:24.066
Give them a menu of options
that they can research.

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:27.336
Also a menu of options that they
can choose to show learning.

00:01:27.336 --> 00:01:28.386
&gt;&gt;Gary: The last group that we'll hear

00:01:28.386 --> 00:01:31.306
from today will be Naomi,
Brianna and Nicole.

00:01:31.786 --> 00:01:33.636
And they are going to inform us

00:01:33.686 --> 00:01:37.806
on what exactly the Black Lives
Movement is and what it's about.

00:01:37.886 --> 00:01:42.766
&gt;&gt;Nicole: In Mr. Gary's class, we have
U.S. History, and what we do is learn

00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:45.266
about different things that
is going on in the world,

00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:47.476
either from the past, or
what's going on today.

00:01:47.476 --> 00:01:50.936
&gt;&gt;Nicole: Eric Garner, he died,
he was standing out after eight.

00:01:50.936 --> 00:01:54.566
New York police officer
put him in a chokehold,

00:01:55.036 --> 00:01:57.976
and his last words were,
"I can't breathe."

00:01:58.236 --> 00:02:00.276
&gt;&gt;Nicole: So my project
was Black Lives Matter,

00:02:00.546 --> 00:02:03.246
and I chose that because I'm
kind of passionate about that.

00:02:03.246 --> 00:02:04.816
I'm passionate about Black Rights.

00:02:04.976 --> 00:02:07.876
&gt;&gt;Student: Black Lives
Matter was created in 2012

00:02:07.876 --> 00:02:09.986
after Trevon Martin's murder.

00:02:10.236 --> 00:02:12.736
&gt;&gt;Gary: It puts them in the role of
being the expert, and they're able

00:02:12.736 --> 00:02:15.156
to share with students about
something that they've researched,

00:02:15.156 --> 00:02:18.206
and it gives them a sense of confidence,
because they have that role in front

00:02:18.206 --> 00:02:19.816
of the room, and they're
sharing that information.

00:02:19.866 --> 00:02:21.056
&gt;&gt;Gary: You guys, good job!

00:02:21.056 --> 00:02:22.836
We'll pick up on Friday morning.

00:02:22.836 --> 00:02:25.616
&gt;&gt;Chae: When it comes to
personalizing our learning,

00:02:25.766 --> 00:02:29.026
we do have some commonality, so
that when we do have projects,

00:02:29.196 --> 00:02:32.136
we also have to look at
content and what standards are.

00:02:32.306 --> 00:02:33.506
But student voice is key.

00:02:33.576 --> 00:02:38.036
So it's students-centered, because a lot
of the ways of, "How did you learn it?"

00:02:38.106 --> 00:02:40.366
some of that comes from
the students' voice.

00:02:40.366 --> 00:02:42.226
&gt;&gt;Derick: And right now I want
to go around with everybody

00:02:42.476 --> 00:02:43.606
and talk to you about your product.

00:02:43.606 --> 00:02:44.216
See where you are.

00:02:44.216 --> 00:02:46.976
I'm going to ask you about your
equations that we worked on last class.

00:02:47.126 --> 00:02:49.736
The better you feel about your
product, the better it will be.

00:02:49.996 --> 00:02:52.616
&gt;&gt;Derick: We have started a
project called Shark Tank,

00:02:52.776 --> 00:02:53.796
it's just like the TV show.

00:02:53.796 --> 00:02:56.496
&gt;&gt;Derick: You'll present your product,
we'll give you feedback and say,

00:02:56.496 --> 00:02:57.676
"I'm gonna invest in your company," or,

00:02:57.676 --> 00:02:58.996
"I'm not going to invest
in your company."

00:02:58.996 --> 00:03:01.556
&gt;&gt;Derick: What I wanted to do
was give the students opportunity

00:03:01.726 --> 00:03:03.186
to create their own business.

00:03:03.326 --> 00:03:05.846
It could be real, it could be imaginary,

00:03:05.846 --> 00:03:07.816
but to create a business
that they have a product.

00:03:07.816 --> 00:03:09.016
&gt;&gt;Student: It's going
to be like solar panels

00:03:09.016 --> 00:03:11.026
on a iPhone case that
charges up the phone.

00:03:11.156 --> 00:03:12.166
&gt;&gt;Derick: What is your
product going to sell for?

00:03:12.166 --> 00:03:15.276
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay, they're going
to sell for $4.99 plus tax.

00:03:15.276 --> 00:03:16.556
&gt;&gt;Derick: $4.99?

00:03:16.556 --> 00:03:17.306
&gt;&gt;Student: Mm hm, plus tax.

00:03:17.306 --> 00:03:19.216
And it's going to come up to
five dollars and nine cents.

00:03:19.216 --> 00:03:20.936
&gt;&gt;Derick: So that's all
you need for the campaign

00:03:20.936 --> 00:03:22.566
to get started, to get people to buy it.

00:03:22.566 --> 00:03:25.216
&gt;&gt;Dan: It had to have a marketing
piece, they had to make a promo,

00:03:25.326 --> 00:03:27.126
print a logo that promotes your brand.

00:03:27.346 --> 00:03:30.566
You could have a jingle, and if you
have a jingle you can just sing it,

00:03:30.596 --> 00:03:31.536
or you know, or like
[Dan and Student sing].

00:03:31.816 --> 00:03:34.956
&gt;&gt;Dan: How do you like to learn math?

00:03:35.136 --> 00:03:35.776
What are you good at?

00:03:35.776 --> 00:03:36.696
Do you like music?

00:03:36.696 --> 00:03:38.946
Let's sing a song about
quadratic functions.

00:03:39.096 --> 00:03:40.126
You like to draw?

00:03:40.216 --> 00:03:41.596
Let's draw a graph, and
let's paint a picture.

00:03:41.706 --> 00:03:44.636
We're covering the same
standards, but it looks different.

00:03:44.636 --> 00:03:45.676
&gt;&gt;Dan: This a video?

00:03:45.786 --> 00:03:46.436
&gt;&gt;Chris: Part of the product.

00:03:46.556 --> 00:03:48.706
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, that's right,
you got the cranium.

00:03:48.706 --> 00:03:49.366
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:49.366 --> 00:03:53.336
&gt;&gt;Chris: Personalized education, it's
really the dame thing, but you get more

00:03:53.336 --> 00:03:55.336
of what you're interested
in, so that's good,

00:03:55.336 --> 00:03:58.226
because you like also get an
insight to what you want to do.

00:03:58.616 --> 00:03:59.896
&gt;&gt;Student: Hello, everyone.

00:04:00.026 --> 00:04:01.456
This is Impulse Products.

00:04:01.576 --> 00:04:04.276
And we would like to
present Arctic Impulse.

00:04:04.816 --> 00:04:07.246
&gt;&gt;Derick: They did all this research,
they got in groups of three or four,

00:04:07.246 --> 00:04:09.106
and then presented their project.

00:04:09.216 --> 00:04:09.776
&gt;&gt;Student: This is how we created,

00:04:09.776 --> 00:04:12.816
and this is where we usually
distribute across the U.S.

00:04:13.706 --> 00:04:17.336
&gt;&gt;Derick: Me and my Advisors, we were
the Sharks, we were sitting on the side.

00:04:17.336 --> 00:04:20.156
At the end of the project, they would
throw out some investment numbers,

00:04:20.466 --> 00:04:22.356
just like Shark Tank, they
give a dollar amount, usually,

00:04:22.356 --> 00:04:23.666
and they give an equity amount.

00:04:23.666 --> 00:04:25.996
&gt;&gt;Student: Our investment,
we were going to ask

00:04:26.536 --> 00:04:31.956
for ten percent of equity for $100,000.

00:04:32.786 --> 00:04:39.656
&gt;&gt;Derick: I'll give you $75,000
cash, but I want 17 percent equity.

00:04:40.916 --> 00:04:46.836
&gt;&gt;Gary: I'm going to give you $100,00
for 20 percent equity in the company.

00:04:46.836 --> 00:04:47.636
[laughter] Money talks.

00:04:47.756 --> 00:04:49.596
I need to know right now, though.

00:04:49.726 --> 00:04:52.136
I need to know either
you're in or you're not.

00:04:52.136 --> 00:04:53.506
&gt;&gt;Class: Seven, six, five--

00:04:53.546 --> 00:04:54.126
&gt;&gt;Student: Mr. Derick.

00:04:54.126 --> 00:04:54.193
&gt;&gt;Derick: Yeah!

00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:56.226
Whoo! [clapping]

00:04:57.076 --> 00:04:59.446
&gt;&gt;Derick: I never seen these kids
get excited about a math project.

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:01.106
Everybody got involved!

00:05:01.106 --> 00:05:02.706
Even the kids that were
not good in math.

00:05:02.766 --> 00:05:03.496
They were getting involved.

00:05:03.496 --> 00:05:04.626
They were doing quadratic functions.

00:05:04.916 --> 00:05:05.966
They were doing all these things.

00:05:06.266 --> 00:05:09.026
I would be silly, as a teacher,
not to give them that opportunity

00:05:09.126 --> 00:05:11.786
to be creative and get
excited about a math project.

00:05:11.786 --> 00:05:14.866
&gt;&gt;Student: I learned how to market my
business, and make new investments.

00:05:15.306 --> 00:05:17.646
&gt;&gt;Chae: When you're able to
make it relevant to a student,

00:05:17.926 --> 00:05:20.786
it helps them to want to
do it, and not just do it

00:05:20.786 --> 00:05:22.636
because that's what's expected.

00:05:22.636 --> 00:05:23.746
Student voice is key.

00:05:23.746 --> 00:05:25.906
Hear it, learn it, ask for it.

00:05:26.446 --> 00:05:28.466
What is it that will help you do better.

00:05:28.696 --> 00:05:30.246
How can we help you improve?

00:05:30.596 --> 00:05:31.696
What do you need from us?

00:05:31.696 --> 00:05:34.836
&gt;&gt;Gary: I'm in for 50,000,
and just to make it sweet,

00:05:34.836 --> 00:05:36.696
let's keep it at 15 percent.

00:05:36.696 --> 00:05:36.886
[applause]

00:05:36.886 --> 00:05:39.516
&gt;&gt;Derick: All right!

00:05:39.516 --> 00:05:41.126
I feel ya!
