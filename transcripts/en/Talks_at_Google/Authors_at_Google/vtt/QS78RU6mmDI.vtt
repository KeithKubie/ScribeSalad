SPEAKER 1: Hi, everyone.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.550
Thanks for coming to our Authors
at Google series.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.150
Today we're pleased to present
Dr. Mark Schoen who's here to

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.400
talk about his latest book
called "Your Survival Instinct

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.760
is Killing You.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.620
Retrain your Brain to Conquer
Fear, Make Better Decisions,

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.530
and Thrive In the 21st Century."
The book contains

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.390
strategies and ideas that show
you how to build your

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.330
instinctual muscles for
survival and managing

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.910
discomfort.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.450
Dr. Schoen is an Assistant
Clinical Professor of Medicine

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.270
at the UCLA Geffen School of
Medicine, where he teaches

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.330
courses to medical students
on performance and

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.930
decision-making under pressure,
as well as hypnosis

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:42.990
and medicine.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.560
He has extensively studied the
area of performance under

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.190
pressure, particularly as it
relates to physical and mental

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.880
decision-making.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.250
His work has been featured
extensively on

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.500
television and radio.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.380
And we're happy to have
him here today.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.368
Please welcome Dr. Schoen.

00:00:59.368 --> 00:01:03.760
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.010
DR. MARC SCHOEN:
Good afternoon.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.710
One question to start out.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.590
What is the one thing that we
can do to influence our

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.250
health, influence our happiness,
to influence

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.940
performance, to influence
aging, to influence

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.050
relationships?

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.420
What's the one thing?

00:01:29.752 --> 00:01:32.620
AUDIENCE: Breathe.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.350
DR. MARC SCHOEN: And it's
not quitting your job

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.520
and moving to Tahiti.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.150
AUDIENCE: Spend more time with
our friends and family.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.230
DR. MARC SCHOEN: Friends
and family.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.274
Someone said breathe.

00:01:41.274 --> 00:01:43.790
You know what it is?

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.650
The right answer is taming
our survival instinct.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.380
Yes, could something like
our survival instinct be

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.870
influencing all those different
parts of our life?

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.400
The quick answer is you bet.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.250
The survival instinct we know
is supposed to be about

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.669
survival, isn't it?

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.950
It's supposed to help
us survive.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.300
But in fact, it's putting
us in harm's way.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.520
Let's talk about it.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.150
What is the survival instinct?

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.180
It's a part of the brain.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.130
Many of us know it because it's
the part of the brain

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.250
that clicks on the fight or
flight part of us, the part of

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.230
us that gets mobilized to help
us get out of danger.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.350
And sometimes we experience it
feeling really flushed in the

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.110
body, right?

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.640
Rapid heartbeat, quick
breathing, the mine getting

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.145
really obsessive, the body
getting tingly, sweating.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.000
In other cases, we just
feel worked up.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.280
But the survival Instinct meant
to keep us out of danger

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.410
is now 24/7 on.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.750
It was never meant
to be on 24/7.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.170
It was meant to help us when
we are in danger--

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.860
real danger, real physical
danger, like in the early days

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.930
running from a spear of an
opposing tribe or running from

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.010
a saber-toothed tiger.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.030
Now I don't know about you.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.860
When I think back, when I
think way back, I can't

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.850
remember last time I
was running from a

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.020
saber-toothed tiger.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.640
Most the time I'm running
from myself.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.100
And that's true of most
of our danger today

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.080
is at our own hands.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.890
And yeah, it's not real
danger, isn't it?

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.450
Getting cut off on the freeway,
having to stand in

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.160
line, someone hurting
our feelings--

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.430
are these real situations
to evoke this kind

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.510
of reaction in us?

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.100
The fact is it's staying on, and
it was never meant to be

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.400
this chronic.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.760
But it is.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.519
Now think, for example, have you
noticed that when you're

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.680
more worked up, more revved
up, does it affect your

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.170
performance?

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.430
Does it affect your ability
to make decisions?

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.150
Or do you notice when you worked
up like this, are you

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.260
more obsessive, think about
things, worry more?

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.620
Generally worry about things
that probably will never even

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.800
happen, Right

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.120
Or how about sleep?

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.290
Does it affect our sleep?

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.800
Do we sleep less?

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.280
Or our sleep is impaired or
compromised, unsettled?

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.510
Do we eat more?

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.760
Do we drink more?

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.410
Do we smoke more?

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.890
Don't answer that question.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:04.330
So we can see it affects
us in a profound way.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.200
So let's look at what
is the chemistry.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.950
What is going on that's making
this survival instinct happen?

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.390
The best way to think about it
is to look at our different

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.460
parts of our brain.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.830
We actually have three parts to
our brain, but we're only

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.640
going to talk about two.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.870
One is a part of the brain
that has existed since we

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.120
broke away from reptiles.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.980
And it is called the limbic
brain, and it's the part of

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.250
the brain that has to do
with gut responses--

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.020
hunger, pain, sleep,
fear, anger,

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.740
pleasure, visceral responses.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.210
We have another part
of our brain--

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.640
I call the cerebral brain--

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.150
it's the logical part
of the brain.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.110
It's where all the problem
solving gets done, the

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.950
decision making gets done.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.070
It's the part that can be
thinking about oh, I better do

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.500
this this time, rather
than that.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.190
Or last time, this was the
result, so I need to do this

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.230
differently.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.070
It's the part that we rely
significantly on.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.940
And these two different
parts to the brain are

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.680
jockeying for position.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.590
The cerebral brain wants to
control those visceral drives.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.350
This role, gut part of the brain
wants full expression of

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.020
those drives.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.430
It wants it right away.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.960
So they're at odds.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.995
They actually speak two
different languages.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.850
It's almost like if you ever
had a tantrumming child and

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:41.360
you tried to tell the child
logically that's really not a

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.930
good idea for you
to be so upset.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.540
Would the child listen?

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.990
Most likely not.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.230
Because the cerebral brain
speaks this language trying to

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.720
be logical to this more
emotional brain,

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.050
it doesn't get it.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.060
So they don't always
get along.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:07.980
But the survival instinct is
housed in this limbic brain.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.510
It's a part of the brain
that's all about

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.080
one thing, one goal--

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.390
to keep us out of danger.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.390
And it's absolute.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.090
There's no grades.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:27.270
We either are or
not in danger.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:35.800
And so now, more than ever
before, we as a society are

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.370
much more revved up.

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.310
It's taking less to trigger
us, isn't it?

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.200
Have you noticed things
that might have been

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:48.662
inconsequential before in our
past are enough to set us off.

00:07:48.662 --> 00:07:50.020
Why?

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.220
Why should this be happening?

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:56.090
Don't we live in a society
filled with all sorts of

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.870
wonderful technological
comforts and advances?

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.110
Don't we?

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:03.790
But guess what?

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.740
As we are filled with all these
advances that make our

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:13.210
lives so much more comfortable,
we have become

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:17.030
less tolerant of being
uncomfortable.

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.480
Our comfort zone has shrunken.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.110
And the result of it shrinking
is that we're feeling

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:31.770
uncomfortable a lot
more often.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.240
And what's the significance
of that?

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.580
Huge.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.880
Because this survival instinct,
the part of us

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:44.230
that's supposed to keep us out
of danger, when it feels

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:48.900
uncomfortable, it senses that
we're uncomfortable inside.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.690
It doesn't think about it oh,
you know, just because you're

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:54.190
standing in line or you're
stuck in traffic.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.190
No, it thinks one thing.

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.900
Thinks I'm in danger.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:03.020
So now the more uncomfortable we
are in our lives, the more

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:08.290
this signal's going off saying
we're in danger.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:11.300
And when that happens,
it clicks on

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.450
the survival instinct.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:16.570
It stays on, goes into
overdrive, and we

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.280
become maxed out.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.540
And what are the results?

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.350
What are the results of this?

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:24.530
Huge.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:31.390
Depression, anxiety, inability
to sleep, pain.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:33.300
They're just going
through the roof.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.970
Now isn't this odd that this
should be happening?

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:39.630
We are living in a society
with tremendous amount of

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:45.620
resources for health, not only
medicine, but research that we

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.520
can read, people given
us tools--

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.220
self-help.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.380
It's everywhere.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:56.390
But why are all these symptoms
getting worse?

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:57.890
We are missing something.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.550
We're missing something.

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:03.940
Something has to be
done differently.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:08.230
And so we're talking about
feeling uncomfortable.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:12.660
So a key part of this, again,
is that when we're

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:17.870
uncomfortable, it signals
danger to the brain.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:21.720
And then it turns on the
survival instinct, and we are

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.390
revved up and worked
up and react.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:28.340
Now you might think is that
really that significant?

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.300
Is it not a problem that
we're more revved up?

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.470
Think of it.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.640
Think of it this way that what
we're basically running on

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:42.280
long-term is leaded fuel,
running coal.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.670
We're not running cleanly.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:50.660
And believe me, this is why we
are seeing symptoms like this

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.240
shoot through the roof.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.050
And it it's not just
in adults.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:55.860
It's not just young adults.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:00.240
I'm now seeing this in kids as
young as eight years old.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.300
And I never saw that happen
30 years ago.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.810
The symptoms I'm seeing in kids
like migraines, horrible

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:11.610
stomach problems, inability to
take exams, panic attacks.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:15.190
This didn't happen in
eight-year-olds 30 years ago.

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:17.840
It happened in young adults.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.968
So it's filtered all the way
down through society.

00:11:21.968 --> 00:11:25.450
So what is it?

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:29.960
What is one of the factors
that's influencing us?

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.090
I call it agitance.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:38.790
Agitance to me is how sped up we
are, how activated we are,

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.690
how hot we're running inside.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:45.520
It's sort of like an internal
thermostat, using this

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.880
metaphorically.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.060
And so that as we get
more sped up,

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.510
the temperature rises.

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:55.930
We're all accustomed to
being 98.6, right?

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:57.190
That's the norm.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.830
Those who are meditators
probably have a lower body

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:00.650
temperature.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:02.920
I've been doing hypnosis
since I've been 13.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.110
Mine's about 96.

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:09.560
So we have this temperature,
and the higher that we get

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.220
revved up, the higher
levels of agitance,

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.370
the hotter we get.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.790
Now it gets to a certain point,
when this speed gets

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:22.250
high enough, it crosses what I
call a discomfort threshold.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:26.570
And as it speeds up, goes up,
it crosses that threshold.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:28.500
We feel uncomfortable--

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.410
clicks on the survival
instinct.

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:34.380
Now it's really important to
think of this agitance.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:39.680
It's not like stress which
is bad or negative.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.460
Agitance can even
be a good thing.

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:47.270
First symptoms I ever got
from stress in my life

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.890
was when I was 36.

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:50.120
And I was loving it.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.850
I was loving what I was doing,
running two cutting-edge

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.750
programs, one on how the
mind affects the body.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.600
I was loving what I was doing.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.000
But I started getting
symptoms.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.820
So this agitance isn't
just bad things.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.220
It can be good things.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.090
That's why it's different
than stress.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:09.740
Stress is something
very discrete--

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:13.700
a conflict with a boss or
coworker, or having to meet a

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:14.960
certain deadline.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:19.290
This agitance is just
generalized speed in the body.

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:21.630
So what affects it?

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:24.630
What affects agitance then?

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:31.440
Well, one is our constant need
for sensory stimulation.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.300
We all know about
that, don't we?

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.560
How many of us just sit
and read a book.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.250
How many of us just
talk to a person.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:45.310
Most of us are engaging in
a flood of stimulation.

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:47.280
I was at a Laker Game a few
years ago, and they were

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.690
actually winning.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:50.090
And it was a playoff game.

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.860
The tickets cost hundreds
of dollars.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.900
And I decide I'm looking around
the audience while the

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.130
game is going on.

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.360
And everywhere I can
see, people were on

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.190
their phones texting.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.270
No one's paying attention
to the game.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:07.030
It wasn't enough stimulation.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.300
And we have become accustomed
to needing lots of

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.390
stimulation.

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:12.890
We didn't want to just
talk to someone.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:13.990
We want to talk to someone.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:15.790
We want to watch something.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.900
We want to eat at
the same time.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.760
We want to play with
our phones.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:25.350
We have become addicted
to stimulation.

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:26.130
We have.

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:26.840
And you know what?

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.540
It has a physiological effect.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:31.490
It's related to dopamine in
the brain, which is a

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:31.970
neurotransmitter.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:35.430
It's a biochemical that
affects mood.

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:38.770
And the more distant stimulation
we get, the more

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:41.760
we become addicted to
this dopamine surge.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.170
And after a while, the
stimulation stops producing as

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:46.820
much dopamine.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:51.810
And we got to do more
stimulation to get back to it.

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:57.660
The next area is what I call
instant gratification, the

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.380
need for something now.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:00.880
We're hungry.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.060
We want to eat, don't we?

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.275
We don't want to wait.

00:15:04.275 --> 00:15:08.190
Hey, if we need an
answer, and we're

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:12.270
uncertain, where do we go?

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:14.850
You guys only get one choice
in this place.

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:16.230
Pass or fail on this one.

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:19.890
Where do you go if you're
uncertain about something?

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:21.950
Google, yes.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:23.810
That's the pitch for Google.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:29.330
But so we've learned to not
live with uncertainty.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:34.380
When I was writing my
dissertation and looking to

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:38.080
find resources to supply my
dissertation, I had to go up

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.950
and down these stacks of the
library looking for something.

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:43.790
And of course, I'd get to the
upper stacks with a--

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.210
I knew that this would be the
article that would be just the

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:48.132
one I needed.

00:15:48.132 --> 00:15:51.680
And of course, I'd get there,
and it would be gone.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.720
It wouldn't be there.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.570
So I I'd have to wait
days to get it.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:55.810
We don't do that
anymore, do we?

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:57.990
We want it right away.

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:01.450
And that leads to the other
thing that influences agitance

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:04.580
We've become impatient,
haven't we?

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:09.480
We get really irritated if we
have to stand in line, if we

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.290
have to ask the same question
twice, if we have to send the

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:13.510
same email twice.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:16.470
We want an email response
quickly, don't we?

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:19.180
We want a text message
quickly.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.510
Who wants to wait?

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:25.400
And what about perfection?

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.860
We have become a culture
that wants perfection.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:30.770
Why?

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:32.550
Because the computer model--

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:34.580
everything's perfect,
isn't it?

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.700
Everything lines up.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.920
You either get it right,
or you get it wrong.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.880
But the problem is the world
doesn't line up perfectly.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.090
And so we take this scheme in
which we're all working and

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:46.670
apply it to the real world.

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:50.880
It creates disastrous results in
our relationships, because

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:56.670
the world seldom produces
exactly what we expect.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:17:02.700
All these factors of agitance
pump up our level of

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.010
discomfort.

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:05.089
They really do.

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:09.760
They cross that discomfort
threshold, and we start

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.490
getting worked up.

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:17.780
So it requires a very little
provocation to set us off--

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:21.329
very, very little.

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:25.550
But let's talk about some
specific things-- how this

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:26.760
really happens.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.620
Let's take performance
and decision

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.290
making under pressure.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:32.310
Happens to be one of
my great interest.

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:35.350
It's a class that I teach at
UCLA in the Medical School

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:39.620
where we take students and
groom them through these

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:43.070
series of exercises and
trainings, so that when

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:46.450
they're under pressure,
they perform at

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:47.810
their absolute best.

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:52.910
So what is it about pressure
that's important?

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:57.920
Pressure is experienced by the
brain as uncomfortable.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.930
And what's most of our
experiences of pressure and

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:05.210
performance?

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:07.350
It began when we were
young, right?

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:12.220
Oral presentations, playing
school sports, and learning

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:15.740
like oh my god, I have to do
well this next time or when I

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.290
get up and do an oral
presentation, I don't want to

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:21.360
embarrass myself or forget
what I'm supposed to say.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.500
And most of us have had
some bad experiences.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:30.420
And those bad experiences
prejudice us in the present.

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.620
So what happens?

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:35.990
Now, when we're under pressure,
it has all those old

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:39.510
associations of flopping, being

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:43.390
embarrassed, being rejected.

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:48.290
So now when we're under pressure
now, we want to

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:49.340
change that.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:50.890
But look what happens.

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:53.710
When the pressure goes up,
we get uncomfortable.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:55.770
The survival instinct goes on.

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:59.180
Here's what happens
mechanically.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:04.660
When the survival instinct goes
on, it diverts the blood

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.360
supply, the oxygen,
away from that

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.940
cerebral part of our brain.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.230
That's the part of the brain
where the decision making is,

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:13.770
the problem solving is.

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:17.850
So it just diverts the
blood away, turns on

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:19.440
the fight or flight.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:23.840
And since the cerebral brain
processes information so much

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.810
slower than the limbic brain,
it can't stop it.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.230
How many people have
noticed this?

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:33.645
Has this ever happened to you
when you felt your heart

00:19:33.645 --> 00:19:36.700
beating, where all of a sudden,
you felt worked up.

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.720
And you weren't sure why.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.540
And then you had to
think about it.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.210
Why am I upset?

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:46.445
That's because the limbic
brain is quicker.

00:19:46.445 --> 00:19:48.290
It's faster, but it
had to be, right?

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.670
If someone was throwing a spear
at us, would we want to

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:52.140
sit back and think?

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:55.530
Hmm, should I hang out?

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:57.270
Or should I run?

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.250
We didn't want to do that,
so we needed to process

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:03.550
information instantaneously
when we were in danger.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:08.030
So this limbic brain
has priority.

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:12.040
So when that does, it takes the
blood supply away from the

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:15.390
cerebral brain where the problem
solving happens.

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:20.680
And the result is it just
doesn't have enough juice to

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.015
run the machinery.

00:20:22.015 --> 00:20:27.380
It's kind of like a electrical
power grid, an electrical

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:31.800
power grid that gets overtapped
and there isn't

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.100
enough energy to go around.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.920
So lights start going out
all over the place.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.120
And one of those lights is in
this problem solving area.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.970
And when it happens, what
happens to our decisions?

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:44.920
They become defensive
in nature.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:50.820
In other words, we're more
concerned about the our losses

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.590
than we are about advancing
our gains.

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:58.050
And even we have situations in
front of us, we will perceive

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:01.520
negative outcomes, even when
a positive outcome

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.170
might be more likely.

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:07.070
So as you can see, our
performance is

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:09.560
dramatically affected.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.410
But think about this.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:14.510
You all probably work
tons of hours.

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:19.890
And you're given a lot of
demands that you have to meet.

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:24.380
And the younger generation has
had much more of this jumping

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:25.630
through hoops.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.960
And you have to learn more.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:34.920
But who teaches you how to
execute that knowledge?

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.450
Who teaches you how to take
that knowledge and make it

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:42.550
happen under extreme
conditions?

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:44.790
I never got that training.

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:47.250
I remember playing sports,
and I used to pitch.

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:49.210
I used to remember thinking
like all this practice.

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:51.880
I just hope to God when I get
in the game, I can get the

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:52.800
ball over the plate.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.010
It was like total random.

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:59.580
No one teaches us how to
perform under pressure.

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:06.660
And to me, that's equally as
important as the information.

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:10.740
But it's not being done.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.390
Just think if we could learn how
to perform under pressure,

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:16.270
what kind of edge that
would get us.

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:18.570
When I wrote my book, I
interviewed different people

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:21.590
who are big in business and who
did well under pressure.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.280
And you know what
they told me?

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.670
They told me this.

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:29.160
They said you know what, because
I can do well under

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:35.050
fire, I have an edge over my
competition who folds and

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:38.120
unravels under pressure.

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:43.680
And they said that they
particularly liked dealing

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.100
with the younger generation,
because they're even less

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:52.720
trained in dealing with pressure
and being under fire.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.810
So this is something
we need to do.

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:59.470
This is something that is part
of my training is teaching

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.700
people how to do that, how to
teach companies, employees,

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:06.250
executives, students to
be able to do that.

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:08.610
So important.

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:10.900
But the good news--

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:14.060
very important-- is that this
is something we can learn.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.200
This is something you can
be trained to do.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.700
No doubt some people
are better at it.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:23.670
But it doesn't mean that the
rest of us can't improve

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:26.490
significantly, for sure.

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:30.820
Now the other area of my
studying and research is in

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.970
the area of health.

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:37.080
What is the effect
of this survival

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.250
instinct on our health?

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:42.120
It's huge.

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:47.340
When we are running at this
higher speed, what it does

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:52.810
when it creates the fear, it
triggers a process called

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:53.890
inflammation.

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:57.096
How many people have heard
of inflammation.

00:23:57.096 --> 00:23:59.300
A small portion?

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.920
Inflammation is perhaps the
leading theory of aging,

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:05.190
disease, health.

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:08.440
Inflammation is intended
for a good thing.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.800
It's to basically beef up the
immune soldiers of the body so

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:18.120
they can fight infection.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:25.660
But what happens is when we're
under stress, fear, anger, we

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:29.060
beef up more immune soldiers
than what we need.

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:29.940
What's the effect?

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:34.850
It's the effect of having a
bunch of Marines Brigade in

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:37.620
the bleachers all
drinking beer.

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:40.720
What's the end result?

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.380
A fight.

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.250
A fight's going to happen.

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:44.840
And where does that
fight happen?

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.710
It happens within us.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:51.140
And these immune soldiers,
instead of fighting pathogens,

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:55.190
they start chewing on and
chomping on our organs.

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:58.530
And we age a lot faster.

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:01.070
We can control inflammation.

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:03.255
One of my earlier things
that I've done--

00:25:03.255 --> 00:25:06.210
in fact, I even just published
a study showing that we can

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:09.190
change that inflammatory
response in the body in a

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:11.710
simple way.

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:15.890
OK, so if it can have this
profound effect on

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:23.170
performance, decision making, on
health, relationships, what

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:26.760
do we do to improve things?

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.410
Now you could say to me
hey, you know what?

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:32.300
This agitance stuff
is here to stay.

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.480
And you might be right.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:38.250
Maybe we all have to just
get accustomed to

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:40.550
running a lot faster.

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:43.540
Maybe all the stimulation
is not going to change.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:46.100
Maybe instant gratification's
not going to change.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.680
Perfection.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.250
You may say that.

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:53.880
And you may be arguably
right on that point.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.820
So if that's not going to
change, and we're all going to

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:59.830
be running a lot faster, that
means we're going to all be a

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:04.180
lot more uncomfortable,
doesn't it?

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.780
So then we have one
choice, don't we?

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:09.030
One choice.

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:17.870
The choices to retrain our
instincts to being

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:22.470
uncomfortable, to make it so
that when we're uncomfortable

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:26.296
it does not mean danger.

00:26:26.296 --> 00:26:29.550
Think we can do it?

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:30.800
Can we retrain our instincts?

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:35.500
Yes, we can.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:39.060
We most definitely can.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:41.870
A moment ago, I referred to a
study that just got published.

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:47.060
It took people who reacted with
this kind of agitance and

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:50.310
discomfort and stress and seeing
if we can recondition

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:55.620
it, so that when they're under
stress, they don't physically

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.072
react to it.

00:26:57.072 --> 00:26:58.910
I'd taken blood measures.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:02.240
I was able to show that, in
fact, we can do that.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:10.260
So then what do we do?

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:14.200
First goal is this.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:19.130
We accept that we're not trying
to banish discomfort.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:21.330
We're not trying to
get rid of it.

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:23.100
Because you know what?

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.720
It's not going away.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.970
It's here to stay.

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:34.380
But many people believe that the
goal is to get rid of it.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.825
And contemporary thought, in
terms of managing stress, what

00:27:37.825 --> 00:27:38.770
is that about?

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:43.900
Trying to stop stresses, trying
to not feel it or to

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:47.040
distract ourselves from it.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.010
But what happens?

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:51.250
That which we avoid
becomes what?

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:55.020
Bigger!

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:59.660
Becomes larger, becomes more
of a threat, doesn't it?

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:08.720
So many times, our attempt to
control stress, fear, is

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.170
making us more vulnerable.

00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:13.200
We don't want to do that.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:17.870
We want to change the brain's
reaction to being

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:19.370
uncomfortable.

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:22.480
And a sophisticated way to do
it, based on the newest data,

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.110
is literally to train the brain
so when we're doing

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:30.120
something frightening,
uncomfortable, instead of

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:33.900
going straight to the fear
center, like a one lane road

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:38.370
to the fear center, we want
to make it take roads to

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:42.720
different parts of the brain
that have no association, no

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.310
connection to fear.

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:52.540
And by doing that, we dilute the
power of that fear center.

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:57.920
It's very elaborate,
sophisticated, and fascinating

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.610
reading and something everyone
can learn to do.

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:04.280
But since we don't have enough
time to go into that, and you

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:08.250
can certainly dive into
that at a later time--

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:09.730
my writings--

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:12.570
but I would like to talk about
some things before I stop that

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:15.300
you can do.

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:19.420
One, if you want to try lowering
the agitance levels,

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:24.780
think about what I call chilling
out before bedtime.

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:25.750
Yeah.

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:28.370
Most people go high gear--
right?-- all

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:29.600
the way up to bedtime.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:33.350
Boom, switch gears, say OK,
it's time to go to sleep.

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:36.650
But sleep is not the
same as relaxation.

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:39.570
And so even though we may fall
asleep, we're still tense and

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:43.220
worked up on the inside.

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:46.340
If you chill out before bedtime,
it has an enormous

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:50.290
effect on physical symptoms the
next day, like grinding

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:53.560
your teeth, headaches,
stomachaches, other types of

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.490
aches, your mood--

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:57.290
important.

00:29:57.290 --> 00:30:02.575
Or take a technological
time out.

00:30:02.575 --> 00:30:04.420
Oh, I just realized it's
not the place to

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:07.870
say that, is that?

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:10.190
But I guess I've made the
mistake, so I probably won't

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:11.970
be asked again to come back.

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:12.730
But it's true.

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:18.700
We need to take some more
breaks from technology,

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.140
particularly before bedtime.

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.110
An hour, two hours, before
bedtime makes a huge

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:25.030
difference.

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:30.390
Now let's say you wanted to
improve your discomfort

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:34.110
muscle, so you could
handle more

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:37.140
discomfort than you do now.

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.310
Build up that muscle
that's atrophying--

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:40.866
what can you do?

00:30:40.866 --> 00:30:43.840
One of the ones that I like
is called expanding

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.160
your comfort zone.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:51.500
For some that may be taking
a new route to work.

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:56.590
It may mean not using Google
Maps to got there or maybe

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:57.840
using Apple maps.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.070
We want to do something that
challenges us, particularly

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:07.860
something that may
be comfortable.

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:09.750
Doing something that we
might have failed at

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:12.040
before or not succeeded.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:16.530
I like to tell people to go take
an acting class, do an

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:20.490
improv class, sing, do these
kind of presentations.

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:24.100
Put yourself in the position
where you're uncomfortable and

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:27.230
where you can survive.

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:30.540
Very, very important.

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:34.970
I am getting the signal that
it's time to stop talking.

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:41.020
But the bottom line I want you
to keep in mind here is that

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.920
these are all things
that we can learn.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.630
This is not something that's
not obtainable.

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:50.380
True, some people are better
at it than others.

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:52.780
But the fact is we
can all learn it.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:55.390
There's data to show we can
learn it, and get a

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:56.740
lot better at it.

00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.690
And so rather than being
something to avoid and fear--

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:02.090
being uncomfortable--

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:05.020
it's something that you can
embrace and find, in fact,

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.630
that it can facilitate
performance,

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:10.210
rather than be an obstacle.

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:11.158
Thank you.

00:32:11.158 --> 00:32:16.310
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:19.780
DR. MARC SCHOEN: And if there
are any questions?

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.795
AUDIENCE: Hi, I was wondering is
this agitance concept that

00:32:22.795 --> 00:32:24.360
you talk about, is this
something that you can

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:25.980
actually measure?

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:28.605
Like do we have biochemical
markers for it or

00:32:28.605 --> 00:32:29.630
anything like that?

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:31.680
DR. MARC SCHOEN: Yeah, the way
you would really measure it is

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.040
look at some
psycho-physiological measures.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.950
You would look at body heat.

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:42.260
You would look at respiration
levels, the breathing.

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:45.290
You'd look at heartbeat.

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:48.256
You could measure tension
in the body.

00:32:48.256 --> 00:32:52.910
You can use electrodes on
particularly the forehead.

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:56.300
And you can also look at brain
rhythms, which would be more

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:59.220
rapid than slow.

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.660
AUDIENCE: So that sounds like
it's at least slightly

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:05.610
complicated, but I guess my
follow-on question was going

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:07.790
to be is this something that
we could do a longitudinal

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:09.640
study on and say is
this actually

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:10.780
getting worse over time?

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.770
Are we more amped up now
than we used to be?

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:14.145
DR. MARC SCHOEN: Absolutely.

00:33:14.145 --> 00:33:17.760
We are so much more amped
up than we used to.

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.830
And that's why I was giving
the example of why should

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:23.570
eight-year-olds be having
these problems

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:25.700
of blocking on exams?

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.800
Why should they be having
headaches, stomachaches?

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.470
Because now at an early age,

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:33.520
everyone's under more pressure.

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:35.230
I remember when my kids
were younger.

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:37.760
They're having to do a couple
hours of homework a night,

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.220
when they were seven.

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:41.010
It's ridiculous.

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:45.060
And so because we're so much
more amped up, and there's so

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:49.080
much more sensory stimulation,
and we're so much more about

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:53.380
instant gratification, it
is just sky-rocketing.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:57.870
So yes, it is much worse than
it ever used to be.

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:00.430
AUDIENCE: The thought I had, I
recently read Jared Diamond's

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:03.190
latest book, and he talks
about how traditional

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:04.780
societies, like what they're
like, how they

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:06.690
deal with their problems.

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:09.060
And the thought that came to
me is that I'm not entirely

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:12.199
convinced that this agitation
factor is what's increasing.

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:15.610
Because reading about these
other societies, they sound

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:17.535
terribly agitated
all the time.

00:34:17.535 --> 00:34:19.320
Like they're worried about
people stabbing them.

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:22.080
They're worried about their
friends murdering them,

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:25.780
starving to death, all these
typical problems that--

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:30.100
we have other agitators but
humanity has persistently

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:32.850
dealt with agitators all the
time and at a very high level

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:34.100
of all the time.

00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:40.170
But what I imagine is the reason
kids these days are

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:42.830
having these problems that you
mention is that we're not

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:46.280
dealing with them, with social
mechanisms that these other

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.739
societies have adopted.

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:52.370
What kind of like social
interactions would you think

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:54.199
would help when dealing
with each other?

00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:57.740
Because you suggested go do
something that agitates you.

00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:57.870
Take

00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:59.330
an acting Class.

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:03.340
But just doing that is good,
but what do you do after

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:05.510
you're done with the
acting class and

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:07.270
you're still agitated?

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:10.680
You have to get some sort of
social interaction to relieve

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:14.200
that agitation, learn that
you're OK, and build up that

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:18.140
muscle but says bad things
happen, then you're OK.

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.170
DR. MARC SCHOEN:
Great question.

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:20.590
Excellent question.

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:24.010
And because I've had limited
time, I couldn't expand on it.

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:25.280
But you're absolutely right.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:28.680
The goal isn't just to
create agitation.

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:32.020
The goal is to change
how we label, how we

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:33.760
experience that agitation.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:37.160
There's actually a part in the
brain that straddles the old

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.290
and new brain.

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:41.470
And its job is to interpret our

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:43.980
physical experience inside.

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:48.680
Because the physiology of being
stressed out and fearful

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.920
is not necessarily different
than the physiology of being

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.590
happy and excited.

00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:55.730
But there's a part of the brain
that interprets that

00:35:55.730 --> 00:36:00.100
physiology as bad or
as OK or good.

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:05.900
So what we want to do is train
ourselves that this type of

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:10.150
discomfort actually
is beneficial.

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:14.480
Now, the elaborate way in my
writings, I show that what we

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:19.450
can do is take this kind of
agitation and recondition the

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:22.440
brain to react differently.

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:26.800
And one way actually is to
use a social component.

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:31.340
One very fascinating way which I
use in my classes is to take

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:35.720
this, create an agitation,
create a stress, but do it in

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:38.050
a group of people.

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:41.280
So now, first of all, there's
pressure to perform

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.210
in a group of people.

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:47.770
And it creates a vulnerability,
because you

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:53.060
know you're going to either fail
or succeed in your peers.

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:57.830
But the group process actually
stimulates our

00:36:57.830 --> 00:37:00.630
hormones in the body.

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:02.610
A thing called oxytocin.

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:03.620
You've probably heard of it.

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:05.620
It's this good feeling
hormone.

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:07.955
And so what happens
is-- it happens to

00:37:07.955 --> 00:37:10.180
both men and women--

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:13.270
is that now they're in a
vulnerable situation, feeling

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:15.830
pressure, in this
group situation,

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:17.500
which creates a bonding.

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:20.440
These hormones are released
in the body.

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:27.090
And so now it gets associated
in the brain with a warmer,

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:29.450
positive, connected feeling.

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:32.230
So we're teaching you that
of vulnerability, of

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:36.080
transparency, rather than of
perfection, being uptight,

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:40.370
being angry, being fearful,
that a transparency of

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:44.510
vulnerability actually creates
a good feeling.

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:45.780
That's how we start doing it.

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:47.130
Great question.

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:49.960
AUDIENCE: We all know stress is
bad, but can we ignore the

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:54.060
fact that stress is also the
main reason for one of our

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:57.840
motivation to do something?

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:03.060
If we suppress our stress, are
we going to be more passive?

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:05.090
DR. MARC SCHOEN: Now I want to
make sure I got the question.

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:07.660
Is the question is that
we use stress to

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:09.340
ignite us, as a catalyst?

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:09.950
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:11.290
DR. MARC SCHOEN: And then
if we take it away,

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:12.060
the question was?

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:13.820
AUDIENCE: Are we going
to be more passive?

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:15.450
DR. MARC SCHOEN: Ah.

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:19.490
The goal is not to
take away stress.

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:21.940
The goal isn't to take away
being uncomfortable.

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:23.450
It's never going to
happen, because

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:25.890
the world isn't perfect.

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:27.000
It never lines up.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.920
Or if it does line
up perfectly, how

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:29.710
long does it last?

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:31.420
It's transitory.

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:35.000
So most the time, the world
doesn't line up perfectly.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.590
And so we really need to be
effective at dealing with a

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:43.340
world that's constantly changing
and not perfect.

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:46.770
So, no, the goal isn't to banish
stress or discomfort.

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:51.090
The goal is OK, if discomfort
is here to stay, we got to

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:52.470
manage it well.

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:56.660
And if we manage it well, it
facilitates performance.

00:38:56.660 --> 00:39:00.540
It doesn't lead to
an apathy at all.

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:04.350
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering if
meditation help, and what kind

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:06.980
of meditation will help?

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:08.980
DR. MARC SCHOEN: Yes, the
question is about meditation.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:10.730
And meditation is wonderful.

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:15.610
There's plenty of research on
meditation having a very

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:19.150
helpful effect on the
brain, on the body.

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:22.410
One of the things that
meditation can do--

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:25.940
mindful meditation is the one
I'm most familiar with--

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:30.050
is that it creates a better
balance between this emotional

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:32.940
limbic brain and the
cerebral brain.

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.430
So it brings them into
better balance.

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:36.390
The problem--

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:39.140
what happens is that as we
become uncomfortable or

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:43.840
experience trauma, it
destabilizes the brain.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.310
So that often this limbic
emotional brain is the one

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:50.870
that has hold of the steering
wheel, and it's the one

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:53.160
driving the car.

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:58.990
But meditation, and the one I
believe a lot in is hypnosis,

00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:03.280
can bring both these parts
of the brain back

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.170
into a balance state.

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:08.430
But mindful meditation is
the one that has the

00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:10.550
most data on it.

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:15.370
AUDIENCE: Beyond behavioral
therapy, like CBT or DBT, is

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:20.640
there other stuff from
psychology that can be used to

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.710
attenuate the agitance?

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:25.200
DR. MARC SCHOEN: Yes.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:30.350
I believe that where this field
is going, I believe that

00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:32.340
this is the future.

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.260
The future is we're not just
going to be sitting around

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:39.570
talking and trying to come up
with strategies and cognitive

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:42.530
and intellectual ways of doing
something or taking a bunch of

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:43.610
deep breaths.

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:46.380
I think where it's really
going is how can we take

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:50.950
specific parts of the brain and
change how those brains

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:52.340
parts fire.

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:54.200
That's what we want to do.

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:57.680
And I think to look around for
treatments that actually focus

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:01.480
directly on the fear center.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.370
Incidentally, I should
tell you this--

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:04.620
I forgot to mention--

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:08.530
if any of you are interested in
a certain breath technique

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:14.710
I developed for this approach,
for my approaches, it's not

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:18.960
set up on my website yet, but if
you wanted to email me, I'm

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:21.380
happy to send it to you free
of charge, of course.

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:23.770
My email is my name--
marcschoenphd@gmail.com.

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.902
And just put in the subject line
"breath technique" and

00:41:30.902 --> 00:41:33.400
I'll send it to you.

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.330
So going back to your question
of what kind of approaches, I

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:39.580
would suggest look for these
newer approaches that really

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:42.050
target these specific
areas of the brain.

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:46.870
I think it's just quicker, more
direct, and ultimately

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:49.120
more powerful and
more enduring.

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:49.710
OK?

00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:50.480
Thank you very much.

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:51.730
Appreciate your interest.
