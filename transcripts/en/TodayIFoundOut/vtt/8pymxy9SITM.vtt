00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.170
When Will the Sun Die and 6 Other Space Facts

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.170
1.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.380
Each second about four million metric tons
of matter is converted to energy within the

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.380
Sun’s core.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.830
This gives the Sun a lifetime as a main sequence
star of about 10 billion years with about

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.330
5 billion years to go.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.330
2.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.970
The surface temperature of the Sun is about
5780 K, which is equivalent to just under

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:31.029
10,000 F and 5,500 C. The temperature at the
core is much hotter, close to 14 million Celsius

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.730
degrees or 25 million degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.000
This extreme pressure and heat allow the Sun
to generate its energy from nuclear fusion

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.370
at its core, fusing hydrogen nuclei into helium.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.760
This nuclear fusion is self-regulating.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.540
If the Sun’s diameter gets smaller while
maintaining the same mass, the pressure at

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.750
the core increases creating more nuclear fusion
which in turn causes it to expand.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.980
If it expands maintaining the same mass, the
pressure lessens in the core resulting in

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.710
less nuclear fusion going on.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.260
So a natural equilibrium has resulted in this
process with the Sun, though there are stars

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.850
that can be observed going through a process
of massive expansion and contraction at very

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.100
steady rates.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.100
3.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.490
Sirius-A is the brightest extrasolar star
visible to the naked eye from Earth, being

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.340
almost twice as bright as the second brightest,
Canopus.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.810
Sirius-A and Sirius-B combine to form a binary
system and appear as one star to the naked

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.249
eye, though the vast majority of luminosity
to the naked eye comes from Sirius-A, Sirius-B

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:33.479
being a white dwarf which is only around 30
AU (astronomical units) away from Sirius-A.

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.040
It is also theorized that there is a Sirius-C,
but to date, this has not been proven.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.799
Sirius A and B (and possibly C) combine to
form a bright point known as Sirius or the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.039
“Dog Star”, which is of course the inspiration
for Sirius’ Black’s name in Harry Potter.

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.039
4.

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.609
Sirius-A is a white main sequence star (A1V)
that is about twice the size of our Sun.

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:59.670
The extreme brightness from our point of view
comes not so much because it is a particularly

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.509
bright star, but rather because it is only
8.6 light years away (2.6 parsecs).

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.310
That’s a really long ways away by standards
of distance we normally deal with (about 50

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.960
trillion miles or so), but by galactic standards,
it’s just next door and is one of our nearest

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.960
neighbors.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.960
5.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.990
One day on Mercury (i.e -the time it takes
to rotate around its axis once) lasts 176

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.130
earth days.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.280
A year on Mercury (i.e – the amount of time
for Mercury to orbit the sun once) is 87.97

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.000
earth days.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.580
In that sense, it remains daytime for a full
year on Mercury and it stays night for one

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.100
full year also.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.160
6.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.800
Unlike Earth and most other planets in our
solar system, Venus rotates clockwise.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.370
The leading theory as to why this is the case
is that it initially rotated counterclockwise,

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.950
but the planet flipped at some point.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:48.950
7.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.970
A white dwarf is a former star that is nearing
the end of its life-cycle, with no further

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.450
nuclear fusion going on at its core.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.390
Once most stars have used up the fuel at their
core, they go into a red-giant or red super-giant

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.910
phase and expand to incredible sizes.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.710
At the end of this phase, when the star has
used up all its fuel that it can use via nuclear

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.500
fusion, if it has enough mass, it will extremely
rapidly collapse and create one of the most

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.500
powerful explosions in the universe, the supernova.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.900
The burst of energy from a single supernova
can briefly out-shine an entirely galaxy full

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.590
of billions of stars.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.400
If the red giant doesn’t have enough mass,
it will simply collapse into a white dwarf

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.390
and spend a couple billion years slowly dimming
as it gives off its stored energy.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.300
Some star remnants are too small to begin
with and so don’t ever go into a red giant

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.300
phase.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.300
When they do go into their “red” phase,
they are called “red dwarfs”.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.880
However, the lifespan of these stars is longer
than the universe has existed.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.300
Thus, every star that will eventually become
a red dwarf is still around today and has

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.460
not reached the red dwarf phase.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.770
As a general rule with stars, the bigger and
brighter it is, the faster it burns out.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:08.780
The smaller it is, the longer it lives.
