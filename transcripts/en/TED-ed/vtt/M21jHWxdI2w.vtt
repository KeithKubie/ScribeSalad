00:00:05.762 --> 00:00:08.319
The healthy liver cell divides only when it's stressed.

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:10.587
The healthy hair cell divides frequently.

00:00:10.587 --> 00:00:14.924
And the cancer cell divides even more frequently and recklessly.

00:00:14.924 --> 00:00:16.592
"The first draft that I saw was, like,

00:00:16.592 --> 00:00:18.721
four days before it was supposed to go online

00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:19.845
or something like that,

00:00:19.845 --> 00:00:21.891
and I hadn't heard, you know I hadn't heard, so, I was like,

00:00:21.891 --> 00:00:25.601
'Hey, guys, just wondering if you need me for anything?'

00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:26.268
You know?

00:00:26.268 --> 00:00:28.186
And so she floods my inbox with emails, being like,

00:00:28.186 --> 00:00:30.719
'Yes, we actually need you for a bunch of stuff!'

00:00:32.596 --> 00:00:33.435
And it was great.

00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:34.523
Like, when I first saw it,

00:00:34.523 --> 00:00:39.263
I mean, you immediately get the whole natural versus unnatural technique."

00:00:39.263 --> 00:00:39.868
"Not good for you?"

00:00:39.868 --> 00:00:41.040
"Right, yes, there you go,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.115
good for you and not good for you.

00:00:43.115 --> 00:00:45.436
Seeing that, actually, was really cool

00:00:45.436 --> 00:00:47.280
because, I mean, I had no idea.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.573
Writing the script, you have no idea

00:00:48.573 --> 00:00:52.036
what it's going to turn out like in the end.

00:00:52.036 --> 00:00:55.818
But you get this, like, intuitive feel of

00:00:55.818 --> 00:00:58.344
'Okay, like, yeah, I get why this is a cancer cell,

00:00:58.344 --> 00:01:00.260
and I get why this is a healthy cell.'

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.552
And, actually, I showed it to,

00:01:01.552 --> 00:01:04.305
I showed an early draft to the professor

00:01:04.305 --> 00:01:06.388
with whom I was fact-checking the script

00:01:06.388 --> 00:01:08.435
who is a cancer researcher at MIT,

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:11.997
and he said that it was one of the best visualizations

00:01:11.997 --> 00:01:14.871
of cancer cells that he'd ever seen.

00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:17.199
So, that was really cool to hear as well."

00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:21.355
"When you get a script,

00:01:21.355 --> 00:01:23.797
do you make a storyboard or not?"

00:01:23.797 --> 00:01:25.317
"I guess it depends on the method

00:01:25.317 --> 00:01:30.072
that we use to produce the piece because, for example,

00:01:30.072 --> 00:01:32.527
things that would definitely be character-heavy,

00:01:32.527 --> 00:01:33.743
like 'Ladder of Inference',

00:01:33.743 --> 00:01:36.037
we worked with a storyboard from beginning to end

00:01:36.037 --> 00:01:38.414
because we were dealing with character animation.

00:01:38.414 --> 00:01:40.204
And something like that is much different

00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:42.624
than stop-motion, for example.

00:01:42.624 --> 00:01:45.492
But, also, I mean Biljana and I have also worked together

00:01:45.492 --> 00:01:48.771
for, like, nearly ten years or something absurd

00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:50.767
so we don't need as much of a, you know,

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:52.512
a piece of paper to tell us what to do,

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:54.693
whereas, if I were working with someone new,

00:01:54.693 --> 00:01:57.895
then I would really want to work with a storyboard,

00:01:57.895 --> 00:01:59.479
but we kind of trust each other."

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.979
"So, you, like, finish...

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.750
...each other's sentences."

00:02:08.427 --> 00:02:10.788
"We can try that again."

00:02:10.788 --> 00:02:13.998
"No, we definitely shouldn't use that, it's too cheesy."

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.346
"So, there was a part in the video

00:02:17.346 --> 00:02:21.559
where we had to represent how the cells reproduce

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:24.550
and how chemotherapy affects it.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.775
And it became quite complicated for me to visualize,

00:02:27.775 --> 00:02:29.764
so I actually had to ask you

00:02:29.764 --> 00:02:33.826
to draw little doodles for me to actually explain that.

00:02:33.826 --> 00:02:35.144
How was that for you?

00:02:35.144 --> 00:02:36.245
How was that experience?"

00:02:36.245 --> 00:02:39.154
"I mean, it was pretty difficult for me to visualize, too,

00:02:39.154 --> 00:02:41.137
so, it was interesting.

00:02:41.137 --> 00:02:43.408
Doing the storyboard actually helped me clarify

00:02:43.408 --> 00:02:45.258
in my head, like, how it actually works

00:02:45.258 --> 00:02:48.336
because when you have to explain something

00:02:48.336 --> 00:02:51.075
to someone else, with anything, obviously,

00:02:51.075 --> 00:02:53.455
you have to, like, really figure it out yourself.

00:02:53.455 --> 00:02:55.313
And, then, when you have to draw it,

00:02:55.313 --> 00:02:57.319
that requires you to take an extra level

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.878
of abstraction and figure out,

00:02:59.878 --> 00:03:01.752
like, okay, like, what are the parts of this drawing

00:03:01.752 --> 00:03:03.007
that are really important?

00:03:03.007 --> 00:03:04.716
What do I have to show clearly,

00:03:04.716 --> 00:03:05.840
and how do I show it?

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.438
And, so, doing that on a legal pad,

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:10.745
which is, I think, how I ended up sending it to you guys,

00:03:10.745 --> 00:03:13.324
taking a picture of myself on camera,

00:03:13.324 --> 00:03:16.584
really helped, you know, me understand the crucial,

00:03:16.584 --> 00:03:17.503
and that's the crucial part

00:03:17.503 --> 00:03:22.243
of why chemotherapy actually works.

00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:23.985
So, it was a really interesting experience."

00:03:23.985 --> 00:03:26.301
"Yeah, we actually started that on a,

00:03:26.301 --> 00:03:28.078
we had a whiteboard,

00:03:28.078 --> 00:03:31.263
and I was trying to figure out that process.

00:03:31.263 --> 00:03:32.832
I think we started at the beginning

00:03:32.832 --> 00:03:35.819
from cell division and multiplying

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.441
and, you know, chemotherapy working.

00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:39.998
But then it became so crazy

00:03:39.998 --> 00:03:42.737
that I had to pull back and start from the end

00:03:42.737 --> 00:03:44.987
and go in a different direction.

00:03:44.987 --> 00:03:47.534
So, that became quite a challenge, too,

00:03:47.534 --> 00:03:48.450
figuring it out."

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.241
"We ended up using the visual that you gave us on the storyboard,

00:03:51.241 --> 00:03:53.372
which is really cool to have that sort of collaboration

00:03:53.372 --> 00:03:56.624
with the educator with whom you're working."

00:03:56.624 --> 00:03:59.490
"And I can't draw, so that should be noted.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.115
It was a very rough storyboard."

00:04:02.115 --> 00:04:03.268
"It was good enough."

00:04:03.268 --> 00:04:04.359
"Good enough!"
