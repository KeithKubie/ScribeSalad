Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Ladies and gentlemen, one of the best boxers on planet earth and his trainer BOMAC and Terrence Crawford. Gentlemen, thank you very much for coming here. Thank you ma'am with live now. Appreciate it. Appreciate it. Hey man, I'm a big fan of yours. I've, we've talked about many times on this podcast. I'm a, I'm a huge fan of the way you switch stances. You know, you switch switch stances as smooth as anybody ever. Like, like you got to go back to Marvin hag or to find a champ that switch stances like as fluidly as you, it's pretty, pretty impressive stuff man. Have you always been doing that?

Speaker 2:          00:00:32       A lot of practice. Yeah, since I was little. I remember getting in trouble cause I used to always switch him. My coach just thought he'd say you need to worry about fighting that one style first and perfecting that before you try to try to switch and do it different style. But I'll always switch. So it got to the point where there was just like, all right, well you're going to fight like that. We're going to train it like that.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       Wow. So you've forced it through. Right. Wow. Now, when you first started out, was there anybody that influenced you to switch like that? Or was it just something you felt naturally

Speaker 2:          00:01:03       or was it just naturally wow. It was just like, all right, this is not working so I gotta do something else.

Speaker 1:          00:01:08       Just make it more tricky. Right. Yeah. Well that's, that's part of what's interesting about watching you fights, watching you fight is that you could see you trying to figure out what's up like first rounds with when you fight is one of my favorite things to watch cause I see you measuring dudes, I see things happening and you switch and stances and then when you start finding the timing, it's like timing is one of the more fascinating things to watch about boxing because a guy who has perfect timing and perfect, like when you see a guy make a read and then execute and it's perfect. It's one of the most beautiful things in all of sports.

Speaker 2:          00:01:42       Right? Right. It's like you, you know, you watching every move and then you just dissecting them slowly.

Speaker 1:          00:01:49       How do you think, do you think about it? Like when you, when you start around a first round of a fight, is it different for every fighter or do you always want to do that? Do you always want to like put them into the computer now is different. It's different.

Speaker 2:          00:02:01       Like sometimes I just want to go out there and just be like, all right, I'm going to see what this dude, God, see if he can tell you, just go right to them. Yeah. And then sometimes I just be like art and I'm gonna take my time and you know, figure him out, see how fast he is seeing, you know, what things he liked to do on what he don't like to do or see if I moved this way. His reaction, just certain things.

Speaker 1:          00:02:25       It's a, you know, we, you came to the UFC this weekend and uh, and obviously I love MMA, but one of the things that I love about boxing is when you take them all, all the elements you take away wrestling and kicking and all that stuff, you get the highest level of an exchange of your punches. And you get to see with guys like you guys like Canelo or Floyd or the the top level boxes you get to see what's possible with guys that are training with the best scientific methods and with all the knowledge of all the past fighters. I mean, when you were growing up, who, what was the fighter that influenced you the most? Well,

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       hands down, Floyd Mayweather and Roy Jones jr you know, I used to love watching Roy Jones jr I'm pretty sure everybody, everybody was a fan of Roy, but set aside, Roy always watched it. Floyd Mayweather and Pernell Whitaker. Yeah, I was too young for sugar Ray Leonard and them. So I'm old enough for that. I was there for the sugar Ray Leonard days. I was there for sugar Ray, Tommy Hearns, the, the, the sh, the sugar Ray Duran. I was there for all that stuff. But I w I watched everything when I was, when I was young, my coach, ms miner, he used to always take me to his house and watch boxing tapes. That was the keep me off off the streets and keep me out of trouble until I went to the gym. Is he still around now? He passed. Damn. He probably like, look at that. What did that work out?

Speaker 3:          00:03:52       You know, we talked about an investment in time that the worked out tremendously. Yeah, the, the, it's always a, in our culture there's a special place for the highest level of boxers. It was like a special place of, uh, admiration. And I just feel like with guys like Loma Chanko with guys like you with Canelo and tripleG , this is a great time for boxing. It's fun to watch, man. There's so many. Earl Spence, junior, there's so many elite boxers right now. It's like a really exciting time. For sure. For sure. Do you recognize your place in history? Do you recognize that? Like you're, you're a special dude? Of course. Of course. Like I always tell people when they, uh, met your me and Errol Spence, you know, of course I want the fight. I'll tell everybody I already say with or without him, I'm going to the hall of fame.

Speaker 3:          00:04:39       When you look at audit things that out of and co accomplish in the sport of boxing people that's in the hall of fame, then you've accomplished that. You know? So I was, I just tell people I don't need him. He really need me. Well, we need it blocks. Right. Don't you agree you're boxing? Do you need that? Boxing needs it. I mean, it's one of the beautiful, beautiful things about when a Canelo and a triple G do get together and you see these guys and their respected way classes that are in their prime. It's fun. You know? Like that's what everybody wants to see. That's the fight. That's what it's all about. It just stop a whole lot of Barbara barbershop conversations. Yes. We need to stop a whole lot of comedy club conversations. Barbara chop garage everywhere. Yeah. That's the, that's the fight to make in your weight class right now, right?

Speaker 3:          00:05:23       For sure. What's hole? What's the hold up. You gotta acts down. Oh, it's that we, everybody has to hold out a little bit, right. To get the best deal. That's great. That's cool. You know, uh, it's, it's all about business, but at the same time, uh, my side of of the deal is ready whenever and you can see all the interviews out there. Man. You could see where if it's tears from myself or Bob or anybody that's affiliated with team Crawford, we all say wants to fight, you know? Yeah, we had a fight tomorrow, you know, if we wanted to, so, well, we know it's leery, Alyse, it won't happen.

Speaker 1:          00:06:04       Right. So when w what do you think that he's waiting for the right time marketing wise? Or do you think he's ready for the right time? Where his skills he feels like are able to challenge you? Like what do you think is the actual holdup?

Speaker 3:          00:06:17       I think is, has something to do with top rank and PBC. Oh, okay. So it's a promoter issue. So it's a financial scramble. I won't say financial because the money will be there if the fight was ever made. I just think it is, you know, Eagles. Yeah. I think he goes up the price of Eagle.

Speaker 1:          00:06:37       Do you think? Hopefully this is just something that's going to take a little while, but it will eventually come to play.

Speaker 3:          00:06:42       Of course, I think, uh, it happened, you know, but I think, you know, me being with top rank and standing in the way of a lot of things happening.

Speaker 1:          00:06:54       Mmm, that makes sense. That makes sense. He's like, it's interesting that promoters or boxing promoters worked together well at all. Right. You know, like you think about it like if the UFC had to work with Bella Tor and put together some world championship fight every, basically there's so many times we get champion versus champion. They have two different promoters and they have to decide to get together and make this happen. Who want to get the more, most of the pot. That's probably what it is. Yes,

Speaker 3:          00:07:17       it's going on Fox or ESPN and who's going to promote it. And

Speaker 1:          00:07:22       it's also like when someone like Floyd Mayweather has done what he's done and sold the kind of paper views that he's sold and then you know, and achieved this sort of level of financial fame as well as like people, he's famous not just for being the best boxer but famous for being insanely rich. Like that's part of the fame. Cause he promoted yes cause he promoted, cause he figured it out and a lot of other people are gonna probably try to do the same thing as well. Right. That's that's not my style. Too busy. Right. Too busy. Yeah man mean you got to just stay busy being Terence Crawford. Do you want to be promoting that? Seems like a lot of a pain in the ass. Well

Speaker 3:          00:07:59       just [inaudible] I do want to promote it. I run my mouth and fit. What about after you're done? When your career is over, when you've retired, do you think you'd do some promoting then or training? What did you do? Nah, I'd just be uh, in my gym back at home and my coach got us a gym and just put my time and effort into the kids in the gym and my five kids that I have. Beautiful. Yeah, that's a, that's a, that's a solid plan. You know, you don't need to get involved in that promoting shit. Now it do get to the gym sometimes and working with the fighters, do you? Yeah, I got that funny because it's funny to see work with them because after about two rounds he came to this shit man cause they're not listening like you telling them over and over and do one little simple thing and like just say you tell them to keep your right hand right.

Speaker 3:          00:08:51       And they keep going like this. Like are you talking about brand new people like yeah, like even even boxers, dad's being boxing for years that they really don't have the fundamentals down to a tee and you're like, dude, you been boxing too long for you to still be making the same mistake. And it's like, I only can say certain things for solid, for certain learn for S for solid learning. And then it's just like, alright, I ain't saying it no more. Well, yeah, your opinion is as valuable as anybody alive. Do you one of the best fucking boxers ever. If you're a beginning boxer and Terrance Crawford teaching you something, you're not listening. You're probably nervous as shit. [inaudible] for sure. But that's crazy that you'd be working with beginners. That's, I must be wild for them. They must work with all of them. That's awesome. That's kind of freaked them out though.

Speaker 3:          00:09:44       Especially the ones that's professional. And they'd be in the gym and I'd be yelling at them. They'd be on a mess with BOMAC. I'll come over there and critique them and they'd be like, shit, here come bud. They look at me like, am I doing it right? Am I doing it right? And you know, so I just want everybody to win. I'll just keep them sharp. Well, when someone has achieved that level, the level that you have, you know, like anybody around you that gets a chance to watch your train. And be a part of that. That's, that's gigantic to see something like that. And in the gym when you agree just to see like a world champion, I mean for just having him around, you know, in the gym when he's not even posed to be training or just being around in the other fires around is phenomenal because you'll see this little extra pussy and the guys sure.

Speaker 3:          00:10:29       You know or like he'll come and run with them and I can see the smaller guys just want to try to get ahead of him, you know? So it's cool man. It's cool. It's really cool. Yeah. That's a do you think about that? That how much you inspiring guys? Of course. All the time. That's why I come to the gym when Bomag be like, man just take a rest. Just relax. I come to the gym and workout when, you know I don't have nothing coming up just so I can show them. Like even though I'm the champion of the world, I still work extra hard to make sure I stay champion cause it's harder to keep the championship title then getting there. It's one of the more beautiful things about boxing is there's no shortcuts. None for the best ever. You have to train, you have to train hard as fuck.

Speaker 3:          00:11:17       You just got to do well. You don't want to do it. There's no doubt about it. You got to do everything you're supposed to do. There's no if, ands, or buts. And if you don't fuck with your head, and that's one thing I took from Floyd Mayweather. You will always see them working out. I don't care if he was at a bar, you'll see him running from the bar. He got his little workout clothes and his little TMT, uh, van and he just ran home. Like, I'll use him three o'clock in the morning, man, let's go work out. You know? And that's what I admire the most of is his work at his work ethic is off the chart. Does the only way you be that good? There's no other way. I mean, yeah, he understands boxing at a level that, I mean, grew up with it. Having his dad and his uncle and all that. The family was so many great boxers around him all the time. But he, you don't get that good without insane work ethic. There's no shortcuts.

Speaker 2:          00:12:08       No, not at all. I, I have never seen nobody like put as much work in as Floyd. So that's why, you know, for me, I'm like thinking to myself, I gotta work twice as harder, you know, if I want to get above him because I never want to be like anybody. I always want to be myself, but I want to surpass the people that I was in front of me.

Speaker 3:          00:12:34       Was it, um, eyeopening when you got to watch him train?

Speaker 2:          00:12:38       Of course. Of course. You know, when I was younger it lets me know that I wasn't working as hard. Yeah. So now when, when fighters come to my camp or I bring in some sparring partners or some friends that's professional that just want to, you know, come to camp and just experience, just being in camp with a world champion, they all say the same thing, man. I thought I was working hard till I came up here, man. You work man, you work too hard. And, and the thing for some people, cause some people they just be like, I can't do it today. Like nah, I'm gonna let y'all do them too. I'm going to go to the gym but I ain't gonna do the other stuff. And I just be like, man, come on man. They'd be like, man, my body and be like man, see that's what it's going to determine. Winning and losing. You complaining about your body when you can rest later, you know? Right.

Speaker 3:          00:13:29       What other stuff you're trying to get them to do? I know you do a lot of stair running, right? I do a lot of everything. I do yoga and I do street relation. I do swimming, hot yoga to do hot yoga. I love that. I joke I used to do it two times. I believe that everybody can do it. It's just a mixture of, you know, just all around body working out. What do you find that you get out of yoga?

Speaker 2:          00:13:57       Oh man. Yoga is harder than you think. You know, you in there, you got to control your breathing. You know, just holding your hands in certain positions is tiring. So the little muscles that you really not using, you know, in a day to day activities you use in a yoga and it's just burning and you're just like, man, just hold your hands up like this and going like this. You be like, you be in there shaking like man, it's kind of burning and you see the girls and you like trying to do it and it just, it helps you with your balance as well.

Speaker 3:          00:14:30       Yeah, it helps me with a bunch of things. It's just interesting that uh, more fighters don't adopt it. You know, I think anything that makes your body more flexible and increases your range of motion and then gives you strength and all the, it feels like when I do yoga, like all the connecting stuff like the shoulders and hips and knees, all that gets like this extra stability workout that you don't get from a lot of other things. I feel like it connects everything together. Good. And it, and it helps you prevent injuries. Yeah. Yeah. No. So now w speaking of that, like what do you do in terms of recovery? Do you do, uh, ice baths or sauna and massage, that kind of shit. Massage and um, I don't, I don't like the cold so I need to like, I don't really take absence. All bass.

Speaker 3:          00:15:14       Yeah. Just did massages. That's a grownup in Nebraska thing though, right? What's that cold? It's cold in Nebraska, but I'm used to that cold but I just can't fix myself to get in the ice tub. [inaudible] I never was that type. It's hard. It is hard. I'd be like, you pick your poison. I stick my feet in there. It'd be like I ain't getting in there. Yeah, it's rough. They'd be like, come on, it's going to help you. All right. It's gonna help me next time cause fuck. Have you ever fucked with cryotherapy? Ever tried? I did that one time. That's easier. Yeah, it was cool. Cause only triads. Yeah. Dry, dry. And it's only three minutes. So, but that, that ice bath, yeah, I'll do the car crier. Ice bath. Nah, you want it. I'll be sore. I don't know what the science says. What's better?

Speaker 3:          00:16:04       I've heard both things. I've heard that the ice bath better cause it's prolonged cause it's like 15 minutes and I've heard the cry was better because you hit your body with such a high degree of cold that freaks out and produces these cold shock proteins better. Either one. You do those, um, you do massage. Do you do yoga? What kinda S I know you do strength and conditioning stuff. Gotta watch your Instagram, you've got a great Instagram. Right. And your kids are wrestlers, right? Yeah. That's awesome. Yeah. Do you think your kids ever fight MMA? Nah, I actually, I'm on, I'm trying to convert them to baseball, really piety in the next year, you know, because it ain't, it ain't that much money in wrestling. It's true. You know, when you look at the MMA fighters, uh, they ain't making a lot of money to get beat up.

Speaker 3:          00:16:48       Like they getting beat up, like look at, uh, pedis. He broke his feet. Right. You know, but yeah, it looked like he broke one of his ankles maybe. And, or at least heard it. I'm pretty sure he didn't make over 300,000 for that shot, that fight. I'd like to know, see if they find out how much the Anthony Pettis made for that fight. He broke his foot for sure. Yes. Oh yeah. He was walking around or being pushed around in a wheelchair today on Instagram. Yeah. It's rough. You see people getting need kicked in the face, teeth. Do you look at it as being more brutal than boxing? Yeah. Yeah. You're taking, you take more risks and UFC it's like saying more head injuries but UFC more risks for yes, for sure. For injuries, right. Broken bones and ankles and knees and shit. Yeah. And I just didn't get and where fall that boxing ain't worth a lot of things too cause you seeing people die in the ring and uh, and they ain't worth your life at the end of the day when you decide to hang it up.

Speaker 3:          00:17:51       How will you know when you never, well me personally, I won't think I'll ever know when, but I just got to date and the age and like, alright, you know, middle thirties. How old are you now? I'll be 32 next month. So your close, close. So you have it in your head. Just got on top. Like Marvin Hagler was one of the only ones that ever do it. He went on top, another switch hitter. Marvin Hagler was the only one out of all the greats who lost that fight. Controversial loss to sugar. Ray Leonard is like fuck this, I'm done. He walked away. Nope. Never ever came back. [inaudible] his last fight was a religion. Yup. Yup. That was it. Controversial laws to let her became a movie star in Italy. He ever seen his movies in Italy? No. I just watch some clips. Hilarious. Marvin Hagler fucking people up.

Speaker 3:          00:18:43       He's like, Oh a movie star. He does like these crazy Italian movies. What is this? How much he made for 155,000. Wow. 55 if he won. But so Dee has made a flat two 50 for the win. Yeah. The, they used to before the Reebok deal, they used to make much more way more for sponsors. Yeah. Cause, uh, I've got a buddy Marsala baked it. You know that guy? He's really good. Very talented. Brassica. Oh is he? Oh, okay. Cool. He's fun. Brought Bosnia buddy lives in Lincoln, Nebraska. Okay. You know, uh, real, real good friends. Real good friends and talented kid. Yeah. And they just always say art, well we get paid for this. If we win this for showing up this, if we get best knockout out of other data, this is more, this is why we to Hagler as this is why money is an action hero. And this is like not far after the fight with Indio too. Cause there was a lot of lot of shit that was unresolved after NGO one. He was a, I've never seen that. Oh this, these are the spaghetti westerns like, but for you know, whatever year this league Harvard Haggard shoot, everybody can speak the language. Uh, yeah. Yeah. Apparently speaks little Italian and you know, he's a star over there. Wow. Yeah. Look at, let me see.

Speaker 3:          00:20:09       But he just decided like, I don't want to [inaudible] box anymore. I'm done. That's good for him though. Yeah. You know, I mean to get punched in the head no more. He speaks perfect. When you hear him speak today, they do a, you know [inaudible] never, never. I'd love to, yeah, I'd like to meet that guy. I was, he was my hero when I was kid. Yeah, I remember there was a video of him, he was trained for Mustapha Hampshire and he's running down Cape Cod in the winter with a, with a hoodie on, just screaming war. Whoa. All the cold coming out of his mouth, that steam and he's running. I was like, Oh my God. Cause I was, you know, doing martial arts back then and I was watching him call him like that. That's the ultimate champion. That's a chamber that puts himself in a terrible play.

Speaker 3:          00:20:51       Puts himself down on the Cape in the winter time to do all his training in the cold runs in the cold and it does it in runs and combat boots too. He ran in combat boots and he would just be, he was hard as fuck and he just had crazy work ethic, crazy work ethic. And I remember whenever I would think about being, thinking about being lazy, I would think of him running down the beach going, Whoa, just to just shadow punching in the beach. Oh, it's crazy that you say that because I remember when we was little, we used to always run in the cold. I mean, it would be so cold where the snow is freezing up. You tearing up, but as you get older you'd be like, man, I ain't buy run. And I go down. I ran on the treadmill. You already know. You already know. You know how to fight. You know you know how to persevere. You already know you're a champion. You already know you're at the top of the game. You don't have to prove that to yourself anymore. You know how tough you all know. No times that. It'd be times that I'd just be like, all right, we, we need that hardcore work. Let's go every name. I be like, what? We ain't going to, why not? One time. One time we ran right after Thanksgiving, dude. Oh no. Right after, right after Thanksgiving.

Speaker 3:          00:22:11       I don't get out there. Just get and get in the truck. Let's go. Cool. So he may, he made Thanksgiving dinner and we in training camp, so you know we all gotta lose weight and stuff and Paul made all this fool man, we all grub in this stuff and then so I'm eating, after I get down eating, I'm like man, I'm stuffed. I'm like man, I can't wake up this heavy. I was like, man everybody let's get it ready to go around. And everybody looking at me laying down like, man, it's cold. You treat you for it. So we run it with these little flashlights, like the little yellow man like [inaudible] you go fishing and stuff. So we all run in air by hunting dude, dude, dude, why that night? It was, it was pretty chill. Wow. Yeah. But that kind of shit like what Floyd may wear that does, that's that two o'clock in the morning workout routine every night.

Speaker 3:          00:23:05       Like it's good to just throw monkey wrenches into your sense of what you should be doing and when be ready to do it. Always. Yeah. That's why they're cold. Weather running is big. Cold weather running is those people that live in cold climates that run in the winter. Man, that's us. That's a hearty breed. A human that's not a regular person that decides like nobody's got a gun to your head. It's not your job. You decide to put your fucking running shoes on and lace up and go out there and when it's zero, it's kinda like when before I fought America and I was down there shadowboxing and in the snow and I blizzard. Oh yeah. I w I'll it on, I'll put it on on my Instagram. Everybody was like, Oh he traded for Spence like 10 10 inches, 10 inches that day and it was a pleasure.

Speaker 3:          00:23:56       And we actually got knocked off a couple of days of leaving. Leaving for training camp. Yeah. Wow. Cause there was so much fucking Snowden, but there's something about that, like even you talking about it, you know, it's kind of wild. You're out there boxing in the snow shadowboxing in the middle of a blizzard. Something wild about that. It's crazy though because when it's snowing it's not that cold. Right. It's true, isn't it? Yeah. Like insulates a little bit in some weird way. I was just sitting in the house and it was just like, man, go outside and do something. So I went outside, ran a little bit and dinner. I come home and I was like, come here. He's like, what? Like come and record me shadowboxing and stuff after I ran. So it was cool. So when, when I see you doing those, a little stair runs, you do that quite a bit, right?

Speaker 3:          00:24:39       Right. Every Sunday. What did he do that in a around probably won't tell anybody where you go. They know they know last spring. Oh okay. That's, that's a famous spot, right man to to experience how many steps is that? That whole thing. Something crazy. Right? This is, it's a mile and a half up. I know it's a Mount. A mile up a Hill. How long does it take you to get up there? Probably like 35 minutes before fucking horrible run and I run and walk. We walk up but some people running. Oh you walk it? Yeah. That's insane. Then people that'd be running the same cause the air been thinner and thinner as you go. And then the steps, you got some steps that's like this, that small. And then you got some steps where you got to really reach. Oh like, so if you're running the slip, yeah, it's a fucked up crumble for real.

Speaker 3:          00:25:32       Yeah. Like when you, when you were up at the top, I feel like you were in the clouds sometimes like looking down like the cars is, it's a straight shot. Would you do your training camp up there? Colorado Springs, right? Just for the altitude? Yup. Yeah. Actually uh, got a house up there. Oh really? You just go back and do that for each camp? What made you decide to do camps out there? Just to get away from home, you know, clear my head, get away from all the negativity. And I've been doing this since 2013, 37, 13, 2013 so, so do you have a gym set up at, at the house. Oh, that's nice. I saw like Canelo had something like that down in San Diego. There was a thing when he was training for one of his fights, they just rented the house, turned the garage into a boxing ring. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:26:19       that kind of thing. You have all set up out there. A lot of guys do that at big bear too, right? Yep. It's similar today. Okay. Yeah. Having that high altitude, is that what you prefer? Like look for for your wind? Yeah, that, that helped my win, but at the same time everything is, is already set up. Like everything from the yoga to the swimming to the gym to everything. It's like a second home to me. So it's not like I got to go look in the fine. Where am I to do this? Where I'm going to do this? It's like everything is everything and you know, my family come up there and visit me and we get the job done. That's all locked in right now. When you go up there, who sets your schedule as far as what your daily routine is? I know you said everything, yoga, all, everything.

Speaker 3:          00:27:09       Well, it's, it's uh, it's two more coaches that that helps me. Solid Diego's and red spike. So we all get together, we make a make a uh, calendar like a month in advance. And now when you do things like when you add in yoga and swimming, how do you know when to put those in? W w everything was always, it started off with a trial and error back in 2013 grab that microphone pulled up close to it. There we go. Like I said, it's around, it moves all over the place, right? Every, like I said, it's done with a child or an ear. 2013 you know, we tried this and we tried that and then we started doing this and we started doing that. And then, you know, just, you just look at the fighter and just see if it is, if it's working for him, you know, and if it's working for him, you want to stick with it.

Speaker 3:          00:27:52       And then you start adding little small things into it. Like the old gun, the swim in the run and you know, the incline. And so after so many amount of years, I think we've been since 13. I mean he just worked like clockwork now. Now do you monitor in your heart rate or how do you know, like do, do, do any of that stuff while you're training? Nothing. Just go by feel. Yeah. Yeah. There's uh, two schools of thought, right? The schools of thought is like the old way is the best way. Like just do hard shit. Chop wood, you know, run, do the, do the standard stuff. And there's other people that watch their macros and you know, they're ma

Speaker 2:          00:28:30       smiling. You're not watching, I know what you're talking about. But I don't,

Speaker 3:          00:28:33       we don't do none of that. Yeah. I think we trained more or less like the old school way, but we do got like some of the new stuff in like the strip, the condition. We've got district to condition a guy Jamie belt, he's excellent and he kind of adds a little stuff, new modern age stuff in, in, uh, into the workouts. Like sometimes I'll be wanting to do more and he be like, nah, I was, I was enough for you. Like, you might not think you did enough, but trust me, you'll feel it tomorrow. What? You wake up tomorrow, you like God really is sore. If there some ties, like I'll add some stuff and just out, you know, try and make things different. You look at me saying now, but we're not doing that.

Speaker 2:          00:29:16       [inaudible] already be like Danny. He's like trying to add extra stuff or would be like one more round. All right, come on one more round and then you'll do that one more round and they'd be like, all right, we got one more round y'all. You'd be like, man, you'd be like, man, I just pushed everything down to that last round because you said that was the last round. Well come on baby. Come on. I'm not about to argue with you. So you can be great. So like,

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       all right, well the fighter, it's like there's this, this gotta be a balancing point, right? Like you don't want them to do too much. Right? So like when that guy told you like that's enough for today and you're like, want to keep going? That's the natural inclination is to work harder. Yeah. It's that weird balancing point. We gotta figure out when you're over-training, right? It's if you're not monitoring your heart rate or anything like that, you just basically have, you have a flat day, you feel flat, just chill out.

Speaker 2:          00:30:06       Yup. Yeah, sometimes. Yeah. Sometimes. Boy always asked me before we go work out, how you feeling? How you feeling? Like I'm good at ball, I'm good. Or sometimes I'd be like, man, I'm tired. Like he'd be like, all right, well we just gone coast today. Like if a Spartan day he'd be like, all right, well don't be trying to do too much. We just gonna spar, hit the mist, get out. We ain't gonna do no bad. We ain't gonna do nothing next year. And then after I do the bagging, sparring, I mean not the bag, but the missing spar. I might be feeling good and I'd be like, man, let's do action and be like, nah. You say you weren't feeling good at first. Listen, come on, let's go. That's the hardest part right there.

Speaker 1:          00:30:43       Pull up to know when to pull it back.

Speaker 2:          00:30:45       Right? Because he, he knows me. He been with me since the beginning, so he knows just by looking at me, you know what type of day I'm having, like either in the gym or outside the gym.

Speaker 1:          00:30:57       That's gotta be important, isn't it? Like knowing him from the time when he was younger and just start now to today is definitely his way.

Speaker 4:          00:31:03       Plays a big part in the relationship as far as like say inside the ring and outside touring. Cause uh, you know, as a trainer, you, you'll never want your fighter to overtrain or you'll never want him to under-trained. So, but w I, I'll never have to worry about him under training because he's always in the gym, but I do have to worry about him over training because he always in the gym, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. Like you said, some days and be like, man, maybe we're gonna pull back this week. Why, man, man, you've been training for already for eight weeks, you know, so, and we still got one or two more weeks to go before we hit the down date, the actual peak point, you know? All right. What level we have, we'll pull back, you know, and then sometimes you yell at hardheaded and say, no, come on man, let me do a little bit more.

Speaker 4:          00:31:48       Alright dude. A little bit more, but don't do too much. You know, you ain't gotta put your all into it. You know, just, just, just move around a little bit. You know, you got to do basically all fighters like that. He says she fighters, good fighters. Cause most good fighters like Terence and other fighters. Jamelle herring, Steve Nelson, you gotta you gotta pull them guys back. You always gotta pull them back cause they always want to go, go, go, go, go, go. Cause I always got this winning gotta fucking win. I gotta fucking win. I understand that. I want you to fucking win too, but I want you to break your body down. I don't want you to [inaudible] you're boxing inside the gym. You got to have something left when you go to the fight. That's a lesson that's very hard for young guys to learn around. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. But it's so critical to know

Speaker 1:          00:32:32       where you body is. And at this stage of your career, I would imagine you just kinda feel it, you know? Exactly. And when you're in training camp

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       and you're gearing up for fight, is that how it feels like you know where you're at? Like, Oh, this is where I'm supposed to be. I feel this right here. Oh, he's just normal.

Speaker 2:          00:32:46       It's funny though, because every fight, every single fight before the fight, you know BOMAC always [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:32:55       waiting to hear me be like, Aw man, I'm ready. I'm ready. Like sometimes it'd be

Speaker 2:          00:33:03       a week before the fight, sometimes it'd be two weeks before the fight. But when he hear it, that's what I'm, that's what I been waiting on. It's like, nah, nah, I'm not, I'm comfortable because like sometimes he, he just be like, he'll look at me, I'll be working and stuff and then he don't say nothing. But then when I come to him like, yeah, I'm ready. He be lightened.

Speaker 3:          00:33:27       He said he ready. You get that from the fighting, right? Fuck down. Shit man. We'll beat this motherfucker Zack. Well, because you guys know each other so well and you worked together so long. Like you must like say, okay, here we are, we're where we're supposed to be. Right. You've, you've been there, falls right into place. All right. My, my biggest thing

Speaker 2:          00:33:47       in that, I always told bone every since I was an amateur because I remember losing a couple of fights because I didn't train as hard and I got tired, you know, and I couldn't really do too much and always told bill. I said Bo, if I'm in the best of my shit, best shape that I possibly can be in nobody being nobody named Baldwin, I know

Speaker 3:          00:34:11       that's why you need to quit bullshitting. So, so it just got to the point, real friend that's a real trainer and a real friend is. So it just got to the point where I just start like training real, real hard. And I was just like training not to go over you in this happened. I was a teenager. I'll just start training, not to get tired. If I can go in there and fight and not get tired, I'm a win. That's what I always stayed at. So the switch flipped. Yup. He figured it out cause I was losing the people that I shouldn't have lost to just head down just swinging wall. Wow. But they was in shape and I was trying to be all cute and slick and get tired. Now it's a matter of life and death, knee hole. And they pushing me. I'm falling all over the place as a, as a little kid, you know.

Speaker 3:          00:34:59       And I was just like, I'll never get that tired ever again in the fight. Dad is such an important lesson for young fighters to hear such important lesson that it's, there's no shortcut. When you look at a guy like Terrence Crawford, you'd say, well that guy must be insanely talented. I mean his timing is reads on people, the ability to switch dances. And he said, well duh. Yeah. Well how'd that come about? That talent came about through relentless hard work. Right? That's what, that's what makes that talent emerge. I'm sure you have a, an amazing inclination for boxing. Every elite of the elite fighter does, but you don't get to be there without any hard work. It doesn't exist. There's no way. There's no, it's so important for young fighters to hear and that's what a lot, a lot of guys that don't see you as that hard work in the jail.

Speaker 3:          00:35:43       You know what I'm saying? [inaudible] with anything that when you look at any top fighter and you look at all the sacrifices they make just to be where they at and you, you have people taking shots at them and stuff and they'd be like, man, yo know what? I didn't put my body due to be here today or you didn't know what I went to went through and is just like total disrespect for somebody that haven't even stepped foot in the ring to be trying to critique you when they ain't. They ain't even stepped foot to get punched in the face before. They can never really understand though, right? No one could ever really understand what it takes to be an elite boxer when your whole, the future of your family, the future of yourself, your financial success and all the people around you is dependent on you navigating the most shark filled waters in professional sports budget, train killers with their hands.

Speaker 3:          00:36:35       Everybody's real good at knocking other people out with their hands and you are successfully navigating those waters like Nope. No one really understands that other than you, right, you and all the other people like you will like the real me people on the outside that are close to you kind of get it a little bit. You are the only one that's ever going to be able to understand that. So all those people talking shit like they might as well be speaking a language, they don't even know what the meaning is. Fact, it's nonsense. Just say nonsense and it's just like you got a bullseye on your head in your back because you, you, you reverse first. You had your eye on somebody and you was like, man, I gotta beat this door after this dude. I gotta beat this dude. So you was I in that person that was in your shoes, you know, that was once champion of the world.

Speaker 3:          00:37:18       Like I was iron Ricky burns when I was coming up, you know, and not there. I be him now. Everybody's IME because I'm chatting now. So it's no more Ricky burns. It's Terrence Crawford. We got to get Terrence Crawford. He's the chin. So now, and it's like damn, everybody wants your head. So now you've got Cheney were harder to keep the title [inaudible] got show up at your gym. Talk shit like Shannon Briggs style and nobody coming home. The hall man, Shannon Briggs where his weight class, he would show up in Omaha. Let's go try to break. He's a Lyria. He will leave on the hall the same way he gave me. He told me I got beat up by somebody. Uh, do you ever see what he did to Vladimir Klitschko when they cut each other and then when they were, well there's a couple of times one at a restaurant poured water on his head, but he comes out that's right from the broken glass.

Speaker 3:          00:38:15       Right. But the other time was, Oh, he was, he was on a wakeboard or on a paddleboard and uh, Shannon came by in a boat and knocked him off the fucking bat and the waves fell. That's, I picked that one stage, all that stuff. I think it was seems like it was stayed just like, man, how are you? You know where it is, man. That every single time he lets go some point. It's good point and then you just so happen to have some good cameras getting the footage. It's true. Then wasn't good cameras, but Shannon wisely would travel with good cameras and then just start making these these scenes. He never fought him. Yeah. He didn't ever fight them. Yeah. I think you fought him when he was younger or something knocked him out or something like that. Vitaly Vitale knocked him out. Yeah, he fought.

Speaker 3:          00:38:56       He fought the older brother Vitaly. He was a monster. Yeah. That's why we fought. Right. I believe Vito V it's how you say it. That's how you say vitally does. That guy had an iron jaw. The brother. Nobody could knock out the brother. It was crazy. That guy would just take bombs. Remember when he fought Lennox Lewis immediately? Yeah. Took bombs. I mean that that guy was so God damn durable. He would've won that fight if he wouldn't have got that cut. Giant cut. Yeah, he was winning. What a weird style too. Right? He had the one of the most awkward, like so strange watching him throw punches, but it was effective and he remind me of a Drago off Iraqi a little bit. That guy's a doc, like he's got a pH D I think he speaks like five languages. What'd they call them? Doctor iron fist was that his name was a character.

Speaker 3:          00:39:47       It's interesting too, like the heavyweight division has now become the focal point of boxing again. It's very exciting. I was like, yeah. For a long time, Vladimir Klitschko was the heavyweight champion of the world and for whatever reason, nobody gave a fuck. It was weird because he was dominating all those years. He was jabbing clutch, jabbing clutch, because we didn't have the American champion for sure. So everybody was like, Aw, forget it. We went there. Probably something to do with it, but if he was fighting, it's like, can you just find the way dr Deontay Wilder does? Who cares if he's from the moon? Right. You start showing people like that, like we want to see that guy fight. Like, you don't care if that guy's from fucking Brazil, wherever he's from. When you're laying there right hand, good night, God damn. It's one of those punches where people just go, you see people in the audience go, God, he hits hard.

Speaker 3:          00:40:39       Even when he don't fully extend. It'd be like the crazy thing is when he fought Tyson fury who was two Oh nine two Oh nine, just nothing to any punches. So fucking hard. It's crazy. That dude is a, an anomaly. The fact that he won a bronze medal in the Olympics three years after taking up boxing. Right. Does insane. Insane. It's just insane. Yeah. Cause there a lot of people they asked me, cause we was in the same, you know, trials in 2007 and it was like, do you ever remember Deontay Wilder and, and the amateurs? I said, man, he came out of nowhere cracking people.

Speaker 3:          00:41:23       He never went on none of the, the uh, duals or nothing. He just came out of nowhere. Yeah. He's all the top guys in the division. Crazy. That's a, let's say he's a unicorn. You know when you look at his record, what is it like 39 knockouts out of 41 fights, something like that. 40 knockouts, 40 knockouts and 41 fights all his four year gate, 39 39 years. Two only two fights. One. What is it a the first one was it Brazil dump? No. No, Brazil. He just knocked out. Who was, who else who went the distance? Stubborn. Stubborn went the distance and their first fights. The Vern and yeah, and then he flatlined him in the second fight. That crazy one. Just the hits dude. Why in man, people go flying. He got the law. He got the right last name. Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:42:16       What's he doing? Wow, he's start. How about that? To this day the dude interviewing was like, shit, what did I do? What the fuck did I do? And then he uses hashtag till this day. He uses that all the time when his Instagram so that guys gets shellshocked. He gets PTSD every time. Rash hashtag till this day. He's like, no, I, it's funny though, because we all, we all be saying that now till this day. I am going back to that. That story told him, yeah, he took that phrase over. Yeah, that was a, that was a phrase, you know that he just owned. He took it over. That's his now. All right. That's it. That's this one interview till his day. One interview, one interview before a fight. He's getting geared up. But you seem to look all my God. Terrifying.

Speaker 3:          00:43:10       Terrifying. When you know how hard that guy hits and he's mad at you like this muffler to knock me out for sure. 100% he would never do that. It's like you beat your in the room and a lion like, Oh no. And he's aggressive. He's mr lion. Oh, you sure this thing's trained? You sure it's not going to eat me. He's so, he's there too. That must have been terrifying. Please blink fully geared up and ready for me for war before this fight. That is [inaudible]. That is hilarious. That is hilarious. So this whole division. Now, if you look at the heavyweight division between, you know, Andy Ruiz just beats Anthony Joshua, and then they're going to try to figure out what they were going to try and do that in Saudi Arabia. But apparently Andy's like, while I'm fighting America, he should took gay guys in Saudi Arabia, a big money fight.

Speaker 3:          00:44:05       I'm sure. Well, they're still gonna do it. They just arguing over where is it off the table now? I don't know this. I did. Who knows, man. I mean, you guys know better than me. It's a lot of games have been shipped by like where you're talking about before, ego and stuff. Same kind of deal, I'm sure as the arrows. Spence jr fight. Same kind of deal. They're jocking to see who could get the Andes worried about I'm taking from [inaudible]. Yeah. He's worried about taking some Mexican supplements. Right. While he's over in another country that they won't test him. So he should have

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       Vata or yes. Right. Testing that is going to go over there and you know, testify it. Yeah, that's a, that's one of the reasons why people gonna love a dude like Andy Ruiz as a champion. Like he, he looks like a regular folk. Right. You know, he's like, he's got a lot of extra body fat. He's a bad motherfucker. But you know, Anthony, Joshua looks like he was made in the lab. Just got a perfect physique man. It's crazy how, how big dude guy? He's huge cause man he wasn't that big at first, but now he's slim it down. But I think he put on a lot of weight to, you know, carry with vitamin mere Klitschko please go. Is that when you put all the weight on? Yeah, I think so. What kind of testing they do for that fight? Uh, they test you for everything, but did they test you for everything at the wanes?

Speaker 2:          00:45:21       Nah. See, see me. Um, I'm with the Vada during the full testing tools. They show up at six o'clock in the morning, the whole deal and they can test out. They, they can test me right now and if they wanted to tell him I'd be waiting outside right now. It's cool. Cause I know I'm good. So, but when he fought, um, Vladimir and he got all big, what did they do with any kind of wide testing? I don't know what type of contract, what they signed for on a contract when they fight contract. But I know me when I'm in training camp, they come whenever they had come six o'clock in the morning and turn around and come at six o'clock at night if they wanted to. That's a point of diminishing returns when you get too much muscle, right? Like

Speaker 1:          00:46:04       yeah, it can make you stronger, but that, that's going to need a lot of oxygen too. And if your body's not used to it, if you, if this is over the course of like a year or two, all the sudden you got this extra muscle like is, do you, are you a fan of guys lifting a lot of weights and lifting up lightweight? Yeah, the right way just to stay strong. Yeah. Well I have a vendor Holyfield we're scheduling Evander Holyfield. I'm excited. Huge Evander Holyfield fan. But he was one of the rare guys that put on the mass and moved up from cruiserweight to heavyweight and fucking still never got tired. I mean Evander never got tired cause he, they put the work crazy work ethic and he was a guy that got thick and muscular, but it didn't slow him down. It enhanced him, you know, especially when you get into like the Tyson fights like that, that muscle didn't hold him pack at all and he was fucking jacked.

Speaker 1:          00:46:52       I mean he was he comparison to cruiserweight Evander Holyfield. Do you look at heavyweight of random old like the Riddick Bowe fights. D D is scroll up a lot. Fuck. He was just cut though. Yes. Chiseled. Yeah. So that's what Joshua said, dude, cut, cut down a little bit and she has a weapon, gets a get mobile. Do you think this was something that he got mad at Lennox Lewis for saying that he needs to change camps? Do you think that makes sense? Maybe just he should sit down with his team and figure out where they went wrong at. I don't think about, I don't think you should change everything. The word was that he had gotten knocked out in training. That was a true, you heard

Speaker 3:          00:47:29       that as well by Joey. Well, Terrence Crawford heard it. Shit's got to be real. That's what I'm saying. I'm just going, I'm going. I'm Twitter now. I want to say it feels real or fake. I'm just saying. I heard you heard it. Yeah, but you know, most people heard the rumors go around and everybody here and it's not even true because that could happen. Right? Like Richard Gere with that juror bulb his ass. Remember that one? You ever heard that? But you never heard that he said a jerboa PD. You heard it, right? Yeah. Tell him to tell him the rumor. I just heard the rumor. I don't know. Kids were kids. Um, there was a rumor that Richard Gere had to go to the hospital. Get a, we'll take out of his ass. Now I grew up in the East coast. My friend Eddie grew up in California. He heard the same story.

Speaker 3:          00:48:12       I was like, this is the same God damn rubber. Like how this room we get across the country with the same age, no internet. The rumor made it all the way across the country when we were in high school. So was it true or not? Probably not. I think you'd get out of trouble out yourself. You don't need to go to the hospital. You know is not, not worth the embarrassment. You'll take some time to go to the store and buy some tweezers, but you're, uh, you don't need to go to the hospital. Just get a mirror and some tweezers. We could handle this. We don't need to let everybody know our business. The other one was rod Stewart, rod Stewart. There was a rumor where in high school it was boom, pre high school, the rod Stewart had swallowed a bunch of Jews and had to go to the hospital and get his stomach pumped. It was probably some guy who rod Stewart fucked his girlfriend and he started riding the bad guy. And that probably is true.

Speaker 3:          00:49:00       I don't think so because I think when I hosted fear factor, we made people drink calm. They had to drink. They had a drink donkey com you could drink it and you can drink a lot of it and you're fine. I don't think you have to go to the hospital. My experience on fear factor, it taught me that a, I don't believe that rod Stewart ever had that real problem. Hey, so did you ever do anything that uh, I ate attempts. I ate some shit. They wouldn't let me try any of the stunts because of insurance purposes or you know, they had, cause the insurance doesn't let the host just try it out for fun. Like I wanted to drive some of the cars off buildings and shit, but they wouldn't let me do, we had one where they hit a ramp off the top of a building.

Speaker 3:          00:49:36       They hit a ramp and the ramp flipped the car through the air and they flew and they landed on these cardboard boxes. They stack these cardboard boxes up like several stories high. And that's how they would get these cars to land softly. So the car would boom, hit the cardboard box and just slowly sink down. And then they would use a crane, flipped the car over and then they could use that car again. It didn't even get damaged. Wow. So these people would fly this fucking car off. It looked like the craziest amusement park ride ever. And you wanted to do all, fuck yeah, I want you to get it man. I'm like, come on, let me do that one. It looks easy. I'm like, I'll do it for the promo. Like God man, I be cool with jumping out the plane. Yeah, we didn't do any of that but we did have people bungee cord jump off of a fucking helicopter.

Speaker 3:          00:50:20       That was crazy. We had a people with a cord there was attached to a helicopter and then they were hooked up to a tree and they had an unlocked themselves in the tree. They had all got a ring of keys. He had to find the right key in a certain amount of time. And then when they did it, they unlocked and trying. They went flying through the air cause they were attached to a bungee cord and the bungee cord was underneath the helicopter and it would go fucking launching them out into the middle of this crazy Canyon. I was like, Oh my God, someone's gonna die. Someone's going to die. This isn't worth it. This job's not worth it. There was a couple of times where I thought someone was going to die. Hey, that's crazy. Stupid. Ridiculous. I'm glad. I'm glad we got through it.

Speaker 3:          00:50:54       When nobody getting hurt, I'm sorry. [inaudible] came up with the uh, the stunts and all that. There was a bunch of people, they had a whole team. There's teams that people that came up with eating stunts. There were the beat team stunt guys, and then the AA team stunt guys was the first, first stunt and then there was the, the C, which was like the big championship finale thing. It's ridiculous show. Last time, man, I used to watch that show all the time. I'll have the time. I can't believe it's real. I watch it to this day. I was like, is that really me? What is that? So long ago. Uh, I remember I used to watch jackass, jackasses. Amazing. Those guys are alive, Steve. Oh, so healthy. You're fine. Come on. Making a fourth movie.

Speaker 3:          00:51:35       They're rolling that dice. They're rolling that die. Someone's going to die. Damn. That's crazy. That's, I only seen pimps of that. Johnny Knoxville was a movie star for awhile. Right. Cause he's still doing big movies. I think so he was doing big movies and then he was still willing to let a bowl hit him. He put a blindfold on, stood in front of a bowl and the bull just fucking launched him through the air blindfolded. Shit. That's the dumbest [inaudible] it's like the girl bus guys got fucked up, man. I mean that is theirs. They're taking some beatings. I'm, what do we do? Laugh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. See what you do is control who gets fucked up. Right. That's what I like about boxing. When I watched boxing express at the highest level, it's like one guy is controlling who gets fucked up, you know? Yeah. Red, the other guy liking or not, whether the other guy likes it or not. What was that? The Mexican gentleman that you fought recently that was talking a lot of shit and stopped him Benevidez Benevides, right? Yeah. That seemed like a particularly satisfying one for you because it was a lot of shit talking, leading up to that fight for years. There's certain times when you watch guys talk shit and I go sodden, this is not a good idea. But it just came out of [inaudible] and

Speaker 2:          00:52:53       nowhere, like I never said nothing to that dude. Never did nothing until that dude like, and he just out the blue just for years, like I'm ducking. I'm like, dude, you went up and wait. I'm at one 40 like when I was at one 35 he was talking about fighting me. He was at one 40 I got up to one 40 he wanted a little fight and then he moved up in weight and I'm like, dude, like you're nobody for me to be worried about. So then it got to the point where he was like, Oh, well they made me an offer to fight you and you talked me and this. So he started telling everybody I ducked them. I been ducking them since one 40 so in a press conference I said, did y'all ever and offer me or him a fight to fight each other? And I was like no. So I was so worried come up with that cause like well it don't matter. We fighting right now. So all right.

Speaker 1:          00:53:45       It was a good fight. This good fight is a good fight too to showcase you, you know, particularly the knockout. And that was a beautiful combination man. When we clipped him right. And then he gets up and then you put him away. When you watch a fight like that where you have a guy who talks shit and then you wind up fucking him up. Was it ever more satisfying? Oh yeah. Cause you seem to enjoy it. It's like Hey the best fighters enjoy putting a beating on someone. Yeah, of course.

Speaker 2:          00:54:12       Going into the fight, I had to calm my emotions down cause of the anger. Right. Because I really want the hurt that dude, you know. So going into the fight, I got to keep reminding myself, stay calm, relaxed, don't go in there and do nothing stupid. Cause this is what he wants you to do. And you been here before, you know, this is nothing new. You didn't have people talk crazy to you, but not to the level that he did. But you didn't have people talking crazy until you, so that's why when I first got in there, I was being patient, taking my time and just filling them out. You know, cause he's long, he's tall, he's long, got some speed on him, but he's a naturally uh, counter-puncher. So it was like I wasn't going to go in there and be careless and get countered because I already knew what he wanted to do.

Speaker 1:          00:55:01       Okay. So when you, when you see a guy, a guy like that, and you're fighting him, what, what is the strap like? This is a different strategy than a normal fighter because of the length and the counterpunch mobility. So you have to adjust, right. So what is, what was your plan going in there?

Speaker 2:          00:55:15       Well, see me, I got long orange to be in a division and my height. So I was just like, all right, just pick them apart, you know? And then once you go into your combinations, make sure you throw more than once because you're going to counter that first one properly.

Speaker 1:          00:55:33       And when you watch the fight, you feel like that's exactly what you're planting, preparing for right now. When you see Errol Spence, excuse me, we see Errol Spence jr. Does he represent to you like the one of the best of the upcoming guys that are, that are possibly on your radar? At least?

Speaker 2:          00:55:51       I really can't say that. You know, because arrow, this is the first real big test that he's up against. You know, um,

Speaker 1:          00:56:00       his last fight was with, uh, Mikey Garcia. That was a good fight. I mean, that was a good test.

Speaker 2:          00:56:06       It's true. You know, uh, Mikey came from, what, one 26? No. Um, he's what, five, six? When

Speaker 1:          00:56:15       you see the two of them at the Wayans and you really could see the difference in the size of arrow. I mean, Earl's ripped. Right. You know, so that's, that's why

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       I say you really can't tell with my DRCs, don't get me wrong. Mikey's a hell of a fighter, you know? But that was his first fight in the division. Uh, he's a smaller guy. He's short and his arms is shorter. Arrow, taller, longer, bigger, you know, so faster. So you, he really couldn't, I really couldn't see what I was trying to see. So Mike, Mikey went up just because it was a big fight. Right? Right. Is he going to stay there do you think? Or is he, yes, I believe he's going to fight Danny Garcia. Oh, interesting. Interesting. There's so many different outlets for boxing now. You know, there's PBC, there's Fox, there's, you know, ESPN is putting on high caliber fights now too. Right. It's very interesting. But HBO is out of the game. Doesn't that feel weird? It does bend that, that, that was the GoTo channel to watch a boxing when I was coming up, when he, people you had on Showtime was Mike Tyson and it was the best commentary crew twos, Jim Lampley, max Kellerman, Roy Jones, jr or sometimes George Foreman.

Speaker 3:          00:57:25       You know, Larry merchant America was the, was doing that. Yeah, man. Emmanuel Stewart and Harold Letterman would come in between rounds and give you his score. It was fucking great. I missed that. Yeah. Don't you miss that? I mean, Harold Letterman, rest in peace. He passed away recently. Um, didn't he did it? Yeah, he passed. Um, but I, I missed that man, Jim Lampley. It was fucking great and max Kellerman was great. It's like you don't have that, there's not a commentary team like that right now in boxing. My Ron not to the, to the level of why don't they have expertise go over to one of these streaming services like the zone or ESPN or something. It just seems like that's the team, right? Yeah. Well, Andre ward, Andre Ward's fantastic at it. He's coming down here to have him on, uh, Tim [inaudible]. Tim Bradley coming along pretty good too.

Speaker 3:          00:58:14       Yes. Very good. Yeah. I mean, he's taken, he's taking look like he's taking that role of a Teddy Atlas. Yeah. It's like he got all of that energy. Yes. Well, Teddy's fucking what a character. I know he'd get it. Is daddy. I rather get out there and fight. He was screaming. I was kidding. Fucking scared. It's funny. I, he'll say on, on here, these judges deed to be fired. Yeah, don't give a fuck. He doesn't give a fuck. You got skill notorious at bad decisions and he's right. He's right. Sometimes, you know he's right. He's wrong about that. Jeff Warner flight, the Jeff Warren Pacquiao fight watched when he freaked out. Is that one of the ones who freaked out when he freaked out? I watched when I first watched it, you know, listening to the commentary, I was like, man, back, y'all whooping him. You know what I mean? Why they, why they, why they, why they cheat them. You know? Cause I wanted to fight pack y'all because I was the next in line, of course the champion. So of course I'm rooting for Peggy. I don't want any cause that's a bigger fight. But after

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       watching the fight again, I was like, they not saying nothing about autumn shots. Jeff Horn was hitting Pat Galloway and he was just brutally bullying them, roughing him up. Uh, they can say all he was being dirty. Sometimes your head bud, but it's a fight that's going to happen, you know? But he was real life man handling pack. Y'all like pushing them all around and you see Keith Thurman couldn't even do that. Yeah. You know, and

Speaker 3:          00:59:48       beat Keith Thurman at 40 years old like God damn, this guy is great. I mean, just look at his career w eight different weight classes, world titles in eight different weight classes, 40 years old beats Keith Thurman who, who's in his prime. Right. Crazy. I mean w what a man man, what a world champion and he should have turned bright. Dan's the time on that one. Crazy. Any foreign inspire. It's both of them

Speaker 2:          01:00:15       bursts. And I thought Keith was going to pick up on it, but pack y'all was only fighting, fighting the end of the round. Like Keith would come on strong at the beginning of the round and they'd be like, all right, Keith winning, winning this round. And then Pat geologists were like, sure, yeah, pop, pop, pop, pop. And then Keith will be like, [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          01:00:33       You're like, Aw man, I ain't even seen the phone when he dropped him with that right hook early in the first. You're like, Oh right shit. Yeah, no, it was like a, he jumped in with that laughing and followed by like a straight right. It was crazy. Yeah, it was crazy. It's like wow, what was his shoulder? Yup. That's his plans. Yep. They was showing him, hitting other fighters with it. The same thing, who boom, boom. He also has a unique style. The leaping [inaudible] if he came in with that shit on you [inaudible] Oh man. Nah,

Speaker 2:          01:01:15       but I give, I take my hat off to pack y'all like, do you think it's possible that you could get a crack at him now? Cause now there he's, you know, he's in the hunt right now. I wouldn't, I wouldn't say, I wouldn't say so because I was in the mentions and talk to fight pack y'all since 2014 and we was in the same promotional company and they couldn't make it happen. So you think it's because he's not interested in that? I don't think he was interested in it because his coach mentioned numerous times. He didn't want him to fight me. He wanted him to stay away from me. So I don't think they was interested. Yeah. Well, I could see that

Speaker 3:          01:01:57       this stage of his career. But you know Keith Thurman is a fucking murderer puncher. Right. Which what was one of the reasons why it's more impressive that he beat him. And so who are they talking about? Patio matching up with next. He chasing the Mayweather. So why not right. Come on. I know you love money. He was saying that he thinks Floyd's out of money already cause he says Floyd spend so much money. He's probably already out of it. Well he spammed money too. I think pet cows spam where money named Floyd and when everybody else Oh that's right cause he's got like 50 people that he just has supported. Yeah. I mean he's a, he's an interesting guy man cause he's so friendly. Right. You know like Pat even like when people are trash talking, he was like smiling and then he gets in that rang kick your ass later.

Speaker 3:          01:02:38       Different. Fuck you do. What's the gypsy that Rose like this is a whole different set of rules he's flying with like Keith Thurman talking about he going to crucify him and stuff like that. And he just like don't say that. Yeah, it got crucified. Yeah. He's the best to [inaudible] lucky enough. I like he's a killer pool players. There's no that about pack yo know like world class. Like he could play pool professionally. Me tune. Really? Yeah. You could play. Oh we got play in that. I heard you. You got got some little personal stents. Pretty good. You're good? Yeah. Okay. Well what do you play? Whatever you want to play. You play like nine ball, 10 ball, whatever. Okay, we'll play it. Cool. So if I leave five balls on the table, you owe me. If farmer your balls on five balls on the tee, my boy playing eight ball, you can't Bay.

Speaker 3:          01:03:29       That's nonsense. It's a nonsense game. Hey, belts a silly game. You're trying to get me leave my balls on the table. No, I'm saying if you take your balls, if I win. Okay. And you still got five balls on your table. Five. Five are your balls. If you, you got seven balls if you can't a ball. So the only way that I went, explain what you're saying. Okay. So you guys seven balls. So start if I beat you and you still got five of your balls on the table. Okay, then you, Oh, Oh what? What? So if you mean if you break and run out and I don't get a shot. No, that's seven ball. Then you get all the balls. Yeah, that's seven ball. If I have five balls left and you went, yeah, what does that, what kind of weird gaze? You ain't get it.

Speaker 3:          01:04:17       I'm not getting it. So if I win and you still got five balls on the table. Okay, then what happens? You owe. I owe what but see if we play time ball or 10 ball, you can't win if there's five balls, nine ball and Tim ball, that's different. But that's what we were saying. Yeah. Yeah. So you were saying like fly eight ball, but I don't like playing that cause that's tricky. Yeah, it's tricky. You play as a strategy. Yeah. You got to learn how to get out. Yeah, I'll hit all of them and missed the last one. Play ball though. That's a cool like ball. It's okay. But it's a simpler game. And you popped me for the last, yeah, I leave you hanging if fuck up. Leave that 10 ball wobbling in the hole. Like he didn't did all this for nothing. I've done that before.

Speaker 3:          01:04:57       It's very heartbreaking. Very heartbreaking. That's the worst way. Using games where it's like all that for nothing and the, and the guys. Thank you for cleaning up. That's a game that no one wants to lose to a girl. It gets hilarious watching dudes play pool against women. When women are good, they panic. They start getting nervous. Like there's something about losing to a girl. It's almost like getting your ass kicked by a girl. Some of them call honest. Seeing some girls at the pool hall. Oh yes. Taken a lot of money. Oh for sure. Yeah, there's, there's like elite women players. You know what I do to the eliminate that. What I just be like, nah, I'm only childlike. Especially where you watching them and then they try to, Hey, I got an, I'd be like, yeah y'all, y'all can play. Cause it ain't, it ain't for me to be getting washed up by no female.

Speaker 3:          01:05:46       Well and any professional. I've played a lot of professionals like cause it's one of the weird sports that you can enter into a tournament and you, you could be a guy who you know as a full time job and you might wind up matching up with like effort. Rayez I was like the greatest player of all time. You might meet him in the first round of a tournament. You both, all you have to do is pay your fee and then you pay your entry fee. You join in just like everybody else and you're playing like a world champ. Like the Terrance Crawford a pool. I'm like Whoa. And you could just be some regular dude playing Efron Rez, but it's cool. You can be like, man, I lost it. We had the greatest lost one of the greatest of all time. Yeah. I've played a bunch of like great play. I played Mike Siegel before I got to play a bunch of great players. Get my ass kicked by him. You will professional pool player. No, no. I'm quite a bit like below. Like if you had like a Manny Pacquiao, he could play professional. He would beat me. I'm like one notch below them. Probably like a notch below that, two notch below them. But man, he like plays in tournaments. He gambles. They call them. Unfortunately they call them the cow cause they're always milking them. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:06:48       cause he's real high level pool players, man. I mean he's good man. He's too busy with running the country. It means a fucking Senator. On top of that, he's one of the best boxers in the world and on top of that, he's got a family. He doesn't have time to be at the pool hall 10 hours a day. All those psychopaths that are like world champions, they play pool eight, 10 hours a day. They play all day long, all day long. You go there, you'll find them. That's where they're at. You say you go there, you're fine. They're there every fucking day. Everybody that I know that's like an elite world class pool player like Mika Immonen and you know these kind of guys, you go there, they're there at the goddamn pool every day. No money in that shit though. You think there's no money in UFC, there's no money in that shit.

Speaker 3:          01:07:26       There's a lot of money on poker. There is how to play. I know, right? [inaudible] poker, it seemed like, uh, my friend Anthony G or Donald, he a directs those. I used to direct those poker shows. He said what changed it is when you had the TV shows where you could see the person's hand. So like we were all playing the folks at home could see what I have and they can see what you have, but we didn't know what we have. So they're all in on it. So the fuck, how's he gonna play that? How's it going to play this? So it made it way more interesting than just watching. Because if you were watching three guys play poker, you would have no idea whose hands or what. But when you're at home and you watch on TV, you get to see the hand. And I still don't know how to play. Yeah, I don't know how to play either, but I just be seeing people with a poker face all in, don't have nothing, and then this dude with a good Hage just put like, Oh, his hands

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       look. Just be like, okay, take that risk.

Speaker 3:          01:08:21       Oh man. Something cool about that. Right? Like a bullshitty. It's bullshitting. You know? There's something about that, like the hustle. There's the thing about poker that doesn't exist in anything else. The psychological hustle, that's why they call it the poker face. Yep. That's a lady Gaga song, bro. Pop, pop, pop or somebody looking all like looking all sad like, yeah, you got a bad hand knowing you got a good here. Yup. It's tricky. Then they, Hey you

Speaker 4:          01:08:48       all in. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:08:51       Plus I found gamblers when they're around each other all the time and then just fucking, that's all they do is gamble and read signs and check each other out. They'd probably have a like a highly tuned sense of someone bullshitting. Right. Highly tuned. Oh, there's something going on behind his eyes, but that's why they wear them glasses. Yeah. You know what? I've always like love watching.

Speaker 4:          01:09:13       Scary to get good at his chest. Just seems like it would eat your fucking time. CTS. Do you play high? Yeah, I taught him I replay. He taught me to not beat him. Beat him the same at the same day he taught you? He just taught me how to move the pieces and I'll be like, huh? Jesus. Yeah. Wow. That's interesting. So women are national rights, so I'm one Monica fifth right now. Do this age nationally ranked? No, I'm saying we on the international show. Right? The whole world is watching. I'll let these do beat you. Let him beat you. Watch this up, get his confidence. Hey, but this is how I do do it. There's some fights. Well, I want him to play test so I can so he can use his mind. Right. [inaudible] that's okay. All right. All right. The whole camp he used in his mind, you use this miles.

Speaker 4:          01:10:08       I'm like, okay. All right. So he'd come out there and he had great performance. So I'm like, okay. All right. That's another strategy to try to get him to do better. Right. But there are some mornings, I'm tell you about this, last morning we had, you know, let me beat him. I just beat him anytime. I really want to win, I win. [inaudible] come downstairs, right? So he comes downstairs and in his boxers and shit, this old terrace Crawford, look, look in here violent. Hey, good morning or morning, let's play. All right. I'm kicking his ass. Right. It meant he'd get mad. You could see, you could see it in his face. Right? So he started making these different, but now man, you can't do that. No man, yes I kiss a kid. No, you can't do that. But you know, you can't do that after a while. You just gotta kind of fear for your life a little bit. Cause no. Yeah. I like Ali big fit in with this duty chest man. It's funny. It's funny when he's

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       losing, they beat me. He beat me that day. I didn't want to play me again. I was on, I see it in your face right now. Oh yeah. You can see reliving it because he just caught me off guard. It's just like, you know what? I mean like I come downstairs and eat some breakfast and he's talking about that's plate. He got it ready and everything. Oh, I'm making stupid. I'm like, damn man, I ain't see that. Like fuck. So he, when he won't play me, but the next time he played me, I watched them killed them so, so bad to where he, he don't even want to play me no more. It's funny is that's one thing that champions have all champions. They hate losing any game or any like Jordan, they said if you beat him playing pool, who fucking hate you didn't want to talk to you.

Speaker 3:          01:12:03       Didn't want to until he could beat you again until he got you again. See, my thing is we have a lot of people that want to play the game, right? So I'm, I don't play the game like I used to. I used to play in, I used to beat them all, but once my nephew got good, I stopped playing. I'm like, man, your game here, I ain't got time the best just sitting on game. And you know, like video games like Xbox two K and you can't fucking those kids, those kids that don't have their responsibilities, they don't have children. They don't, they don't have, they have nothing but time. They get too good at those goddamn thing. Good. So was lose your life trying to chase him. So now, so now it gets to the point where I just watched him play. So, so we had this dude named chairs at that.

Speaker 3:          01:12:47       Oh man. So, so chance we got shit core and we got Chucky, they all like to play and we got Kenny. So Kenny was playing Chucky choke you and chance was always going at it. We each other and uh, Kenny was beating Chuckie and he was just rubbing in his face and it was just like, you can see how mad he was. Like, and this dude Chuggy, he's the one that always be like joking around and stuff. It's all fun and games and you like, you could just see, he was like, why is you even talking if you not playing like, Hey, it gets so bad in the house man too. You have to put the game up. You guys have like moments where you don't want them to play games and things like that. Like during camp, like you just want to just arrest.

Speaker 3:          01:13:38       No, no. That's relaxation. Relaxing. Yeah, but video games are a little, they get your tense. That's why he took the gay gay. He did so it get so tense. People were to fight each other. People get in arguments. One want to do to get mad at other dude like ah, you mad like man, shut up man. That's why we sparring when we get to the gym. Huh? How about that Tiberius? Be funny as shit, man. It can, it can cause problems too. Oh sure. Well a bunch of competitive dudes all training together and then you play

Speaker 1:          01:14:11       something competitive that makes you angry if you lose. Yeah. Yeah. Recipe for disaster. Right. And they don't care. They don't care. They don't care an hour and they just like whatever. I still want to play. It's like a big daycare.

Speaker 4:          01:14:25       That's basically what it is. Big D me, I'm the oldest guy to start cussing at home.

Speaker 1:          01:14:32       You can't eat,

Speaker 4:          01:14:34       don't you? Come out your room, get up for your duties, dishes. Oh bad. It seems like you guys are having a good time. Amaz

Speaker 2:          01:14:44       it's, it's fun. Campus campus is fine. It's hard work and it's hard. But at the same time, you know, we work as work and then we try to come home and you know, clear our head and not just be so mentally drained over, over thinking about the fight. Right. So we want it to be fun at the end of the day.

Speaker 1:          01:15:05       Do you have like a, a mental coach or is there anybody you've ever worked with that's like, uh, like where you've tried to do visualization work or formulate a game plan or is it just,

Speaker 2:          01:15:16       just go out there and get it done? Just get it done. No need, no need. Like my mental is so strong. Like from what I have overcome and been through in my heart entire lives, it's like nothing's going to break me. That's my mental, like if that couldn't break me, you not going to break me. I mean in terms of the way your childhood growing up. Yeah. Like everything that I went through. Irreplaceable. Right. People that have gone through

Speaker 1:          01:15:47       Mike, Mike Tyson, like many great fighters have gone through hardship when they're younger. That, Whoa, that, that ability to endure.

Speaker 2:          01:15:55       It's not, I wouldn't say when I was younger and it's still going through, still going through. I still go through a lot. A lot. How so? Like it seemed like before all my big fights, somebody die or my family, you know, like my grandpa just died the day before yesterday. Sorry to hear them. Yeah. But I'm here, you know what I mean? Yeah. I'm about to going training camp and prepare for my next fight, you know? So it was just like things always happening. Right. But at the same time I got a job to do and I'm going to still be focused and nothing's going to distract me. Now

Speaker 1:          01:16:33       will you go on a training camp with a date in mind or would you just, but do they, but you haven't, nothing's been signed yet, right? Nothing has been signed yet. So do you just sort of go in and get the wheels move in and then just get ready to ramp up? Like how do you determine when you ramp up your training camp? If you're like, say if you're getting back into training camp now, but you don't know when the fight is going to be scheduled. So how do you, how do you approach it in the beginning?

Speaker 2:          01:16:58       No, I don't, I don't, I wouldn't necessarily necessarily say I'm getting in training camp right now because I'm not like, my training camp is six to seven weeks.

Speaker 1:          01:17:07       So you get forward ready to get into training

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       camp? No, I wouldn't even say that. I'm just saying in general, okay. You know, you're not getting ready. Right. State work now I stay working. Of course, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:17:18       now when you're not, when you're not in the gent, well, when you were in the gym, but you're not training for a fight, are you still doing all the strength conditioning stuff?

Speaker 2:          01:17:25       Yeah. Here and there. Yeah. And not to the same intensity, but just to keep moving.

Speaker 1:          01:17:33       Right. And so you do that just to make sure that you preserve your body and don't get injured and things along those lines. So when you think of it in terms of camp like that as the roughest experience you're going through it, right? You're going through how many nine weeks that would you say you prefer? Seven, seven weeks, seven weeks. So that those seven weeks there is when you are pushing it to the limit and then everything else is more like a maintaining thing.

Speaker 2:          01:17:54       We like stair steppers, we've got a precap and then once we're in camp it's like this don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. And you know what those steps are, right? So when we get to the, to the end of camp, we already at the highest, highest step. So that way when we go to, to the fight, we already at the end.

Speaker 1:          01:18:12       And so this is planned out in the amount of rounds you do. The amount of running every week, every week is something added on every week. If it's for around six round, eight rounds, 10 12, two minutes, we do minutes. You know, what's amazing about this conversation is if you are a young up and coming boxer in, you know, 1982 or something like that and you want to know how Marvin Hagler did it. There was no podcast, right? There was no like Marvin Hagler breaking down how he does his training camp and talking all about it. But today kids can watch you and they can see what you're doing. And I guarantee just listening to you talk about realizing how hard Floyd worked and you work it out, you wanted to work out even harder and all the crazy shit you're doing. Like people right now lacing up the shoes right now and fire it up, running out the door thinking I gotta work like Terrance. I have to, you know that is one of the coolest things has to be about being a world champion is that you are the guy now, you know when you were a kid, I'm sure you had like those ring magazine posters and shit. Like you're that guy now, right? That's gotta be crazy. Some kid right now who's like six years old. I was just getting the golden gloves and he's looking up at his bedroom wall. Silver gloves, golden gloves,

Speaker 2:          01:19:21       the golden gloves. 18 yeah, we use yours, several gloves. And when your jewelry, silver gloves,

Speaker 1:          01:19:26       it doesn't sound as good. Yeah. Boxing, amateur boxing, kids getting an amateur boxing. Definitely heroes. You're one of them, man. I mean that's gotta be, you gotta be a cool feeling.

Speaker 2:          01:19:34       Oh yeah man. I love it. I love it. And when I go, when I go to them little little smokers or I'm little national tournaments and see all the little kids run up to me [inaudible] and I'd be like, what up? I go grab it all. That's awesome grandpa. They head mess around with him. And if you're out there, a wrestling tournament, pupil like, yo your terrorist car. I'd be like, yeah, what's up? What's your name? And they'd be like, dude, like man, you, you real cool. Like I'd be like, man, yeah man. What's up? That's amazing. So they all gravitate to me. Was there someone that you met when you first met them when you're

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       like, I can't even believe that I'm sitting there with Evander Holyfield or someone like that. Someone real famous where you couldn't believe you were actually being around them.

Speaker 2:          01:20:16       Do you want to have to say Roy Jones Jones? Because I never was like a big fan boy. I'll always be like, Aw man, they just humans like me. But when I seen Roy for the first time I was like Paul, that's Roy Jones jr like I met Floyd Mayweather but this Roy Jones jr like yeah it was just crazy. He was real cool and you know I was just like damn, I didn't want to be like all like shines to out like damn. Like I met sugar Ray linner when I was at amateur and it didn't feel the same.

Speaker 1:          01:20:53       It was just like man, that sugar. Right. Cause it's a different era cause it was, you didn't watch them fight watching Roy Jones, man when I was a kid, when he was in his prime, he would lead with a left hook and he's like more than a jab. He was just whip that left hook at dudes and they didn't know what the fuck to do with that. That speed was preposterous. So fast. Woo. Roy was doing stuff to people that made you just go, wow. Like he's not even doing the same thing they're doing right. He's like, he's on another dimension is a different record. Speed. You know, he was so fast, like max Kellerman had this incredible ramp once about just realizing how good Roy Jones was in his prime is, it wasn't like he wasn't around great fighters, but they couldn't do shit to him.

Speaker 1:          01:21:35       Nah, he was around world champions, but he was lighting them on fire. Right. It was crazy. And you know, all good things come to an end. It only lasted for, you know, X amount of years. I mean, what was the best years of his championship reign? But he was untouchable, untouchable, untouchable. When knocked out Virgil Hill with that body shot. Why? You know, he's like God to him. One punch. And when he, when he put his hands behind his back and still knocked down Jamestown, I mean he, when he dropped his hands like this and James Tony does it too and he leaps in and drops him at one duty. Knocked out what? His hands behind his back. Who was that dude? I forgot what it was on the ropes. Yeah, put his hands behind his back. The dude moves forward and drops him and knocks him out. It's like this is a movie scene, right? This is a real life. No one does that in real life. Roy Jones was having fun with people. Yeah. He was having fun with his entertainment. He was incredible how fast he was.

Speaker 2:          01:22:28       But like I got him, man, I didn't met people like Roy. He's a fan of me. It's amazing. And it's like, dude, like I'll be like so starstruck. It's like, man, I'm a fan of you and he's a fan of you. You're a fan of me. Wow. Like today, today, so happy. I was on Instagram and I was like, um, I wouldn't pass LL cool J cause we was listened to some old school music and I I like dang LOL. Got an Instagram. So I clicked on him and he's following me. I sell Bo look, LL coolJ following me on Instagram.

Speaker 2:          01:23:13       It's just crazy just to think of all the people that you like grew up admiring and like you a fan of and for you to see them fan of you. It's like damn like Iverson. Iverson. Wow. And he came up to me and he was more happy to see me then I wasn't him. I tear his car for it. Oh man. You know mom. Wow. And I was like, I was just sitting there looking at him like this, our IRA's [inaudible] like so it's crazy like seeing all those, you know, celebrities and all time greats, that's big fans of mine and it's like fuck, does it wear off or do you still freak out? I still freak out some times I still freak out sometimes. Like it just depends on the person. Like, fuck, like damn right, like Snoop or something like that. Like Snoop too. I know I met Snoop, I'll be like, damn, like fuck. Like that's when you know that you made it to a certain level and yo yo uh, professional sports that everybody watching you. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:24:18       Well you know, and that's one more thing that's beautiful about you meeting those little kids is that they can realize like, Oh, Terrence Crawford's a man, right? He's a man, man. He's a superstar and he's a champion and I see him on TV, but he's a man. He's right here. He kept me in the headlock. Right? Oh shit. We're playing together. He's a nice guy. Oh, he's a person because you see someone that's achieved a certain level of status and championship reign and you see him on TV knocking people out. That doesn't even seem like a real person when you're a kid. I that can't be a real person. Right. And then you're there and then he's shaking his head. He's like, what the fuck? This is crazy. So you changed that kid's world like his idea of what the future is. Idea what a person is. A person is Terrence Crawford as a person. I'm a person too. I got just got to work hard

Speaker 2:          01:25:04       and it's crazy because like a lot of a lot of people, they would see me and they'd be like, we are your body and we entourage like they be. They be having questions that, yeah. And I'd just be like, nah man, I'm a regular person. They'd be like, man, why you ain't gonna be on TV? Like Floyd Mayweather? Black man ain't for me, man. I'm, I'm chill. They'd be like, Oh well where are your cars? Like they'd be just acting all kinds of crazy stuff and I just be like, nah, man, you live where you grew up. Right. Wow. That's crazy. And everybody's cool. Everybody. Nobody gets jealous. The fact that your [inaudible], you always gonna have that no matter where you go, you always gonna have the jealousy and the people that NVU people want loans. Right. You just gotta you just got to move different. Yeah. You just got to move differently. Do you need, do you, what kind of cars you Rob? I drive old schools. Old schools. Like what kind of, I got some Monte Carlo.

Speaker 1:          01:25:59       Oh, Oh, that's right. I saw you and looked like a grand national, but of a grand

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       national. I said Monte Carlo. That's a Monte Carlo. Oh, is this a souped up Monte Carlo? Nice. This is all original. I just put the ramps on it. Oh, the soup. That one is the silver one. The 87. Oh, what is that? Another Monte-Carlo. Oh, you're a Monte Carlo guy. Yeah. I love Monte Carlo's back in the day. Like the 70s like 70 Monte Carlo's. Ooh, those are so pretty. Ain't nothing like the 80 [inaudible] 87 that's probably because you're younger than me. Super sport. Me, I'm, I'm like, I get from muscle cars. I get as high as 71 with a Barracuda and then I drop off. Yeah. Everything else. Like I need 65 to 70 71 that's only, only Barracuda and challenger. That's it. Everything else fell apart by 71. What about the, uh, the, a Oldsmobile? They made some cool shit. They made some cool shit, but it's just not as good as like the sixties sixties and the 1970 cars like 70 Chevelle Chevelle come on, seven job top.

Speaker 3:          01:27:02       The drop. The problem with drop top is the O, the weekly or you know the like there's a lot of body flicks to it, whether you don't get the rigidity that you feel and like the solid hard top muscle car. Right. You know what? I'd love those old cars, man. They have something to them, right? Nay costs a shit ton of money if you get, if you get one as all the original, Oh yeah. Everything. The paint still like, man, you bought this car to put it in the garage for 30 years. Dude, I saw Sarah kudo that was for sale for over a million dollars. $1 million for a car that was like $30 30,000 not even right. Didn't we talk about this does in like five grand when his brand new, something crazy like that. Now it's $1 million. I got a J Lindell, I don't know one of those knuckleheads that likes everything perfect and original.

Speaker 3:          01:27:52       There's certain dudes like with the original numbers matching, look with a V I N number matches the tires. These are the original tires from 1960 [inaudible] paperwork. You better go slow around the corner with those shitty tires. Everything original means everything's shitty. No shitty drum brakes and shitty suspension. And I like the size. I used to eyes, uh, get up and watch them car auctions. Oh yeah, the Meacham. Yeah. That kind of shape. Just loved those. Just to look at the cars. God, if you have a ton of money and you're there, that shit could be real bad. Yeah. Like if you're one of those dudes, it's like a collector and you see all those cars moving by. Like I want that one to 55 off. 55 Chevy, right. Oh my goodness. Yeah. This, there's some, I mean, I'm just a big fan of those shapes.

Speaker 3:          01:28:37       Those shapes are the 1960 shapes because there's something about the car, they just nailed it. They just knew how to make a car look beautiful back then. And it was enabled to build sturdy. Like nowadays, you bump a car, your big old tent pumper falling off. Back then you could run a car over and he'll still steal a little bitty dent and go on about your way. Yeah. It's a different also the now car cars handled good. They have airbags. Yeah. There's some good, some good shit about today's cars too, right? Yeah. Try self. Yeah. Yeah. Do you ever do one though? You had been in a Tesla. We just talk about time on a wheel there. Freakouts man, it'll freak you out like you driving that thing. Oh my God. They fast this shit. It's ridiculous. Right? Did you ever drive one? Yeah, dude. The crazy thing about the Teslas is it's like a race car. It's like, and you'd be waiting for it to be like [inaudible] like, but it don't never changed gears. It's just straight.

Speaker 3:          01:29:40       You can all of a sudden it's 150 miles an hour like that. It's so fast. Disney make sense? It's like a race car. It's like a time machine. It's like a compressed time, like there's a certain amount of time in a normal car. You feel like you have to go? There's a certain amount of time that has to take place before I can get in front of that guy and then get over here and then get to the on ramp with a Tesla. You just go shoot, you're there. It's like time like press zero to 60 in 2.4 seconds. You never even felt anything like it. It so God damn roller coaster ride. It's like you're pinned to your seat. It's just going like fuck. And they're making a faster one to go. One's going to be 1.9 the Roadster. That really slick looking little tiny one.

Speaker 3:          01:30:17       They're ridiculous. That's the future. Yeah, I got it. Demon. Oh, Dodge demon. Oh those are nice. It's fun. That's a fun fucking, who is that? Like 800 horsepower. Think 909 800 something crazy. It's crazy. After anything over seven signed my rights away. Really? You guys signed all these papers talking about if you die or get seriously injured and K nobody else come back and Sue them. All kinds of crazy shit. Wow. The car so fast. They letting you know, like, you know, you can get real life fucked up. And does they make those in a stick shift or is it just an automatic Oh, I don't know. I got on. I man, it's a crazy amount of power, but I think, I think nowadays you got the passengers. Yeah. Paddle shifters. That's cute. Where you could put manual shifting with your left foot in a clutch and shifting gears.

Speaker 3:          01:31:05       You're right. That's like part of the whole muscle car thing, right? Yeah. Part of the old school thing. You don't want to old school automatic. It seems silly. You know, you just think [inaudible] school. Yeah, that's true. It's way faster. Oh, it's way faster. Cars today are way faster period. And they're all gonna be electric than 10 years. They're just so much better. They're so much faster. Right. As long as they can figure out how to make it charge quick. That's the thing. The gas, as you just pull into a gas station, 10 minutes later you got a full tank. Right? So your cart charges up. Yeah. I'm going to take, let's take a good solid six or seven hours. If it's dead, if it's almost dead, it'll take like six or seven hours at a super. I have a supercharger too. Normally it might take 12 like with a regular outlet.

Speaker 3:          01:31:55       Yeah. Fuck it takes a long time. Yeah. Yeah. So if you pull into like one of those supercharges, I think they can get you up to like 80% in like an hour to the first charge. The first 80% quit pretty quick. So you could do that [inaudible] for gas. Yeah. Yeah. You pay for it. Yeah. You use a credit card for it. Yeah, I seen them there. What? The airport's free. You could plug in at the airport and it's free. It's a, it's a weird experience, man, because I love the sound of engines. But uh, that car makes them all look stupid. They all, they all seem dumb. It does, right? Yeah. You don't hear that, but it's on the, yeah, I gotta have that muscle muscle. It's fun. Yeah. I'm wondering, once you get into the, you can't burn out in it. Nah, there's no burning out.

Speaker 3:          01:32:41       It's just Gusto. It makes a noise like this wish, like it doesn't make any noise. It doesn't like [inaudible] there's none of that just takes off. Yeah. It doesn't even seem real. I like them. The inside is crazy with the big screen touch and, yeah, no, they're pretty dope. You just look like you're in a future where state, it feels like you're in the futuristic. What, what do you spend your money on? Do you have a thing that you, uh, you indulge in? Nah, that's, I don't really have no spinning habits. Just, that's the main stuff. Fishing and, yeah, we were talking before the show about bonefish and you're like, bonefish. I love it. I love it. I got took on both fishing one time and I've been hooked. I've been spending money on it. We actually walked in his pond. I bought waiters, I got waiters and everything.

Speaker 3:          01:33:27       So I'm out there in a water in a little mud and stuff, hitting the little guards and, and uh, anything I can find. Do you, uh, do you eat guards? You smoked those, right? You can't eat them? No, no, no. We, we mainly trying to get the grass carp cause they, they're invasive. Right. They tried to kill as many of those as they can. Right. Yeah. So it's crazy though because the Asian carp, we own my boat, we in the river and this was the other night we going through this little spot in the river and they started jumping in the boat. Yeah. That's not weird. Have you ever seen him? Yeah, I've seen all of these TV shows. Fucking crazy. They like this big, no lie. They was like, you say car jumping park, no Asian cart, seven pounds. And they'd fly through the air and hit you in the face different than grass card.

Speaker 3:          01:34:22       We will shoot in grass carpet and uh, and a pine. But in the river, the Asian carp dye was jumping in my boat was every bit of 30 pounds and they're hitting people in the head, hay on them, flat line them. I said, didn't they bring those States, those carbons over to eat up something in a something? Look at these things here. These people fly a boat and got hit in the back of the head. Right? That side ain't joke. Both. What are these guys are trying to shoot them while they're flying? That is so ridiculous. What are the rednecks rednecks court Saturday? What kind of fucking fish just flows itself out of boat? It's so crazy. The sound of the engine that you get them started. Something like that. It's crazy. Like this'll give you a target panic man. You're not going to get good at shooting a bow and arrow and getting hit in the head while you're pulling back your bow.

Speaker 3:          01:35:16       Or these guys are just trying to shoot. No one's even pulling the trigger. Oh man. That's funny. Look at that. Pop. Yeah. Look, these keeps getting hit donk. What a weird dude. I just got clipped laughing going. Gasbag Eddy duck. The second one. I'll get it. Oh. Oh, that guy got nailed. Yeah, I'd have a bat finishing with a base on a B boat. I'm telling you what a samurai sword mugs get big [inaudible] part. What was that in the river river. So they're trying to kill as many of those they can. They're trying to kill as many of those as they can. Those things have overpopulated lakes just taken over. I don't know why they brought him in though originally and more. More so of the lakes is grass cart, not Asian carp and some rivers big red looking ones here. Those get huge like yeah you have [inaudible] it's crazy enough alone in America we think of them as shit.

Speaker 3:          01:36:10       There's like trash fish but in England they're prized. Like in England they have carp fishing contests and they have certain carbs that they catch and they weigh in and then they release them and then they catch them again like a year later. Like they know the carp and like they were in world records like the wholly caught mr fishy again or mr fishy is now, you know, 85 fucking pounds and they keep catching them year after year until these things die and when they die they make like a big deal. We lost his car but they take carp fishing super serious. Which is so strange because over here in America we think of them as trash. They eat everything. Yeah. When, when we see the Asians fishing and whatever they catch they, they keep, yeah, so it's like the Gar, the Asian carp, they eat them up.

Speaker 3:          01:36:59       Apparently Gar taste good if you smoke it. That's what I've heard. I've heard he gets smoked car. Not fucking one that to dinosaur. I feel w it's a weird thing to eat. It's like eating a snag. I shot him. I didn't shop one just to look at the meat and it's all hard hot like autumn pones how are you going clean that day? Yeah, I saw a guy do it on TV. Can I cooked it on TV? I forgot. What was one of those wild game cooking shows? He smoked a Gar. I could see an alligator guard like when you go down like the Texas or so, is that a different kind of guard? Alligator guard and the mugs get pig. Maybe that's what it is, you know, but the guard that we got a little skinny little pencil wool things like, Oh, so they're tiny. Yeah. They like that big eight long. Yeah. Those Texas ones are freakish, man. They don't even look real. But listen, man, I'm not gonna take up any more of your time. I just want to tell you I'm a big fan. It was an honor having you in here. I really appreciate watching you fight. One of my favorite, I think when I, when I talk to people about, about

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       combat sports, one of the things that I always talk about is like the difference between the skill level of an elite boxer. When you see what that's all they do versus like an MMA, you see openings and MMA that you would never see like in boxing. So I'm just, I'm happy you're out there, man. I appreciate it. And I, and let us know when your fight is. We'll let everybody know and, um, just alert the world. I'm excited. Thank you, sir. Thank you, man. Thanks. Bye everybody.

Speaker 5:          01:38:22       I'll make them get a picture. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:38:33       [inaudible].
