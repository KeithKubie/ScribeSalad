00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:00.830
&gt;&gt; You ready for a quiz?

00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:01.550
&gt;&gt; Yes, I am.

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.090
&gt;&gt; Okay. Here's what I'd like you to do. I'd like

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.290
you to use these probabilities that we have written down here,

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.180
that, that constitute the joint distribution of, when you look out

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.310
do you see a storm, do you see lightning? And use these

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.300
numbers to answer some other questions that aren't directly in here

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.650
but you can figure it out. So, the first one is to

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.190
say, what's the probability when you look out the window at

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.088
2 PM in the summer, in Atlanta, that there's no storm, okay?

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:25.080
&gt;&gt; Okay. And, then the question is to say,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.940
what's the probability that if there is

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.360
a storm, there is also lightning, okay? So

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.970
the probability of lightning given that there

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.652
is a storm. And we've done some stuff

00:00:33.652 --> 00:00:35.790
with conditional probability. So these concepts should

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.110
be familiar with you, but you should be

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.030
able to connect it up with, you know, the numbers in the table. You ready?

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.562
&gt;&gt; I am ready.

00:00:40.562 --> 00:00:40.790
&gt;&gt; Go.
