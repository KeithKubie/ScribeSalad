00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.799
We human beings diligently scan the night
sky hoping to find something new, and every

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.180
now and then keeping an open ear pays off.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.510
In 2007 astronomers detected a sudden blast
of radio waves that lasted just a few milliseconds

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.070
and dubbed it a Fast Radio Burst.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.089
Since then they’ve found about two dozen
more, but one in particular has them intrigued.

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:23.710
Speaking of being intrigued though, have you
visited our friend Simon at Today I Found

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.710
Out?

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.390
If you’re watching Seeker you obviously
like learning new things, so definitely check

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.929
out Simon’s channel -- Today I Found Out
-- because that is what it’s all about!

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.890
There’s a link in the description to this
video about the dogs we launched into space,

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:36.890
FOR SCIENCE.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.720
Okay, back to the fast radio bursts.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.120
The source is called FRB 121102, so called
because it was first observed on November

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.390
second, 2012.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.981
The reason FRB 121102 is special is because
sometimes it repeats, the only Fast Radio

00:00:50.981 --> 00:00:52.710
Burst we’ve found that does so.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.360
Knowing that it pipes up from time to time,
astronomers have paid close attention to FRB

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.580
121102’s patch of sky, and sure enough on
August 26, 2017, they detected 15 MORE bursts,

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.850
bringing the total number to over 150.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.110
No one’s sure exactly what causes these
fast radio bursts.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.080
It’s possible they’re generated by a young
and fast spinning neutron star with an intense

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.110
magnetic field.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:27.270
Or maybe, just maybe, it’s aliens and they’re
sending out a hailing frequency and we’re

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.130
gonna be best friends and go on kickass adventures.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.790
*jumping freeze frame* on take 3

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.810
I’m sorry I just get really excited when
something might be aliens.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.450
But in truth it’s a pretty distant possibility.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.940
Like, really distant.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.909
Since FRB 121102 repeats we’ve been able
to figure out where it’s coming from, a

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.500
dwarf galaxy 3 billion light years away.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.310
That means if it IS aliens, they sent the
signal 3 billion years ago, when life on Earth

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.940
was just single celled organisms.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.680
Any reply wouldn’t get back to them for
another 3 billion years.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.140
If these aliens haven’t died out, they’ve
probably forgotten they even called.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.170
I bet they moved on with their lives, got
married, started a family, evolved into completely

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.210
different life forms with 60 tentacles, that
sort of thing.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.920
Fast radio bursts may be more common than
we thought, with some astronomers estimating

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.830
that one goes off somewhere in the universe
every second.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.629
So either they’re just some as-yet-unexplained
and totally mundane phenomenon, or there are

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:22.790
a lot of life forms out there trying to reach
out and touch someone with their 60 gelatinous

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:23.790
arms.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.660
Either way, we’ll keep listening to find
out.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.410
Remember to subscribe to Seeker for more videos
and to check out Simon on Today I Found Out

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.730
to learn why we sent dogs into space!

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.811
It had to be ruff for them.

00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:35.811
You know?

00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:36.980
That was horrible.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.410
With all this talk about aliens we can’t
forget that an asteroid flew through our solar

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.510
system and of course, some people thought
IT was aliens too.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.240
But it wasn’t.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:52.019
This video explains why. Thanks again for watching.
