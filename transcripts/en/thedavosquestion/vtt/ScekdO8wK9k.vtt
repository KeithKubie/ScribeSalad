00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.740
Hello I'm Jane Carter and I'm director of
coaching for hope. I think the possibility

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.089
of FIFA for world cup benefitting Africa is
definitely there. And I think the key really,

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:16.660
my point of view, my pont of view, is to invest
in the people who love football, who follow

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.060
football. Football is such a big force for
changing Africa if it's used positively. So

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.199
I think the key thing is investing in the
coaching infrastructure. Giving people a chance

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.419
to get out there and play. And focus on the
people rather than the buildings. Then the

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.330
whole continent hopefully can really get something
out of this fantastic event.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.630
[pause]

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.160
Will that do?

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.160
[laughter]

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.161
Ok.
