00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 . 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
 In this presentation, I want to solve some examples 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.800
 Deals with contracts 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.570
 Comparisons are what some students find 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.230
 Difficult, but I think if I understand what I'm talking about 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.070
 For him, you'll see that 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.240
 The idea is straightforward 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.710
 Sometimes you will wonder, why all 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.880
 This? 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.720
 The pairing is a 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.830
 A relationship between two variables 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.540
 If we assume that y = coupling x, all this 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.260
 I mean, you gave me x 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.660
 You can imagine this pairing as consumption for x 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.190
 You insert x in this association 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.480
 This pairing is a set of rules 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.150
 You will say, oh, this x 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.230
 I will link them with a value for y 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.945
 You can imagine the process as a box 

00:00:42.945 --> 00:00:45.900
 You can imagine the process as a box 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.990
 This is a coupling 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.830
 When I give it a value for x, it will give me 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.990
 The other number is y 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.160
 This may seem brief 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.360
 What are the values ​​of y and x? 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.830
 Maybe I have an association - let me write it like this 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.190
 Suppose I have a coupling definition 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.720
 It seems so 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.770
 For any value x you give, the output for it will be 1 if x 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.440
 = - I do not know - 0 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.730
 The output will be 2 if x = 1 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.320
 Otherwise output will be 3 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.790
 . 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.720
 So now we have defined what is going on inside the fund 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.630
 So let me draw the box around it 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.650
 This is the fund 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.940
 This is an arbitrary definition of conjugation, however 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.760
 I hope it will help you to understand what 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.070
 Being in pairing 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:47.500
 If now if x is equal - if you choose x = 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.480
 7, now how much will equal (f (x? 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.400
 How much is f (7? 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.020
 If we take 7 into the box 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.700
 You can count it as a computer 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.770
 The computer looks at x and then looks at its rules 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.060
 Say, well, x = 7 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.270
 Well x is not equal to 0. and x is not equal to 1 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.229
 And go to the other case 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.100
 So you enter the 3 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.040
 If f (7) = 3 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.320
 If as I wrote f (7) = 3 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.760
 Where f indicates the name of the pairing, this base system, or 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.310
 This relationship, this representation, ie 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.190
 Of these names you can use them 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.350
 When you give it 7, the output will be 3 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.460
 When you give this 7, the output will be 3 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.240
 How much product (f (2? 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.690
 Well, this means that instead of x = 7, you'll 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.420
 Give x = 2 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.550
 Then the microcomputer within the pairing will 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.550
 Say, well, let's see, when x = 2 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.410
 No, I'm still in the other case 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.910
 x is not equal to 0 or 1 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.800
 If again f (x) = 3 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.470
 Now, what happens if 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.970
 So, this f (2 also equals 3 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.200
 Now what happens if x = 1? 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.100
 Well in this case will turn to this 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.990
 If 1 (1) 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.080
 Will go to its bases here 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.620
 Oh see, x = 1 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.350
 I use the rule here 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.520
 If when x = 1, I will get 2 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.750
 If (f) 1 equals 2 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.290
 The output of f (1, 2) is extracted 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.420
 This is a pairing 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.120
 Now, since we have all this, let's solve some of these examples 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.620
 They told us about all this 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.010
 We evaluate these different associations 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.570
 Different boxes have been created - on this 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.070
 Different points 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.800
 Let's solve one part first. They have defined the fund 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.880
 f (x) = -2x + 3 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.790
 They want to know what happens when f = -3 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.300
 Well f = -3, this tells me what to do 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.430
 Do x? 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.110
 How much will the product? 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.060
 When I see x, I replace it with 3 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.060
 If equals -2 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.780
 Let me do it that way, you see what I'm doing exactly 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.520
 3, I will write it in bold 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:13.130
 2 x 3 + 3 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.149
 Notice that whenever you see x, put its place-3 

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:19.250
 If I know what the output will give him the black box 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.600
 This equals -2 × 3 = 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.640
 6, + 3 = 9 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.470
 If f (-3) = 9 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.130
 What about f (7? 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.340
 I will do the same again, f - I will type 7 in color 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:43.120
 Yellow - f (7) = -2 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.650
 X 7 + 3 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.480
 + 3 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.140
 If this equals 14 + 3, that is equal 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.260
 11 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:03.940
 Put - let me make it clear - put 7 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:11.060
 In pairing here f and be output -11 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.310
 That's what he explains to us 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.760
 This is the rule 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.470
 It's similar to what I did above here 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.980
 This is the base pairing that we have 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.430
 Let us solve the following example 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.200
 I do not want to solve part b 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.330
 You can do it in order to enjoy 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.650
 I will then solve part c, for the time 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.540
 Now we have reached f (0 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.810
 I will use one here 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.300
 I think you understand the idea. (f (0 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.500
 Wherever you see x, you will set 0 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.005
 If -2 × 0 + 3 

00:05:40.005 --> 00:05:43.100
 -2 × 0 + 3 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.345
 Well, the output is 0 

00:05:44.345 --> 00:05:47.300
 If f (0) = 3 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.000
 Then the last one. (f (z 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.720
 They want it to remain brief 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.780
 I will color it 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.800
 (f (z 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.150
 Let me type the z in a different color 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.900
 (f (z 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.210
 Anywhere I see x, I will 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.750
 Replacing it with z 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.240
 2 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.040
 Instead of x, we will put z 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.860
 We will put z orange here 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:19.760
 -2 × (z + 3) 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.330
 This is the answer. f (z) = -2z + 3 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.110
 If you imagine the box, the coupling f 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:38.130
 Put z, you get -2 x 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:43.480
 z + 3 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.520
 That's all 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.830
 It's a bit brief, but it follows the same idea 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.030
 Now let's solve part c here 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.330
 Let me explain it 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.820
 I walk quickly 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.102
 Let me clarify all this 

00:06:59.102 --> 00:07:02.910
 Let me clarify all this 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:03.810
 I can solve part c 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.370
 I will skip part b 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.710
 You can solve that part 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.830
 Part b 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.430
 They tell us - this is the definition of pairing 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.680
 Sorry, I said that I will solve part c 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.610
 This is the definition of pairing that we have 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:26.300
 f (x) = 5 (2 - x) / 11 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.440
 So let's apply these different values ​​to x, these 

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.620
 Various inputs in pairing 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:39.900
 If - f (-3) = 5 (-2) 

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.250
 We saw x, we replace it with 3 

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.620
 (II-III) / 11 

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.700
 This equals 2 + 3 

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.870
 Which equals 5 

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.260
 If we get 5 x 5/11 

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.120
 This is equal to 25/11 

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.850
 Let's solve this 

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.990
 (f (7 

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:06.680
 For the second coupling here, f (7) = 5 

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.160
 × (2 - - Now the value of x is 7 

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.360
 (2 - 7) / 11 

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.540
 So how much is this? 

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.250
 2 - 7 = -5 

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:23.780
 5 x -5 = -25/11 

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.410
 Finally, we have two left. (f (0 

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:35.000
 This equals 5 (2 - 0) and this is equal to 2 

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.130
 5 × 2 = 10 

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.850
 If it equals 10/11 

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:39.840
 another one 

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.059
 (f (z 

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:43.299
 When we see any x, we'll 

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:44.490
 Replacing it with z 

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:49.960
 This equals 5 (2 - z) divided by 11 

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:50.630
 This is the answer 

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.910
 We can distribute the 5 

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:57.210
 You can say that this is equivalent to (10 - 5z) divided by 11 

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.260
 We can also write it at the intersection of the inclination 

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:06.000
 This is equivalent to 5 / 11z + 10/11 

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.990
 All are equal 

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.430
 But this is the output of f (z 

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:11.590
 right Now 

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:15.510
 Pairing, as I said, is that if you give me any value for X, you will 

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.470
 I give you a product 

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.120
 I will give you (f (x 

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.040
 If this is the pairing given to us, give me x, and be 

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.550
 Output (f (x 

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.680
 Only one f (x) can be produced for any x 

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.840
 Our coupling can not be produced 

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.700
 Two possible values ​​for x 

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.540
 If there is no coupling - it will be 

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:42.790
 The definition of this association is illogical - f (x) = 3 if 

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.230
 Was x = 0 

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:49.240
 Or it can equal 4 if x = 0 

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:53.170
 Because in this case, we do not know what the result of f (0 

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:54.090
 how much? 

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.330
 If x = 0, it should be 3 or can be - 

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:57.310
 we do not know 

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:57.830
 we do not know 

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:58.190
 no Yes 

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:01.550
 This is not even coupling though 

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:02.800
 It seems so 

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.700
 Not a conjunction 

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:12.250
 If we can not have two values ​​for (f) x for one value for x 

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:16.020
 So let's see which of these graphics represent associations 

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.390
 To find its value, you can say, see any value for x 

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:21.850
 Here - select any value for x - I have one value for f (x) 

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:25.090
 This is y = f (x 

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.950
 I have only one - at this x, this 

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:30.550
 The value of y that I have 

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.970
 You can have a vertical test line, which shows it on any 

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:35.720
 Point If you draw a vertical line - note that the vertical line 

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.570
 For a specified x value 

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:41.920
 Explains that I have only one value for y on this point 

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.630
 If this pairing is true 

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:46.240
 At any time you draw a vertical line, intersect 

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.610
 With representation only once 

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.410
 If this pairing is true 

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.220
 Now what about this? 

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.960
 I can draw a vertical line, let's say, on 

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.230
 this point 

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:58.650
 For x those, it seems that this relationship has 

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.860
 Two possibilities for f (x 

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.550
 (f) x This value can be either f (x) or that value 

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:05.270
 Right? 

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:07.520
 We have split twice with acting 

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.840
 If this is not coupling 

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.150
 We have done exactly what I have described here 

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:15.090
 For a given value of x, we describe two possibilities for y 

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:16.800
 They can equal (f (x 

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.220
 If this is not coupling 

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.830
 Same thing here 

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.310
 I drew a vertical line here 

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.540
 I split twice with acting 

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.000
 This is not an association 

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.590
 You define two values ​​for y for one value for x 

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:31.490
 Let us move on to this pairing 

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.160
 It seems a strange conjunction 

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.750
 It looks like a true mirror 

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.020
 But at any time you draw a vertical line, you will 

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.720
 Only one time 

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.420
 If this pairing is true 

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.470
 For each x, we have only one y 

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:46.450
 Or (f) x one common with it 

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.960
 Anyway I hope you have found this useful
