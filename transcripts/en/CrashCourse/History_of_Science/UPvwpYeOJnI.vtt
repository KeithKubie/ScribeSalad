00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.200
Historians looked at a bunch of changes in
technical systems and called it the Industrial

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.200
Revolution…

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.340
But historians love to debate each other.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.500
So some of them pointed out that the first
half of this revolution looks a lot different

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.619
from the second.

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.820
Basically, the First Industrial Revolution
ramped up around 1800.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.070
It started in Britain, ran on steam, trains,
and factories, and led to lots of scientific

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.329
discoveries by individual researchers such
as Volta, Faraday, and Maxwell.

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.530
The Second Industrial Revolution resulted
from the industrialization of electricity

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.380
and mass manufacturing.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:45.340
It happened around 1900, started in the United
States and ran on electricity, cars, and communication

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.340
technologies.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.490
And it led to technological inventions owned
by corporations such as the various Edison

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.500
companies and everyone’s favorite Orwellian
corporate work camp, Ford Motor.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:05.060
[Intro Music Plays]

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.009
Whatever terms you use, the world at the end
of the nineteenth century looked very differently

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:10.590
than it did at the beginning.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.509
For one, lots of people could now see at night
because of electricity.

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.390
For two, the scale of industry—and even
what the word even meant—had changed.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.229
For example, German-American engineer John
Augustus Roebling lobbied for

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.299
the 486-meter long Brooklyn Bridge, connecting
Manhattan to Long Island.

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.500
His son, Washington, oversaw construction
until 1870, when he was seriously injured.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.859
Then, Washington’s wife and co-chief engineer,
Emily Roebling, oversaw construction through

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:39.520
the bridge’s completion in 1883.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.180
Meanwhile, in Paris, the wrought-iron Eiffel
Tower, completed in 1889, created a metaphorical

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.709
bridge into the future… and a literal bridge
to nowhere,

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:50.340
It's not a bridge.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.450
And three, and one of the most iconic, scale-shifting,
nineteenth-century American inventions was

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.299
the cheap automobile and the new, more efficient
factory system that created it.

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.009
Karl Benz invented the practical automobile
in 1885.

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.490
But cars in the late 1800s were super expensive.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.720
So most people moved around on ships or trains
between cities, and on horses within them.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.280
There was just one problem: biology.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.000
Horses got sick, died, and got into accidents
causing traffic jams.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.580
Plus, cities couldn’t figure out how to
clear away their manure fast enough.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.060
In fact, New York City hosted the first professional
conference on urban planning in 1898, and

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.510
the theme was horse poop management.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.410
Which probably was a respectable job!

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.980
As the saying I just made up goes, ‘tis
better to manage than to shovel.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.980
Anyway.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.070
People loved the idea of cars, if only they
worked better…

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.150
Enter Henry Ford, a famous inventor who modeled
his life on Edison’s…

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.860
A Progressive vegetarian who helped invent
social welfare…

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.069
And a racist who helped invent social engineering,
inspiring Adolf Hitler.

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.470
It’s safe to say that Ford’s legacy is…
complicated.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.420
Ford was raised in Michigan and, in 1879,
became an apprentice machinist.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.379
Then in 1891, Ford joined the Edison Illuminating
Company in Detroit.

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:13.459
He became chief engineer only two years later,
working on the side on experimental projects

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:14.780
such as the “quadricycle.”

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.560
Which—why is that not a thing I can buy!?

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.819
Ford loved Edison, the company and the man.

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.209
He saw Edison’s corporate research on lights,
phonographs, and movies in New Jersey and

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.820
thought—YES! GOOD!

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.260
I’m going to do that, but bigger, for cars.

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.660
So in 1903, Ford co-founded the Ford Motor
Company.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.319
When Ford got started, there were many small
auto companies turning out gas, electric,

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.030
and even steam-powered cars.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.150
In fact, electric cars were popular!

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.180
But all of these cars were still expensive
and unreliable, and there were no standard

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.480
car parts.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.629
Ford set out to change all of that.

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:54.049
Vroom, Vroom ThoughtBubble.

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:59.519
In the early years, Ford Motor was a small-scale
operation that carried out mostly experimental

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:00.519
work.

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.430
They had no uniform process for manufacturing
cars.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.900
Ford’s team learned a lot, and drummed up
a lot of public interest.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:14.310
The Ford 999, for example, broke the land
speed record, covering a mile in only 39 seconds.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.799
But Ford wanted a car that was affordable,
easy to operate, and tough.

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:25.199
He pushed his team, and in 1908, they released
the Model T. and this car changed the world.

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.280
In the first month, only eleven Model Ts were
produced.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.400
But two years later, in 1910, Ford produced
10,000.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.870
In 1914, the year the first World War broke
out, the company shipped 250,000.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:45.110
And in 1916, Ford sold nearly 500,000 cars—each
for less than half the 1914 price!

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:52.830
Then, in 1927, Ford produced fifteen million
cars, plus tractors and lots of other machines.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.590
These large production numbers highlight the
phrase most often associated with Ford: mass

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.590
production.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.900
This style of production meant specialization
and standardization.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.940
The Ford plants at Highland Park and River
Rouge only produced one thing—the Model

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:08.940
T.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.419
These plants used Ford’s special business
technique, the assembly line.

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.290
So they could assemble a car from raw materials
in only twenty eight hours.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.860
Using sheet metal, they could assemble a Model
T in one hour.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.699
Without robots or computers!

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:26.660
You could even visit and see this happen,
because Ford loved watching people experience

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.990
how his cars came to life.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.139
So Ford succeeded thanks to unskilled labor
and a modular system that anyone could learn

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:35.479
a single part of.

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:40.900
That was the core idea of his assembly-line
philosophy, “Fordism”: build sophistication

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.259
into the product, making it modular, using
standardized parts.

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:48.540
And take skill out of the work involved.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:54.729
Just weld some parts and—presto, you’re
ready zoom past horses and put all those poop managers out of business.

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:55.840
Thanks Thoughtbuble!

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.150
Ford hoped Model Ts would protect his version
of a small-town, American utopia: now, country

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.879
doctors and lawyers could drive around, just
like rich British and German dudes!

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:09.020
He also hoped that it would keep farmers on
the farm.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.349
Well, white farmers, anyway.

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:15.349
And he wanted to spur an entire industry of
small-scale entrepreneurs who could augment

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:16.599
and repair his cars.

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:20.069
He even published a Model T repair catalog
to help them.

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:24.480
The irony was that, with his growing company,
Ford Motor created an environment hostile

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.979
to small automobile entrepreneurs.

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:30.160
It was expensive to invest in an assembly-line
factory.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.650
And Ford had a problem.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:37.340
Working on an assembly line was awfully boring,
so he faced a three hundred percent turnover

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.340
rate.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.949
He also had twenty seven million dollars in
cold profits that he could reinvest.

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:46.800
So he came up with a solution: double his
workers’ pay to a whopping five dollars

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.800
per day.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.680
This sounded great: in fact, it caused riots
when it was announced, as people tried to

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.610
get these amazing jobs.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.509
In reality, only white men were even eligible
to earn the whole five dollars.

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:03.199
African-Americans earned twenty percent less,
and women were mostly ineligible.

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:06.760
But Ford worried that simply paying people
more wasn’t enough.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.270
He wanted to educate his workers to become
model citizens.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:16.360
So he stipulated that they could earn this
new wage only if they met certain conditions:

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.789
one, they had to work for six months.

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:25.330
Two, they had to be clean-living: sober, “thrifty,”
possessed of “good moral habits,” and

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:26.879
involved in civic life.

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:31.849
And three, they had to swear off all involvement
with union activity.

00:07:31.849 --> 00:07:37.349
Ford even went so far as to set up the Ford
Sociological Department, which conducted inspections

00:07:37.349 --> 00:07:38.390
of his workers.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:42.880
In his mind, he wasn’t just producing cars:
he was producing Americans.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.520
The Sociological Department had images of
what a worker’s house was supposed to look

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.520
like.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:54.069
They inspected these homes and then published
before-and-after photos to show worker compliance

00:07:54.069 --> 00:07:55.729
with the company’s rules.

00:07:55.729 --> 00:07:57.629
Ford felt this was his duty.

00:07:57.629 --> 00:08:01.259
He hated the trends he was seeing in industrial
society.

00:08:01.259 --> 00:08:05.150
Ford viewed immigrants, especially Jewish
immigrants, and the corporations that employed

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.919
them as serious threats to democracy.

00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:12.630
In the late 1920s and ‘30s, Ford turned
to focus on his social goals.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:16.560
He wanted Americans to learn “not from the
school books but from life.”

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.020
So he opened a museum dedicated to Thomas
Edison.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.210
And then another one all about Ford Motor.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.130
Then Ford went really overboard.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:29.300
He relocated the homes or workshops of famous
inventors and recreated others, organizing

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:34.550
them into a whole town, called Greenfield
Village, with no regard to geographic accuracy.

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:38.589
Greenfield is a mishmashed paradise for a
historian of technology.

00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:43.620
To this day, you can visit Edison’s Menlo
Park laboratory, the Wright brothers’ bicycle

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.030
shop, and George Washington Carver’s house.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:50.640
Ford Motor kept operating his museums and
Greenfield Village after he died, updating

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.140
the museums to showcase all kinds of innovations.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.700
What were the short-term effects of scaling
up the auto industry?

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.690
Well, this also meant scaling up the infrastructure
of roads, gas stations, and mechanic shops

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:03.970
that could keep motorists a-motoring.

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.670
Cars also increased access to national parks.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:10.420
More people were moving to cities, and the
US government was starting to protect wild

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.930
spaces from development.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.420
Cars allowed people living in cities to get
out to these spaces, generating new interest

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.430
in nature with a capital N.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:22.279
This led to research on the scientific management
of forests and influenced the young discipline

00:09:22.279 --> 00:09:25.130
of ecology, which we’ll get to in a later
episode.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:30.330
In terms of economics, other car manufacturers
emulated the Fordist assembly-line method.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:35.390
While Ford concentrated on producing as many
Model Ts as possible, General Motors created

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:38.029
many different models, giving Americans more
options.

00:09:38.029 --> 00:09:43.950
By the middle of the century, only three companies—the
“Big 3,” Ford, GM, and Chrysler—dominated

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:48.180
the American auto market, pushing out small,
regional manufacturers.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:53.570
And Ford’s company became a symbol for the
transformative power of American industry—and

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:59.490
for the tensions between the owners of large
corporations and the workers running them.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:03.769
Industrialists felt that their workers had
freedom, as non-unionized contractors, and

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:06.720
that large corporations were the natural result
of innovation.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.610
Workers, on the other hand, didn’t feel
free.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:14.520
They worked long hours and often had little
choice, as with Ford Motor, as to where (and

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.060
even how!) they lived.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:20.990
They came together, forming unions, in order
to negotiate for better labor conditions.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:26.589
Finally, scientists and engineers professionalized
a lot over the course of the 1800s.

00:10:26.589 --> 00:10:30.420
The American Medical Association, for example,
was founded in 1847.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:35.329
And Wyoming became the first state to legally
license engineers, in 1907.

00:10:35.329 --> 00:10:39.149
Increasingly, being a doctor or engineer wasn’t
something you could just do.

00:10:39.149 --> 00:10:43.720
You needed university training, financial
backing, and professional licensing.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:48.720
And corporations such as the Edison companies
and Ford Motor offered paths for professionals

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:55.519
to follow, shaping what it was that scientists
and engineers did all day, and why they did those things.

00:10:55.519 --> 00:11:00.290
Today, many people claim there has been a
Third Industrial Revolution, tied to digital

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:05.550
information technologies, and even a Fourth,
current one, tied to Internet-connected automation.

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:10.130
Before we get to those stories, however, we
have the entire twentieth century to get through!

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:14.899
Next time—bust out your old records: it’s
the birth of mass media!

00:11:14.899 --> 00:11:18.190
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula,

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:22.070
