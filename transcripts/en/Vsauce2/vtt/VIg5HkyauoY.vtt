00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.160
Vsauce!

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.460
Kevin here -- now let’s paint a classic
rainbow.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.420
&nbsp;Green, good.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.379
Yellow, nice.

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.340
Red, spectacular.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.580
And we’re done.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.080
Because for most of human history, there was
no blue.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.689
I mean, of course blue existed.

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.520
Ancient humans had the same biological visual
systems for observing colors we have today

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.200
and clothing dyed blue with indigo has existed
from the Indus Valley Harappan to the Han

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.470
Dynasty in China.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.470
&nbsp;

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.100
But take a look at these old paintings and
you'll see there's no blue.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.200
So did rainbows themselves change!?

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.160
No.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.460
You can even see blue sky and blue water in
these paintings -- which means blue paint

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.280
existed but the rainbow of colors is missing
blue.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.470
They observed blue and used blue, but didn’t
see blue as part of the rainbow.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.380
Why?

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.920
Because blue is clearly an important color.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.100
It’s everywhere.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.380
Except it’s… not.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.930
When it comes to blue foods, you have blueberries,
which are actually a deep purple.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.760
Plants have no true blue pigment.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.070
The less than 10% of flowers that look blue-ish
are like that due to the natural modification

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.810
of a red pigment called anthocyanin - the
same thing in blueberries and cherries.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.810
Well, what about blue animals?

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:41.930
Bluebirds?

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.190
A Mandrill’s blue nose and… butt?

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.650
The blue-footed booby?

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.400
Your Uncle Louie may have a pet parrot with
bright blue feathers, but blue animals haven’t

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.900
been and continue not to be a very common
part of our lives.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.390
In terms of blue minerals, the Egyptians imported
the rare blue stone lapis lazuli from thousands

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.360
of miles away 6,000 years ago.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.170
The legendary talisman of Charlemagne, king
of the Francs, purportedly contained a fragment

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.220
of the cross upon which Jesus Christ was crucified
set between two blue sapphire gems.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.230
The most valuable object of the most powerful
Christian King was encased in blue.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.760
While in the East, the blue Buddha carved
from lapis lazuli represented healing, wisdom

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.230
and compassion.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:38.220
So basically when we finally found something
blue it was like….”THIS SEEMS IMPORTANT.”

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.590
Like my eyeballs.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.160
Blue eyes have only existed for about 7,000
years and were traced to a common ancestor

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.160
in Spain.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.840
Today, people with blue eyes only represent
about 8% of the population.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.200
So on this blue marble called Earth, there’s
not really much blue anywhere.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.260
Except the entire sky.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.319
I think.

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.500
Classical Arabic and Persian poetry frequently
refer to the sky as “the green” and up

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.280
until about the 13th century, the sky was
primarily considered white because of its

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.260
association with light during daytime.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.420
And yeah, the sky and water are often blue
but not always.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.250
On overcast days the sky can be white or gray,
and at night it’s black.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.480
Water can look gray, green, or have no color
at all.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.390
Water was often green on maps and wasn’t
established as blue until the 17th century.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.900
Green and blue are separated by only 35 nanometers
on the visible light spectrum, making them

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.120
even closer than violet and indigo.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.440
The thing is… in languages ranging from
Old Irish to Japanese, green and blue were

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.120
just one word.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.709
It’s tough to imagine lumping together blue
and green, but you probably lump together

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.290
goluboy and siniy.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.320
In Russia, light blue and dark blue are known
as goluboy and siniy respectively and a 2006

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.050
study found that Russian speakers were faster
at discriminating two separate colors when

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.690
shown blues that fell into their linguistic
category.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.180
English speakers, who really only have one
word for blue, showed no advantage.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.650
When you don’t have different words to distinguish
shades, blue is just blue -- it’s really

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.130
hard to categorize a difference quickly.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.690
But not only were green and blue once one
color - for a while there were actually only

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.310
three colors.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:46.110
Black, white, and red were the first recognized
colors in virtually every civilization.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.669
Here’s why.

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.210
Black and white come from dark and light.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.650
&nbsp;Red comes from poisonous fruits and from
blood spilled during hunting, battle or injury,

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.300
and also represents the fertility associated
with menstruation.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.760
The deeply-rooted impact of the Black/White/Red
three-color system can been seen in Snow White,

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.150
a story that has existed cross-culturally
in multiple forms for hundreds of years.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:18.380
Snow White with lips as red as blood and hair
as black as ebony wood.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.330
And when her evil stepmother tries to poison
her with a red apple, she tries to convince

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.150
Snow White it’s not poisoned so she eats
the apple with her but the stepmother eats

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.449
the white part which is not poisoned and makes
Snow White eat the red part which is poisoned.

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:35.480
The colors are important is what I’m trying
to say.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.949
Humans have always observed other colors,
but we just compartmentalized them into black,

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:43.510
white and red.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:49.290
Yellow was associated with white, and green,
blue and violet were linked with black.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.710
Eventually yellow and green became unique
colors in their own right -- there’s plenty

00:05:53.710 --> 00:06:00.699
of both in nature -- but still no one was
talking about blue.

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:06.650
Early languages like Greek, Hebrew, and Chinese
had no specific word for blue.

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:12.550
The words they used to represent colors weren’t
necessarily describing an exact hue, but instead

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.080
could reflect brightness or even quality.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.450
So, a better translation for green might be
“pale” and white might be “shining.”

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.320
You hear that, Doctor Resnick?

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.720
I’m not vitamin D deficient.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.980
I’m shining.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:34.199
Hey, how about you give us a specific example
of blue missing from the past?

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:36.610
Okay.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:42.680
A famous 1858 study by William Gladstone showed
that Homer’s The Odyssey mentions black

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:51.010
200 times, white around 100, red less than
15, yellow and green under 10, and blue a

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.080
whopping zero times.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.300
The Greeks did have a word -- glaukós -- that
could mean light blue, but glaukós was more

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:04.100
about describing the feeling of a color and
could also mean gray, yellow or brown.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.710
And the Hebrew tekhelét described a colorant
which came from a mollusk that could be used

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.040
to dye garments blue or violet.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:17.570
When we did develop words for blue they were
rooted in materials rather than the abstract

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.630
concept of color.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:26.100
The Egyptians had a word for their blue pigment:
irtiu, the first synthetic pigment ever created.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:31.940
But after the fall of Rome, the complicated
process of making Egyptian blue was lost -- along

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.120
with the Romans’ word for it, caeruleum.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.759
&nbsp;Since the Latin lexicon had a gap for blue,
the most common modern words for blue derive

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:45.460
from German and Arabic, both of whom made
and traded blue.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:52.070
In the 13th century, woad began being produced
on a large scale for dying clothes.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:57.100
Making blue from yellow flowers for the masses
influenced the culture’s need for a word

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.930
to describe that color.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.139
&nbsp;That word was blau.

00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:06.610
The word Azure comes from the Arabic lazaward,
which was used to describe cobalt oxide blue

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.020
glass and ceramics as well as lapis lazuli.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:15.580
The deep blue metamorphic rock was mined from
a single mountain range in Afghanistan, the

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.530
Sar-i Sang or “The Valley Of The Stone.”

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:25.280
After about 3,000 years we finally figured
out how to extract just the magnificent blue

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.310
to create a pigment called ultramarine.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:34.119
Ultramarine was the first truly vibrant blue
pigment in the world and was extremely rare

00:08:34.119 --> 00:08:39.419
and expensive — blue became more valuable
than gold.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:45.230
Painters reserved it for only the most important
subjects like the Virgin Mary’s robe.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:49.670
But only the rich “blue bloods” could
possibly afford ultramarine.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:55.779
It took an accident with red blood to bring
blue to the world.

00:08:55.779 --> 00:09:01.119
A pigment maker named Diesbach was trying
to create a popular red out of cochineal,

00:09:01.119 --> 00:09:05.519
an insect still used for red dye in everything
from lipstick to ketchup.

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:10.620
He added iron sulfate mixed with potash which
we later discovered has a useful element now

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.029
called potassium.

00:09:12.029 --> 00:09:18.350
Anyway, the potash he used was contaminated
with animal blood, which contains iron, and

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:23.800
rather than creating red, he accidentally
invented an affordable, long-lasting true

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.640
blue.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:34.970
When it came to making red pigment… he really
blue it.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:39.999
Named Prussian Blue after its use as a dye
for Prussian army uniforms, its popularity

00:09:39.999 --> 00:09:41.480
went global.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:46.630
It reinvigorated Japanese woodblock paintings,
which went on to influence manga, which led

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:49.019
to Japanese animation.

00:09:49.019 --> 00:09:51.379
And it also revolutionized architecture.

00:09:51.379 --> 00:09:58.740
In 1842, English astronomer Sir John Herschel
used Prussian blue to invent blueprints, eliminating

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:03.339
the need for architectural drawings to be
arduously hand-copied.

00:10:03.339 --> 00:10:09.259
So you can thank blue for Dragon Ball Z and
buildings.

00:10:09.259 --> 00:10:14.040
But clothing is where blue cemented its use
in everyday life.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:19.239
Black gave way to blue as the color of choice
for uniforms from sailors and guards to police

00:10:19.239 --> 00:10:21.369
officers and postal workers.

00:10:21.369 --> 00:10:24.000
&nbsp;The working class became “blue collar.”

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.959
And the explosive popularity of rugged denim
jeans brought blue to everyone.

00:10:29.959 --> 00:10:36.699
It’s impossible to understate how quickly
our modern world exploded with color.

00:10:36.699 --> 00:10:42.470
It was only 350 years ago that Sir Isaac Newton
changed the world when experiments with prisms

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:49.179
led him to divide the visible spectrum into
five colors: red, yellow, green, blue and

00:10:49.179 --> 00:10:50.179
violet.

00:10:50.179 --> 00:10:54.759
He later added orange and indigo simply because
he wanted the number of colors to align with

00:10:54.759 --> 00:10:58.509
the ancient Greek belief in the power of the
number seven.

00:10:58.509 --> 00:11:05.679
Seven notes in a musical scale, seven known
planets, seven days in a week.

00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:11.350
Four centuries later, you have a telephone
in your pocket that displays over 16.7 million

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:18.220
colors with clearly defined hex codes so I
know that the specific blues for Vsauce2 are

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.800
#3399ff and #0066cc.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:30.189
And now blue - a color with no name for most
of existence - is the most popular color in

00:11:30.189 --> 00:11:31.709
the world.

00:11:31.709 --> 00:11:40.500
We invented the color of our planet and it’s
changed how we see life.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:46.059
Norwegian Painter Edvard Munch had a perceptual
phenomenon known as synesthesia which causes

00:11:46.059 --> 00:11:53.290
sensory and cognitive signals to cross -- and
it led him to see emotions as colors.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:59.160
He said, "In my art, I attempt to explain
life and its meaning to myself.”

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:06.459
And while The Scream remains his most legendary
work, Munch’s painting Starry Night represents

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:10.370
how human perception colors our reality.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:17.819
&nbsp;Having just lost his first love, Munch painted
the view from his hotel room in Oslo.

00:12:17.819 --> 00:12:25.040
Tapping into his synesthesia to express this
once-in-a-lifetime feeling, the entire landscape

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:33.480
is bathed in the color of a bruised heart,
the color of transcendence beyond the ordinary,

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:38.940
the color blue.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:44.480
Describing the painting, he said, “… a
landscape will alter according to the mood

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:49.139
of the person who sees it.”

00:12:49.139 --> 00:12:55.489
But the invention of blue didn’t just alter
the landscape - it allowed us to advance from

00:12:55.489 --> 00:13:01.559
simply observing our surroundings to finally
seeing our world.

00:13:01.559 --> 00:13:05.949
Which means the question, “why is the sky
blue?”

00:13:05.949 --> 00:13:08.660
actually has two answers.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:13.499
The first is that the shorter, smaller blue
light waves from the sun scatter when they

00:13:13.499 --> 00:13:16.269
hit molecules in our atmosphere.

00:13:16.269 --> 00:13:23.550
The second is… we found blue.

00:13:23.550 --> 00:14:09.279
And as always - thanks for watching.

00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:13.980
Hey if you want to learn more about yourself
then click here to watch my previous video,

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:14.980
Scapegoats.

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:20.549
For this video I want to thank Joshua, Trevor
Something, Kidmograph, Victoria and Virginia

00:14:20.549 --> 00:14:21.839
all for their help.

00:14:21.839 --> 00:14:26.939
Now the new Curiosity Box just arrived this
is the new T-shirt but what I really want

00:14:26.939 --> 00:14:29.740
to talk about is this.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.889
Say hello to Nikola Tesloth.

00:14:31.889 --> 00:14:35.449
The first in our brand new pin series, Curious
Creatures.

00:14:35.449 --> 00:14:39.999
Which is a mashup of some of the most curious
humans of all time with some of the awesomest

00:14:39.999 --> 00:14:41.439
creatures of all time.

00:14:41.439 --> 00:14:45.009
On the back you get to see a brief biography
of Nikola Tesloth.

00:14:45.009 --> 00:14:47.069
And this is the first of many to come.

00:14:47.069 --> 00:14:52.089
So starting now, each Curiosity Box will include
another Curious Creature.

00:14:52.089 --> 00:14:55.949
So if you subscribe now you get to start your
collection from number one.

00:14:55.949 --> 00:15:00.939
As always a portion of the proceeds from The
Curiosity Box goes to Alzheimer's research.

00:15:00.939 --> 00:15:05.870
So thanks for supporting all of our brains,
thanks for supporting your brain and thanks
