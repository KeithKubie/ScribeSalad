00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.020
Fewer and fewer people believe nowadays.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:17.580
It's possible that in a generation, there simply won't be religion across Europe and large sections of north America, Australia and Asia.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.240
That 's not necessarily a problem.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.820
But it's worth thinking about why people made up religion in the first place

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.960
and what we're doing with the needs and longings that led them to do so.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.660
At one level, religions are about asking us to believe in something.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.880
And when people say they can't believe, they tend to stop right there with the whole religion business.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.960
And often point out all the horrid things that religions have undoubtedly done and continue to do.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.360
But in this sense, belief is almost the least important and definitely the least interesting side of religion.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.560
What's fascinating is all the other stuff religions get up to.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.120
For example, the way they regularly gather people around and,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.920
strikingly, tell them to be nice to one another.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.120
Or the way they create a sense of community,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.380
acting as hosts, making sure that granny and the child, the big chief and the little guy

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.220
learn to see each other as human beings rather than abstract entities.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.700
Religions use rituals to point stuff out to us and lodge it in our fickle minds.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.920
For example, that the seasons are changing or that it's the time to remember your ancestors.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.760
That the moon looks pretty

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.280
or you can atone and make a fresh start.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.040
or that it's rather amazing that there's food on the table.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.760
Religions know we're not just intellectual creatures

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.400
so they carefully appeal to us via art and beauty

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.300
We think of beauty in one category a frivolous and superficial thing, and truth and depth in an another

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.200
Religions join them together.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.700
They build temples, cathedrals, and mosques that use beauty  to lend depth to important ideas.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.920
They use the resources of art to remind us of what matters.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.720
Their art is didactic.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.600
It's directed at making us feel things

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.100
calm

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.120
pity

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.800
awe

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.280
We may no longer believe, but the needs and longings

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.620
that made us make up these stories go on.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.800
We're lonely

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.920
and violent

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.560
We long for beauty, wisdom, and purpose.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.240
We want to live for something more than just ourselves.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.060
Society tells us to direct our hopes in two areas

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.920
Romantic love and professional success.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.920
And it distracts us with news, movies, and consumption.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.720
It's not enough, as we know.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.380
Especially at three in the morning.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.400
We need reminders to be good,

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.720
places to reawaken awe,

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.040
something to awaken our kinder, less selfish impulses.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.940
Universal things which need tending like delicate flowers

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.760
and rituals that bring us together.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.960
The choice isn't between religion and a secular world as it is now.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.420
The challenge is to learn from religions

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.840
so we can fill the secular world with replacements for the things we long ago made up religion to provide.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.800
The challenge begins here.
