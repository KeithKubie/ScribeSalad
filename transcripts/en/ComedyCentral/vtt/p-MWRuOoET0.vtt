FRANCIS SCOTT KEY,

00:00:02.703 --> 00:00:05.572
A VERY PROMINENT LAWYER
IN BALTIMORE

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:08.876
DURING THE 1812 WAR.

00:00:08.976 --> 00:00:12.312
ONE NIGHT, HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW
SHOWS UP, AND HE SAYS,

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:15.582
FRANCIS, THE HONORABLE
DR. BEANES

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:19.620
HAS BEEN TAKEN CAPTIVE ON
A BRITISH WARSHIP.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.858
DR. BEANES IS A VERY UPSTANDING
MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY.

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.561
HE HELPED EVERYBODY.
[laughs]

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:29.329
- HE'S DR. BEANES.
- HE'S DR. BEANES.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.064
HE'S AMAZING.

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:34.801
FRANCIS SCOTT KEY GOES
TO PRESIDENT JAMES MADISON,

00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:37.571
WHO WAS THE PRESIDENT
AT THE TIME.

00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:43.076
HE SAYS, LISTEN, THE HONORABLE
DR. BEANES HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED.

00:00:43.177 --> 00:00:45.078
PRESIDENT JAMES MADISON IS LIKE,

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:49.917
THE--IT'S LIKE A TERRIBLE--
LIKE, YEAH.

00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:53.787
OBVIOUSLY, YOU GOT TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:56.690
[laughing]

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.861
AND SO HE HOOKS HIM UP
WITH A GUY NAMED JA--

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:04.765
JOHN SKINNER,
A PRISONER EXCHANGE AGENT.

00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:07.334
AND THEY SET SAIL
TO THE BRITISH HEADQUARTERS,

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:09.870
WHICH IS A [bleep] BOAT.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.274
UNDER THE CONTROL
OF VICE "ADMIRABLE--"

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:15.909
UH, VICE "ADMIRABLE"--

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.077
UH, F--SORRY.

00:01:17.144 --> 00:01:21.114
ADMIRAL A--
OH, OKAY, LET'S BACK UP.

00:01:21.215 --> 00:01:23.917
VICE ADMIRAL ALEXANDER COCHRANE.

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:25.652
MAN, I'M [bleep] DRUNK.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.288
I GOT TO DRINK MORE.

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:31.925
THE BRITISH WINE THEM,
AND THEY DINE THEM,

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:33.994
AND KEY AND SKINNER
AND WERE LIKE,

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:37.865
YOU'VE GOT THIS FRAIL,
OLD DOCTOR MAN

00:01:37.965 --> 00:01:42.202
SITTING IN HIS CELL
OR WHATEVER.

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:45.639
IT'S LIKE, LET THE GUY GO,
YOU KNOW?

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:47.608
THEY MADE A REALLY GOOD CASE.

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:49.943
AND MAJOR GENERAL ROSS WAS LIKE,

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.944
SOUNDS GOOD.

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.180
LET'S LET DR. BEANES GO.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.549
THEY WINED AND DINED
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.287
EVENTUALLY, KEY AND SKINNER HEAR
SOME BRITISH SOLDIERS SAYING,

00:02:00.387 --> 00:02:02.155
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:02:02.256 --> 00:02:07.127
NEXT WEEK, WE'RE GONNA BE
ATTACKING BALTIMORE.

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:09.563
WE'RE GONNA BE
ATTACKING BALTIMORE.

00:02:09.663 --> 00:02:13.367
AND THEY SAW MAPS AND PLANS

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.769
OF HOW THEY WERE GONNA DO IT.

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:19.373
COCHRANE TELLS KEY AND SKINNER,

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:22.142
YOU KNOW TOO MUCH.

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:24.077
YOU KNOW TOO MUCH.

00:02:24.178 --> 00:02:26.980
HE AND SKINNER WERE HELD
PRISONER FOR A FULL WEEK.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.249
THEY WOULD TEASE THEM
AND SAY THINGS LIKE,

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.687
HEY, I HOPE YOU TAKE A GOOD LOOK
AT THAT FLAG OVER THERE,

00:02:33.787 --> 00:02:36.890
BECAUSE, UM,
IT'S NOT GONNA BE THERE.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.326
'CAUSE IT'S GONNA BE GONE.

00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:40.928
[laughs]
SORRY.

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:41.762
FRANCIS SCOTT KEY IS THINKING--
