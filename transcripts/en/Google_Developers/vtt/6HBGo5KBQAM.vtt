MALE SPEAKER: I
would like everyone

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.990
to give a nice warm welcome
to Timothy Jordan, who

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.220
is going to be talking about
Google Glass. [APPLAUSE]

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.622
And we will start.

00:00:17.622 --> 00:00:19.080
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.620
How is everyone?

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.120
Todd just asked, but I'm
asking again for form's sake.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.050
Good?

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.150
OK.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.180
Hey, I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.082
I'm a developer advocate
working on Glass.

00:00:30.082 --> 00:00:32.040
And you can find out more
information about me,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.290
and we can have a chat if
you visit me over at Google+.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.900
google.com/+timothyjordan.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.190
Today, I wanted to talk
a little bit about games,

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.310
because that seems to be
the right context for it.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.700
But I have a few
questions first.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.270
And this is going to start
with a really easy one.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.860
This is partially because of
the question, and partially

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.320
to just know who in the audience
is going to participate today.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.820
Who likes games?

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.190
OK, everyone's going
to participate today.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.340
I like that.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.590
Now here's a more deep
leading question, if you will.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.360
Who here believes that the
average game on a smartphone,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.600
when just ported to Glass, is
going to make sense on Glass?

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.070
And no one.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.820
Now I know because you're paying
attention, because you already

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.870
demonstrated you're
participating.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.700
And that's the thing, is
that our gaming systems

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.550
look nothing like this.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.560
And I'm going to
spend some time today

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.360
talking about the
user interaction

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.330
model and the
paradigms with which we

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.500
design things for Glass.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.540
And how that becomes
a challenge when

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.177
we think about building
games on Glass.

00:01:42.177 --> 00:01:44.510
I'm going to start out with
some general principles that

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.200
are the foundation for how we
think about Glassware design

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.450
or apps for Glass design.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.320
Those of you who have seen
the design principles before,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.290
please bear with me.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.910
They're still new
for some people.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.493
And then after that, I'm going
to drill down just a little bit

00:02:00.493 --> 00:02:03.710
deeper into some do's and
don'ts, specifically based

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.620
on those principles, but
looking at games in particular.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.440
Sound like fun?

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.440
Whoo!

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.030
It's just after lunch,
and we're excited.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.280
Design principles.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.520
So, there's five of them.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.660
And the first one is
the most important.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.420
This is design for Glass.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.870
And what we mean by this
is design specifically

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.850
for the Glass platform.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.180
Because although
it's a mobile device,

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.160
it's fundamentally different
than other mobile devices.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.550
It's not a rectangle
with a touchscreen on it.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.480
That's clear and obvious,
but when I say it out loud

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.230
it makes more sense, or
at least that it should.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.300
And it goes deeper than just
how it gets put on user.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.330
The UI changes because of that.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.520
So, this is the Google+
experience on a tablet

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.040
and on a phone.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.780
You can see it's a very
browsable experience.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.890
It's very much lean
back on your couch,

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.390
see what your friends are up to.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.965
But when the user's
wearing Glass,

00:03:04.965 --> 00:03:07.720
they're out in the world,
they're doing others things.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.550
They might still want
the benefit of technology

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.585
and the cool stuff and Google+.

00:03:12.585 --> 00:03:15.140
But they're going to want
it in a different way.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.040
So, this is that same
experience, that same service,

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.320
but on Glass.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.330
You'll notice a handful
of things are different.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.070
First off, there's a
single thing per view,

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.310
and it's very glanceable.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.170
I briefly look at
this, and I know

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.680
it's a post from my
friend Alex, who's

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.260
on a steep climb on his bike.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.742
I need less than a second
to figure that out.

00:03:39.742 --> 00:03:41.200
And if I want to
interact with him,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.280
I can, through some very
short and quick gestures.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.830
The thing here is that
it's the same service,

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.450
but it's different on Glass.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.590
It's been rethought and
redesigned specifically

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.100
for this experience.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.325
And most importantly,
it's been tested on Glass.

00:03:55.325 --> 00:03:57.380
And we've made changes.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.360
In fact, when I've been
working with developers outside

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.930
of Google-- some of our
partners and otherwise--

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.660
most of the time spent
building Glassware

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.500
is in that iteration phase.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.992
After they've thought
what the design would be.

00:04:10.992 --> 00:04:13.450
They've built the prototype,
and then they put it on Glass,

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.797
and they go, oh.

00:04:16.797 --> 00:04:18.630
And then we started
changing things together

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.500
until we got to a good place.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.440
So, the four
following principles

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.630
really build upon that
theme, designing specifically

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.170
for Glass.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.680
And the first one is
don't get in the way.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.140
And this is especially both
important and challenging

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.370
when we're thinking
about game design.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.330
The idea is that I'm out in
the world doing something,

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.340
and I might use Glass to
enhance that experience.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.310
In this case, I'm looking
at some jellyfish,

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.280
and I'm learning
more about jellyfish.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.870
You don't see something else
blocking my vision here.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.420
Now, with game
design, we're used

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.500
to the paradigm of immersion.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.960
Capture the user's attention,
engross them in the game,

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.270
and keep them there.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.630
And usually, the success
metric is the more time

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.146
they spend there, the more
involved and immersed they are,

00:05:08.146 --> 00:05:09.270
the more valuable the game.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.500
The more they enjoy it.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.980
The more they keep coming back.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.130
With Glass, that's different.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.600
Because you're getting in the
way of the user's life while

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.290
they're out there living it.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.800
So, we need to start
thinking about how do we

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.790
build games that
highlight this difference,

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.270
not fight this difference.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.990
And I'll talk more about that.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.030
Keeping it relevant.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.330
And there's two
very specific ways

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.300
we think about
this in common use.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.370
One is over time, and
the other is over space.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.409
Because relevancy has a
lot to do with what now is.

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:46.950
And when you're thinking about
different computing paradigms,

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.340
your cloud is your
sort of forever.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.680
Your laptop might be your
last year, two, or three.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.930
However often you replace them.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.330
Your phone could be the
last month or the last week.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.340
But Glass is right now.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.640
It's just this moment, and
it's where you happen to be.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.670
This is one of my favorite
ideas for building

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.485
for Glass is having a
shopping list when I need it.

00:06:11.485 --> 00:06:13.610
I don't know about you,
but I keep a shopping list.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.450
But every time I'm at the store,
that shopping list is somewhere

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:17.714
else.

00:06:17.714 --> 00:06:19.880
And so what I've started
doing is I keep it digital.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.240
But wouldn't it even be cooler
if when I get to the store--

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.010
and maybe I check
in, or Glass just

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.170
knows that I'm there
because I've been there

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.420
for a few minutes-- it
surfaces my shopping list

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.530
with the items that can
be found at that store.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.110
How exceedingly
helpful would that be?

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.540
And that's because
it's an experience that

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.540
can know where I am and help me
out in that particular moment.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.890
We want to avoid the unexpected.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.650
Especially the unexpected
and the unpleasant.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.940
Because the unexpected and
the delightful is good.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.620
Surprising our
users with delight

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.130
is fantastic,
especially when looking

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.160
at entertainment or gaming.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.040
But giving them
something unexpected

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.360
that they also do not enjoy?

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.040
That would be unfortunate.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.350
And it's particularly important
to remember this on Glass

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.510
because it's so
personal to the user.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:19.800
They're wearing Glass
throughout their day.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.930
So, when you come and
say hello to them,

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.850
it's something that should
be helping them in their day.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.820
It's not something that you
can remind them of abstractly

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.130
while they're at their desk.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.320
Because that's not where
Glass is most often used.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.830
A great way to do this is to
give users controls and make

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.640
it clear what's
going to happen when.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.610
And an example is CNN, where
CNN delivers short videos

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.420
throughout the day on the
topics that I've chosen.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.810
And to choose those topics,
I go to the settings page,

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.720
and I can choose the
different topics.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.940
I get an idea of how many posts
per day I will get per topic.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:03.550
And I can also choose the
time of day that I can receive

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.100
notifications, and when I don't.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.350
So I have a lot of the agency.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:10.010
I have a lot of
choice as a user here.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:13.600
Or I can tell CNN when
I want to get this news.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.750
And so when that
news comes through,

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:19.840
it's an expected part
of the experience.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.085
And the last thing
is build for people.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:28.330
This is something
that we discuss a lot,

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.380
especially nowadays.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.929
I think it's really important
to mention, especially

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:38.409
in the context of Google Glass.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:41.539
And this is what I mean by this.

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:45.200
And I suspect most of the people
in this room already know this.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.920
That the layout on
your keyboard was

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.860
designed to make
you type slower.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.170
Who knew that?

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:52.920
So not everybody.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.169
About 40%.

00:08:54.169 --> 00:08:55.210
Isn't that extraordinary?

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.254
Doesn't it bother you on
some level, just a bit?

00:08:57.254 --> 00:08:59.420
Now, I'm not saying the
keyboard's going to go away.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.900
We're familiar with
it, and it's sort of

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.080
like this universal
input device.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.530
However, that layout
was designed at a time

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:11.750
that mechanical
typewriters were the norm.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.440
And if you typed too
fast, they'd jam.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.560
So the layout was meant to keep
typists from going so fast.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.180
And in that way, actually get
more work done on the day,

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.726
because they didn't
have to deal with jams.

00:09:23.726 --> 00:09:25.350
But that's not really
the case anymore.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:28.030
And we've done some
incremental improvements,

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:30.590
like lighting the keyboard, or
making the keys a little bit

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.570
more low-rise so that you
can type a bit faster.

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.831
But Glass is not an
incremental improvement.

00:09:36.831 --> 00:09:38.080
It's what we call a moon shot.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.580
It's a 10x improvement.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.500
And this is where
Glass users are.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.120
They're out living their
dreams on adventures

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.830
or doing the things
that make them happy.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:53.230
They still want the benefit
of technology in their lives.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.720
So the question we've got to
ask ourselves as the makers

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.450
and designers and
developers of this Glassware

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:04.090
is how can we give them that
joy of technology, while not

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:07.150
getting in the
way of their life?

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.850
Always thinking about where's
the user going to use this.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.310
Who are they around?

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:16.089
How can we make it
fun for everyone?

00:10:16.089 --> 00:10:16.880
And those are them.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.590
Those are the
foundational guidelines

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.960
for building Glass
software or Glassware.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.770
Designing specifically for
Glass and testing it on Glass.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.870
So that we really know what
works and what doesn't.

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.530
Not getting in the
way of the user.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:35.080
Never taking precedence over
anything else in their life.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:40.150
Keeping it relevant to where
they are, what time it is.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:41.195
Avoiding the unexpected.

00:10:41.195 --> 00:10:46.010
And especially that which is
unexpected and unpleasant.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.130
And finally,
building for people.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.020
Solving real user problems.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.535
Building games for people
to use in their lives.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:01.445
OK, so a few notes coming off
of this, specifically for games.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.570
Who has had a
chance to use Glass?

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:10.525
OK, so just about
20% of the audience.

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:15.700
The obvious things are
relatively obvious.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.070
For input, we've got a touchpad.

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:20.730
There are microphones,
I can use voice control.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:21.500
There's a camera.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.432
There's a full IMU.

00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:24.140
And of course, there's
location services.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.845
And for output,
I've got a screen.

00:11:28.845 --> 00:11:30.220
It's always there
when I want it.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.500
It's never in my line of
sight, but it's always

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.610
in my field of view.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:35.430
It's 640 by 360.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.030
And of course, there's
audio, either through earbuds

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:42.130
or through the built-in
audio that's just for me.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.310
And those things are
interesting, but even more

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.930
so is how the form
factor changes

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:51.410
how you use those items.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.470
Because those input
and output mechanisms

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:55.870
are on other devices,
but it's different

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:59.210
when you put it in Glass
and you wear it outside.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:02.560
So let's drill down into some
of those do's and don'ts, if you

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.060
will.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:07.210
And the first one is
don't design an app.

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:08.740
There's two important
points here.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.950
First, the Glass UI
model is time-based.

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:14.600
It's not an app model.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.970
At no point will you
find a wall of icons

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:20.440
that you can choose to launch.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.850
Instead, we use voice commands.

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:26.030
And these voice commands
aren't launch maps.

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:28.690
It's get directions to.

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:29.850
It's an action.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.970
It reduces the time between
intent and that action.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.840
So instead of "launch
maps, enter an address,

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.250
tell it where I am, I want
directions by car," I just say,

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.050
"get directions to
the Moscone Center."

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.210
And it happens.

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.400
And all voice commands
follow this form.

00:12:51.754 --> 00:12:52.920
A note about voice commands.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.520
These voice commands
are built models

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.240
that we release with
software releases,

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.400
and there's a set number
of them that are growing.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.965
One of them that you may be
interested in is "play a game."

00:13:03.965 --> 00:13:05.840
And if the user has
multiple games installed,

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.660
they then get to choose
which game, again by voice.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.780
Don't just port your
mobile experience to Glass.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.820
So this is a screenshot
that we haven't actually

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.020
shown very much.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.700
This is an early
prototype of Glass.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.325
The idea, what if
Glass was a dashboard

00:13:27.325 --> 00:13:30.190
and we showed the user a lot
of information all the time?

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:31.710
So we tried it.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:34.190
It's important to try things
quickly and when they fail,

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:35.650
learn from them and move on.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:36.600
And this failed.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.100
Right?

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.790
It's too much information.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.290
If I'm going to sit
down at my desk,

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.400
I'm fine with looking
through a lot of information.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.899
But if I'm walking
between meetings,

00:13:45.899 --> 00:13:48.360
this is not going to work.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.570
It's a glanceable interface.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:56.400
And so even though you might be
trying to have the same action

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.310
or give the same benefit
to the user, how you do

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:03.560
it is going to be
different on Glass.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.250
And you want to test this
experience everywhere you can.

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:10.100
An example of that is
both indoors and outdoors.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:14.480
This one image, when
seen through Glass

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.640
inside and outside, looks
remarkably different.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:22.060
And it's not just the luminosity
against the background.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.400
It's also the color temperature.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.770
A little more detail there.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:34.970
White is the new black, which
is also the name of my upcoming

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:37.610
first album, "White
is the New Black."

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:41.380
The white right
there, you'll notice

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.430
is very stark in its contrast.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:49.344
It's really easy to see, whereas
the black part of the screen

00:14:49.344 --> 00:14:50.760
sort of fades into
the background.

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.980
And we establish hierarchy
with different shades of color.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:06.640
Green, red, different
shades of gray.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:10.660
You wouldn't want to do this
by changing the font size,

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:14.804
because smaller font sizes
can be hard to read on Glass.

00:15:14.804 --> 00:15:16.470
So you'll notice
there's a heading here,

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.053
and then there's
different data that's

00:15:18.053 --> 00:15:21.056
differentiated and broken
up visually by using color.

00:15:21.056 --> 00:15:22.430
But the font stays
the same size,

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:23.920
and it's the same font face.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.515
Be wary of head gestures.

00:15:35.867 --> 00:15:37.700
And the reason for this
is that it might not

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.550
work out the way
you think it will.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:43.350
Because head gestures-- when
I'm standing still and not doing

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:46.450
anything else-- are
relatively predictable.

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:50.710
But when I walk down the
street, everything changes.

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:54.320
And to emphasize this point,
here's a video of a chicken.

00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:59.870
Humans don't operate this way.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.230
And this is another one of those
cases where what you need to do

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:09.950
is if you're going to try
head gestures, go for it.

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:11.995
Write the experiment,
and then go try it.

00:16:11.995 --> 00:16:13.771
Try it in several
different environments

00:16:13.771 --> 00:16:14.770
and different locations.

00:16:23.569 --> 00:16:24.360
Make it glanceable.

00:16:30.476 --> 00:16:32.350
The interesting thing
about these two screens

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:33.780
is that I put these
in front of people,

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.655
and I'm like, which do
you like better, which

00:16:35.655 --> 00:16:39.500
has more information,
which is more usable?

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.100
And opinions differ.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:46.900
The thing is, on
the left, you've

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:50.650
got so much visual information
that even though some of it's

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:54.290
useful, it takes you a
longer time to get there.

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:56.380
Whereas on the right,
what you need to know

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:57.900
you can get in just a glance.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.800
In fact, in about half the time.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.650
If you want, you can try
and break it into chunks.

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:06.800
On the left, there's all
these different places

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.180
where your eyes are
going to go before you

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:10.800
realize the entire picture.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.010
And on the right, there's
just a handful of them.

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.489
We can even put some
numbers behind this.

00:17:16.489 --> 00:17:18.030
On the left side,
you're going to see

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:20.579
in an average of 1.8 seconds.

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:24.599
On the right side,
half that time.

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:27.400
And it's the same information.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.580
It's the same
usage for the user.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.970
But how we've displayed it
is remarkably different.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.940
And because of that, you also
want to design for emotion.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.270
It can be simple.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:46.470
It can just be telling the user,
you're doing good on your run.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:47.050
Keep going.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.845
And finally, include
other people in the fun.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.380
This might not be
so obvious when

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:10.282
we're doing video game design.

00:18:10.282 --> 00:18:14.730
But I think it is obvious
when we do board game design.

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:15.670
You know?

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:18.570
Think about the last
game of Werewolf or Mafia

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:21.099
that you played.

00:18:21.099 --> 00:18:22.890
You had the game master,
you had the people

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:24.210
who are participating.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.550
And you had the people
who are watching,

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.050
hanging out in the background.

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:32.730
It was fun for everybody
to see that game unfold.

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:34.240
What if Glass were like that?

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.650
Here's a photo I recently
took of my team playing

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:42.419
a word game, something
like Taboo, using Glass.

00:18:42.419 --> 00:18:43.960
Glass was the
interface for this that

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.890
just made the game move along.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:48.375
But then it was the people
that were really the mechanic.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.910
There's been a lot of game
design for Glass done already.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:57.150
In fact, Glu released
this great game

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:58.690
on Glass, called Spellista.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:03.060
It was a great start for seeing
how to use the Glass interface

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.270
and gives the user
an opportunity

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:06.870
for whimsy on Glass.

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:09.470
Not just productivity.

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:13.410
And we recently released
some experiments

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:16.050
for trying different
sensors out.

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:17.660
And using new kinds
of game play based

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:21.090
on those sensors and the
form factor of Glass.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:24.290
And the next step
is for all of you

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:28.610
to figure out how
to make this happen.

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:32.080
What I mean by this is that
the next step in Glass gaming

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.520
design is not going
to look like a game

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:38.370
on your phone or your tablet
or even like a board game.

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:40.695
It's probably going to look
a lot more like IRL games.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.010
But it's going to include
this component that

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:48.490
makes it all that much
more engaging for the user

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:51.360
and for the people around them.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.210
And our job is to
work on this stuff

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:55.840
and make sure the
platform is flexible,

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.780
and you can do some
amazing things with it.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.540
And I'm just waiting
for and hoping for

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.600
and here to encourage.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.950
What does innovation on
games for Glass look like?

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.750
And the next big step
where everybody sort of

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:18.556
stops and says, oh, that's
what it is, has yet to happen.

00:20:18.556 --> 00:20:19.930
Which means you
guys are probably

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:22.090
the ones that are
going to do it.

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:25.160
It's going to
happen any day now.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:30.310
For more information on the
product and the platform,

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:33.671
developers.google.com/glass.

00:20:33.671 --> 00:20:34.420
Thank you so much.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.690
