00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:10.333
[non-english speech]

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.567
Are you listening to me?

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:12.700
Of course.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.567
You were sleeping.

00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:14.200
I wasn't.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.500
I promise.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.667
I was having the most
wonderful thought.

00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:19.767
Oh, yes?

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:21.066
And what was that?

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:24.133
It's been bothering
me for over a year now.

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:28.266
How does something
traveling to nothing?

00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.767
What are you
talking about, Albert?

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:38.200
I imagined I was riding
alongside a light beam.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.900
Guess what happened?

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.066
I have no idea.

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:42.900
Let me show you.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.734
Come!

00:00:45.734 --> 00:00:47.166
Come on!

00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.133
[gasps]

00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:48.867
Come!

00:00:52.467 --> 00:00:55.266
Imagine I'm a light
beam traveling to Earth.

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.300
Now catch me!

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.333
How fast must we go?

00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.467
About 300,000
kilometers a second.

00:01:00.467 --> 00:01:01.800
Albert, you are mad!

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.000
No, I'm away, traveling
through the ether.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.734
Come on!

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:09.834
Come on!

00:01:09.834 --> 00:01:10.834
[woman laughs]

00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:11.734
Catch me!

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.700
[playing violin]

00:01:35.567 --> 00:01:39.266
And if you catch up to me,
the strangest thing happens.

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:40.667
I appear to slow down.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:41.867
Am I right?

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:43.300
[playing violin]

00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:46.233
[woman laughing]

00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:48.100
And here's the best part.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.100
When you are traveling
the speed of light

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:58.066
alongside the wave, me,
I appear frozen in time.

00:01:58.066 --> 00:01:59.633
Is that it?

00:01:59.633 --> 00:02:01.834
Well, so far, yes.

00:02:01.834 --> 00:02:04.266
[playing violin]
