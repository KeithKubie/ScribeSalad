00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.440
This right over here
is a self-portrait

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.520
that Rembrandt made
in 1640, and what's

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.300
really interesting about it
is like other great artists

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.370
like Leonardo da Vinci
and Salvador Dali

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.090
and many, many, many
others, Rembrandt really

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.980
cared about something
called the golden ratio.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.320
And I've done whole
videos about it.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.440
And it's this fascinating,
fascinating, fascinating number

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.195
that's usually denoted
by the Greek letter phi.

00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:28.570
And if you were
to expand it out,

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.990
it's an irrational
number, 1.61803,

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.290
and it just goes on
and on and on forever,

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.870
but there's some very neat
mathematical properties of phi,

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.280
or the golden ratio.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.440
If you start with phi, and
if you were to add to that,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.950
or actually let's
start it this way.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:54.990
If you were to start with 1
and add to that 1 over phi.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.970
Let me write my phi
a little bit better.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.260
You add to that 1 over
phi, that gives you phi.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.140
So that's kind of a neat thing.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.120
Now, if you were to multiply
both sides of this equation

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.740
by phi, you get that,
if you start with phi,

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.910
and then if you add 1,
you get phi squared.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.732
So it's a number you add
1, you get its square.

00:01:15.732 --> 00:01:17.440
These are all really,
really neat things.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.780
It can even be written
as a continued fraction.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:29.160
Phi could be rewritten as 1 plus
1 over 1 plus 1 over 1 plus 1

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.560
over, and we just go like that
forever and ever and ever.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.819
That also gives you phi.

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:34.860
So hopefully this gives
you a little appreciation

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.110
that this is a
really cool number.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.120
And not only is it
cool mathematically,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.179
but it shows up
throughout nature,

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.720
and it's something that artists
have cared about because they

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.530
believe that it helps
define human beauty.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.060
And we see that Rembrandt
really cared about it

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.250
in this painting.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.180
And how can we tell?

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.346
Well that's what we're going
to analyze a little bit

00:01:54.346 --> 00:01:55.940
through this exercise
in this video.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.360
We can construct a triangle.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.985
Obviously these triangles aren't
part of his original painting.

00:01:59.985 --> 00:02:01.460
We superimposed these.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.700
But if you were to put a
base of a triangle right

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.790
where his arm is
resting, and then

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.139
if you were to have the
two sides of the triangle

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:12.050
outline his arms and shoulders
and then meet at the tip right

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.320
at the top of this arch, you
would construct triangle ABD

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.930
just like we have here.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.570
And then if you were
to go to his eyes,

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.940
and you could imagine
human eyes are

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.356
what we naturally look at,
whether we're looking at a face

00:02:23.356 --> 00:02:24.720
or a painting of a face.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.530
If you look at his eyes, and if
you were to draw a line there

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.930
that's parallel, well, that
really connects the eyes,

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.900
and that's parallel to the
BD right over here-- so let's

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.890
call that segment PR
right over there--

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.710
we'll see that this ratio,
the ratio between this smaller

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.770
triangle and this larger
triangle, involves phi.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.330
So this is what we
know, what we're

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.390
being told about this painting,
and this is quite fascinating.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.450
The ratio between the length of
segment CD and BC is phi to 1.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.710
So you drop an altitude
from this larger triangle,

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:05.390
this ratio, the ratio of CD, the
length of CD to BC, that's phi.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.240
So clearly, Rembrandt
probably thought about this.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.745
Even more, we know that
PR is parallel to BD.

00:03:11.745 --> 00:03:13.370
We've actually
constructed it that way.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.019
So that is going to be parallel
to that right over there.

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.560
And so the next clue
is what tells us

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.590
that Rembrandt really
thought about this.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.900
The ratio of AC to AQ.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.670
So AC is the altitude
of the larger triangle.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.280
The ratio of that
to AQ, which is

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.870
the altitude of this top
triangle, that ratio is phi

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.980
plus 1 to 1, or you could even
say that ratio is phi plus 1.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.580
So clearly, Rembrandt
thought a lot about this.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.550
Now using all that
information, let's

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.710
just explore a little bit.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.110
Let's see if we can come
up with an expression that

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.790
is the ratio of the
area of triangle ABD,

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.960
so the area of the
larger triangle,

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.080
to the area of triangle APR.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.720
So that's this smaller
triangle right up here.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.330
So we want to find the ratio of
the area of the larger triangle

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.080
to the area of the
smaller triangle,

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.530
and I want to see if we
can do it in terms of phi,

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.760
if we can come up with some
expression here that only

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.579
involves phi, or
constant numbers,

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.250
or manipulating phi in some way.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.000
So I encourage you to pause the
video now and try to do that.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.300
So let's take it step by step.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.610
What is the area of a triangle?

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.820
Well, the area of any triangle
is 1/2 times base times height.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.850
So the area of
triangle ABD we could

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.500
write as 1/2 times our base.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.240
Our base is the
length of segment BD.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.844
So 1/2 times BD.

00:04:41.844 --> 00:04:42.760
And what's our height?

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.030
Well that's the
length of segment AC.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.067
1/2 times BD-- Maybe
I'll do segment AC.

00:04:48.067 --> 00:04:49.650
Well, let me do it
in the same color--

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.660
times the length of segment AC.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.810
Now what's the area?

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.680
This is the area
of triangle ABD.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.680
1/2 base times height.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.030
Now what's the area
of triangle APR?

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.480
Well, it's going to be 1/2 times
the length of our base, which

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.960
is PR, segment PR,
the length of that,

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.690
times the height, which is,
the height is segment AQ,

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.580
so the length of segment
AQ, we could just

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.750
write it like that, times
the length of segment AQ.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.570
So how can we simplify
this a little bit?

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.070
Well, we could divide
the 1/2 by the 1/2.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.980
Those two cancel out.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.830
But what else do we know?

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.690
Well, they gave us the
ratio between AC and AQ.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.700
The ratio of AC to AQ right
over here is phi plus 1 to 1.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.820
Or we could just say
this is equal to phi.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.250
Or we could say this is
just equal to phi plus 1.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.532
So let me rewrite this.

00:05:44.532 --> 00:05:45.990
Actually, let me
write it this way.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.580
This is going to
be equal to-- So we

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:54.570
have the length of segment BD
over the length of segment PR,

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.510
and then this part right
over here we can rewrite,

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.049
this is equal to
phi plus 1 over 1.

00:06:00.049 --> 00:06:01.340
So I'll just write it that way.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.520
So times phi plus 1 over 1.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.315
So what's the ratio of BD to PR?

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.400
So the ratio of the base of
the larger triangle to the base

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.869
of the smaller triangle.

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:20.410
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.750
What might jump out at you
is that the larger triangle

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.990
and the smaller triangle, that
they are similar triangles.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.260
They both obviously
have angle A in common,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.640
and since PR is
parallel to BD, we

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.940
know that this angle
corresponds to this angle.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.510
So these are going to
be congruent angles.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.570
And we know that this
angle corresponds

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.560
to this angle right over here.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.190
So now we have three
correspondingly angles

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.350
are congruent.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.050
This is congruent to itself,
which is in both triangles.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.427
This is congruent to this.

00:06:53.427 --> 00:06:54.510
This is congruent to that.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.135
You have three
congruent angles, you're

00:06:56.135 --> 00:06:58.160
dealing with two
similar triangles.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.510
And what's useful
about similar triangles

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.770
are the ratio between
corresponding parts.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.920
Corresponding lengths of
the corresponding parts

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.860
of the similar triangles
are going to be the same.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.950
And they gave us
one of those ratios.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:15.410
They gave us the ratio of the
altitude of the larger triangle

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.240
to the altitude of
the smaller triangle.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.860
AC to AQ is phi plus 1 to phi.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.375
But since this is true
for one corresponding part

00:07:26.375 --> 00:07:27.750
of the similar
triangles, this is

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.820
true for any corresponding
parts of the similar triangle,

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.120
that the ratio is going
to be phi plus 1 to 1.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:40.340
So the ratio of BD, the ratio of
the base of the larger triangle

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.230
to the base of the
smaller one, that's

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.870
also going to be
phi plus 1 over 1.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.450
Let me just write it this way.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:56.040
This could also be rewritten
as phi plus 1 over 1.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.750
So what does this simplify to?

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.740
Well, we have phi plus 1 over
1 times phi plus 1 over 1.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.220
Well, we could just divide by 1.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.470
You're not changing the value.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:04.900
This is just going
to be equal to,

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.620
and we deserve a drum roll now.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:11.250
This is equal to
phi plus 1 squared.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:12.319
So that was pretty neat.

00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:14.610
And I encourage you to even
think about this because we

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.880
already saw that phi plus
1 is equal to phi squared,

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.220
and there's all sorts of
weird, interesting ways

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.220
you could continue
to analyze this.
