00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.870
So right over here I've
graphed the function

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.400
y is equal to f of x.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.810
I've graphed over this interval.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.190
It looks like it's between
0 and some positive value.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.940
And I want to think about the
maximum and minimum points

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:13.820
on this.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.290
So we've already talked a little
bit about absolute maximum

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.390
and absolute minimum
points on an interval.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.780
And those are pretty obvious.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.976
We hit a maximum
point right over here,

00:00:21.976 --> 00:00:23.600
right at the beginning
of our interval.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.058
It looks like when
x is equal to 0,

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:27.920
this is the absolute maximum
point for the interval.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.950
And the absolute minimum
point for the interval

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.259
happens at the other endpoint.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.430
So if this a, this is b,
the absolute minimum point

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.260
is f of b.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.600
And the absolute
maximum point is f of a.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.990
And it looks like
a is equal to 0.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.240
But you're probably
thinking, hey,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.870
there are other interesting
points right over here.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.970
This point right over
here, it isn't the largest.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.140
We're not taking on--
this value right over here

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.610
is definitely not
the largest value.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.530
It is definitely not
the largest value

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.510
that the function takes
on in that interval.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.879
But relative to the
other values around it,

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.420
it seems like a
little bit of a hill.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.010
It's larger than the other ones.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.300
Locally, it looks like a
little bit of a maximum.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.980
And so that's why this
value right over here

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.860
would be called-- let's
say this right over here c.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.630
This is c, so this is
f of c-- we would call

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.285
f of c is a relative
maximum value.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.090
And we're saying relative
because obviously the function

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.380
takes on the other values
that are larger than it.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.290
But for the x values
near c, f of c

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.260
is larger than all of those.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.970
Similarly-- I can
never say that word.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.200
Similarly, if this point
right over here is d, f of d

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.270
looks like a relative
minimum point

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.155
or a relative minimum value.

00:01:59.155 --> 00:02:05.770
f of d is a relative minimum
or a local minimum value.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.581
Once again, over
the whole interval,

00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:09.289
there's definitely
points that are lower.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.960
And we hit an absolute
minimum for the interval

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.600
at x is equal to b.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.350
But this is a relative
minimum or a local minimum

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.340
because it's lower
than the-- if we

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.090
look at the x values around d,
the function at those values

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.210
is higher than when we get to d.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.470
So let's think about,
it's fine for me to say,

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.490
well, you're at a
relative maximum

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.420
if you hit a larger
value of your function

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.336
than any of the
surrounding values.

00:02:36.336 --> 00:02:37.710
And you're at a
minimum if you're

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.330
at a smaller value than any
of the surrounding areas.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.512
But how could we write
that mathematically?

00:02:45.512 --> 00:02:47.220
So here I'll just give
you the definition

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.761
that really is just
a more formal way

00:02:48.761 --> 00:02:50.350
of saying what we just said.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:03:00.370
So we say that f of
c is a relative max,

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:08.370
relative maximum
value, if f of c

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.640
is greater than or
equal to f of x for all

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:24.410
x that-- we could say in a
casual way, for all x near c.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.724
So we could write it like that.

00:03:25.724 --> 00:03:27.390
But that's not too
rigorous because what

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.790
does it mean to be near c?

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.260
And so a more rigorous
way of saying it,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:39.080
for all x that's within an
open interval of c minus

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:47.340
h to c plus h, where h is
some value greater than 0.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.410
So does that make sense?

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.470
Well, let's look at it.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.180
So let's construct
an open interval.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.537
So it looks like for
all of the x values in--

00:03:54.537 --> 00:03:56.370
and you just have to
find one open interval.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.940
There might be many open
intervals where this is true.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.040
But if we construct
an open interval that

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.910
looks something like that,
so this value right over here

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.620
is c plus h.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.130
That value right
over here c minus h.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.720
And you see that
over that interval,

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.590
the function at c,
f of c is definitely

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.130
greater than or equal to
the value of the function

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.327
over any other part
of that open interval.

00:04:19.327 --> 00:04:20.910
And so you could
imagine-- I encourage

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.260
you to pause the video,
and you could write out

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.160
what the more formal definition
of a relative minimum point

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.370
would be.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.260
Well, we would just
write-- let's take

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.520
d as our relative minimum.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:38.310
We can say that f of d is
a relative minimum point

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.590
if f of d is less
than or equal to f

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.810
of x for all x in an
interval, in an open interval,

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:54.330
between d minus h and d plus
h for h is greater than 0.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.870
So you can find
an interval here.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.820
So let's say this is d plus h.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.260
This is d minus h.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.650
The function over that
interval, f of d is always

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.180
less than or equal to
any of the other values,

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.010
the f's of all of these
other x's in that interval.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.830
And that's why we say that
it's a relative minimum point.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.680
So in everyday
language, relative max--

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.820
if the function takes
on a larger value at c

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.170
than for the x values around c.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.930
And you're at a
relative minimum value

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.540
if the function takes
on a lower value

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.200
at d than for the
x values near d.
