Now, since it's my job to make your life difficult. I'm going to give you a nice

00:00:04.616 --> 00:00:09.133
complicated expression here. We have 7x squared plus 2x plus 1, all inside

00:00:09.145 --> 00:00:13.863
parentheses. And I'd like you to add that to this other quantity that's inside

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:18.152
parentheses. 4x squared minus 2x plus 4. And remember, I'd also like you to

00:00:18.164 --> 00:00:22.062
simplify as much as you can, so no more parenthesis and all like terms combined.

00:00:22.153 --> 00:00:26.072
I know this looks complicated, but you know how to do this. And if you don't get

00:00:26.084 --> 00:00:27.140
it right, no big deal.
