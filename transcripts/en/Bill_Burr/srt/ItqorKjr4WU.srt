1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:02,431
Hey,

2
00:00:02,431 --> 00:00:06,060
what's going on it's Bill Bird and his
time for the Monday morning podcast for

3
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:10,590
Monday, May 9th, 2016 what's going on?

4
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:15,150
How you go in there? Fuckos um,

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,380
oh, freckles laying on his back
trying to get rid of the cyanic.

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,190
It's much better.
Cyanic

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,600
oh,

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,530
cyanic a lot of people don't know that
was the original lyrics to Panama.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,940
You know, David Lee
wanted to say, you know,

10
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:40,920
Sciatica and Eddie wanted to, and Alex
wanted Panama and Michael Anthony,

11
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,530
he's like, come on guys know, except
he said it in a much higher voice.

12
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:45,210
Can we fucking just get along here?

13
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,180
And David ended up giving it to
the brothers and that's what it,

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,080
next thing you know, he was on
his own room, just a Gigolo.

15
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:57,150
So, um, yeah, my back's doing,
uh, it's doing much better.

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,270
Slowly but surely I've,

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,550
I've kind of found out it's going to
sort of work itself out if I just don't

18
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,140
have to sit on my fucking ass from
here to Jacksonville every other week.

19
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:10,020
But that's the life that I live.
You know,

20
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,270
this is the weirdest injury ever. Usually
if you're fucked up, sitting down,

21
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,370
you know, and resting is
a good thing. This thing,

22
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:21,150
I just got to kind of get a lay down.

23
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,630
I'm a mess. I'm taking that
fucking Ibuprofen. I don't
even, what the fuck it is?

24
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:30,480
Some anti inflammatory thing.

25
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,780
I'm stretching like a fucking NHL goalie,

26
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:37,900
trying to get everything all fucking
on done down there. But I don't know.

27
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:42,690
I don't know what's going on. I don't
know. But it is a, it is getting better.

28
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:43,560
But I um,

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,140
I flew all the way back today
from a Jacksonville, uh,

30
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,750
had a great time. And by the
way, here's, here's some, uh,

31
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,780
here's some advice for you when you're
out on the road and you're going to get a

32
00:01:56,971 --> 00:01:59,110
breakfast.
All right?

33
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,810
Unless you're in some mom and pop place
and he could see over the counter,

34
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,500
you can watch them making your food, which
I don't necessarily really like to do.

35
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,310
If you're going to order eggs,
don't ever order scrambled eggs.

36
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,610
I know what you're thinking. Why,
Bill? Why, why wouldn't you do that?

37
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,180
Cause they got a giant fucking VAT
that they've made scrambled eggs or the

38
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:24,280
fucking oatmeal of eggs. When
you go to restaurants, it's just,

39
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,530
it's like the trailer Zonea it's just
that as you're fucking, you know,

40
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,980
is your fucking eggs.
Especially like this morning,

41
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:34,950
the place where I went to Jacksonville,

42
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:38,190
he aided the Chili's restaurant in
Jacksonville, Florida. I know you guys.

43
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,310
You're jealous, right? Oh my
God. He gets to see everything.

44
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,890
So me and Forrest Shah who
murdered it all week, um,

45
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,830
we ordered the,
the whatever,

46
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:54,831
the American breakfast or something there
and your only option on the eggs was

47
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:59,470
scrambled. Okay. Now if
that's the fucking case,

48
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:02,320
that means they got a giant
VAT that was probably made,

49
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,270
I don't know how long ago,

50
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:08,020
whatever the health code violation
is plus five minutes, you know,

51
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,200
it's been sitting. So you get the
rubber fucking eggs and then bacon,

52
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,890
they just make a bunch of fucking bacon.
They got that sit to the side, you know,

53
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,600
and then they had their bullshit
hash browns, which, you know,

54
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,480
it was already all the whole
fucking thing was already made.

55
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:26,960
The only thing that really tasted
good was the biscuit. So, um,

56
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,010
if you ever at the airport,
you know,

57
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,090
or if you're going down to the hotel
lobby for their continental breakfast,

58
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,490
um, you always never order scrambled
eggs or the eggs over easy,

59
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,340
get an Omelet, you know, um,

60
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,520
do something like that where they just
aren't going to just have this shit

61
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:49,060
already made. Um, or you could
do the gross shit with the syrup,

62
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,300
but that's going to fuck your
whole day up. I feel, I mean,

63
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,250
not like I didn't order
a big salty breakfast,

64
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:57,070
but for some reason as salty breakfasts,
as bad as it is,

65
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,840
I can continue to function.

66
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,400
But if you get a waffle or pancakes of
French toast to that Shit, you know,

67
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,370
you might as well just have somebody
put you in a fucking sleeper hold co's

68
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,890
cause you're going down and you
go down early. Um, so anyway,

69
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,680
just a little travel tip for you there.
Um,

70
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:20,500
so anyways, you know, all this
past week, uh, the lovely Nia,

71
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,360
my beautiful wife was away and I was
telling you how immaculate I was keeping

72
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:29,380
this place fucking immaculate.
All right?

73
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,400
And um,
I literally like,

74
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:35,410
there was no trash in any of the barrels.

75
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,440
All the fucking pillows were all poofed
up look like it looks like a show room.

76
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,580
The living room, right. I made
the fucking bed, you know,

77
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:51,040
it was spotless. I wiped down my
side of the fucking sink, you know,

78
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,480
brush my teeth and all that shit spotless.
Okay.

79
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,740
I got a car washed and waxed, filled
it up with gas, all of that shit.

80
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,090
Everything was done. Went through
all the bills, got the junk mail,

81
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:06,970
all the bullshit, the
recycling, fucking everything.

82
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,770
I did everything right. So I'm thinking
she's gonna come home, you know,

83
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,690
cause I was leaving and
right as I was leaving,

84
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:15,790
she was coming home so he would
just missing each other. Right.

85
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:21,050
So I was thinking when she came
home she was going to be like,

86
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,370
like, Oh man, you know what? I might
have to bring her in for this shit.

87
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,520
You know what, I'm going to have to bring
her in for this. Hang on one second.

88
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:31,510
Hold on one second. All right. All right.

89
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:35,170
So I'm back here. So anyways, let me
keep setting this up. So my whole thing,

90
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,670
Nia,
was that when you came home,

91
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:44,140
this place was going to be absolutely
spotless. So you'd be like, oh my God,

92
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:46,060
that's so nice.

93
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:51,610
And then also you wouldn't feel like
I was just hopeless SAP without you.

94
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,090
Cause that always bugs me. Like
when women go like take, take,

95
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,010
did they fall apart without
us? Like I'm like, I've

96
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,120
never said that about you,

97
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:03,050
nor have I ever thought that I've
never come home after being away.

98
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,660
And the place has been in shambles
because you don't know what to do. Oh.

99
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,560
So I don't know why. Nothing. No.

100
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:12,320
But You keep holding on to some idea of,

101
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:17,321
of something that [inaudible] song
was talking to them like manspreading

102
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,990
well I keep, I gotta be on
the fucking couch. Um, no,

103
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:27,500
I don't know what you're so concerned
about that for like the place has never

104
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:30,740
been disgusting or gross
after I have gone away.

105
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:35,190
So I don't know why you have this
big hangup about, you know, I don't,

106
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:39,860
I don't get it. You know what? No, I don't
either. Well, I'm trying to think. We,

107
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,280
you fucking will actually let me work
through my shit. No. Okay. Sorry.

108
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,240
What jerk you're telling this
story and then you're out law.

109
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,990
So any adult, because I'm told what
happened. So I'm fucking waiting.

110
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:57,500
I'm on the road on the road again,
and I'm in fucking Hollywood, Florida,

111
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,960
right? And all I'm thinking is, oh,
the text message I'm going to get.

112
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:07,220
Oh, it looks so great. It's so wonderful
to come home to a nice clean house.

113
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:11,210
It looks like a fucking show room.
And what do I get?

114
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,610
I get a fucking videotape from you.

115
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,730
She's in the pantry now. Evidently
something went bad in the pantry. Okay.

116
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,530
Something didn't go bad in the pantry is
just some shit that's going down in the

117
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:27,590
pantry. There's some shit going down
to the pantry. So here's the deal.

118
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,460
I'm fucking on in the pantry.
Um, I'm here by myself.

119
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:34,520
I'm writing on the fucking show every
night until seven o'clock at night,

120
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,350
I'd come home, my brain is fried, I come
home, I order a pizza, I pour a scotch,

121
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,120
I eat,
and then I stare at the wall.

122
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,240
I go to bed and I get right back up and
we stare at the next draft in the next

123
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:49,370
script. That's been my life. So
I didn't in defense of me. Okay.

124
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,050
The one fucking place I didn't go into,
so there was the pantry.

125
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,850
Let's stop saying,
I don't like that word.

126
00:07:55,851 --> 00:08:00,030
I just realized Pantry pantry stuff saying
I don't play Shit. It just, it's uh,

127
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:00,620
I don't know.

128
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,640
It's too close to panties in this food
and I don't like when food and sex are

129
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:09,140
combined. Okay. Now I know you
don't like that you pantry here. Oh,

130
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:12,560
that nine and a half weeks when it's
fucking her with all the groceries on her

131
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:18,230
was like either eat or fuck,
not together,

132
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,250
you know. So anyways, um,

133
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:27,950
so she sends me this
video, she's like, Bebe,

134
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,580
how did you not see this?
Right.

135
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,230
It just starts fucking giving me all this
shit. I'm like, what the fuck? All right.

136
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:42,140
And she pans up to the top of the fucking
ceiling and there was, what was it?

137
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,240
There's the larvae. Larvae.
Little, yeah, little moths. Modal.

138
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,500
What? Go. It's an inside joke.
Oh, go ahead. And inside with who?

139
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,870
With the fucking people
listening to when I,

140
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:00,600
no. Yeah, there's sort of larvae.
There's, there's mods and stuff.

141
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:01,770
Because some,

142
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,060
like if there's flour that's been
opened and it's not sealed up properly,

143
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:07,710
or grains or cereal,

144
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,220
they'll create little mom's like
if you have fruit out for too long,

145
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:14,190
it'll make fruit flies. So that was
what was happening. Fruit flies.

146
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,680
It attracts them. No, it
creates them from that.

147
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,650
I was just talking the Terminex guy
about it. They just, they, I don't know.

148
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:23,310
Flies come from apples. Listened. Yeah.

149
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:24,900
Like if you have fruit and stuff out to

150
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,550
[inaudible] and then fucking nine months
later you get a fruit fly. You're like,

151
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,380
there's no warm in there that's making
it happen. No, that's not what I mean.

152
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,950
It's not a fruit having sex. She said,
well, if that's what you're saying,

153
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:41,310
you're saying the constant. I'm
saying, I listened. I don't know.

154
00:09:41,311 --> 00:09:42,960
I'm not a fucking term next person.

155
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,660
But he was telling me
that when it's dirty mobs,

156
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,380
fuck on those apples out in the orchard
now and they plant their seed in there

157
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:53,250
and then it comes out like alien. Okay,
bill, there's not any fruit in the pantry.

158
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:57,890
Okay, so we have, we have grains and he's
just staring at your crush right now.

159
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:03,270
It's so comfortable though.
My lower back is so comfortable right now.

160
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:07,200
Oh, you know what, I figured out a thing
to get for you for that. But anyway,

161
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,041
we'll get back to that.

162
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:12,320
But if you have grains and cereals out
exposed and like this little closed

163
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:13,830
environment where it gets warm,

164
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,990
it produces these larvae and
little flies and mobs and shit.

165
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,860
So that's what the guy just told me.
He's not saying it right.

166
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,990
Well how are you saying it?
Are you saying?

167
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:29,280
I'm saying please tell me how you explain
things and how clear it is when you

168
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:34,260
explain things.
What I would say is like,

169
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,500
you know if you're having a
cookout and you leave food out,

170
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,640
all of a sudden flies or an ant show up,
but they don't come from the food.

171
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,810
That's what he told me. I'll
be, you keep saying they,

172
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,340
they come in from the apples
and it's confusing me.

173
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,360
You said it came from animals.
I said nothing about

174
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,490
ample line. This one up
though from apples. I would
never say it came from you.

175
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,590
The start throwing apples into the mix.

176
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:05,330
I was trying to explain to you
about grains and shit. You're right.

177
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,910
Maybe I was saying it's like
fruit flies suck in school.

178
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:10,980
I can't even hear what you're
saying because you don't listen.

179
00:11:10,981 --> 00:11:13,740
That's why you got damn add.
You don't listen.

180
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,580
You don't listen and you start saying
things and you said them and then you

181
00:11:17,581 --> 00:11:18,870
distribute them to the other person.

182
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,580
Like it's so confusing to talk to you
sometimes because you don't live it so

183
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,310
fucking hard.
It is hard.

184
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,050
How about we were just
watching the Simpsons and you
watch the entire episode in

185
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:31,260
midway through it. You were like, why
is that happened hanging? I'm like,

186
00:11:31,261 --> 00:11:32,140
where did the blue snake,

187
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,720
like a major plot point that hadn't
been explained not even five minutes

188
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:39,270
earlier, but you don't pay
attention to, how about this?

189
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:43,560
How about my fucking back is out and I
was in Jacksonville, Florida this morning.

190
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,710
How about that? What does that have to do
with anything that we're talking about?

191
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:51,330
Well, maybe I'm a little fucking, you
know, not focusing on a fucking cartoon.

192
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,030
Okay.
You're

193
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,550
such a baby when you traveled
to whenever you travel,

194
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:01,930
you fucking for like one day like,
oh my God, I do know how you do this.

195
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:05,260
And then it goes right out your
fucking head. And then the next,

196
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,440
next time I coming back off the
road, you look, oh, let's go. Well,

197
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:13,060
you know Susie Fricker sees having a
fucking who hot down the fucking street.

198
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:15,400
You want to go to that? When
I say no, you flip out at me.

199
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,710
I don't know what you're talking about.

200
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,320
Should do you know exactly when you know
who she is to see the frigging, oh yeah,

201
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,240
he's that bright thing.
All right, so whatever.

202
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:32,200
So she comes home and evidently there's
some sort of bug horror movie and you

203
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:36,880
know how, what infestation infestation
and you know how the ladies react.

204
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,850
They don't like insects.
You know what I mean?

205
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:44,970
They don't like insects the way men don't
like cats hate those fucking things.

206
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,940
There's nothing better than a cool cat.

207
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:53,600
I like a cool cat that chills and
lays in the fucking sun. Yeah.

208
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,170
You know I liked their own new prison
up on you. Yeah, I don't like that. I'm,

209
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,480
when they're practicing
killing it like that,

210
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,550
you just look over and they're staring
at you from the corner now than they stop

211
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:05,770
and try and play it off. I
don't like, I don't like that.

212
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:10,450
They stand on your chest in the morning,
waking you up.

213
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:12,940
I don't like this shit in a box
and then you got to pick it up.

214
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:17,170
It's just too much. It's too
much. Cleo. Shit's just outside.

215
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,300
But we still got to pick it
up. I know, but I don't have
to. It's not in the house.

216
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,370
I mean, if you're going to shit
in the house, go in the toilet.

217
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,840
I think some people can train their cats
to shit in the toilet. I don't know how,

218
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:35,410
but, well, I can tell you how they can't
communicate with other human beings.

219
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,520
So they put all their energy into yeah,
like they, they got like that gift.

220
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:41,280
They have like a like uh,
Asperger's,

221
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:47,110
Asperger's with cat, some sort of, um,

222
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,810
what's that thing that always talking
about nowadays? Autism, autism,

223
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,100
autistic with people, but okay.
They can communicate with cats.

224
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,020
What the play an instrument
to front up with.

225
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,870
No one in his diagnosis of the
mental illnesses. It's just,

226
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,730
they'll just stop right there,
please.

227
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,050
He's talking about when are you going
to get angry tweets. I'm not marking,

228
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,090
marking any of that.
I'm making fun of people that put,

229
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:17,230
you can't fucking say anything anymore.
Everybody gets all worried. Oh, I know.

230
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,330
I do benefits for all of those things.

231
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:24,040
All of those things I know about
my free fucking time. All in black.

232
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,800
Oh Jesus Christ.

233
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:35,740
I remember when things were
funny. Oh, it was so simple.

234
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:39,900
Back in the day where you get was you
could just say shingles and one every

235
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,050
fucking jerk off. Didn't have some way
they can just spout about fucking annoyed.

236
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:44,650
They are,

237
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,770
but everything else is fine as long
as it doesn't come around to my world.

238
00:14:47,771 --> 00:14:51,130
Can I just ask what this situation
is here with the Ziploc bag?

239
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,140
What about it and how you're
keeping your equipment stored? Yeah.

240
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,930
Bill's got this cord and the little foamy
part that you put on the windscreen,

241
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:03,990
the wind screen and a couple of batteries
and an old zip lock bag that's ripped

242
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,670
and just doesn't even zip anymore.
Right.

243
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:12,850
So I'm just wondering why
basically because it's still
holds the things and if I

244
00:15:16,341 --> 00:15:17,630
just throw that thing out,

245
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,810
another one's going to break and then
that thing right there is probably going

246
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,800
to end up on the nose of a porpoise
and it's not gonna be able to eat.

247
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,100
It's going to die because everything
ends up in the ocean. Yeah. You know,

248
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,080
they say that put letter in its place.

249
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,530
It's like the second eldest shit that you
throw out the saying you don't pollute.

250
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:36,910
We all pollute. It's just some of us
do take this on the road with you.

251
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,650
It's not like I was having
an idea that good. I mean,

252
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,500
well I take that on the road that you're
just going to be like babbling about

253
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:45,410
something that you don't really
know about us at all. I mean,

254
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:49,490
I don't really flip the chart anything.
Uh,

255
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,950
so you take this on the
road with you? Yes. Alright.

256
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,990
Well as I could maybe get you
a nice, never had a problem
leather Satchel. Really?

257
00:15:56,991 --> 00:15:59,810
You got a skin of fucking
cow because I already,

258
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,560
I already have one that'll last longer
than putting it in this ridiculous thing

259
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,240
that's never going to biodegrade.

260
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,790
What's this bad think and
that they won't biodegrade.

261
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:13,130
Other thing will be here somewhere in
the dirt somewhere hundreds of fucking

262
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:17,840
years after we're gone saying you can
have a nice way to carry your things that

263
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:22,820
doesn't look like you know the bags
that we used to use for sandwiches.

264
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,670
What is your fascination
with just like buying shit?

265
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,960
What do you mean fascination with buying
ships session? I mean, look at this,

266
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:30,471
look at this,

267
00:16:30,471 --> 00:16:33,370
that you're carrying this thing and I
really wish you guys could see the Ziploc

268
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,270
bag right now. It's, it's a mess.

269
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,890
A man of your stature should not be
carrying around your podcast equipment and

270
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:44,080
an oil as well. What did you say? Ziploc
bag. A man of my stature. Fuck it.

271
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:47,940
Two seconds ago I was a fucking
moron. But now, now cause you

272
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,100
to shave from naenae.
So what do you like tonight?

273
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:04,290
Who We got
Saint Louis Blues meet me in St Louis.

274
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,870
Louis v versus to the Dallas Stars.
Formerly the Minnesota North Stars.

275
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,230
Are these hockey teams? Yes they are. Oh,

276
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:17,310
if they're not like the kings or
the a Bruins, I don't really know.

277
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,430
Oh yeah. What are your feelings
about the kings and the Bruins? Well,

278
00:17:23,431 --> 00:17:26,430
if it came down to it, I would be a
Bruins fan because I'm from Boston.

279
00:17:26,431 --> 00:17:29,280
So you just say no, you're going to root
for yeah, but the other, the rest of them,

280
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:33,300
I don't know. Those are my two. What do
you like? I like boltings but I just,

281
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,470
I started pulling for the blues because
the blues had been in the league since

282
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:43,110
1964. Who's kidding? Who cause the Bruins
didn't make the playoffs. So I was like,

283
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,471
all right,

284
00:17:43,471 --> 00:17:47,040
I got to pick somebody and I'm not
going to jump on the Black Cox and Kings

285
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:50,090
bandwagon because they were always in it.
So I'm going to for sworn under dog.

286
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,150
And I was like,
well the blues,

287
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,350
they've been around since 1967
so the Minnesota north stars,

288
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:57,510
but the people in Dallas
haven't been rooting that long,

289
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:01,350
but I really liked the players and
shit. I like, I like Dallas but I, I've,

290
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:03,560
I've ever been written for um,
a babbling open.

291
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,240
You're looking a little
bit. Yeah. St Louis. They're
relaxed. They're going to be a,

292
00:18:07,241 --> 00:18:10,110
a kings game that we can go to
cause I really enjoy going to that.

293
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,520
Those two kings games we went to. Yeah.
That they got bounced out. That done.

294
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,350
What do you mean bounced out there? Uh,
they got beat by the San Jose Sharks. Oh,

295
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:22,530
so they're not in it. It's
over. It's over for them.

296
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,880
The Stanley Cup playoffs. There you go.
They got, they lost in the first round.

297
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:31,030
What about the breweries? We didn't
make it. We were, oh well then I don't,

298
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,430
we overt, well we, it

299
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,460
sheaves throughout the year because at
least as far as I was concerned about

300
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,690
guided we'll do,
fuck am I going,

301
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:41,990
I mean with the players that we
had and every that we got rid of,

302
00:18:41,991 --> 00:18:44,990
I thought we were just gonna be trying
to figure out who the fuck everybody was

303
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:48,680
for half the season. And then
maybe, you know, I dunno.

304
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,160
What about the Toronto Blue Jays and
what happened was we will going to be

305
00:18:52,161 --> 00:18:54,470
making the playoffs and
everybody's all bunched together.

306
00:18:54,471 --> 00:18:55,730
We look at fucking third seat.

307
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,950
Then we'd had a west coast trip and
we got to fucking asses kicked and a,

308
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:05,140
it all went away and a flyer and
red wings fans talk shit about,

309
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,000
you know how high he didn't
make the playoffs and they
both got the right there.

310
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:10,650
Fred in the first fucking
round. So I enjoyed that. Okay,

311
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,630
well that's Ronald [inaudible]

312
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,930
Blue Jays. Is that a, is that a
hockey team? Nope, that's baseball.

313
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,060
Oh the Toronto Maple leafs.

314
00:19:17,061 --> 00:19:20,030
The amount of the maple leafs got the
first pick in the draft of the raptors.

315
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:24,920
Are they have a hockey team?
Nope. Where they basketball team.

316
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:28,600
Oh Jesus keeps, keeps saying this
shit. You know. And then I'll do you,

317
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,580
you pick something else that I don't know
anything about. We'll see who's more.

318
00:19:31,581 --> 00:19:34,700
Right. Um, what do you went
to that you know about?

319
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:39,110
Did I just say that as a question?
What are you going to let you know about?

320
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:45,680
I don't know. Fashion. Okay, go ahead. Um,

321
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:51,980
oh Jesus. What's the name of the
guy who makes fun of fat people?

322
00:19:51,981 --> 00:19:54,140
He used to be fat.
Ah.

323
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,770
Is that, that's, that's not Alexander
Wang is it? No. Is it Michael Richards?

324
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,890
Is it Michael?
A Michael Kors?

325
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,580
No, he's German. Is it Paul Mitchell.

326
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,590
And he is the head of a very,

327
00:20:07,591 --> 00:20:09,960
very like the most famous
fashion house in the world.

328
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:14,280
It's not for Saatchi cause
he got shot by that guy. Yes.

329
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,720
No, it's not the Chanel cause that
was a chick and she's dead. Right.

330
00:20:18,721 --> 00:20:22,740
But she has an apartment in Paris that
you can go into if you're skinny enough.

331
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:26,520
Right. But you're, you're closed.
You're getting there. I Chanel is right.

332
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,110
Chanel's the right fashion house.

333
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:33,970
A person who you're talking about is that
the cad creative director for Chanel?

334
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,160
He looks like a war criminal. Right?
He's chairman. I'll say you go

335
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:46,300
and why were they war criminals?
Because they lost,

336
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:52,030
we would had just as many people going
to fucking Nuremberg. We really would've.

337
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,970
Okay. Dresden, Karl Lagerfeld. Ah, fuck.

338
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:02,230
I remember when we saw him and the last
time we were embarrassed in the cab and

339
00:21:02,231 --> 00:21:06,940
I started freaking out because I saw Carl
walking down the street in Paris and I

340
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:08,440
thought he was a cool looking dude,
man.

341
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,440
He's a vampire looking through vampire
war from old queen looking dude.

342
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:18,370
Yeah, pretty much. That's him.
Name is sports team. Go ahead.

343
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,720
Um, I'll name one of you. Tell me what
it is. They are the yellow jackets.

344
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,050
Somebody but did not make that up.
Yellow check.

345
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:31,060
I feel like that was a high school. I
feel like that was a fucking fusion band.

346
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,480
Um, what about no, no.

347
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:37,510
It wasn't like wake forest or something
that's a college basketball team or some

348
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,720
, some sort of jackets. Uh,

349
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,750
the Grizzlies Grizzlies to rotten.
No,

350
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:49,000
Michigan at some place cold that
would have grizzly bears. Right.

351
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:52,120
So it's not going to be a southern
Julian good guests. But they moved.

352
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,630
They were initially
initially embed. Oh, okay.

353
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,120
It's a Midwestern kind of thing.

354
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:02,350
They were initially in Vancouver and
then they went to another in Memphis. Oh,

355
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:03,300
that says the Memphis grades.

356
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,970
And for some dumb reason they kept the
name kind of like when the New Orleans

357
00:22:06,971 --> 00:22:10,990
jazz moved to Utah,
the widest fucking place ever taught jazz.

358
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,770
Like you'll never see any
jazz or hear any jazz in Utah?

359
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,680
I wouldn't think so.

360
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:24,640
No Jazz Clubs and Utah.
It's like the New Orleans Mormons,

361
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:31,050
New Orleans Morgan. I like
that name better. All right,

362
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:35,830
well we enjoyed you hear neo. Oh, I'm
done. I don't know. Your phone's ringing.

363
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,970
Oh God. Oh look at us. I know.

364
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:43,990
I get a call her back.
Um, are you done with me?

365
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,950
Are you wrapping up the podcast?
Did you answer questions? No,

366
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:50,500
but you can come back for that.
I actually kind of tired,

367
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:53,470
so I think I'm going to leave oh down.
Nice reversal.

368
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,930
I kicked you off and then you're
like, no, let me come back.

369
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:58,960
And then you tell me to go fuck
myself. You know what? I I enjoy that.

370
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,780
I respect that. So I just came on to
tell the larvae, larvae and then leaving

371
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,440
and get out of here so I can straighten
out my legs and fucking give my,

372
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,870
I feel like Kennedy right now.

373
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:17,680
Are you even able to do a podcast
in the upright position anymore? Um,

374
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,090
this is why I married you with.

375
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,050
This is the type of compassion
that I've come to expect from you.

376
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:28,690
You're such a fucking baby. I, I tough
my way through all of this shit. I never,

377
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:32,200
I never see doctors. I don't take
medicine. That's cause you're dumb.

378
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,440
You're dumb. Well, it's because I grew
up so people don't go to the hospital.

379
00:23:38,441 --> 00:23:41,380
They don't go to doctors. They will
take medicine. No, you're dumb.

380
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,780
We have advances in our society,
but I'm tougher than you.

381
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:50,210
You're a baby. So fine. Be Tough. All
you want, but like be smart and tough.

382
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,550
Go to the doctor if you're so tough.

383
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,450
Go to the doctor and hear what they
have to stay after school special. Yeah,

384
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:56,781
I will.

385
00:23:56,781 --> 00:24:00,590
I'm getting their beats stuff by going
to the doctor and hearing what they have

386
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:05,160
to say. That's real toughness. That's real
talk. That's real socks on. All right.

387
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,950
I'm out of here.
Nini out.

388
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,980
I'm sorry I had to ah,
I enjoyed when you come out.

389
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:17,870
I like miss you baby. Huh? Don't say Huh?

390
00:24:17,871 --> 00:24:20,770
You heard me listen, I went out. You know.

391
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,750
You know why I don't go to fucking
doctors and all that shit. Why?

392
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:27,410
Because doctors, they practiced
medicine. They practice on you.

393
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,060
They don't have shit down.
And one of the,

394
00:24:29,061 --> 00:24:31,700
one of the things that they still
don't know a lot about this,

395
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,920
but it's not like they don't
mean it like they're practicing.

396
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:36,260
Like you sit in here practicing drums,
you know,

397
00:24:36,261 --> 00:24:39,170
that's not the same thing they went
to medical school. I understand that.

398
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:42,200
So why are you like taking that word?
So literally,

399
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:46,010
have you ever seen Lars Ulrich
played life and he practices,

400
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:50,220
he fucks up all the time with
Metallica. Oh my God, Nia.

401
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,760
I'm telling you,
if that's what it means,

402
00:24:52,761 --> 00:24:55,520
you practice medicine and then
you learn off other people.

403
00:24:55,521 --> 00:24:57,530
Just look how much better
hair plugs have gotten.

404
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,080
Look how much better they get
in with the fucking, you know,

405
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,060
cutting part of your eye out
and then you can see better.

406
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:05,870
You told me you were going to go to a
doctor to figure out what was happening

407
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:09,650
with your leg. Okay. So I know, I know,

408
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:14,210
I know you think you know what it is,
but can you please go to a doctor?

409
00:25:14,211 --> 00:25:17,540
And so it doesn't become a chronic
issue. And then when you're, you know,

410
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:20,780
50 which is, can I, can I finish?

411
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,790
Can I finish Kathy? You're going
to have some sort of handle on it.

412
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:30,200
He had one of the things that they
know the least about is the back. Okay.

413
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:33,650
And I'm just, I'm just not going to
just go to a fucking chiropractor.

414
00:25:33,651 --> 00:25:37,910
I'm going to find somebody you know
who has a good reputation of not just

415
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:42,770
fucking opening people up like a fire.
It isn't fine cause I wasn't done talking.

416
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:46,190
You always jump in because
you're suggesting that I
just want you to go to some

417
00:25:46,191 --> 00:25:50,690
random ass clinic. I was just
joking around. I was joking around.

418
00:25:50,691 --> 00:25:53,030
I'm holding you to this because
you said you were going to do it.

419
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:57,620
So are you going to do it?
Um,

420
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,510
I don't know. Film pretty good.
I don't like going like this.

421
00:26:02,511 --> 00:26:04,910
I don't like going to the doctor the way.
I'd only go into the fucking mall.

422
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,691
I just,

423
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:09,050
the whole idea going over there and
parking and just the whole fucking thing.

424
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:13,160
I know. I need to fill the shower. Make
sure you show up 15 minutes before.

425
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,840
Oh yeah. Y'All be there. See that? I know,

426
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:21,140
but once it's done, it's done. And you
need all my first show in Hollywood,

427
00:26:21,141 --> 00:26:24,740
Florida. There was a couple
of ladies in the front row.

428
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:29,930
Uh, we'll asking if you were there
because they needed relationship advice.

429
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:34,700
Oh yeah. You know, they were like,
how come we don't have boyfriends?

430
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,280
No, they didn't say this.
That's what they said.

431
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,760
Someone actually wrote me and asked me
about you proposing and actually that's

432
00:26:43,801 --> 00:26:44,010
what I

433
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,530
wanted to do.
I wanted to talk about this email I got.

434
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:47,950
Should we do it today or
should we do it though?

435
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,280
Fuck his writing you and how
the fuck are they writing you?

436
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,420
Because they read Mike because of
my website, tender headed films.com.

437
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,820
So they were writing me because remember
I was going to do a podcast all those

438
00:26:59,821 --> 00:27:03,210
years ago and then I just
never did it. Um, no,

439
00:27:03,211 --> 00:27:08,211
they wrote this whole thing about how did
you get a guy who was so anti marriage

440
00:27:08,221 --> 00:27:12,960
to propose and all that kind of stuff
and how did it happen? And did I propose?

441
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:17,670
No, I did not propose. But he'll
propose to me. Uh, and all that stuff.

442
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,720
It was interesting. I didn't
read, I didn't, excuse me.

443
00:27:21,721 --> 00:27:25,860
I wore him down. No, no. See this
is why we have to talk about it.

444
00:27:25,861 --> 00:27:29,170
Cause that's some bullshit. Oh
wait, even put that out there joke.

445
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,760
Where you fucking down.
You love me. You missed me.

446
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:36,020
You told your Lar Bay story. Now,
the one thing about Showpad is,

447
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:40,290
is you leave them wanting more to
get your fucking cute ass outta here.

448
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,950
All right, goodbye. I want to
talk about that story though.

449
00:27:42,951 --> 00:27:44,930
I want to answer things in

450
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:49,760
life. Bait it. Goodbye. Hit the road jack.

451
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,800
Don't you come back? No,
no, no, no. Hit the road.

452
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,260
Deni yeah,
so that's what I came up to.

453
00:27:57,261 --> 00:28:01,250
She fucking shows me this big goddamn
thing about all the fucking, I mean,

454
00:28:01,251 --> 00:28:02,780
granted them as much
as I'm going to bitch.

455
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,400
It was a bunch of fucking larvae.
I swear to God.

456
00:28:07,401 --> 00:28:12,401
She says that comes from apples in flowers
and flower and flower being left out

457
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,190
in grains. What up? You know, if you
agree with her, you can go fuck yourself.

458
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,030
How about that? All right, let's read a
little advertising here for this week,

459
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:24,950
shall we? Oh my goodness.
MVMT watches, you know,

460
00:28:24,951 --> 00:28:27,590
it's been a few weeks now.
Um,

461
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,320
since they started advertising movement,

462
00:28:30,321 --> 00:28:34,840
watches boxes and Oh my God,
what the f,

463
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,030
I don't even understand this copy.
As promised,

464
00:28:38,031 --> 00:28:43,031
the quality of these watches are there
for an awesome price in the style

465
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:44,100
department.

466
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:49,040
The compliments that you'll get wearing
these things are really unbelievable.

467
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,810
You know what I'm doing?
I gotta start this over again.

468
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:58,310
This is what I'm doing is they keep
fucking having me say that I cracked open

469
00:28:58,311 --> 00:29:03,311
these boxes and I'm fucking where in one
right now and I'm not sort of fucks up

470
00:29:03,831 --> 00:29:07,430
all the copy. All right. I
will read what you write,

471
00:29:07,431 --> 00:29:10,730
but I'm not going to start lying saying
I have on your fucking underwear.

472
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:15,170
Your watch is when I don't listen these.
All right, let me start over again.

473
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,420
So they don't hear that
part cause they don't,

474
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,560
they don't wanna listen that fuck apart.
They just listened to the read.

475
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:21,590
All right?

476
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:26,280
Unless one of you cuts rats me out on
Twitter like the fucking j Edgar Hoover's,

477
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,990
everybody's acting like nowadays.
All right. MVMT watches.

478
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,910
If you haven't had a chance to experience
how a movement watch fits around your

479
00:29:34,911 --> 00:29:36,780
wrist,
well God dammit.

480
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:40,760
This is your chance movement
watches start at just 95

481
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,590
seat when movement cut out the middle
man with huge big brand markups,

482
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:50,020
the price of a stylist watch finally
got affordable. Imagine that.

483
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:54,370
Or Watch with department store quality
for a fraction of the price movement has

484
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:57,430
grown organically purely
by supporters like you.

485
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,930
So join there more than 1 million social
media followers and get a movement

491
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,570
What is it about buying a mattress
that leaves you feeling violated?

492
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,700
This, that's not a good word
to use with a mattress. Um,

493
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,010
is it the pushy salespeople,

494
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,150
the fake presidents' Day
sales or the fact you know,

495
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:39,610
you'll regret what you bought.
Um,

496
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,760
as you do the walk of shame out of the
mattress store cause you get violated.

Well, what kind of sex offender is
selling you? Your sheets Hallux. He looks,

That's almost three months. So over
three months, no questions asked.

514
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:50,140
he looks sleep.com/ [inaudible] one
of those pronunciations is right.

515
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:54,520
All right. Dollar Shave
club, everybody, all my God.

516
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,490
Look who's back.
Dollar Shave Club,

517
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:01,720
dollar shave club.com as a special
offer for new members who join today,

518
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:06,820
you'll get a free month of the executive
razor when you buy a tube of Dr

519
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:10,510
Carver's shave butter. I swear to
God, it used to be easy shave butter.

520
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:15,130
Um, this is the first time they've ever
done something like this and once you try

521
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:19,810
dollar shave club.com, you'll become a
proud member like millions of others.

522
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:24,040
One reason is because they deliver amazing
rate as razors right to your door for

523
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:27,010
a third of the price of what the
greedy razor corporations charge.

524
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,080
That means when you
joined dollar Shave Club,

525
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:33,220
you can afford to shave with a
fresh blade anytime you want,

526
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,050
which feels fantastic.

527
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,830
You'll get a first class shave when you
use the executive blade hurting your

528
00:32:39,831 --> 00:32:40,250
wallet.

529
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:45,250
Another reason is that Dr Kvcc shape
by using it with the executive razor,

530
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,270
the blade just glides gently
for the smoothest shave ever.

531
00:32:50,271 --> 00:32:53,510
Dr Carver's shave butter isn't
your average shave cream.

532
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,200
It's a unique conditioning formula

get the executive razor for absolutely
free. They've never done this before.

536
00:33:07,761 --> 00:33:11,870
Take advantage of it or you'll regret it
for the rest of your life and it's only

537
00:33:11,871 --> 00:33:13,380

560
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:41,630
And with that it's over.
Come on, come on now. Delete.

561
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,230
Close the window and onto
the rest of the bullshit. Um,

562
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,470
I had the worst fucking keeps a good guy,

563
00:34:48,471 --> 00:34:52,280
but I had a bad cab driver on the
way back from the fucking airport.

564
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,073
Use One of those.

565
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:58,460
I'm one of those people that can't
keep a consistent speed, you know,

566
00:34:58,461 --> 00:34:59,660
so you make your car sick.

567
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,620
And what was hilarious was he was driving
a Prius and the way he was driving

568
00:35:03,621 --> 00:35:06,010
this thing, I would be surprised
if he was getting eight gallons,

569
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,510
eight miles per gallon.
He just kept doing that.

570
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,690
Eh,

571
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,190
just stomp and glide. Um, I,

572
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:20,680
I just amaze me some people like how they
cannot hear, you can't hear the engine,

573
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,940
you know, he can't hear the fucking
rpms going through the roof.

574
00:35:24,941 --> 00:35:27,430
You don't understand that is wasting fuel.
I know.

575
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,890
You know how bad those
cabbies get fucked over.

576
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,070
You think that he would be
concerned about something?

577
00:35:33,071 --> 00:35:35,140
You think if you drove
for a fucking living,

578
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,830
you'd have an understanding
of how fucking works.

579
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,083
MMM.

580
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,220
It was so fucking annoying.
It actually,

581
00:35:43,221 --> 00:35:47,420
it just kind of just became funny and
he was a really nice guy. But, um,

582
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,950
I know some people like, it's almost like,
it's like the driving with a fake foot,

583
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,730
you know, or a mechanical foot like
the prototype and it, you know,

584
00:35:55,731 --> 00:35:58,790
it's either on or off. There's no, um,

585
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:03,140
consistency of speed. This guy,
he just kept going up to like 65,

586
00:36:03,141 --> 00:36:07,550
70 miles an hour and then glide
back down to like, you know, 52.

587
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,920
Of course I'm looking at my fucking
phone, so I'm starting to get six. Yeah.

588
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:13,790
You know, it was, it was
a shit show and absolute,

589
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:15,020
yeah.

590
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:18,470
Fucking shit show. Oh, you know,
when I went to Florida, by the way,

591
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,560
I landed in Miami,
every time I land into Miami,

592
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,710
I'll you immediately start seeing all
these beautiful women and every time I go

593
00:36:24,711 --> 00:36:26,990
there,
I just hear Tony Montana's voice going.

594
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:30,240
The city is like one big
pussy waiting to get fucked.

595
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,673
MMM.

596
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,250
And I was trying to bait me into those
two women that was sitting in the front

597
00:36:36,251 --> 00:36:39,730
row to get into that fucking conversation.
Um,

598
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,250
but she did buy the bait. She didn't
take the bait cause they were like,

599
00:36:45,251 --> 00:36:49,660
why don't we have boyfriends? You know
and you should have seen him cause you,

600
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,410
I dunno cause you guys are
you not wearing any clothes

601
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,360
that be the one tag is
beautiful as you are.

602
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,490
No guy wants to put up with that.

603
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:04,440
You got to walk down the street
like some over protective dog.

604
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:06,910
I keeping everybody away.
Everybody's

605
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:09,010
okay.

606
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,780
Well one of them was
barely wearing a shirt.

607
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:15,550
Granted I wasn't complaining for where
I was standing front but I mean it just

608
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,630
seems kind of obvious. You
know what I mean? You got it.

609
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:22,690
You got to cover up the goods a little
bit. I mean I would say that to Madonna.

610
00:37:22,691 --> 00:37:24,520
I don't know if she's
currently dating 70 right now,

611
00:37:24,521 --> 00:37:28,720
but Madonna is in fucking unbelievable
shape for her age and if she would just

612
00:37:28,721 --> 00:37:31,330
put on something elegant,
you know what I mean?

613
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:35,050
Instead of rolling around with half
a fucking pussy lip hanging out.

614
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,560
I don't know why she does that.
She said something late, you know,

615
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:41,740
as she did yet another thing are all
fucking career has been like one big

616
00:37:41,741 --> 00:37:45,580
publicity stunt after another. You
know, I'm wearing a wedding dress,

617
00:37:45,581 --> 00:37:49,030
but I'm fingering myself at the
fucking award show. Right. You know,

618
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,790
right from there. And
then, oh, it's Jesus,

619
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:54,700
but he's African American and
now I'm trying to fuck them.

620
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,400
It's just paint by numbers.
Shock.

621
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:02,100
And what's funny is I actually like
our music borderline feel like,

622
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,690
uh, just keep, you know, that's actually,

623
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:11,620
I threw out my back doing
that Molly Ringwald dance. Um,

624
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:15,850
anyways, yeah. And then she
goes on Letterman. She says,

625
00:38:15,851 --> 00:38:17,770
fuck 50,000 times.

626
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:22,090
She does stand up on the tonight show
was just one big fucking thing after

627
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:22,291
another.

628
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:26,710
I saw her latest one was she showed up
to a movie theater and I move out movie

629
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,380
premiere or whatever the fuck she, I
don't know who the fuck knows what it was,

630
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,190
you know,

631
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:34,510
some fundraiser to get toothbrushes
to some fucking gods for sacred place.

632
00:38:34,511 --> 00:38:39,370
So she shows and she literally has her
titties in her ass out like a see through

633
00:38:39,371 --> 00:38:42,910
dress. And she of course says, well,

634
00:38:42,911 --> 00:38:47,300
what I'm doing is I'm challenging
the boundaries and um, of,

635
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,530
you know, of course women, you
know, got to drag all that bullshit.

636
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,060
And then it's like, no, you're 57. Okay.
Nobody wants to look at that. Okay.

637
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:58,000
Like it my age,
I am,

638
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,820
I am well into put on
a fucking sport coat.

639
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:07,860
Nobody wants to see it. It's just a,
yeah, you're not pushing any boundaries.

640
00:39:07,861 --> 00:39:12,300
It's just, it's a, a, you know, you have
it a little bit of a midlife prices.

641
00:39:12,301 --> 00:39:15,270
I think she looks fucking great, but she
looked way better if she fucking just,

642
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:19,920
you know, you know, put on,
split out a fucking dress,

643
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,980
fucking adore. I Dunno. But then again,

644
00:39:22,981 --> 00:39:26,070
I saw Iggy pop and he
wasn't wearing a shirt,

645
00:39:26,071 --> 00:39:28,110
but I don't find guys
aren't like attractive.

646
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,650
It was just sort of
funny to me that funny.

647
00:39:31,651 --> 00:39:36,630
I just was just him not giving a fuck.
So I guess if she just said, look,

648
00:39:36,631 --> 00:39:41,430
I don't give a fuck. I just felt like
Kevin my ass and titties hanging out.

649
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,680
I wouldn't have a problem with that.

650
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:48,360
But the fact that she's sitting there
trying to say that. No, no. Wait a minute.

651
00:39:48,361 --> 00:39:52,410
I think she might be right.
Maybe she is right.

652
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,840
Hey, come here. You gotta
answer this question.

653
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,873
Okay.

654
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:05,580
There's a chance I might be common like
they don't understand that daughter

655
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,230
till she comes here. I'll sing a sing
some of my favorite songs by her.

656
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:17,240
A bad boy.
Bad girl home by six.

657
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,470
Hey, pick up the mic. I
got a question for you

658
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,480
now you want me back?

659
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:27,040
Yup. That's like that street joke
I told you. Right? Watch one.

660
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:28,800
I heard Jackie the joke mental.

661
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:35,040
The one about the gorilla. No,
the one with the fucking cause.

662
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:35,790
I like that one.

663
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:38,800
The married guys walking out of the
house and his wife's yelling at him.

664
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,640
Don't get the fuck Outta here. Get the
fuck out. I never want to see you again.

665
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,270
So he's walking away and she goes,
I hope he had died a long, slow,

666
00:40:48,271 --> 00:40:51,420
miserable death. And he turns around,
he goes out, what now you want me back?

667
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:56,730
That's stupid. That's a stupid joke. It
just reminded me of that. Anyway, school,

668
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,070
I could have told it better,
but I got, I just got off plank.

669
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:03,660
Jackie jumped in and tell us a way better.
Um, all right, so my daughter recently

670
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,390
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

671
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:11,920
she showed up at some fucking,
you know, raise awareness thing.

672
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,233
I don't know what it was.

673
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:18,580
It was a carpet she showed up and she
had a butt cheeks out in a titties out.

674
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:22,390
Okay. This was the met ball that
happens every year in New York City.

675
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:23,890
And that's for the mets.

676
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:29,580
Yes, it is. Go math, but it's
just for one of them. I know.

677
00:41:29,581 --> 00:41:32,610
It's for the fucking
museum. Yes. The hacky date.

678
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,560
Every person in their twenties
goes on in New York and Madonna,

679
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,720
let's go to a museum.
Um,

680
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:42,920
Garla only the Creme de Creme dialing.
I invaded.

681
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,090
So Ralph Lauren pretends to fall.
He sniffs or butter on the way down.

682
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:52,250
So what happens? You know, this super
rich people, they're all freaks,

683
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,800
aren't they? I guess it wasn't at
the point of eyes wide. Shut it.

684
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,660
I don't know what the point
of I wide shut was. Well,

685
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:02,660
what happened was Stanley Kubrick died.
He died halfway through.

686
00:42:02,661 --> 00:42:07,430
I saw a great fucking movie on a plane
called the insiders. It's a movie made by,

687
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:12,800
uh, some Korean director, man. It was
fucking phenomenal. Really enjoyed it.

688
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:17,410
Okay. Had One of the best
fucking fight scenes that I,

689
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:22,310
I've seen, cause the gay was
missing a hand, you know,

690
00:42:22,311 --> 00:42:24,350
so he had to like fucking,
you know,

691
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,500
everybody knew one handy
was throwing right.

692
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:31,850
And it was multiple attackers.
It was the shit.

693
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:36,050
I almost gave it a standing ovation
on the plane. If it was pre nine 11,

694
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:38,870
I could've done it. But I started
to do and they're like, sorry,

695
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,500
I had to sit down. Okay.
It's another freedom lost.

696
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,653
So anyways,

697
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:54,670
so fucking Madonna shows up. Yeah. Sorry.

698
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:55,963
Okay.

699
00:42:56,270 --> 00:43:00,920
So she says that she's trying to fucking
push the boundaries of or whatever,

700
00:43:00,921 --> 00:43:05,750
the fucking sex and that type of
thing. Okay. So I was going like,

701
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:08,900
Duncan, mind you 57, no wants to
see me without a shirt on grants.

702
00:43:08,901 --> 00:43:11,300
She's in better shape than
I am. But like, you know,

703
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:15,230
Almond must my sport coat years, like, you
know, covered up their freckles. Right.

704
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:19,970
So what I'm saying is you're in your
sport coat you, yeah, yeah, yeah.

705
00:43:19,971 --> 00:43:22,550
You get to a certain point, you get
to your forties and stuff like that.

706
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,320
Women Dress elegantly and men dress like
gentlemen. Yeah. In other words, yeah.

707
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,680
You cover up, uh, you know the fucking
battle scars of what you've been through.

708
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:36,280
Okay. Do any fucking wine
and cheese plates? No.

709
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,700
What I'm saying is, so I was saying with
mark, but Donna just put on a nice dress.

710
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:43,880
You could look really elegant. Right.
That's not really her vibe. Yeah, I know.

711
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,470
I know.
But you know something,

712
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:49,010
it's like he like look who's
can do Michael Jackson. He,

713
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:52,850
if he was still alive [inaudible] the
short pants with the glitter socks.

714
00:43:52,851 --> 00:43:56,570
It's like, come on dude. Some points
you've got to update the look what is,

715
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:01,040
what is your point? What
this whole Madonna thing. And
so I, as I was saying that,

716
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:04,910
but then I was like, wait a minute. But
when I saw Iggy pop with no shirt on,

717
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:09,010
I thought it was bad ass that daddy
didn't give a fuck. So that, that's,

718
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:13,220
that's bullshit. So I should be actually
applauding Madonna. Wow. Look at you.

719
00:44:13,221 --> 00:44:17,420
See that? That's not, that's not okay. I
was going to say, you're going like wow,

720
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:20,510
look at you. You're really known
as DME. So my apologies to Madonna.

721
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:28,820
Feels like I'm shot.
Take it.

722
00:44:28,821 --> 00:44:33,821
Look at my fucking 57
year old titties teeth.

723
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,250
She's my age with 10 she's 10 years.
We're 10 years apart.

724
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:43,170
So She's 50th wait what?
I, I'm 57 years. Wait.

725
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:47,940
Yes she is. She was born the
same year it was Prince Oh shit.

726
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:49,783
The same year as Michael Jackson.

727
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:56,420
Michael Jackson was 58 prince was 58
and tick but was 58 I never know how old

728
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:01,890
Madonna is ever. And that was like
in 1957 Oh my God. You're right.

729
00:45:01,891 --> 00:45:04,540
She's gonna be 58 right? Had
no idea. And August, yeah,

730
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:09,180
she'll be 58 so 1958 as far as music goes,

731
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,280
was kind of like 1943

732
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:17,280
1943 was Janis Joplin,
Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison,

733
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:21,240
all born 1943

734
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:27,900
and then they all died in 1970 and then
people started to understand drugs.

735
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:33,420
And you know, bringing a jump rope on
the road and maybe becoming a Vegan.

736
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:36,840
So now they live longer.
Michael made it to 50 prints,

737
00:45:36,841 --> 00:45:41,050
made it to 57 but don is still going okay.
Right.

738
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:46,070
So all of them in their own way kind
of went on stage with their ass hanging

739
00:45:47,761 --> 00:45:50,440
out. Right. Um,

740
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,650
okay.
Where are you going

741
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:58,840
to fuck it. I want to do
some questions here. Okay.

742
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:04,930
Say you brought me into, show me that
you've evolved and seeing your own. No,

743
00:46:04,931 --> 00:46:06,450
I was trying,
I was trying to seek,

744
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:10,360
see if that was a double standard women
and showing their bodies and you know,

745
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:12,130
double standard also works with women.

746
00:46:12,131 --> 00:46:14,920
The way they look at guys in certain
situations too is you guys aren't like

747
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:16,920
perfect. No one, no one is claiming.

748
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:20,240
Perfect. Okay. Well the media just
seems to cover your complaints

749
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:25,950
and then this chest to ever have a voice.
Uh Huh.

750
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:30,290
Thank God you have this podcast. I
know. No one would hear me. Okay.

751
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:34,910
Listen, you got to understand
the world doesn't live with me.

752
00:46:34,911 --> 00:46:37,280
They don't have the privilege of
living with me the way you do.

753
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:39,920
So I need to do this once a week.

754
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,330
That's a fucking beautiful watch. Who
got you that? You did? That's right.

755
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:52,700
Asshole response to stinky
German from last week.

756
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:54,680
So this poor bastard,
um,

757
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:59,880
he's German, right? Yes. And
uh, so he lives in Germany.

758
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:03,450
He's old school. He didn't
leave and try to be like, hey,

759
00:47:03,451 --> 00:47:07,650
I wasn't part of that Hitler thing. Right.
He's still listening. His grandparents

760
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:13,020
said, you know, I don't know if it's me,
but this guy's making a lot of sense.

761
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,313
So,

762
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:23,650
so because of the mistakes of
his forefathers and mothers,

763
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:29,670
the gods have cursed him that he just
sort of smells a little musty and east,

764
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:33,430
she's tries showering, it has all this
shit. He doesn't know what the fuck to do.

765
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,400
So evidently this,
there's this other musty guy,

766
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:39,940
formerly musty guy heard about this.
Okay.

767
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,030
That's you look into his diet. Yeah. We,

768
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:48,010
we've talked about that in halitosis
and maybe you have a fucking as a sinus

769
00:47:48,011 --> 00:47:51,370
infection. I don't know what,
but he just, he just smells bad.

770
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:54,580
Then no matter how much he showers.
So this guy says, yeah, anywhere.

771
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:59,290
Where's the yeah. Was
quite, it's quite a mystery.

772
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:04,390
I'm boy, I tell you, I'll tell you
this person's in response to this.

773
00:48:04,391 --> 00:48:07,750
This is a formerly musty person,
so I hope this helps the, uh,

774
00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:12,660
the sour kraut
cheeses.

775
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:14,843
See,

776
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:23,440
that is my best fucking fun ever.
I'm sorry,

777
00:48:23,441 --> 00:48:27,650
but that shit was great. All right. That
was pretty good. That was pretty good.

778
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:31,660
That was good. That was
good. All right. I'm gonna,

779
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,050
I'm gonna.
He said,

780
00:48:35,051 --> 00:48:38,440
I'm gonna and keep this simple because
we all know if you're reading issues,

781
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,730
I admittedly have,
I've been a fan for years,

782
00:48:42,731 --> 00:48:45,880
but this is the first time I feel
the need to chime in on something.

783
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:50,740
Last week you read a question from a
German guy that had a musty body odor and

784
00:48:50,741 --> 00:48:53,260
did not know what to do about
it. He said, growing up,

785
00:48:53,261 --> 00:48:56,320
I dealt with the same bullshit
that poor SAP is going through.

786
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:01,510
I always smelled musty. I could not wash
it away, no matter how often I showered.

787
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,400
This is brutal.
I feel bad for these people.

788
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:07,030
I tried everything and
finally realized it was, eh,

789
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,330
it was antiperspirant
for some weird reason,

790
00:49:10,331 --> 00:49:14,290
my body reacted when I put
it on and I smelled musty.

791
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:17,860
I actually stopped wearing deodorant
for a few weeks in the winter,

792
00:49:17,861 --> 00:49:21,730
so I did not smell like a complete savage.
After that period of time,

793
00:49:21,731 --> 00:49:26,410
I began wearing deodorant, only
skipping all brands with antiperspirant.

794
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:30,340
Uh, happily the stinky,
musty odor went away.

795
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:34,690
Hope this works. You Stinky
Fuck, love the podcast.

796
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:38,290
Your comedy and F is for family
and go fuck yourself. Yeah.

797
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:42,520
So basically what I got from that is
maybe his body is having a reaction to

798
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,080
something that he is using.
I don't know.

799
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,250
Cause your body should sweat the
weight to keep you cool. Right.

800
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:49,450
That's the whole point of sweating.

801
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:54,930
So anti perspirant I know maybe
people who sweat excessively,

802
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,490
they don't want to be sweating
through their clothes or something.

803
00:49:57,491 --> 00:50:00,490
So I don't know. But it sounds
like that person to go to a doctor.

804
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,950
Well they haven't been able
to figure out what's going on.

805
00:50:02,951 --> 00:50:05,530
And he's in Germany too. And those
guys don't fuck around over there.

806
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:09,630
They're very efficient. Yeah, no. Oh yeah.

807
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:13,140
I mean the cars, the trades,
the rocket side trick, you know,

808
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:19,130
if everybody could just forgive him
for that one crazy 10 year period,

809
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:24,020
I think they got a little
sideways. They'll never,
they'll never live it down. No,

810
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,560
you can't. Sorry. You know
what? It's on video. That's why,

811
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:33,080
you know, other countries could do shit.
And it happened before like a certain,

812
00:50:33,081 --> 00:50:37,220
something that happened in 1915
that we always see advertised. Uh,

813
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:41,600
my vote dear bill on Capitol Hill. I don't
know what you're talking about. Well,

814
00:50:41,601 --> 00:50:44,660
you should. You know what if there
was movie cameras around you? What?

815
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:47,630
Movie Cameras. Yep. Motion picture things.

816
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:52,220
Have you ever heard of vermin supreme?
Um,

817
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:56,120
he's been on. I don't, I don't, I don't
believe that this is somebody's name.

818
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:58,520
I'm going to look this up before
you guys make a fool of me,

819
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:02,510
which is not hard to do.
Why don't you read it first?

820
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:06,440
Because then I start commenting and then
halfway through I realized it's a prank

821
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:10,490
phone call. Vermin
supreme. It's coming up.

822
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,130
That's vermin supreme.

823
00:51:13,131 --> 00:51:17,570
Vermin supreme as an American performance
art or artists and activists who has

824
00:51:17,571 --> 00:51:20,780
run as a candidate and very
low various local states.

825
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,210
Um, okay. Let me see what this,
what's up with this guy? Okay.

826
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:27,740
I never heard of this guy.

827
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:31,730
He's been on the ballot in New Hampshire
and his platform has a lot to do with

828
00:51:31,731 --> 00:51:35,870
dental health. He also has a plan
in place for the Zombie Apocalypse,

829
00:51:35,871 --> 00:51:40,850
which involves setting up thousands of
treadmills to put the zombies on to help

830
00:51:40,851 --> 00:51:44,450
power the new world. He wears
a giant boot on his head. Oh,

831
00:51:44,451 --> 00:51:46,670
I've seen this fucking guy.
That boot that's right.

832
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:51,200
And carries around a rubber toothbrush.
Here's an article on him.

833
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:55,250
He also has promised free
ponies for everyone. Oh,

834
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:01,340
so he's a whack job.
I don't know if he's a whack job,

835
00:52:01,341 --> 00:52:04,580
because that's a really funny joke though.
The zombies on the treadmill.

836
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:09,380
Are you looking them up? Are you
texting? I was looking at Madonna photos.

837
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:14,600
Okay. We were back here and we've
now, we've moved on. We've moved on,

838
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:18,710
but I just was looking at photos.
I'm here. I'm a don't preach

839
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,470
Amin. Trouble dealing dope. Do
you know any new Madonna songs?

840
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:31,940
I just said, I'm sorry. I did my
fucking, I did TV. Your, your, your,

841
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:36,110
your vocal warmups. Yeah. This was
not a good luck at the met ball.

842
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:40,250
It was just I, yeah. Oh, ladies,

843
00:52:40,251 --> 00:52:43,620
can we stick together first of all and

844
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:49,220
just get something right? Yeah. Home.

845
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,970
But now it's not, I'm not
being catty. She just,

846
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,660
it's just so thirsty. It's
just, I don't [inaudible]

847
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:03,110
and I love Madonna, but this is
just too much. Or you're done.

848
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:07,670
Yeah, I'm done. I'm
sure her kids enjoy, uh,

849
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:12,260
wife's family is a bunch
of dramatic babies. Oh God.

850
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,370
You're the baby. And we go, hey
bill, I'm sick of this election.

851
00:53:16,371 --> 00:53:19,340
I hope Trump wins. I know he's
a jerk, but I hate Hillary.

852
00:53:19,341 --> 00:53:23,510
I think Bernie is a nice guy without
a clue. He says a lot of great things,

853
00:53:23,511 --> 00:53:26,250
but he's going to raise taxes.
He talks about

854
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:30,330
making college free, but his taxes, we'll
make it. Oh, nothing is free. And that,

855
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,390
yeah, that's never going to happen. But
nothing that, you know, free health care.

856
00:53:33,391 --> 00:53:35,880
It's not, it's not free. Somebody
has got to fucking pay for it.

857
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:37,740
He talks about making college free,

858
00:53:37,741 --> 00:53:41,130
but it's taxes will make it harder for
people like me to pay my student loans.

859
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:43,950
I make 95 grand a year.
I have a kid,

860
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:47,550
a hundred grand in student loans between
me and my wife. We live comfortably.

861
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,760
But if you take another 20 $504,000
from him a year, I will feel it. Yeah,

862
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:57,120
definitely. I am already only netting
60. What is the fuck is all of this?

863
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:01,170
What's the plan?
The family has a venture.

864
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,310
Dramatic babies. All right.
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

865
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:08,283
MMM,

866
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:12,870
okay. So we'll get into, we'll get
into his family here somewhere.

867
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:16,290
I'm not opposed to giving money
to help people who need it,

868
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:20,430
but when is enough enough?
$1 trillion on dumb shit every year.

869
00:54:20,431 --> 00:54:24,660
And you need more from me. Fuck off
Bernie. I love how he's blaming Bernie.

870
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:29,850
You know, Bernie didn't create
the fucking situation. Um,

871
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,780
he's trying to get us out of it, I
guess. I don't know if it's gonna work.

872
00:54:33,781 --> 00:54:38,010
I don't think, I mean, I don't know if
people work with the guy, but oh God,

873
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:41,760
what a fucking decision this year.
Um, so I make this point to my wife,

874
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:45,990
my wife's family. I didn't yell. I
didn't say fuck off Bernie. I just said,

875
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:46,980
I don't think we,

876
00:54:46,981 --> 00:54:50,820
the people should have to give more
money if they're wasting their money.

877
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,870
They already get, well, my
wife's family lost their shit.

878
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:58,200
They said that I'm selfish
and that if I vote for Trump,

879
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,410
I'm endorsing hate and greed and fascism,

880
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:06,600
a really question mark. They endorsed
Obama and I have a problem with him.

881
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:10,200
Hatefully blowing up kids and
wedding parties with drones.

882
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:13,830
Why doesn't that make them hateful?
Um,

883
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:18,750
they then went on to talk about for
30 minutes about hate and how theirs,

884
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,950
they were scared about what would happen
to the country and they're scared about

885
00:55:22,951 --> 00:55:27,870
how children would grow up in a country
with anti quote Hitler minus the

886
00:55:27,871 --> 00:55:29,280
concentration camps.

887
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:33,870
I told them that comparing an Egomaniac
to Hitler is unfair to the victims of

888
00:55:33,871 --> 00:55:34,704
the Holocaust.

889
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:39,980
It trivializes the actual evil of Hitler
and embodied her mother and father were

890
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:44,610
both taken aback and said that my way of
thinking could potentially be dangerous

891
00:55:44,611 --> 00:55:45,900
to their grandchildren.

892
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:50,340
What period the fuck period is going,

893
00:55:50,341 --> 00:55:53,040
period on period. Well, you dope.

894
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:58,190
Yeah. You fucking opened up your fucking
mouth about politics. Talk about Paul,

895
00:55:58,330 --> 00:56:02,070
know who he is and he's young. He
doesn't know. Well, you know? Yeah.

896
00:56:02,071 --> 00:56:05,670
And how did you learn? How did you learn
and how did I learn by bringing it up.

897
00:56:05,671 --> 00:56:09,320
By doing that? Yeah. This is the
deal. You know, you can't talk

898
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,930
about politics and religion
and shit like that.

899
00:56:11,931 --> 00:56:15,920
Those are going to say get got
it got really heated. Yeah,

900
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:20,570
right before they said that shit.
Well you can't. And also you just,

901
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:24,100
yeah, I don't know. He
gotta be, if you really

902
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,800
are going to vote for Trump,
I just,

903
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:32,020
I think there's only certain sections
of the United States where you could say

904
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:35,230
that where you'll get a, yeah, I get it.
Oh, well, tell me more about your opinion.

905
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,960
I feel like if you say, you know
what, fuck this, I'm voting for Trump,

906
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:40,360
most people are going to be like,
are you fucking kidding me?

907
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,110
So I'm not surprised at that,
but

908
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:46,920
no. Yeah, you really a lot of shit. One
Oh own. I was, I made fun of him when, uh,

909
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,510
you know, I got some shit for it. For
making fun of Trump. Yeah. From who?

910
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:56,760
People who support Trump. Oh,
well, okay, fine. Yeah, they have,

911
00:56:56,850 --> 00:57:00,740
believe it or not, there's people that
I know it has a lot more than I thought.

912
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,360
Remember when we was first talking
about running and we're both like,

913
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:06,210
this is never going to happen.
This is a joke. This is ridiculous.

914
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:10,410
And now here we are. And he used like
the only Republican left standing.

915
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:15,750
So I mean, I guess I underestimated him.
Yeah. He's like the less humble party.

916
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:19,230
He's like the Leicester City
of Pollock politicians. Um,

917
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,430
but here's the thing though,
I, but I think like, you know,

918
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:27,630
Hillary Clinton is the fucking devil
because she's acting like she gives a fuck

919
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:31,650
and she's, you know, she's one of those
Bilderberg people. I don't like her.

920
00:57:31,651 --> 00:57:34,050
I like Bernie out of all of them.
I liked Bernie Sanders.

921
00:57:34,051 --> 00:57:36,570
I just don't think anybody's
going to fucking work with, well,

922
00:57:36,571 --> 00:57:40,650
the California primary is coming up, so
he's, he's not throwing in the towel.

923
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:45,550
Ernie, Bert I have. Do you know something?
But we got to vote. We have to go.

924
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:50,630
I have to vote for a person that I feel
is actually truly gives a shit about

925
00:57:52,261 --> 00:57:54,630
regular people and yeah,
that would be him.

926
00:57:54,631 --> 00:57:57,330
Whether he's going to be successful or
not. And I know what a lot of people,

927
00:57:57,590 --> 00:58:00,860
well,
you're going to put Trump

928
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:04,380
good. The office. I've always
voted for the fucking third wheel.

929
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:07,740
Every fucking God damn time.
Well, when the primary happens,

930
00:58:07,741 --> 00:58:10,610
we got to vote for him.
That's the only way that he'll listen.

931
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:12,760
I don't have to do anything that you say.
Okay.

932
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:16,560
But I don't know what I'm going to do.
So basically his, this guy's in law.

933
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:18,540
Do you know what? We just did
eight him, you know, we just did.

934
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,310
We just did with this guy did,

935
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:24,870
which is what we just fucking talked
politics and gave endorsements to.

936
00:58:24,871 --> 00:58:26,100
Bernie said,
we shouldn't have done that.

937
00:58:26,101 --> 00:58:27,810
I still haven't made up my
mind that I'm going to do that.

938
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:31,080
Why are we were giving endorsements
just by talking about it,

939
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:33,330
by saying that you're going to do it well,

940
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,090
it's how I feel like that guy that fucked,
we like those,

941
00:58:36,091 --> 00:58:39,330
those people that you see on Facebook
and they go, Hey, do you know me?

942
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:43,350
I pretend to be a doctor on his soap
opera and I think this is who you should

943
00:58:43,351 --> 00:58:45,720
vote for. I apologize
for that. People. I, I,

944
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:49,120
I try not to say that eventually when
she was going to come up doors thing,

945
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:52,680
anybody where we'll, let's just
leave it. I'll tell you what,

946
00:58:52,681 --> 00:58:57,050
I'm endorsing a nice fucking
cold Budweiser. When I sit
down to watch game five,

947
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:00,300
that's what I'm endorsed. What
is, what does he want to know?

948
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:03,420
He was just sort of like,
what the hell? Now My,

949
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:06,870
now my inlaws don't want
me to have children with my
wife because they think I'm

950
00:59:06,871 --> 00:59:09,780
evil and they're gonna.
I'm gonna raise a little evil.

951
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:14,100
Trump's might think about Trump is his
fucking about lack of compassion for

952
00:59:14,101 --> 00:59:14,701
fucking people.

953
00:59:14,701 --> 00:59:18,400
When you sit there and say take his coat
and like riling people up like that was

954
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:22,430
just says that he says really,
really awful things.

955
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:26,180
But the thing I like about him is he
lets me know that they actually count the

956
00:59:26,181 --> 00:59:29,750
votes because no super rich
people want that fucking guy.

957
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:32,210
And I always thought for years
my conspiracy theory is like,

958
00:59:32,211 --> 00:59:34,970
they don't count these fucking thing.
They do. Oh, it's pretty fucking close.

959
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:38,660
And they put the money on both horses
and then that fucking fine. But uh,

960
00:59:38,661 --> 00:59:40,760
the fact that he's actually doing well,

961
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:43,750
he's speaking a lot of
people out there need,

962
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:48,200
it's going to build a wall and he's
going to have the people whose wallet and

963
00:59:48,201 --> 00:59:53,100
pay for it telling you these talking
mad shit. I don't know. I feel like I,

964
00:59:53,101 --> 00:59:56,360
all those years of watching the apprentice
and celebrity apprentice are now

965
00:59:56,361 --> 01:00:00,050
coming back to when you tried to find
a CEO for a company that doesn't exist.

966
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:02,000
It's all coming back
to bite me in the ass.

967
01:00:02,001 --> 01:00:03,860
I've been supporting him
this whole entire time.

968
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:10,370
I'm partly to blame for this bullshit.
So what does this look?

969
01:00:10,371 --> 01:00:13,460
He can't be a complete moron. What is
this kid saying? What does this point?

970
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:15,740
He's just is, no, he's
just saying what the fuck.

971
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:20,290
So we just will not talk about
politics anymore around your inlaws.

972
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:21,560
I'll tell you that much.

973
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:23,780
But then he said looking
forward to seeing you in Dublin,

974
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:27,110
myself and some friends that
will be coming from Belfast.

975
01:00:27,111 --> 01:00:30,440
Well I'm going to be doing
Belfast too. So you don't, yeah,

976
01:00:30,441 --> 01:00:35,040
you don't even need to do that. Yeah.
And we're putting together the dates.

977
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,460
I'm definitely doing Dublin.
Definitely doing Belfast. Yeah.

978
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:41,660
I'm doing a little 10 day tour over there.
Cause skin,

979
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:44,030
it's not a good time to go to Scandinavia
this time of year because they

980
01:00:44,031 --> 01:00:48,830
actually have sunlight and it's
warm out. So when I usually, well,

981
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:53,060
because they're going to want
to be outside. Okay. Yeah.

982
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,770
Yeah. If you go in December
and it's already fucking
dark, go to movies and stuff.

983
01:00:57,771 --> 01:00:58,401
Still though,

984
01:00:58,401 --> 01:01:01,610
I would imagine just cause it's sunlight
most of the time doesn't mean why would

985
01:01:01,611 --> 01:01:03,810
I listen to the promoters
over there? I'll, I'll listen.

986
01:01:06,350 --> 01:01:08,300
When is this happening?
I'm going to go,

987
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:10,390
that's going to be happening individually.

988
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:14,000
Like I think it's going to start on the
31st and it's going to go into August.

989
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:18,680
Very excited about that. Exciting
things are happening. I love Ireland.

990
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:20,930
Oh No,
I love the people of Ireland.

991
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:26,690
Look who you're with or potato face
himself through advice with neighbors

992
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:29,000
emotionally. Germany. Oh mighty Billy.

993
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:33,480
I don't actually don't even know that
cause I never done the whole a CFC if

994
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:38,690
they're always like a more German than
Irish cause I am German, Irish Catholic

995
01:01:40,890 --> 01:01:44,330
podcasts. It doesn't get any
wider. I wasn't getting any wider.

996
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:48,500
All mighty Billy Ball bags. Uh, alright.
And vice with neighbors. Question.

997
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:54,250
I live in an apartment complex here in
the lovely state of Oklahoma and I have

998
01:01:54,411 --> 01:01:57,980
this neighbor who lets her dog
out on her balcony every morning.

999
01:01:57,981 --> 01:02:02,060
Somewhere between the hours
of four and 5:00 AM oof.

1000
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:05,900
The dog barks aggressively
for hours afterward.

1001
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:08,630
Of course it wakes me up.
Poor thing.

1002
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:14,470
The dog that is and this about this
poor bastard or lady Oklahoman.

1003
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:17,960
Um,
Oklahoman Oklahoman.

1004
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:26,920
Uh, where am I? Okla Homo Sexual? No,

1005
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:30,330
no. Isn't that one of the
characters on your Nashville show?

1006
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:36,860
I want to write a song with you.
We'll likes about us. They gay cowboy,

1007
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:40,590
the gay cowboys to gay cowboys.
Cutting edge character.

1008
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:45,880
That's the first gay cowboy ever
in primetime in Bram time. Yes.

1009
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:48,450
I've been prime time
during the lunch hour.

1010
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:50,160
It was just littered with
them when I was growing up.

1011
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:57,270
Those people on Captain Kangaroo, right?
Ernie and Bert isn't what they said.

1012
01:02:57,271 --> 01:02:59,490
All those guys. Right.
All right. Question.

1013
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:03,510
I live in an apartment complex here in
the lovely state of Oklahoma. Okay. Yeah.

1014
01:03:03,511 --> 01:03:07,160
The dog parks aggressively for hours.
It wakes me up and I have to go.

1015
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:12,260
I have to work at 8:00 AM I filed
complaints after an altercation in which I

1016
01:03:12,571 --> 01:03:17,220
went out and scream, shut your fucking
dog up before I make you shut him up. Oh.

1017
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:21,740
Was that your opening line or something
along those lines? My muscles.

1018
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:26,700
My message has not been heard by the
apartment costs and she continues to let

1019
01:03:26,701 --> 01:03:31,560
the dog out. What should I do?
Sincerely, a blue collar working man,

1020
01:03:31,561 --> 01:03:33,390
just trying to get some fucking sleep.

1021
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:38,420
Who is also Saint Louis Blues gave the
stars of fucking Molly whopping today.

1022
01:03:40,111 --> 01:03:42,450
Hope you watched it. I miss that. Um,

1023
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:47,550
well fuck urine here in Oklahoma,
man. You know what you need to do?

1024
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:51,870
Take out your side iron.
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, eh,

1025
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:55,170
take the fucking dog out the bell bow.

1026
01:03:57,210 --> 01:04:00,690
Don't even joke about it with rubber
bullets. Don't even joke about that.

1027
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:01,890
Who is your super,
you know,

1028
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:05,500
he put rubber bullets in the gun
and every time the dog barks,

1029
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:09,690
king very signed a dog barks, you shoot
it and its ass and it starts to Oh,

1030
01:04:09,691 --> 01:04:14,310
when I bark and then it'll shut
up. No, you can't do that. Uh,

1031
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:18,240
you would get arrested for that.
So why don't I would just go down.

1032
01:04:18,241 --> 01:04:22,620
I would buy a month's worth
of cube steaks. Right?

1033
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:25,470
Why does it does a dog shit
and Piss on the balcony?

1034
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:28,500
Is that why she's letting it out there?
Cause that's gross. I don't know.

1035
01:04:28,501 --> 01:04:32,550
But that is so fucking not acceptable
because you know what's probably the

1036
01:04:32,551 --> 01:04:37,551
fucking dog gets up at Ford 5:00 AM
is keeping her up to him up so they,

1037
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:42,270
oh my God. No, it's you. Gotta you gotta
call them on or something. Oh wait.

1038
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:44,700
Did he say that they're not
paying attention at the,

1039
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:50,340
like when you say it's not going over
well with the people in the apartment?

1040
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:54,690
Well he has like, she just has a
neighbor. I can't, I don't think that, oh,

1041
01:04:54,691 --> 01:04:56,520
it's an apartment complex.
Yeah.

1042
01:04:56,521 --> 01:04:58,500
You got to say something to the
management company. Oh look,

1043
01:04:58,501 --> 01:05:02,040
there's no fucking way. He's the only
person that's annoyed by this. Of course,

1044
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:07,070
I would go around and I would get a
bunch of signatures and then I would,

1045
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:11,470
you know, try to have everybody
all get together and say, ah,

1046
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:16,980
that bitch needs to shut
the other bitches. Oh, cleo.

1047
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:19,980
No,
what's up buddy?

1048
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:21,960
Okay.

1049
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:26,330
Yeah. This little bit, no. Why are you,
it's time for this one probably to go out.

1050
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:28,610
Speaking of all that. All
right, well you do that well,

1051
01:05:28,611 --> 01:05:32,340
I will wrap up the podcast here. No,
you take her out. Um, sorry. Hey,

1052
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:37,350
is it Jacksonville this morning? That's
my, uh, that's my excuse. All right,

1053
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:40,060
well that's going to be there.
The, uh, the light on weight,

1054
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:44,680
so we didn't offer any advice besides
your horrible joking advice. Of course.

1055
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:48,060
I just said you get a bunch of signatures.
He can get enough signatures,

1056
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:51,520
not going to do shit. You got to go
to the management company and be like,

1057
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:54,720
this dog is barking at four or five
in the morning every morning. Oh,

1058
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,640
he said he already did that. Oh,
and they're not paying attention.

1059
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:00,640
He said he's in this fucking, what do
you think signatures are going to do?

1060
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:05,560
Any technology like to hear him about fun?
No, that's not it. Oh wait, I missed one.

1061
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:11,950
He said, I have this day. I live in an
apartment complex. The dog barks. I've,

1062
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:16,550
I filed complaints. Yeah. Like nothing's
happening. Um, that sacks. Wow.

1063
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:20,490
So you have to do this thing.
I'm not going to pay my
fucking rent. There you go.

1064
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,880
I'm not paying my rent until you get
this one. Yeah. To shut this damn dog.

1065
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:27,590
Oh yeah. Cause that's not fair. Yeah.
How about that long? She's lived there.

1066
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:32,000
That sounds like something an older
person would do to just like put their dog

1067
01:06:32,001 --> 01:06:37,001
out on the balcony and just let it bark
all morning cause it probably goes out,

1068
01:06:38,330 --> 01:06:39,320
takes a piss,

1069
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:42,740
takes a shit and then once to come inside
and meanwhile the owner has gone back

1070
01:06:42,741 --> 01:06:46,870
to sleep. All right. Well obviously I
was joking. You don't shoot it the dark.

1071
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:53,270
No, you don't. All right. That's
right. Cleo is the other one.

1072
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:58,220
Um, all right. Virtual
reality headset, blow job.

1073
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:01,913
Uh,
all right.

1074
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:05,130
I know you hate technology but we'd
like to hear your opinion on this.

1075
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:06,630
My girlfriend,

1076
01:07:06,631 --> 01:07:11,631
half jokingly promised me a double
blow job from my 30th birthday.

1077
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:16,530
Um,
I do not expect this to happen,

1078
01:07:16,531 --> 01:07:20,790
but I have been joking with her that the
date is approaching and she should have

1079
01:07:20,791 --> 01:07:22,410
a girl lined up,
et cetera.

1080
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:27,800
I have also been talking about virtual
reality slash Vr headset as I'm thinking

1081
01:07:28,321 --> 01:07:31,840
of getting one, I don't know
what that is. Yeah. What is that?

1082
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:36,390
She asked me the other day, would I be
able to watch porn through it? I said yes.

1083
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:40,140
She then said instead of the double by,

1084
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:45,620
why don't you wear the headset
and I can give you normal.

1085
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:51,930
Oh by while watching a porno. Wait, what
do you what? What are you saying goodbye?

1086
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:55,040
Oh Bj. Yeah. Oh, you know what?

1087
01:07:55,041 --> 01:07:59,150
It was underlined in red so I couldn't
see the bottom part. I was like,

1088
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:04,130
why does this by,
Oh my God.

1089
01:08:04,370 --> 01:08:07,560
Your reading skills are atrocious.
Yeah,

1090
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:10,760
and by what actually mean that there
wouldn't be a guy and a girl doing it.

1091
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:14,990
I was even, I was thinking about
like his girlfriend would be like by,

1092
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:20,120
she was down there with another chick.
I am stupid.

1093
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:25,340
See this people, you too can be
successful in life years dumb as me.

1094
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:31,850
She then she then just instead of instead
of a double Bj, he read this again. Wow.

1095
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:35,690
Why don't you wear a headset and I could
give you a normal BJ while watching a

1096
01:08:35,691 --> 01:08:38,110
porno.
Why can't you do that now with a TV?

1097
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:42,290
Because I feel like that's
something like weird Tron,

1098
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:47,291
futuristic shit where you put it on this
opening Pandora's box or is this a way

1099
01:08:48,361 --> 01:08:52,760
for Vr to be seen as a techie sex toy?

1100
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:55,460
You are really asking the
wrong person that question.

1101
01:08:55,461 --> 01:08:58,610
You know bill doesn't know what
looking forward to see you in Dublin.

1102
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:01,770
Myself and some friends
will be coming from bell.

1103
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:05,600
Oh this is the I that was the one.
Okay. Um, is this the same? No,

1104
01:09:05,601 --> 01:09:09,260
I read the ending to the other one to
that one and it was weird because the

1105
01:09:09,261 --> 01:09:10,760
ending was in front of the other one.

1106
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:18,590
Oh fuck you and fuck everybody else. Yeah.
It's all fun. It's all fun and games.

1107
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:23,280
Until I stopped podcasting. Oh, I've
had enough of this sensitive deep.

1108
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,880
No I'm not, I don't care. Um,

1109
01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:29,120
it is a slippery slope but I feel like
that could be really kind of cool.

1110
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:30,380
Does she get to do it too?

1111
01:09:30,381 --> 01:09:33,620
Like does she get to watch some
porn while you like go down on her?

1112
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:36,680
That'd be really trippy.
It would be trippy.

1113
01:09:36,681 --> 01:09:39,470
But the thing is then then
when ends up happening is,

1114
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:44,330
is then you end up getting like a that,
that disconnect.

1115
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:47,600
Right. And now you don't want
to do anything that's the
one of you is wearing the

1116
01:09:47,601 --> 01:09:52,580
helmet. Yeah. That's weird. Oh my God.
I have to like see you. So that's,

1117
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,760
I got, that's a dangerous, yeah,

1118
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:58,100
that's like one of those things like
do you think I could do heroin once and

1119
01:09:58,101 --> 01:10:02,540
like be all right with
that? No, I saw something,

1120
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:06,020
I'm
trying to think where I saw it.

1121
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:10,850
Saw what in one of those Asian countries,

1122
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:15,520
because they're always ahead of us, they
have better cell phones. There was a, uh,

1123
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,460
a guy trying out like a
virtual reality sex suit,

1124
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:25,030
which I had a bit on this thing in like
the late nineties when I first heard

1125
01:10:25,671 --> 01:10:28,100
that they were going to do
that. Um, and by the way,

1126
01:10:28,101 --> 01:10:30,560
the fact that you haven't already
called me out going like book bill,

1127
01:10:30,650 --> 01:10:34,070
How did you just stumble upon this?
I'm dead honest one.

1128
01:10:34,071 --> 01:10:37,040
I don't remember the waiting for the
rest of the story cause I felt like there

1129
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:41,870
was more, could have been while I was
watching Internet porn probably. Yeah.

1130
01:10:41,871 --> 01:10:44,420
But they don't have advertising
advertisers for that.

1131
01:10:44,421 --> 01:10:46,910
It was like a story on
the side of the thing.

1132
01:10:46,911 --> 01:10:51,170
They have all those and how do you
know them? Yeah. Right back at you.

1133
01:10:52,190 --> 01:10:56,330
So yeah, but they don't have any, I don't
have ads like that. Right. That's true.

1134
01:10:56,750 --> 01:11:00,610
Well this is what it was. It looked
like a fucking dude. He was like,

1135
01:11:00,810 --> 01:11:03,950
let go mummy suit,
who's hilarious.

1136
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:05,990
Literally was all wrapped
up in toilet paper.

1137
01:11:05,991 --> 01:11:10,700
That's how I remember it because
it was so horrifying. It was just,

1138
01:11:10,701 --> 01:11:11,600
it was one of those things,

1139
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:15,660
whatever I was looking at that then
came up and I went, wow. Right. He was,

1140
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:17,520
and it looked like

1141
01:11:20,330 --> 01:11:21,163
mmm.

1142
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:24,690
His hands with to his side. He
had on the fucking, you know,

1143
01:11:24,691 --> 01:11:29,380
I'm old and I can't see anymore those
glasses, those cataract glaucoma,

1144
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:34,320
cataract glasses from the drug
store. Yeah. So he had on those, he,

1145
01:11:34,321 --> 01:11:37,950
I think he was all wrapped up because he
didn't want anybody to see who he was.

1146
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:41,190
Yeah. Maybe that's what it was.
Okay. And then there was this thing,

1147
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:45,060
obviously his dick was in
it. Oh my God. And it just,

1148
01:11:45,061 --> 01:11:49,050
the same way your hand would be going like
bang, Bang, Bang, Bang against yourself.

1149
01:11:49,051 --> 01:11:52,410
It was this thing.
It was the most fucked up thing ever.

1150
01:11:52,510 --> 01:11:56,190
Would you ever use one of those flesh
bought things? You know how porn stars,

1151
01:11:56,191 --> 01:12:00,470
they get mold. Those things are so
fucking gross. I think those things,

1152
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:04,860
those things is so fucking gross.
A long time ago I did somebody podcast.

1153
01:12:04,861 --> 01:12:07,740
I'm not gonna say who, but people
who listen to podcasts, no. Who is,

1154
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:12,370
he had one of those things and it look
like some Jeffrey Dahmer body part

1155
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:15,360
automatically.
Who your tax just sitting.

1156
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:18,600
I don't think you'd do cause I
know who you're going to guess.

1157
01:12:18,601 --> 01:12:22,680
But it wasn't that person. Um, it
looked, no, it just looked like and it,

1158
01:12:22,681 --> 01:12:24,570
did he say that?
Did it feel like every,

1159
01:12:24,571 --> 01:12:29,250
it can't feel like a real vagina
obviously, but like it's, it's just,

1160
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:33,210
it's, I, I can't believe that it does.

1161
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:37,620
Like shit like that doesn't cause
you to either be like become like a

1162
01:12:37,621 --> 01:12:40,660
necrophiliac or some sort of perk,
feel Yak.

1163
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:42,960
Why would it make you feel a necrophiliac?

1164
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,630
Cause you fucking something that looks,

1165
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:47,970
looks like a body part and it's not alive.

1166
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:52,570
Women have like dildos and vibrators and
stuff and it's like the same sensation.

1167
01:12:52,571 --> 01:12:55,980
So why wouldn't a one of those
fleshed bought things feel like,

1168
01:12:56,070 --> 01:13:01,070
isn't that kind of like another Madonna
Iggy pop thing by looking at it the

1169
01:13:01,231 --> 01:13:04,770
wrong way maybe? No, I don't think,
no, I don't think you're looking at it.

1170
01:13:04,771 --> 01:13:09,120
I remember back in the day, back in the
day, don't like the idea of a fake vagina.

1171
01:13:09,740 --> 01:13:10,111
You don't,

1172
01:13:10,111 --> 01:13:14,070
you're not comfortable just sitting on a
table and it has a handle on it and I'm

1173
01:13:14,071 --> 01:13:18,300
holding it. No, that's not
your thing. You're not into,

1174
01:13:18,301 --> 01:13:21,150
that feels like Henry
portrait of a serial killer.

1175
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:24,030
I remember back in the day,

1176
01:13:24,031 --> 01:13:26,910
right when you actually had to go
to a porno store to get your porn,

1177
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:29,550
and they had like, you know, always,

1178
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:33,450
always behind the counter and
they would have shut up there.

1179
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:41,530
They had this, it was like what's in the
box? It was literally a head in a box.

1180
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:46,500
The chicks, Bob was like, [inaudible] you
stick your Dick in it. You know? I'm like,

1181
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,680
somebody's going to buy that.
Yeah. It was in like the same box,

1182
01:13:49,681 --> 01:13:52,350
like a basketball came in
and someone's gonna take it,

1183
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:57,330
grab it by its fucking ears that are stuck
to the side of its head and then just

1184
01:13:57,331 --> 01:14:00,240
going to go home and
fuck ahead just to head.

1185
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:04,200
Now there's no fucking way
that that doesn't fuck you up.

1186
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:08,550
Psychologically.
If you do that long enough,

1187
01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:10,170
then you go out with a real person.

1188
01:14:10,171 --> 01:14:13,240
It's already annoying that they
have to buy a dinner and that the,

1189
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:16,520
there's a whole body attached to it
and you have to talk to it. Yeah,

1190
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:20,410
and they all, they're thinking of just
grabbing you by your ears. Water, water.

1191
01:14:20,411 --> 01:14:24,880
I want to alert. It's over.
Yeah. It's fucked up. Well,

1192
01:14:24,881 --> 01:14:27,310
I still feel like we're
going back to the question.

1193
01:14:27,311 --> 01:14:30,910
I feel like they can experiment
with it like once or twice,

1194
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:34,060
but it can't be like a regular thing
that they're doing all the time because

1195
01:14:34,061 --> 01:14:34,510
then yeah,

1196
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:39,280
that'll completely fuck up your sex life
because then you'll just be looking at

1197
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:40,211
everything you do.

1198
01:14:40,211 --> 01:14:44,620
Like it's supposed to be this
hyper reality dual reality.

1199
01:14:44,650 --> 01:14:46,750
Virtual is just not good.

1200
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:51,680
You don't, I was just saying this out.
Let's just fast forward here. Okay.

1201
01:14:52,730 --> 01:14:55,780
Now. So that becomes the thing, right?

1202
01:14:56,030 --> 01:14:59,510
Which you know what's gonna people
are gonna do it and then we're,

1203
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:04,610
it's going to become is porn stars will
be making all of that fucking money.

1204
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:09,760
[inaudible] and it basically
you have a girl fucking, ah,

1205
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:11,480
they'd probably just
be like the whole suit.

1206
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:13,310
It's eventually just going
to be the whole suit. Right.

1207
01:15:13,311 --> 01:15:17,510
What are you talking about?
Like the whole, I'm talking
about like in the future,

1208
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:22,170
like when like everybody has like a
virtual reality sex suit that's will

1209
01:15:22,171 --> 01:15:23,900
actually helped the population problem.
Right?

1210
01:15:24,530 --> 01:15:27,950
The virtual reality sex suit [inaudible].
Okay.

1211
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:33,490
And then porn stars will
then have their likeness,

1212
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:39,140
they'll do a POV porn and then they
get money and then you have to like

1213
01:15:39,141 --> 01:15:41,300
subscribe to that.
So you can do,

1214
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:46,010
you can do a virtual reality thing where
you at with any porn starts with like

1215
01:15:46,070 --> 01:15:49,880
asa, Akira and then he, and then
here's what happens. Yeah. Okay.

1216
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Who's going to be the first celebrity
that crosses over and eventually,

1217
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:56,090
right,

1218
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:59,780
because they're sick of doing superhero
movies and they don't want to do the

1219
01:15:59,781 --> 01:16:01,880
grunt work of an independent cause.

1220
01:16:01,881 --> 01:16:04,940
Like you notice now they're all
doing ads over here. Back in the day,

1221
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:07,880
all the celebrities did ads, but
they did them overseas, right?

1222
01:16:07,881 --> 01:16:11,090
Remember we used to go over and we all
look at so and so doing a fucking watch

1223
01:16:11,091 --> 01:16:12,710
thing or look at her doing this thing,

1224
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:17,120
but they'd never do them here
because it was that whole, um, um,

1225
01:16:17,121 --> 01:16:20,760
stigma that if you did a commercial,
you're a sellout, blah, blah,

1226
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:22,760
whatever the fuck it was.
Or it's like you're doing a commercial,

1227
01:16:22,761 --> 01:16:24,830
you're a movie star. I'm, where
we start is not even on TV.

1228
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:28,730
Forget about doing an ad. Now
that all went away, you know?

1229
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:34,370
So I'm saying eventually
somebody famous would do it,

1230
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:36,590
right? You could, yeah.

1231
01:16:36,810 --> 01:16:40,440
Get a suit and program it so that you're
having sex with like Lindsay Lohan or

1232
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:43,470
something and the first one, the first
and the first level will go down.

1233
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:47,690
Now be one of those reality TV show stars.
Right.

1234
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:50,130
You know when the reality
show goes off the air,

1235
01:16:50,490 --> 01:16:53,430
like Jersey shore, they were all
fucking huge. Now it's just disappeared.

1236
01:16:53,550 --> 01:16:55,230
Where the fuck are they?
Right.

1237
01:16:55,710 --> 01:16:58,320
You could probably talk a couple
of them and is doing it right.

1238
01:16:58,570 --> 01:16:59,700
Are we pitching a show right now?

1239
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:02,490
I think or some kind of
like high tech concept.

1240
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:05,310
We'll that will probably make a lot of
money that's going to end up at sounds

1241
01:17:05,311 --> 01:17:06,600
like a movie.
It sounds like.

1242
01:17:06,601 --> 01:17:08,850
Like a what was bad and this
is what's going to happen.

1243
01:17:08,851 --> 01:17:10,240
You're to have these self driving

1244
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:11,550
fucking cars.
Huh?

1245
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:15,110
You're going to have self driving fucking
cars and people would be laying in

1246
01:17:15,111 --> 01:17:19,850
them in virtual reality suits having
sex with any famous person they want to

1247
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:22,910
write and bill have like,

1248
01:17:22,911 --> 01:17:26,150
because you don't need to steer in
wheeler gas or brake or anything anymore,

1249
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:29,870
you literally feel like your suit
in there and then when you're done,

1250
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,380
you roll rollover up from that
seat into like another, like a, uh,

1251
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:36,170
like a freshen up like tub or some shit.

1252
01:17:36,310 --> 01:17:40,150
So I think we're totally going in that
direction. I think you're right. We'll,

1253
01:17:40,151 --> 01:17:43,240
we'll, we'll see it in the next
generation. Before it was just, yeah,

1254
01:17:43,241 --> 01:17:48,190
the fleshbots stuff or just the mold
of the vagina or the deck or whatever.

1255
01:17:48,370 --> 01:17:51,160
And then it's going to be this virtual,
it'll be super expensive at first

1256
01:17:51,370 --> 01:17:52,530
is going to go into a complete,

1257
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:55,340
it's gonna be like one flat screen TVs
first came out and they have 14 grants.

1258
01:17:55,341 --> 01:18:00,341
So don't buy the first virtual
reality sex suits virtual way to the,

1259
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:05,640
like they'd come down to like 800 bucks
at best buy. Then you get them right.

1260
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:10,370
Figure out how to like make
this technology and just
like patent it and that's

1261
01:18:10,371 --> 01:18:11,204
how we'll make our,

1262
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:15,300
yeah, yeah. We're going to figure out
how to do that. I can't even read copy.

1263
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:20,220
We're not calling it that.
That's what's going to happen.

1264
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,620
I've already selling it right
now with these self driving cars,

1265
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:25,650
like the interiors of cars.
What they're going to have now,

1266
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:29,580
they're going to have office ones.
They're gonna have sleeper ones.

1267
01:18:29,581 --> 01:18:31,410
People just want to sleep,
going to work.

1268
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:34,620
They're going to have one second to catch
up on your emails and all of that type

1269
01:18:34,621 --> 01:18:39,130
of shit. Yeah, the different those
that'll be like the different, um, the,

1270
01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:40,230
the social one,

1271
01:18:42,570 --> 01:18:45,450
the social and office one, all of
that type at all. I don't know.

1272
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,370
And then eventually is going to be like,
well, why are you even going to work now?

1273
01:18:48,371 --> 01:18:52,770
Because everything's automated. And then
there's robots, right? And then one day,

1274
01:18:53,010 --> 01:18:54,990
the whole fucking thing just turns on us.

1275
01:18:55,540 --> 01:19:00,370
What if there was a company like in
some really random, not really random,

1276
01:19:00,371 --> 01:19:01,204
like a Japan,

1277
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:03,140
by the way.
Neither one of us is high right now.

1278
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:07,040
No, not at all. Completely that
high. It's the middle of the day.

1279
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:11,390
Never been more sober. What if there was
a company somewhere and like, I dunno,

1280
01:19:11,690 --> 01:19:15,020
not Japan,
but like Eastern Europe that said,

1281
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:20,470
we want to do this deal with you where
we have these like sex dolls with your

1282
01:19:21,081 --> 01:19:24,890
face on them and they offered you like,
yeah,

1283
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:29,240
an insane amount of money.
No, no, to do it. Oh,

1284
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,840
and you could buy a bell birth sex doll.

1285
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:36,980
Do you realize the photoshops I'm going
to get and I'm going to have to re tweak

1286
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,020
now you asshole.

1287
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:43,000
Oh, you're right. Oh, they're going
to be horrifying, but hilarious.

1288
01:19:43,210 --> 01:19:47,530
Like a bill. Birth sex.
Um, what'd you do? Yeah,

1289
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:50,860
they come out of like somewhere
random, like, you know,

1290
01:19:51,010 --> 01:19:53,280
Norway or just something
or like, you know, yeah.

1291
01:19:53,490 --> 01:19:56,210
One of those plays random like
Norway, love Norway. That's

1292
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:57,740
my random enough like,
you know,

1293
01:19:59,050 --> 01:20:02,390
turns Minnick Stan or one of those fucking
places. I'm not even saying it right,

1294
01:20:02,391 --> 01:20:06,020
but just a random little pocket
that was just like, you know,

1295
01:20:06,830 --> 01:20:08,280
we $5 million

1296
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:12,700
that we want to make sex
toys with your face. No,

1297
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:17,150
you wouldn't go for it. Can you imagine
that phone call out of nowhere? No. No,

1298
01:20:17,370 --> 01:20:22,000
I wouldn't. No. I can honestly
tell you that I would know.

1299
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:25,020
I know you wouldn't like,
yeah, I would think so.

1300
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:27,470
How the fuck did we get all the way
over here? See this white light,

1301
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:32,220
the questions? Great questions because
of the person in their virtual blow job.

1302
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:34,350
Look,
we'll buy according to you.

1303
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:38,820
I never claim to be smart since
beginning of these podcasts.

1304
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:45,030
I don't know. I, I, I don't
claim to be smart. And with that,

1305
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:49,350
go fuck yourselves.
I'm sorry.

1306
01:20:49,351 --> 01:20:53,100
The podcast was so late. Um, I was flying
back from Jacksonville as I mentioned,

1307
01:20:54,230 --> 01:20:57,060
um, rural times, several times.
I complained about it. And, uh,

1308
01:20:57,090 --> 01:21:01,710
I'll be checking in on you on Thursday.
I'll see you go blues.
