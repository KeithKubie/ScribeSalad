00:00:00.271 --> 00:00:02.021
- This just looks incredibly good.

00:00:02.021 --> 00:00:04.521
I'm gonna take that top piece.

00:00:09.907 --> 00:00:11.335
It's salty,

00:00:11.335 --> 00:00:15.028
you got the mix of the fat and the meat.

00:00:15.028 --> 00:00:16.528
That is wonderful.

00:00:21.056 --> 00:00:21.967
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:21.967 --> 00:00:26.541
It's Mark Wiens with
migrationology.com in Rome, Italy.

00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:29.867
We just got off the metro
at Piramide Station,

00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:33.351
and now walking over to Testaccio Market,

00:00:33.351 --> 00:00:35.857
which is not too far away from here.

00:00:35.857 --> 00:00:39.190
There should be some amazing food there.

00:00:45.705 --> 00:00:48.611
Just arriving now to Testaccio Market,

00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:51.402
and from what I understand,
this is an old market,

00:00:51.402 --> 00:00:55.364
but it has been relocated
to this new location,

00:00:55.364 --> 00:00:58.313
and it's nice and brightly
lit, naturally lit.

00:00:58.313 --> 00:01:01.548
You can buy everything from
fresh vegetables and fruits

00:01:01.548 --> 00:01:06.208
to meats to prepared food,
all sorts of prepared food.

00:01:06.208 --> 00:01:09.462
There are places like delis and cafes.

00:01:09.462 --> 00:01:14.013
This is just kind of an all
things food under one roof,

00:01:14.013 --> 00:01:15.585
and a beautiful roof.

00:01:15.585 --> 00:01:18.168
(upbeat music)

00:01:24.306 --> 00:01:25.139
- One?

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:26.306
- [Mark] Okay.

00:01:27.874 --> 00:01:28.707
Okay.

00:01:33.315 --> 00:01:34.148
- That's all?

00:01:34.148 --> 00:01:36.467
- That's all, thank you.

00:01:36.467 --> 00:01:37.648
Grazie, thank you.

00:01:37.648 --> 00:01:39.543
Ying and I saw the beautiful fruit,

00:01:39.543 --> 00:01:42.218
especially the cherries and the grapes,

00:01:42.218 --> 00:01:43.051
and had to get some.

00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:44.805
All the fruit looks really, really good.

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:46.796
You just gotta see this whole stock

00:01:46.796 --> 00:01:49.055
of green grapes I just bought.

00:01:49.055 --> 00:01:49.888
Oh, yes.

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:52.735
Grapes

00:01:52.735 --> 00:01:54.612
are just an amazing thing.

00:01:54.612 --> 00:01:56.120
A whole vine of them.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.953
Grapes, grab a couple.

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:03.552
Wow.

00:02:04.602 --> 00:02:07.508
Those are incredibly juicy

00:02:07.508 --> 00:02:08.771
with just a little bit of bitterness

00:02:08.771 --> 00:02:11.293
from the seeds that are still in it.

00:02:11.293 --> 00:02:13.293
Oh, wow, those are good.

00:02:17.456 --> 00:02:21.561
The grapes are just an absolutely
fantastic snacking fruit.

00:02:21.561 --> 00:02:25.728
You can just sit here and just
eat a whole vine of grapes,

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:30.650
and they're just perfectly
bite sized, as well.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.567
And, the same goes for cherries.

00:02:32.567 --> 00:02:35.900
Perfect little bites of delicious fruit.

00:02:38.401 --> 00:02:39.980
Yeah.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.073
And, also along with all
the food in the market,

00:02:42.073 --> 00:02:43.308
you can also buy clothes.

00:02:43.308 --> 00:02:44.832
There are shoe shops,

00:02:44.832 --> 00:02:47.482
there are some household
necessity shops, as well.

00:02:47.482 --> 00:02:50.883
So, it's kind of an all
around, well-rounded market

00:02:50.883 --> 00:02:52.344
where you can buy just about anything

00:02:52.344 --> 00:02:53.842
you need for you house,

00:02:53.842 --> 00:02:57.092
but especially focused on lots of food.

00:03:03.487 --> 00:03:04.320
Hello.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.380
(mumbles)

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.643
Panini con Picchiapo.

00:03:07.643 --> 00:03:10.730
For my first thing to eat,
I have come to a stall,

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.368
and he specializes in all
sorts of different Roman dishes

00:03:14.368 --> 00:03:16.454
inside of a sandwich, a panini sandwich,

00:03:16.454 --> 00:03:18.729
and so I ordered off the menu,

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:22.188
it's called Panino con Picchiapo,

00:03:22.188 --> 00:03:24.213
and I think it's a type of meat,

00:03:24.213 --> 00:03:26.624
which is brazed in tomato sauce.

00:03:26.624 --> 00:03:27.722
He does have some stools here

00:03:27.722 --> 00:03:29.476
that you can sit right
in the market and enjoy,

00:03:29.476 --> 00:03:31.726
and this is a lovely place.

00:03:32.576 --> 00:03:35.681
So yeah, come get a close up
view of what's inside of this.

00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:38.021
Oh yeah, that bread feels wonderful.

00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:42.617
It looks like shredded
meat with lots of tomatoes,

00:03:42.617 --> 00:03:44.448
sauce, and maybe a few small

00:03:44.448 --> 00:03:47.448
assorted vegetables inside, as well.

00:03:54.307 --> 00:03:55.140
Oh yeah.

00:03:56.738 --> 00:03:58.387
That's like a,

00:03:58.387 --> 00:04:00.604
I think it's beef.

00:04:00.604 --> 00:04:04.771
It's like a stewed tomato
beef filled into a bun bread.

00:04:09.735 --> 00:04:12.000
Oh yeah, it's the type of sandwich

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.152
that when you take a bite,

00:04:14.152 --> 00:04:16.557
the insides sort of squeeze out,

00:04:16.557 --> 00:04:18.181
because of that pressure.

00:04:18.181 --> 00:04:22.056
That was a great way to start
walking around this market,

00:04:22.056 --> 00:04:24.730
and now we are off to
go find something else,

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.454
but what I'm already
loving about this market

00:04:26.454 --> 00:04:28.268
is how friendly it is,

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:31.254
and how wide open the aisles are,

00:04:31.254 --> 00:04:32.825
and I also love this natural light.

00:04:32.825 --> 00:04:37.085
It gives it such a, like
a charming feel to it,

00:04:37.085 --> 00:04:39.306
and yet it's not,

00:04:39.306 --> 00:04:40.210
it's not too busy.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.691
Maybe it's the time I'm here.

00:04:41.691 --> 00:04:44.295
And, it's just friendly and relaxing.

00:04:44.295 --> 00:04:46.802
Lots of space, good food,

00:04:46.802 --> 00:04:49.515
a fantastic place to just
walk around and explore.

00:04:49.515 --> 00:04:52.098
(upbeat music)

00:04:58.383 --> 00:04:59.216
- Prosciutto?

00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:00.049
- [Mark] Prosciutto.

00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:00.882
- Si.

00:05:00.882 --> 00:05:01.715
- [Mark] Di montagna.

00:05:01.715 --> 00:05:02.548
- Si.
- Okay.

00:05:02.548 --> 00:05:03.381
- Quanto?

00:05:03.381 --> 00:05:04.565
- [Mark] One.

00:05:04.565 --> 00:05:05.600
Two hundred.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.433
- [Clerk] Due?

00:05:06.433 --> 00:05:07.772
- Correct, yeah.

00:05:07.772 --> 00:05:10.355
(upbeat music)

00:05:14.611 --> 00:05:15.566
For my next stop,

00:05:15.566 --> 00:05:18.520
I have come to a place
called Enzo and Lina,

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.415
and they are especially
known for their prosciutto,

00:05:21.415 --> 00:05:23.374
as well as, it's kind of a whole deli.

00:05:23.374 --> 00:05:26.363
I saw people in front of me
were ordering full sandwiches,

00:05:26.363 --> 00:05:29.376
choosing their meat,
and then slicing it up,

00:05:29.376 --> 00:05:32.653
and then putting it into bread
with cheese and some pickles,

00:05:32.653 --> 00:05:35.106
and the owners are
extremely nice and friendly,

00:05:35.106 --> 00:05:37.874
and I noticed what I really
liked about them is that

00:05:37.874 --> 00:05:40.196
when I was standing up
front at the counter,

00:05:40.196 --> 00:05:42.827
they were conversing with
all of their customers,

00:05:42.827 --> 00:05:46.241
and chatting, and having a
good time while serving food.

00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:48.061
I, of course, don't speak Italian,

00:05:48.061 --> 00:05:49.862
but it was still a really
friendly experience,

00:05:49.862 --> 00:05:52.774
and you could sense the generosity

00:05:52.774 --> 00:05:55.167
and the kindness of the owners.

00:05:55.167 --> 00:05:58.174
Let's see what goodies I got.

00:05:58.174 --> 00:05:59.717
I didn't fully know what I was doing,

00:05:59.717 --> 00:06:02.204
but I decided to go no bread,

00:06:02.204 --> 00:06:04.790
because I just had that
whole bread sandwich,

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.893
and so I'm sure this would be
really good in bread, as well,

00:06:07.893 --> 00:06:10.394
but I got some of their,

00:06:10.394 --> 00:06:14.312
I think this one is called
the Prosciutto di Montagna.

00:06:14.312 --> 00:06:17.479
And, he sliced it up, I got 200 grams.

00:06:19.057 --> 00:06:21.070
Whoa, that's quite a lot.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.841
This just looks incredibly good.

00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:24.919
I'm gonna take that top piece.

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:26.002
Look at that.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.163
Yeah.

00:06:33.345 --> 00:06:34.762
That's marvelous.

00:06:38.042 --> 00:06:38.959
Cured pork.

00:06:40.109 --> 00:06:41.800
It's salty,

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.166
it's

00:06:43.166 --> 00:06:45.459
got the mix of the fat

00:06:45.459 --> 00:06:46.542
and the meat.

00:06:47.527 --> 00:06:48.882
That is wonderful.

00:06:48.882 --> 00:06:50.352
And, in addition to this,

00:06:50.352 --> 00:06:54.519
I also got a little packet of
the fresh mozzarella buffalo.

00:06:58.473 --> 00:06:59.306
It's a little ball,

00:06:59.306 --> 00:07:02.723
and then he sliced it into pieces for me.

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.352
That texture.

00:07:05.352 --> 00:07:07.102
The softness of that.

00:07:12.007 --> 00:07:12.840
Wow.

00:07:15.096 --> 00:07:16.376
That's amazing.

00:07:16.376 --> 00:07:18.221
That combination is insane,

00:07:18.221 --> 00:07:19.766
and the mozzarella is amazing.

00:07:19.766 --> 00:07:22.804
I don't know if I've ever
had mozzarella like that.

00:07:22.804 --> 00:07:24.729
Both the texture and the flavor.

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:25.812
The flavor is

00:07:26.876 --> 00:07:28.700
kind of mild and not too salty.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.636
A little bit salty, but it's milky,

00:07:31.636 --> 00:07:32.553
it's curdy,

00:07:34.044 --> 00:07:34.890
it's awesome.

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.890
It's just amazing stuff.

00:07:42.418 --> 00:07:46.740
It's like milk gushes out
when you start chewing.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.303
Another piece of this.

00:07:48.303 --> 00:07:50.886
This is actually a lot of meat.

00:07:54.254 --> 00:07:55.087
Yeah.

00:07:56.858 --> 00:07:58.669
It's very, very rich,

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:00.193
so it would go good with bread.

00:08:00.193 --> 00:08:01.526
That's for sure.

00:08:03.359 --> 00:08:06.030
They were so friendly and so nice there.

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:09.418
I wish I could speak Italian
to talk to them more,

00:08:09.418 --> 00:08:11.212
but that was fantastic.

00:08:11.212 --> 00:08:14.334
The mozzarella, in particularly,
really blew me away.

00:08:14.334 --> 00:08:16.584
That mozzarella was insane.

00:08:20.276 --> 00:08:22.405
Can I have the pepper, apple, lemon juice?

00:08:22.405 --> 00:08:24.006
- Okay.

00:08:24.006 --> 00:08:25.489
Small, medium, or large?

00:08:25.489 --> 00:08:26.906
- Medium, please.

00:08:28.337 --> 00:08:30.504
(mumbles)

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.604
After that wonderful salty meat,

00:08:35.604 --> 00:08:37.622
I thought it would be a
good idea to have a juice,

00:08:37.622 --> 00:08:39.790
and so, this place is called Zoe,

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:42.109
and they specialize in
different types of juices,

00:08:42.109 --> 00:08:44.215
as well as some healthy salads,

00:08:44.215 --> 00:08:46.940
I think are going on
behind me, and sandwiches,

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.852
but I just came here for a juice.

00:08:48.852 --> 00:08:49.876
And, when I ordered it,

00:08:49.876 --> 00:08:51.533
they have a list of different juices.

00:08:51.533 --> 00:08:53.130
They have some really
interesting combinations

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.703
that include both vegetables and fruits,

00:08:55.703 --> 00:08:58.241
and they also have different properties,

00:08:58.241 --> 00:09:00.704
like antioxidant, or slimming.

00:09:00.704 --> 00:09:02.383
I happened to get one for slimming,

00:09:02.383 --> 00:09:05.097
but not because I want the slimming,

00:09:05.097 --> 00:09:08.361
but because it's an
interesting combination,

00:09:08.361 --> 00:09:12.614
and so it is a combination
of green apple and lemon,

00:09:12.614 --> 00:09:13.947
and also pepper.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.833
Oh yeah.

00:09:21.935 --> 00:09:24.271
Oh, that's a beautiful thing.

00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:27.827
Oh, that is perfect after what I just ate.

00:09:27.827 --> 00:09:31.994
It's sour, it's just perfectly
sweet, naturally sweet.

00:09:32.902 --> 00:09:33.735
Did I taste the pepper?

00:09:33.735 --> 00:09:35.902
Let me get one more drink.

00:09:38.861 --> 00:09:41.609
Just a faint pepper taste to it,

00:09:41.609 --> 00:09:45.736
but it's really nice with
green apple and lemon,

00:09:45.736 --> 00:09:48.819
and just a faint pepper flavor to it.

00:09:52.824 --> 00:09:56.661
That is one high quality,
awesome mixture juice.

00:09:56.661 --> 00:09:57.604
There's another sandwich

00:09:57.604 --> 00:09:59.975
that I don't wanna leave
this market without eating,

00:09:59.975 --> 00:10:02.604
and it's located right on
the outside of the market.

00:10:02.604 --> 00:10:05.104
The stall is called Strit Fud.

00:10:08.208 --> 00:10:11.208
(speaks in Italian)

00:10:15.867 --> 00:10:17.380
They have a number of all sorts of,

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.750
actually their menu is pretty diverse.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:19.708
They have a lot of different things

00:10:19.708 --> 00:10:21.301
from pastas to sandwiches.

00:10:21.301 --> 00:10:24.804
Under the recommendation
of Valentina and Antonio,

00:10:24.804 --> 00:10:27.887
I ordered the Panino con Lampredotto,

00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:32.693
which is cow stomach,
and I think it's boiled.

00:10:32.693 --> 00:10:34.705
There might be some pieces
of beef in here, too,

00:10:34.705 --> 00:10:36.932
but mostly beef stomach,

00:10:36.932 --> 00:10:40.431
and then put into a piece of bread

00:10:40.431 --> 00:10:44.030
with some kind of an herb dressing.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.863
It smells.

00:10:44.863 --> 00:10:48.030
You can definitely smell that stomach.

00:10:52.184 --> 00:10:55.960
That stomach is definitely
jiggly in texture,

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.791
but it's wonderful within the sandwich,

00:10:57.791 --> 00:11:00.803
because the bread is gummy and crusty,

00:11:00.803 --> 00:11:03.819
and then just with that soft,

00:11:03.819 --> 00:11:06.652
chewy gelatinous stomach in there.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.646
This is good, but you
definitely have to love tripe

00:11:16.646 --> 00:11:18.035
to order this one.

00:11:18.035 --> 00:11:20.606
And then, I also ordered
a Filetti di Baccala,

00:11:20.606 --> 00:11:23.503
and this is a fried piece of fish.

00:11:23.503 --> 00:11:25.344
I got a nice horseshoe shape,

00:11:25.344 --> 00:11:28.261
and I think it's battered, as well.

00:11:32.313 --> 00:11:34.666
That's really good.

00:11:34.666 --> 00:11:36.358
It has a very thick batter.

00:11:36.358 --> 00:11:40.138
It's crispy and gooey,
and then the fish just,

00:11:40.138 --> 00:11:41.626
sort of, it's very, very soft.

00:11:41.626 --> 00:11:42.853
For me, that tripe sandwich,

00:11:42.853 --> 00:11:45.059
it was a little bit on the plain side.

00:11:45.059 --> 00:11:47.025
I would've liked maybe some extra,

00:11:47.025 --> 00:11:49.987
something flavorful to go with that tripe.

00:11:49.987 --> 00:11:51.579
I think it was jut pretty much boiled

00:11:51.579 --> 00:11:53.994
with just a little bit of a sour sauce

00:11:53.994 --> 00:11:56.766
with maybe some parsley in it.

00:11:56.766 --> 00:11:58.767
It was kind of on the plain side,

00:11:58.767 --> 00:12:02.053
but this entire market
experience has been fantastic.

00:12:02.053 --> 00:12:05.427
I think my favorite thing had to be that

00:12:05.427 --> 00:12:08.813
buffalo mozzarella, and the prosciutto.

00:12:08.813 --> 00:12:10.544
This is our final full day in Rome.

00:12:10.544 --> 00:12:14.038
Tomorrow, we are moving
on to the next location,

00:12:14.038 --> 00:12:17.225
but today we just wanted
to enjoy and just relax,

00:12:17.225 --> 00:12:19.246
and just kind of walk around,

00:12:19.246 --> 00:12:21.467
and just have a leisure day in Rome.

00:12:21.467 --> 00:12:23.781
We spent about an hour
back at the hotel room

00:12:23.781 --> 00:12:27.459
after the market, eating
lots and lots of cherries,

00:12:27.459 --> 00:12:30.694
and finishing off those
grapes, which were amazing.

00:12:30.694 --> 00:12:33.714
And now, actually our hotel
happens to be very close

00:12:33.714 --> 00:12:37.716
to Villa Borghese, which is a big park,

00:12:37.716 --> 00:12:39.299
and it is a garden,

00:12:40.356 --> 00:12:45.175
and also, there is a famous
gallery within the gardens,

00:12:45.175 --> 00:12:46.929
and that's what we are
going to visit next,

00:12:46.929 --> 00:12:49.187
and also just to walk around
the park for a little while.

00:12:49.187 --> 00:12:51.798
This is a whole map of the
entire park and gardens.

00:12:51.798 --> 00:12:55.473
We are gonna head first
over to the Museo Borghese.

00:12:55.473 --> 00:12:58.056
(upbeat music)

00:13:00.385 --> 00:13:02.021
The big evergreen trees are cut,

00:13:02.021 --> 00:13:02.986
all the branches are cut off,

00:13:02.986 --> 00:13:06.593
so it just has like a
little hat on the top.

00:13:06.593 --> 00:13:07.426
Oh, there's a train.

00:13:07.426 --> 00:13:08.551
I didn't know that.

00:13:08.551 --> 00:13:09.384
Hello.

00:13:10.486 --> 00:13:12.160
I guess you can ride a train,

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.085
and you can also rent
these golf cart bicycles

00:13:16.085 --> 00:13:17.399
to pedal around.

00:13:17.399 --> 00:13:19.982
(upbeat music)

00:13:27.988 --> 00:13:29.723
Just about a 10 minute
walk through the park,

00:13:29.723 --> 00:13:33.413
and we have arrived to the Villa Borghese,

00:13:33.413 --> 00:13:35.485
which is now called the Gallery Borghese,

00:13:35.485 --> 00:13:36.790
and it's a museum.

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:38.704
I previously, actually just yesterday,

00:13:38.704 --> 00:13:42.172
I booked my tickets online,
and you have to book online.

00:13:42.172 --> 00:13:46.339
I don't think you can just
walk up and get your ticket.

00:13:48.848 --> 00:13:52.803
Immediately upon entrance,
you enter into this huge room

00:13:52.803 --> 00:13:54.172
with a really high ceiling,

00:13:54.172 --> 00:13:57.605
and the ceiling is just incredible.

00:13:57.605 --> 00:14:01.453
And, this is a former mansion, a villa,

00:14:01.453 --> 00:14:03.358
which is now turned into a museum.

00:14:03.358 --> 00:14:07.214
It's a gallery with many important
paintings and sculptures,

00:14:07.214 --> 00:14:10.920
and I know especially
there are some paintings by

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.883
Raphael, and also by Caravaggio.

00:14:13.883 --> 00:14:16.466
(upbeat music)

00:14:22.336 --> 00:14:26.704
Within this museum, there are
over 20 rooms on two stories.

00:14:26.704 --> 00:14:29.287
(upbeat music)

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:36.099
You can choose to rent an audio guide

00:14:36.099 --> 00:14:38.166
to walk you through this museum,

00:14:38.166 --> 00:14:39.633
but they also, in every one of the rooms,

00:14:39.633 --> 00:14:42.097
they have these big laminated cards

00:14:42.097 --> 00:14:43.967
that you can read information,

00:14:43.967 --> 00:14:45.960
and you can read about the room,

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.633
and also read about the different things

00:14:47.633 --> 00:14:49.169
that are within the room.

00:14:49.169 --> 00:14:52.337
So, that's very helpful to guide yourself

00:14:52.337 --> 00:14:53.529
through this museum.

00:14:53.529 --> 00:14:57.745
Right now, I am in the
Gallery of the Emperors,

00:14:57.745 --> 00:15:00.269
and then above me, on the ceiling,

00:15:00.269 --> 00:15:02.186
is Domenico De Angelis.

00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:06.176
The Triumph of Galatea.

00:15:06.176 --> 00:15:07.829
And, what I really like about this museum

00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:11.745
is that they really control
and manage the amount of people

00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:14.502
that are let in per
day, and per time slot.

00:15:14.502 --> 00:15:16.606
So, although you do have
to pre-book in advance

00:15:16.606 --> 00:15:18.605
to ensure that you get a ticket,

00:15:18.605 --> 00:15:21.602
once you're inside, it has a perfect feel,

00:15:21.602 --> 00:15:25.834
because it's not too busy,
and it's very well managed.

00:15:25.834 --> 00:15:29.281
And now, we are exiting, and
on our way to a restaurant

00:15:29.281 --> 00:15:30.890
that is very close here.

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:32.899
Just a few minutes walk away, I think,

00:15:32.899 --> 00:15:34.361
to have dinner tonight.

00:15:34.361 --> 00:15:36.944
(upbeat music)

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:42.724
Thank you.
- Two?

00:15:42.724 --> 00:15:45.362
- For two, please.
- Yes.

00:15:45.362 --> 00:15:46.195
Here?

00:15:46.195 --> 00:15:47.028
- Sure.

00:15:51.531 --> 00:15:52.378
Thank you.

00:15:52.378 --> 00:15:54.023
This is a real classic restaurant.

00:15:54.023 --> 00:15:58.978
It has been here since 1913,
and you can just tell how...

00:15:58.978 --> 00:16:01.330
How do you say the name
of this restaurant?

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.002
Fiaschetteria Marini?

00:16:03.002 --> 00:16:07.198
(owner speaks in Italian)

00:16:07.198 --> 00:16:08.115
- Oh, okay.

00:16:11.555 --> 00:16:14.555
(speaks in Italian)

00:16:15.669 --> 00:16:16.971
- [Mark] And, it's from the?

00:16:16.971 --> 00:16:17.908
- From Toscana.

00:16:17.908 --> 00:16:18.782
- [Mark] Okay.

00:16:18.782 --> 00:16:19.615
- From Tuscany.

00:16:19.615 --> 00:16:21.333
- And that's what the name,
the restaurant is named after?

00:16:21.333 --> 00:16:25.253
- Yes, Fiaschetteria,
because 100 years old,

00:16:25.253 --> 00:16:26.920
we have all of this.

00:16:27.836 --> 00:16:29.701
(speaks in Italian)

00:16:29.701 --> 00:16:32.284
- Okay, and this restaurant
has been here since 1913?

00:16:32.284 --> 00:16:34.696
- [Owner] Yes, my generation
is the fifth generation.

00:16:34.696 --> 00:16:35.724
- So, it's all your family?

00:16:35.724 --> 00:16:36.944
- [Owner] Yes, all my family, yes.

00:16:36.944 --> 00:16:37.843
- You're the fifth?

00:16:37.843 --> 00:16:39.218
Oh, wow, pretty cool.

00:16:39.218 --> 00:16:40.051
- [Owner] Thank you.

00:16:40.051 --> 00:16:40.985
- Yes, thank you.

00:16:40.985 --> 00:16:41.818
- [Owner] Grazie.

00:16:41.818 --> 00:16:42.873
- Ying and I got here pretty early,

00:16:42.873 --> 00:16:44.104
right as they opened for dinner,

00:16:44.104 --> 00:16:46.943
so we are the first
here for dinner tonight,

00:16:46.943 --> 00:16:47.776
and we got this,

00:16:47.776 --> 00:16:49.354
I think maybe the best
seat in the restaurant,

00:16:49.354 --> 00:16:51.918
which is right, we're not sitting outside,

00:16:51.918 --> 00:16:55.541
but we are sitting right next
to the full door that opens,

00:16:55.541 --> 00:16:57.106
so it's basically outdoors.

00:16:57.106 --> 00:17:00.154
We have fresh air coming from the street,

00:17:00.154 --> 00:17:02.782
a view of the smart cars,

00:17:02.782 --> 00:17:04.385
and this is a wonderful restaurant.

00:17:04.385 --> 00:17:06.805
You can feel the classic
heritage feel of it.

00:17:06.805 --> 00:17:09.120
They have a pretty concise menu.

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.806
It's not huge,

00:17:10.806 --> 00:17:13.284
but it took me some time to
navigate it a little bit,

00:17:13.284 --> 00:17:17.134
and the owner, he helped
me decide what to order.

00:17:17.134 --> 00:17:18.734
So, ordered a couple of different dishes,

00:17:18.734 --> 00:17:21.299
but I like how it's
not too huge of a menu.

00:17:21.299 --> 00:17:22.243
It's very manageable,

00:17:22.243 --> 00:17:23.979
and you know that they're gonna

00:17:23.979 --> 00:17:26.710
prepare the dishes with expertise.

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:29.058
You know that a restaurant is a classic

00:17:29.058 --> 00:17:32.016
when the theme color is mustard green.

00:17:32.016 --> 00:17:32.996
Thank you.

00:17:32.996 --> 00:17:34.504
- [Ying] Thank you.

00:17:34.504 --> 00:17:35.337
(mumble)

00:17:35.337 --> 00:17:36.337
- Thank you.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:38.894
First course has arrived.

00:17:38.894 --> 00:17:41.256
Got two different pasta dishes.

00:17:41.256 --> 00:17:45.119
This one is the gnocchi,
and this is a potato pasta.

00:17:45.119 --> 00:17:47.676
Little nugget sized potato pasta.

00:17:47.676 --> 00:17:48.827
It looks very cheesy,

00:17:48.827 --> 00:17:52.641
and I think this is also
the cured pork cheek.

00:17:52.641 --> 00:17:54.808
I'm gonna start with this.

00:17:59.836 --> 00:18:00.669
Oh, yeah.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.010
Those are so, like, pillowy soft,

00:18:06.979 --> 00:18:08.571
and just, sort of,

00:18:08.571 --> 00:18:12.285
they're just like little pillows of pasta.

00:18:12.285 --> 00:18:15.501
That is marvelously good, and

00:18:15.501 --> 00:18:18.730
it is very rich, and very cheesy,

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:23.371
and then those little
bits of salty cured pork.

00:18:23.371 --> 00:18:27.209
But, what's really amazing is
how the gnocchi just sort of,

00:18:27.209 --> 00:18:28.765
they're so soft,

00:18:28.765 --> 00:18:31.781
and yet so smooth that they just sort of

00:18:31.781 --> 00:18:35.795
straight up blend into that cheese sauce.

00:18:35.795 --> 00:18:38.962
Yeah, that is a richly delicious dish.

00:18:42.357 --> 00:18:44.236
And, they're so rich and so soft,

00:18:44.236 --> 00:18:47.903
but at the same time,
gnocchi is very dense.

00:18:53.261 --> 00:18:55.445
And, we also ordered amatriciana,

00:18:55.445 --> 00:18:57.699
and this is one of the pasta
dishes I've already had,

00:18:57.699 --> 00:18:58.645
but I really love it,

00:18:58.645 --> 00:19:01.066
because I'm a tomato
kind of guy, actually.

00:19:01.066 --> 00:19:03.981
I really like the flavor,
the tartness of tomatoes,

00:19:03.981 --> 00:19:05.361
so we had to get it here.

00:19:05.361 --> 00:19:06.764
Pasta, there's cheese on top,

00:19:06.764 --> 00:19:10.573
and also again, the cured pork cheek.

00:19:10.573 --> 00:19:12.740
And, this looks wonderful.

00:19:19.577 --> 00:19:20.410
Yeah.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:21.527
And, I love the cheesy pastas,

00:19:21.527 --> 00:19:24.969
but I'm really a tomato
pasta kind of guy, though.

00:19:24.969 --> 00:19:25.946
I love that tartness,

00:19:25.946 --> 00:19:29.414
and the flavor that the tomatoes provide.

00:19:29.414 --> 00:19:30.770
In contrast to the gnocchi,

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.431
which are just completely
soft, through and through,

00:19:33.431 --> 00:19:35.494
this pasta is very al dente,

00:19:35.494 --> 00:19:39.638
and you can, has a lovely
chewy texture to it.

00:19:39.638 --> 00:19:40.769
It's fantastic.

00:19:40.769 --> 00:19:42.352
It's really good.

00:19:42.352 --> 00:19:44.109
I like how they sprinkled on
just a little bit of cheese,

00:19:44.109 --> 00:19:47.392
but they didn't overdo it on the cheese.

00:19:47.392 --> 00:19:49.818
Let's get a closeup look at this sauce,

00:19:49.818 --> 00:19:51.901
and also that pork cheek.

00:19:59.345 --> 00:20:00.755
That is excellent.

00:20:00.755 --> 00:20:02.307
I completely forgot the name of this dish,

00:20:02.307 --> 00:20:04.868
but it's like a beef salad,

00:20:04.868 --> 00:20:06.476
and there's beef on the bottom,

00:20:06.476 --> 00:20:10.722
and then there is rocket
arugula all over the top,

00:20:10.722 --> 00:20:12.312
and then it's sprinkled with,

00:20:12.312 --> 00:20:15.345
I think strips of cheese,
shavings of cheese,

00:20:15.345 --> 00:20:17.440
and then tomatoes are around the outside.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.550
Let me try to get a little
bit of everything in one bite,

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:21.785
with some of the cheese, some of that...

00:20:21.785 --> 00:20:23.368
Wait, is it cheesy?

00:20:24.419 --> 00:20:27.024
(mumbles)

00:20:27.024 --> 00:20:28.893
A little bit of everything,
and one of those tomatoes,

00:20:28.893 --> 00:20:31.060
beautiful little tomatoes.

00:20:38.606 --> 00:20:40.270
Oh, that's wonderful.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:41.603
It's like tender

00:20:42.887 --> 00:20:45.409
stewed beef of some kind,

00:20:45.409 --> 00:20:49.756
and then with the light
horseradishy flavor

00:20:49.756 --> 00:20:51.121
from the arugula,

00:20:51.121 --> 00:20:54.396
and then this vibrant tasting tomato.

00:20:54.396 --> 00:20:57.234
It's a wonderfully simple,

00:20:57.234 --> 00:20:59.219
but delicious combination of a dish.

00:20:59.219 --> 00:21:00.212
And, it gets juicier

00:21:00.212 --> 00:21:02.319
the further you go down there, the beef.

00:21:02.319 --> 00:21:03.220
Oh, wonderful.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:04.425
The tomatoes.

00:21:04.425 --> 00:21:07.425
The tomatoes are absolutely amazing.

00:21:10.159 --> 00:21:12.972
And then, I also got a plate of fennel,

00:21:12.972 --> 00:21:16.139
and I think this is sauteed in butter.

00:21:22.158 --> 00:21:25.408
Really soft, kinda like cooked cabbage,

00:21:26.531 --> 00:21:30.750
but then you can taste a little
bit of that fennel flavor,

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:34.167
and it almost has a caraway flavor to it.

00:21:40.031 --> 00:21:42.585
That turned out to be an amazing dinner.

00:21:42.585 --> 00:21:44.434
This is a gem of a restaurant,

00:21:44.434 --> 00:21:45.960
and not only was the food good,

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.621
the pasta and that beef dish,

00:21:47.621 --> 00:21:49.282
and I'm sure everything on the menu,

00:21:49.282 --> 00:21:51.860
but the owners, and it's now run,

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:53.165
they're now the fifth generation

00:21:53.165 --> 00:21:55.011
of this family that owns the restaurant.

00:21:55.011 --> 00:21:57.054
They're also very friendly, very nice.

00:21:57.054 --> 00:21:58.847
The menu is even all in Italian,

00:21:58.847 --> 00:22:01.548
but they will explain to you the menu.

00:22:01.548 --> 00:22:03.275
A great, great restaurant.

00:22:03.275 --> 00:22:05.651
And, this actually happens to be,

00:22:05.651 --> 00:22:07.232
I think this will be our last meal.

00:22:07.232 --> 00:22:08.303
I don't think we're gonna be able to fit

00:22:08.303 --> 00:22:10.350
any other meals in Rome tomorrow,

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:12.286
because we leave tomorrow.

00:22:12.286 --> 00:22:14.786
A fantastic last meal in Rome.

00:22:15.914 --> 00:22:17.940
Thank you all very much
for watching this video.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.596
We're gonna just head back home,

00:22:19.596 --> 00:22:21.496
back to the hotel for tonight.

00:22:21.496 --> 00:22:23.250

Thank you again for watching.

00:22:32.457 --> 00:22:33.848
(beep)

00:22:33.848 --> 00:22:34.681
Whoa.

00:22:35.844 --> 00:22:38.338
That was a pigeon behind me.

00:22:38.338 --> 00:22:39.296
Okay.

00:22:39.296 --> 00:22:41.213
I ordered the panini...

00:22:42.254 --> 00:22:43.087
What is it called?

00:22:43.087 --> 00:22:47.086
And, we also ordered
the (speaks in Italian).

00:22:47.086 --> 00:22:50.086
(upbeat drum music)
