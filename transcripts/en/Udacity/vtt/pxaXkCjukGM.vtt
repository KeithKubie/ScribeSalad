00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.100
Looking at this plot, we can see that our suspicion

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.840
is confirmed. Users with a longer tenure tend to have

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.220
higher friend counts, with the exception of our older users,

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.240
say, about 80 and up. To put these cohort specific

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.420
medians in perspective, we can change them to cohort specific

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.090
means. And then plot the grand mean down here as

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.990
well. The grand mean is the line we saw in

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.340
lesson four when we plotted average friend count across the ages.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.060
Let's see if you can change the code for this

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.760
plot to plot the means instead of the medians for

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.280
each cohort. You'll also want to plot out the grand

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.320
mean as well, that we talked about in lesson four.
