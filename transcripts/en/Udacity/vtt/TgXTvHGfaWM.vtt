00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For this next problem, we're going to be once again working with a nice constant electric field

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and let's imagine that we put two charges in this field, one positive charge and one negative charge,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and we align these two charges such that if you draw a line between the two of them,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
this line is perpendicular to the field lines.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We know that there are two forces acting on each of these particles.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
There is the electrostatic force trying to pull them together and there is the force from the electric field

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
which for this negative charge is going to be pushing it down this way

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and for this positive charge is going to be pushing it upwards this way.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Let's say that we once find the net force acting on this positive charge,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
it makes this angle θ₁ with the horizontal here

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and when we find the net force acting on this negative charge particle,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
it turns out to make this nice angle θ₂ with the horizontal.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Given only these two angles,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
can you tell me what the ratio between these two charges has to be?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
What is the charge of the positively charged particle

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
divided by the charge of the negatively charged particle?

00:00:53.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Put your answer here.
