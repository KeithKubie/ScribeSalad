00:00:07.765 --> 00:00:10.205
For centuries it was well known that

00:00:10.205 --> 00:00:13.225
the health of one soul required people to spend periods

00:00:13.225 --> 00:00:16.255
away from the city. Somewhere isolated, peaceful

00:00:16.255 --> 00:00:17.385
and spiritual.

00:00:18.965 --> 00:00:21.645
It is this impasse that explains why for centuries

00:00:21.645 --> 00:00:24.655
all the major religions built monasteries -

00:00:24.655 --> 00:00:27.375
beautiful pieces of architecture in quiet places.

00:00:30.785 --> 00:00:33.295
"The school of life" is a global organization

00:00:33.295 --> 00:00:36.375
commited to psychological health and well-being.

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:39.415
Our headquarters are in some of the world major urban centers -

00:00:39.415 --> 00:00:42.415
London, Paris, Amsterdam, Melbourne,

00:00:42.415 --> 00:00:44.635
Seoul, Istanbul, but we have always longed to be able

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.015
to help our audiences from around the world

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.960
find some other peace of mind

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.760
once offered by monasteries. It was with this in mind

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.920
that "The school of life" got interested in

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.180
the work of the great British architect - John Pawson,

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.120
who has designed several monasteries, churches

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.120
and places of contemplation.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.735
The result of our collaboration is now open -

00:01:05.735 --> 00:01:08.655
a beautiful secular monastic building

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.495
in the middle of a deserted rugged valley in central Wales.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.065
The school of lifeÂ´s secular monastery,

00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:16.980
that we call simply "The life house".

00:01:48.215 --> 00:01:51.095
The Life House has three large bedrooms,

00:01:51.095 --> 00:01:54.055
each dedicated to one of the great ways that humans has over the centuries

00:01:54.055 --> 00:01:55.315
salt serenity.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.600
The literature room is entirely oriented to reading

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.220
and has a carefully curated library, decked out

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.800
with books we have choosen.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.440
Next comes the music room,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.180
equipped with a state-of-the-art music equipment and a selection of some of the best

00:02:11.185 --> 00:02:13.645
therapeutic, relaxing music of the world.

00:02:15.215 --> 00:02:17.945
Finally, there is the bathing room, a bedroom with a large

00:02:17.945 --> 00:02:20.995
sunken beth in it, with vistas on the Welsh countryside

00:02:20.995 --> 00:02:22.205
in all directions.

00:02:30.415 --> 00:02:33.465
The house includes a contemplation chamber,

00:02:33.465 --> 00:02:36.615
buried deep in the hillside, where you can sit alone and listen to water trickling

00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:40.085
into a fountain and collect yout thoughts and calm anxieties.

00:02:48.255 --> 00:02:51.425
The School of Life has always been dedicated to mental well-being.

00:02:51.485 --> 00:02:53.685
With the launch of our "Life House"

00:02:53.685 --> 00:02:56.655
we have taken the best lessons from the monastic traditons of old

00:02:56.655 --> 00:02:59.625
and updated them for the modern age.

00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:00.625
Do come and stay!
