00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.250
Okay, it's time to improve
our home town app.

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.480
I'll go ahead and start with
the meta tag for the viewport.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.380
On the left, I've got the code
that you started with, and

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.660
on the right, I've got my modifications.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.190
I added the meta tag with
the name viewport, and then I

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.150
set the content to width equals device
width and the initial scale equals 1.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.860
Okay, well, that wasn't too hard.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.910
Let's see what's next.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.410
Now I need to make some
adjustments to my CSS and

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.340
markup so
that everything fits in a single column.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.980
I'll be sure to use relative widths.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.320
To do so I'm going to open up a page
in DevTools and make my changes there.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.430
Here's the page in its original state.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.110
And now, I've got DevTools open.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.030
One of the cool features of DevTools
is that when I hover over elements in

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.090
the Elements pane, I can also
see them selected on the page.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.870
That's pretty helpful.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.920
When I'm hovering over the header here,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.440
I can see that the header takes up
the entire width of the viewport.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.060
So that seems pretty responsive, but
I want to check out what's inside it.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.010
hah.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.780
Inside it I see this
header inner element.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.769
And that's not taking up the entire
viewport like we want it.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.470
I think I might need to make a change.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.490
On the right hand side I can
see header inner CSS, and

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.460
it's width is set to a fixed 800 pixels.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.640
That's not right.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.530
I double click to change it.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.160
And we'll change it to 100%.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.280
Great.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.270
Now, when I hover over it,

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.240
I see that the header inner is
the entire width of the viewport.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.650
So far, so good.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.150
Coming down on the page,
we come up to the nav.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.130
And when it's selected,

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.650
it's pretty clear that it's
not the whole viewport width.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.500
On the right side, we can see its CSS.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.390
And the width is set
to a fixed 800 pixels.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.600
Just like before,
I'll set its width to 100%.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.640
And now when I select it,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.680
it looks pretty clear that the nav is
now taking up the full viewport width.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.210
The header and the nav are looking good,
I'll come down to main, and once again

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.395
we can see that main is set to a fixed
width of 800 pixels, now with a width of

00:01:57.395 --> 00:02:01.160
100%, I can see that the main is taking
up the entire width of the viewport.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.040
Nice, and side main content looks good,
it looks like it's taking up

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.169
the full viewport but
I want to take a look inside too.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:12.590
And now I see the different sections
on the page and there's the hero.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.940
Now the hero seems to
be of a fixed width.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.000
There's a lot of space on the side
it could take up, but it's not.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.980
So I want to make a change.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.699
Its width is set to a fixed 480 pixels.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.330
And when I change it to 100%,
we see it take up the full viewport,

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.590
just like we wanted.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.120
Looking down in the dom I see the top
news section, so I'll click on that.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.940
And once again it's obvious that
the fixed width should be 100%,

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.810
or some other percentage,
and not this fixed width.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:43.470
Okay.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.970
And now the top news takes up
the entire width of the viewport.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.060
That's good.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.970
I have to scroll down a little bit and
then I see sports.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.530
And the scores aren't taking
up the full viewport.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.130
If I click on it,
I can see pretty clearly why right here.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.517
So once again, 100%.

00:03:01.517 --> 00:03:06.340
And now the scores take up
the full viewport, not too bad.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.550
This says push the poor weather
section down really low and

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.340
we've got all this open
space to work with.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.480
So I want to make sure it takes it up.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.170
The width right now is
fixed at 320 pixels.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.730
I can change that to 100%, and now
the weather takes up the full viewport.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.800
Very nice.
And lastly, the recent new

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.200
section is already taking up the full
viewport so, hey, not too bad.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.930
Don't have to do anything there.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.580
Step 1 and Step 2 are done.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.330
For Step 3, I want to make sure
my touch targets are easy to hit.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.320
This means that I want my a tags
to be at least 48 by 48 pixels.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.330
A tags, remember,
are going to be the touch targets,

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.190
because the As are the links.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.440
To do so, I went through the CSS.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.880
On the left there's what I started with,
and

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.160
on the right there's what I ended
up with, and I went ahead and

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.450
added a padding to the a tag
inside the nav class.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.070
I set the padding to 1.5em.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.200
Which means that the padding is
equivalent to 1.5 times the font

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.500
size of the a tag.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.220
If I open up DevTools and check out what
I've done, I can see that the a tag here

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.690
has a nice box around it and its width
is 69 pixels and its height is 54, which

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.620
means that it's bigger than the 48 by
48 I was shooting for, that works for me.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.780
Farther down in the page, I see
the top news item with an A tag and

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.500
I went ahead and
set it's padding to 1.5em as well.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.730
Then I added the second one, inherit
here, that's going to be the left and

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.090
the right padding.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.294
And it's inheriting the padding from
the item that is its container.

00:04:42.294 --> 00:04:45.720
With DevTools open it's pretty clear
the touch target there is great.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.360
Good.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.470
Let's move on.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.270
There's another A tag inside
the snippet title class.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.980
So once again we'll set
its padding to 1.5em.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.800
And then of course one
last time at the bottom of

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.820
the page there's an a tag in the footer
so, one more change to the padding.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.990
Let's take a look at
the page in its full glory.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.180
The page looks really good on mobile.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.920
I can scroll up and down and

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.050
see that all of the content fits
the viewport width we've got here.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.600
Of course, if the page gets a lot wider,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.980
then things start to get a little
ridiculous, but that's okay.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.880
Now just to be clear, when you start
comparing your CSS to our CSS,

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.210
you might actually see some
differences between them.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.840
And that's okay, there is more than
one way to solve this problem.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.050
And in fact, the CSS that I ended
up with in my main .css file,

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.015
is actually slightly different than
the changes I made inside DevTools.

00:05:37.015 --> 00:05:39.760
DevTools are a great place to start,
but of course in the end,

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.310
you need to make your changes to code.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.110
And I well, made a few changes.
