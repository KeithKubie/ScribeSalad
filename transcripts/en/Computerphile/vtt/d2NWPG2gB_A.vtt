00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.060
A movie has just come out called 
"The Imitation Game"

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.480
starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan
Turing and

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.460
Keira Knightley as one of the the team that 
worked with Turing -  her name was Joan Clarke.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.519
[ALAN TURING: ... five minutes and 34 seconds ...]

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.029
[JOAN CLARKE: ... you said to do it in under six ...]
And I'm sure many of you know

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.359
Alan Turing worked at the Government Code
and Cypher Centre at Bletchley Park

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.740
throughout the war, right from when it
broke out in 1939

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.000
right through until the end the war 
in 1945.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.579
Alan Turing was at Princeton doing
research with another

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.860
very famous mathematical logician called
Alonzo Church.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.110
He returned from Princeton in 1938 but
even in that year,

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.390
from '38 to '39, it's very clear

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.739
that he was contacted by GC &amp; CS

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.829
even though he wasn't employed by them.
And became a sort of

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.520
consultant; became acquainted with all
the difficulties that were going to

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.350
hit the Allies when war broke out
- as seemed 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.979
inevitable - in deciphering German

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.490
ciphers that had been done on this Enigma
machine. Now an awful lot of the material

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.770
that I'm going to be using today, really,
uses as a reference book

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.860
this one by Andrew Hodges. It's called 
"Alan Turing - the enigma"

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.970
This has been reprinted, republished - I
think in a slightly newer edition -

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.970
because "The Imitation Game" is based

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.220
on this account of Turing's life.
Now, Enigma goes back a long way.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.079
Prior to its use by the German armed
forces it was just a simple commercial

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.869
cipher machine and it was a pretty
reasonable system

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.180
but I suppose you could say the number of
possibilities - the

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.350
degree to which it scrambled up the
message, was considerable

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.799
but not ultra, ultra safe,

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.740
I think it was a machine that - as they
say in the cryptological trade -

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.170
was designed to discourage casual snooping

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.430
rather than to withstand serious
attention from experts in the field.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.789
And what I want to do is to go through
with you, in this video,

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.460
the components of the system and then in
the later one

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.880
summarise and say: "That's the problem
they were up against -

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.820
how do you make a machine that could
help you decipher

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.850
that code if you didn't know the settings
of the machines that created it

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.220
in the first place?" I'm going to cross-refer
you to some footage on our sister channel,

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.470
Numberphile. James Grime has done a couple
of videos,

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.200
on Numberphile, which actually use
a real-live Enigma machine that

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.950
belongs to Simon Singh.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.330
Lucky James gets to use the real thing
and I would strongly recommend,

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.560
if you're puzzled by all of this, go and 
watch those two videos.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.220
One of them is just a generalized introduction

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.830
to the Enigma, the other one 
explains precisely why

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.580
the Enigma machine's big flaw was that it
could never encipher

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.690
a letter as itself. Believe it or
not that is a big, big security flaw,

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.920
and does provide a way in, for people who
want to crack that particular code.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.610
The Enigma itself looks, at first sight, a bit
like an ordinary typewriter. It's got a typewriter

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.880
board layout, there's typewriter keys,

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.670
but you then notice that if you switch it on - and
it is battery powered -

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.430
in the area just above the keys, instead of having
26 further keys, you have 26

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.680
places where a lamp can light up a letter.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.549
So you might press a T and it will light 
up as a G.

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.370
What else is there, inside this machine. How
does the key-press

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.860
get through to illuminating a lamp? Well
in the most amazing and convoluted way.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.950
There's a set of rotors here. These
rotors have 26 alphabetic letters

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.620
engraved around the circumference.
Sometimes you don't get letters you

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.290
get numbers 0, 1, ... through to 26, but it 
comes down to the same thing in the end.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.049
When the lid is closed on top of them
the letter - as it were - pointing

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.370
upwards on the rotor

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.140
anywhere between A to Z, shows up in
three identical

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.610
looking windows. Perhaps the easiest way
to think of it - even

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.100
for those of you viewing who are relatively 
young - can you remember back to your family's first

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.220
ever car?

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.609
Where it had an old-fashioned
odometer, you know, a mileage indicator

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:22.720
on the dashboard

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.190
which wasn't all done in electronics, it
was actually driven off the engine

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.270
and you actually had little wheels
moving in front of you?

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.400
On the right-hand side would be the tenths
of a mile, or tenths of a

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.830
kilometre, and every time that had got 
up to a 9 it would nudge

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.449
the dial to the left of it, to move on one
place, and so on.

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:44.780
The principle is exactly the same on the Enigma.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.139
The right-hand rotor moves the fastest

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.840
and at a certain stage will nudge the
next one

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.490
into moving on a notch. The left hand
rotor is the slowest moving of all

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.000
and once the lid is closed on the Enigma, all
you see is the

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.389
letter on the rotor that's uppermost

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:05.680
showing through the windows

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.180
at the top. Now - complication upon complication,

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.669
Within each rotor there is, if you like,

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.690
on the two sides, an input stud and
an output stud,

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.990
and they are cross-wired. If you could 
break open

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.330
as is shown here, the rotor mechanism,

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.289
you would see a whole bunch of 26 wires, in there,

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.850
which are cross-wiring an input stud

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.699
to an output stud. So you might get A, cross wired

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.050
to J, B cross-wired to Q,

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.150
C cross-wired to W - something like that.
When Enigma first came out there

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.509
were three sorts of rotor wheel

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:51.199
numbered I, II, and III, in Roman
numerals, typically,

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:54.400
in the German instruction manuals. 
A rotor of type

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.289
II would not be cross-wired in the same way

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:02.710
as a rotor of type I. And similarly
a rotor of type III would be a completely

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.259
different cross-wiring.

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:08.229
I think many of you will know the number of ways
you can arrange three things on a

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:09.250
spindle like that

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:14.639
is 3 factorial, which is 6.  Six possible 
orderings of the rotors on the spindle.

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:20.419
So you can begin to see the multiplication 
of the number of combinations

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:23.870
about how this thing could be set
up in the first place.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.260
You've got different orderings on the spindle;
you've got different cross-wirings on the

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.740
different sorts of rotors.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.889
So for the very basic machine, then, that

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:35.099
was just about it. You fed the

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:40.439
signals through the right-most rotor
through the middle rotor with a different

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:44.400
cross-wiring and mapping, through the
left-hand rotor

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.409
and then there was what the Germans called
a 'reverser',

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:52.349
sometimes in English called the 'reflector'.
What it would do

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:56.349
was to return the signal back via a different

00:06:56.349 --> 00:07:00.169
stud on the left-hand rotor so it would take a
different

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:03.689
journey back through the machine to the
way it came in.

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:07.279
Now here is the secret of why

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:11.150
it never mapped a letter to itself. It
couldn't because,

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.840
to make that effect happen, you'd have had
in the reflector drum here,

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.680
to say "Ah! it's coming out of the A slot;
I'm going to return it back

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.469
through the A slot". It wasn't electrically
set up to

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:28.240
enable you to do that. You effectively had
to decide

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.969
to cross-wire in that reflector

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:35.610
to something different. And I think, here,
if you look carefully

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:39.050
A is actually cross-wired to something like W.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:44.539
Now, in the early 3-rotor Enigma, that
reflector had fixed cross-wirings

00:07:44.539 --> 00:07:48.159
which were the same in all Enigma machines.

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:51.189
So, your current goes back through a different route

00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:55.300
and then, finally, lights up a lamp
on the lamp array

00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:01.050
just ahead on the keyboard. over here  So that's 
the way it was up until about the mid-thirties.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.819
But then, as the German armed forces were
taking more and more interest

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:09.069
in these things, and saying: "Oh, if we could beef
them up these could be made into

00:08:09.069 --> 00:08:11.180
military grade security devices",

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.389
they did two things. First thing, they said

00:08:14.389 --> 00:08:17.490
we're not just going to have three rotors in

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:22.330
six combinations, we're  going to do the
following: were going to invent two more rotors

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.360
called IV and V, amazingly :-) 
Here's what you now do:

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.500
We will choose any three out of those five rotors

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:35.079
- well the ways of picking three from five is
five times four over one times two

00:08:35.079 --> 00:08:38.460
Five factorial over three factorial [times two factorial]
The answer's 10.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:43.349
But for each of those 10 ways, you can still
jumble them up in six ways on the spindle.

00:08:43.349 --> 00:08:47.270
Ten times six is sixty, so classic

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:50.490
Army-Airforce Enigma

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:54.940
used this pretty well throughout the war.
You chose three from five

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:58.040
and the three you chose could be put on 
the spindle

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.250
in a certain way. Now comes the real killer.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:04.860
If that wasn't bad enough, the armed forces decided

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.220
that on the input to the machine and on the output

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:12.260
they would have another cross-wiring
board, called the Plugboard.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.960
Now this one's simple to understand. It's
basically got sockets

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.240
numbered from A to Z and you're given
chunks of wire.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.260
If the instructions say crosslink A

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.430
to J, that's what you did. Crosslink B

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:30.060
to R, you did that as well. In usual 
operating practice

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.360
10 out of 13 of those plugs

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.060
would be cross-wired and wired up. You could
wire up in the pairs but you didn't

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:42.810
absolutely have to wire up everything. If
you left something

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.670
unwired - or 'unsteckered' as they would say in German -

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:52.400
then that's fine. I mean a letter Q might have
no plug in it - going absolutely nowhere.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.730
Fine. So Q maps to Q - it's not altered
to anything else at all.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:01.110
But, like I said, typically 10 out of 13
would be wired up.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:05.480
So this is getting to be a pretty
complex machine now

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:10.370
and you would think: "By golly! surely this
is enough security for anybody?"

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.730
Well, what's good enough

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:17.580
for the Army and the Air Force in almost
any armed forces in the world

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:22.800
is never good enough for the Navy! I think
it's that case in the UK - it's certainly that

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.960
way in the US,

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.360
and it certainly was that way in Germany.
Admiral

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.260
Karl Doenitz who was the head

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:33.740
of the German Navy, was a very smart guy. Some
people theorize - and maybe they're right -

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.160
that he strongly suspected

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.570
as the war went on, that maybe Army and
Airforce Enigma was being

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:45.040
decrypted successfully, sometimes, by the
Allies, and he was determined

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.610
to make the German Navy version of Enigma 
far harder.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:53.870
So, first thing he did was to say: "All right,
we'll stick with three rotors for the moment

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.310
but it isn't choose 3 from 5, it's choose

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:00.720
3 from 8", And and by the time you've worked it

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.030
out, how many ways to pick 3 from 8,
and then multiply by 6 for the number

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.680
of ways you can arrange the three you've 
chosen on the spindle,

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.480
the answer is 336.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:16.330
And that's daunting! One of the things, I think,
does need a bit of careful explanation -

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.450
it's not very well done

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:23.140
in the various books about Bletchley Park
and Enigma, and how it worked -

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.360
is to explain what these so-called 'ring
settings' were.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.690
Now the straightforward, internal, 
cross-wiring is simple:

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:34.640
you just look at the top row and for every
letter you follow

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:38.660
vertically downwards and you say: "Okay, in
a Type I rotor

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:42.030
A on one side gets mapped to

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:46.170
E on the opposite side. B gets mapped to K;

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:50.020
C gets mapped to M - all the way through to 

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:55.640
Z gets mapped to J ". But to complicate 
matters just a little bit further

00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:00.240
every one of these rotor rings had a
little blob of paint associated with

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.060
it showing

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.070
which was the proper setting. with A at
the top and A against the dot of

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:08.530
paint, but it had the ability to

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:12.260
be able to turn the thing in such way

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.780
that instead of A being against the canonical blob

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.980
something else was So, so you could

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.210
set a little notch that held it in position,

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:27.210
but in a place that actually was not
the standard position.

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:31.170
If you put your button - your ring-setting
button - against the letter B

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:34.840
it had the effect of making A map across
to what

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:39.780
B would normally have turned into. B would 
normally have turned into K.

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:43.050
B goes to M; C goes to F; D goes to L and so on.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:47.300
It's just an offsetting mechanism.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:52.140
It's just moving, as it were, the bunch of
wires inside

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:55.250
the rotor. So, that is what a 'ring setting' is.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:13:01.040
It's basically an initial offset, that
changes the mapping ever so subtly -

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:06.950
makes things even more complicated. The  final
bit of complication now, just so that we're

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:08.810
completely mind-blown and

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:12.430
think: "How on earth could this ever be decrypted
by anybody?"

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:16.110
You might think that just as a car's odometer

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:19.990
would go all the way up to 9, on the
right-hand side and the moment it

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:24.210
turns over at 9 it would nudge the
next one on the left, some bright spark

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:27.410
had the idea that it might give more security

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:31.360
if you made different wheel types have
different turnover points.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.720
And Doenitz's extra rotors VI, VII and VIII -

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.530
even worse - they turn over twice!

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.530
Once at Z, and once at M - in the middle of
the alphabet.

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.700
Actually it's not a good idea if you
think about it.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.740
And I'll tell you why. Imagine you know -

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.310
because you've done a lot of work on this - you're pretty
sure that at the moment

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:54.350
the machine has got a Type I rotor at the right.

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:57.820
And you're also pretty sure from the
cryptanalytical working

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:02.080
done, that it's currently on the letter N.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.260
You then type in three more of the

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:09.000
received ciphertext letters.  And you
suddenly see - 

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.040
you suddenly find things going completely weird.
This isn't just the same wheel

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.000
turning, something's happening,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.340
It shouldn't have come out looking like this - 
this sequence! Argh! 

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:27.120
it's turned over the middle rotor, so if I
think it was on N and

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.500
it's turned over the middle rotor on a Q,

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:35.070
then it follows that that right-hand
rotor must be of Type I

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:40.250
and I wanted to know that all along. So
these turnover points, because they weren't

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:44.720
all at Z to A, which would have
made it all look uniform,

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.460
you know, whenever anything turns over
that's the way it does it,

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:54.330
had this little signature that if you're very
careful in your cryptanalysis gives the game away.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:57.330
How is this all gathered together? If

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.500
you were very lucky, in the very early days
of the war,

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:05.330
you didn't even have to try and cryptanalyse
this incoming ciphertext traffic -

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:10.720
either by hand or by machine. If you
could do what Bletchley Park called

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.100
'a pinch', If you could actually get a secret agent
or an army officer

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:18.060
to just accidentally be able to get hold
of the code tables,

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:22.180
issued to the German armed forces, you
didn't have to do any cryptanalysis at all

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:27.690
either by hand or by using this very
expensive machinery that we'll be talking

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:28.840
about next time,

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.610
this electro-mecanical Bombe. You didn't have 
to use those

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:35.640
it's all here. But as James makes very clear

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:36.390
in his videos

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:39.530
If you did get that bit of luck it never
lasted long;

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:42.890
you maybe got a month's worth and then a
it ran out, or

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:47.100
someone back at headquarters said: "I'm not happy, 
one of our code books seems to have been

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.550
stolen and disappeared.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:53.200
I'll tell you what, even though there's six 
months to go on it, we're throwning it away and

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.390
issuing another one -

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:58.770
just to be on the safe side". 
We've assumed and it's quite right

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:02.940
that the good thing about Enigma
from the cryptanalysis point of view

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:07.250
it started off life as a commercially available 
totally open machine so

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:10.460
you might think: "Well the wiring inside those
rotors then -

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:13.710
three of the rotors at least, I, II and III -
would be known?"

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:19.290
Yes, but of course the moment the Luftwaffe and 
the Army started

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:22.870
introducing two more rotors you've then got
the problem

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:27.400
of "Can we steal these things or do we
have to work out from first principles,

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:32.500
and with rather a lot of advanced Group
Theory and mathematics, and a lot of known

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:37.030
ciphertext and plaintext, and all sorts - 
can we work out what the wiring is

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:41.050
in those rotors without actually having
them?" And the answer is,

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:44.260
eventually, "Yes", but it's very very nice

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:48.220
if somebody helps you on this front.
What did you need

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:52.170
to know in order to decrypt a cipher stream

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:56.890
done within Enigma, that your listening
stations had picked up ?.

00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:00.150
It was transmitted in Morse as single letters

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:04.480
sent to Bletchley Park - what do you need to
know to make any sense of this?

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.180
Number 1:  which rotor wheels are in use?

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:11.670
Number 2: what is the ordering,

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:16.310
left to right, of those rotor wheels ?
Number 3:

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:20.410
for each of those rotor wheels where has
that stud

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:22.559
been located that does the ring

00:17:22.559 --> 00:17:28.029
setting - against which letter ? 
The fourth thing, which 

00:17:28.029 --> 00:17:32.490
we haven't mentioned very much, but which
in the next video we'll say a lot about

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:36.860
the operator himself - usually himself
not herself - 

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:40.870
had to also do what was called a 
'message setting'.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:44.309
for this particular message. Every

00:17:44.309 --> 00:17:47.629
separate message had to have a different
message setting.

00:17:47.629 --> 00:17:51.240
It wouldn't have been safe just to keep
using the ring settings alone

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:55.889
without any alteration to those. So
that had to be worked out as well.

00:17:55.889 --> 00:18:01.169
And finally - last but not least - the plug
board cross-connections had to be worked out.

00:18:01.169 --> 00:18:06.049
Now that's a lot of stuff. In the very
early days of simple Enigma,

00:18:06.049 --> 00:18:09.049
where therw were only three rotors, not
chosen from anything else,

00:18:09.049 --> 00:18:14.229
just three, we'll find out next time that
the Polish Cipher Bureau had a lot of success

00:18:14.299 --> 00:18:17.759
by hand, and with a very simple machine, in

00:18:17.759 --> 00:18:23.019
getting things decrypted. But the
moment you start adding more rotors,

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:27.090
plugboard and all the complications you
rapidly find

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:31.869
the you just don't have enough time in
the day to decrypt all that you'd like to do.

00:18:31.869 --> 00:18:34.929
The sheer weight of cipher traffic takes over.

00:18:34.929 --> 00:18:38.490
You have to mechanise.
