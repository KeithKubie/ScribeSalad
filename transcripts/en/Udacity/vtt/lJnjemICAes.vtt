Let's talk about remote work. Part two of
three.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.050
Welcome back to another episode of
"Udacity Career Tips" my name is Martin

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.250
McGovern, and today we are going to be
addressing part two of an audience

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.930
question about remote work. This question
comes from LinkedIn and asks, "What are

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.419
the efforts that one has to put in in
order to achieve a remote job?". This is a

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.560
big question and one we won't be able to
fully cover in a video like this but I

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.310
did put the question to the LinkedIn
community and got some responses from

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.870
folks to hear how they found their first
remote job. The majority of people who

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.070
responded said that they got their first
remote job by turning their in-person

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.720
job into a remote position. Now, the way
they did this was that they showed a

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.850
history of accomplishing their tasks, and
self-management. They had a good rapport

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.870
with their boss. And they started small.
They started doing a couple days a week

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.010
from home, before eventually
transitioning completely into a remote

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.850
position. Now, if you're looking for your
first job, you're looking to change

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.549
industries, or you're just looking for
your first remote gig and you don't have

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.030
one right now; it's gonna be a bit hard
to turn your current job that you don't

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.340
have into a remote job. So, what can you
do to help improve your chances? The real

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.319
difficulty in finding a remote job is
building trust with the person that you

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:24.770
don't get to sit down with one-on-one. In
an in-person interview or an office

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.549
environment you get to interact with a
lot of people in the room, so it's easy

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.450
to get a sense of who you are, how you
act, and how well you fit in. But, if your

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.950
remote, you don't get to have that
face-to-face contact. So, as you're

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.999
thinking about applying for remote jobs,
your online personal brand is going to

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:43.999
be extremely important.
Are there any videos that I can watch?

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:48.799
Any audio I can listen to? Any projects
that I can interact with to see who you

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.749
are, how you work, and the type of a tone
that you bring to a team? So, if you're

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:57.200
really interested in getting a remote
job, and you don't have a job that you

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.609
can turn into a remote job at this time,
be focused on building a personal brand

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:06.770
that showcases who you are, so you remove
doubt and increase trust in the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.819
conversations that you're having.

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.769
If you have anything to add to this
point please put it in the comments. This

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.480
is part two of a three-part question so
join us again next week as we answer

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.189
part 3. Which is the pros and cons of a
remote job - and a little bit of a teaser,

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:29.129
I work remote! So, I have a bit of a
insight into that one. We also are really

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.060
excited to be collecting questions from
you to answer in future videos so please

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.989
put those in the comments as well. We
appreciate you for watching and wish you

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.609
the best of luck in your job search!
