 [Applause] 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.320
 ah 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.610
 [Music] 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:41.280
 but if they like it too much one day 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:44.070
 being strange to see a child of 78 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:52.249
 years already in that 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:52.249
 [Music] 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.040
 when there are for commands I always 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.900
 I take the shirt from the controls and 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:04.269
 put because they respect respect 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:20.600
 in still 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:21.420

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.209
 i 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.209
 [Music] 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:34.270
 sometimes it's a very difficult decision the 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.850
 even think you can go to a place that 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.380
 he does not know the world 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.380
 we could lose your life 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.720
 you want to help others but 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.670
 you also want to protect people 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:53.450
 who are under touching me during turns 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:54.840
 [Music] 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.099
 do not 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.099
 [Music] 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:05.210
 we ask him to give us the blessing of 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.070
 grant us to fulfill the mission that 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.110
 we have embraced and that we do 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.440
 voluntarily and with all the love for 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.800
 to be able to fulfill with that the prayer of 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.480
 command is something very cute and has a 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.260
 great meaning for all those who 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.260
 we are commands 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.099
