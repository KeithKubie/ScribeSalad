manages to to create internal coherence
 

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:15.960
manages to to create internal coherence
so the different reactions different

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:15.970
so the different reactions different
 

00:51:15.970 --> 00:51:18.450
so the different reactions different
steps in metabolism for example happen

oxidative reduction reactions are

00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:24.580
oxidative reduction reactions are
 

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:27.270
oxidative reduction reactions are
happiest when they're separated in time

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280
happiest when they're separated in time
 

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:34.050
happiest when they're separated in time
and so circadian rhythms arose a long

00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:34.060
and so circadian rhythms arose a long
 

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:37.260
and so circadian rhythms arose a long
time ago in response of course to this

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:37.270
time ago in response of course to this
 

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:39.990

what's currently available on our planet

00:51:50.039 --> 00:51:50.049
what's currently available on our planet
 

00:51:50.049 --> 00:51:53.789
what's currently available on our planet
and well before the atmosphere had its

00:51:53.789 --> 00:51:53.799
and well before the atmosphere had its
 

00:51:53.799 --> 00:51:57.769
and well before the atmosphere had its
current gaseous constitution and in fact

00:51:57.769 --> 00:51:57.779
current gaseous constitution and in fact
 

00:51:57.779 --> 00:52:01.950

the oldest clock we know the clock in
cyanobacteria really participated in

00:52:05.299 --> 00:52:05.309
cyanobacteria really participated in
 

00:52:05.309 --> 00:52:08.789
cyanobacteria really participated in
oxygenation of the atmosphere so 2

00:52:08.789 --> 00:52:08.799
oxygenation of the atmosphere so 2
 

00:52:08.799 --> 00:52:12.120
oxygenation of the atmosphere so 2
billion years ago we lived in a we lived

00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:12.130
billion years ago we lived in a we lived
 

00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:15.809

the planet experienced a reducing

00:52:15.809 --> 00:52:15.819
the planet experienced a reducing
 

00:52:15.819 --> 00:52:17.670
the planet experienced a reducing
atmosphere and it was really

00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:17.680

cyanobacteria with the aid of its clock
 

00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:24.479
cyanobacteria with the aid of its clock
that produced the oxygen that enabled

00:52:24.479 --> 00:52:24.489
that produced the oxygen that enabled
 

00:52:24.489 --> 00:52:28.190
that produced the oxygen that enabled
life as we currently know it to arise

00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200
life as we currently know it to arise
 

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:34.140
life as we currently know it to arise
and so clocks exist really in different

00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:34.150
and so clocks exist really in different
 

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:37.499
and so clocks exist really in different
kingdoms not only in bacteria as I just

00:52:37.499 --> 00:52:37.509
kingdoms not only in bacteria as I just
 

00:52:37.509 --> 00:52:41.609
kingdoms not only in bacteria as I just
alluded to but also in plants and in

00:52:41.609 --> 00:52:41.619
alluded to but also in plants and in
 

00:52:41.619 --> 00:52:44.249
alluded to but also in plants and in
animals which I will focus on and it's

00:52:44.249 --> 00:52:44.259
animals which I will focus on and it's
 

00:52:44.259 --> 00:52:48.269
animals which I will focus on and it's
likely that these clocks arose

00:52:48.269 --> 00:52:48.279
likely that these clocks arose
 

00:52:48.279 --> 00:52:50.519
likely that these clocks arose
independently because there's very

00:52:50.519 --> 00:52:50.529
independently because there's very
 

00:52:50.529 --> 00:52:52.739
independently because there's very
little evidence of a relationship

00:52:52.739 --> 00:52:52.749
little evidence of a relationship
 

00:52:52.749 --> 00:52:55.319
little evidence of a relationship
especially between the cyanobacterial

00:52:55.319 --> 00:52:55.329
especially between the cyanobacterial
 

00:52:55.329 --> 00:52:58.440
especially between the cyanobacterial
clock and animal clocks and probably

00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:58.450
clock and animal clocks and probably
 

00:52:58.450 --> 00:53:00.479
clock and animal clocks and probably
even the plant clocks arose

00:53:00.479 --> 00:53:00.489
even the plant clocks arose
 

00:53:00.489 --> 00:53:03.559
even the plant clocks arose
independently so this is such a powerful

00:53:03.559 --> 00:53:03.569
independently so this is such a powerful
 

00:53:03.569 --> 00:53:07.339
independently so this is such a powerful
such a powerful contribution to fitness

00:53:07.339 --> 00:53:07.349
such a powerful contribution to fitness
 

00:53:07.349 --> 00:53:10.259
such a powerful contribution to fitness
that it arose in these independent lines

00:53:10.259 --> 00:53:10.269
that it arose in these independent lines
 

00:53:10.269 --> 00:53:15.410
that it arose in these independent lines
and so a simple systems view of

00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:15.420
and so a simple systems view of

mention of transcription and the way we

01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:16.680
mention of transcription and the way we
 

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:20.130
mention of transcription and the way we
imagined this was that it could work at

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:20.140
imagined this was that it could work at
 

01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:22.200
imagined this was that it could work at
the post transcriptional level for

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:22.210
the post transcriptional level for
 

01:03:22.210 --> 01:03:25.110
the post transcriptional level for
example maybe messenger RNA half-life

01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:25.120
example maybe messenger RNA half-life
 

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:30.150

was affected was regulated and not

01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:30.160
was affected was regulated and not
 

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:32.010
was affected was regulated and not
transcription it could be transcription

01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:32.020
transcription it could be transcription
 

01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.980
transcription it could be transcription
and moreover it could be indirect in

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:34.990
and moreover it could be indirect in
 

01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:37.050
and moreover it could be indirect in
other words the period protein could

01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:37.060
other words the period protein could
 

01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:39.540
other words the period protein could
affect these things directly but perhaps

01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:39.550
affect these things directly but perhaps
 

01:03:39.550 --> 01:03:41.550
affect these things directly but perhaps
the period protein affects another

01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:41.560
the period protein affects another
 

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.680
the period protein affects another
protein which is actually the direct

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:43.690
protein which is actually the direct
 

01:03:43.690 --> 01:03:48.270
protein which is actually the direct
regulator or a most indirect if you will

01:03:48.270 --> 01:03:48.280
regulator or a most indirect if you will
 

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:51.090
regulator or a most indirect if you will
is that the period protein could

01:03:51.090 --> 01:03:51.100
is that the period protein could
 

01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:53.340
is that the period protein could
influence behavior which could in fact

01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:53.350
influence behavior which could in fact
 

01:03:53.350 --> 01:03:57.000
influence behavior which could in fact
feed back and affect the molecular

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:57.010
feed back and affect the molecular
 

01:03:57.010 --> 01:03:59.130
feed back and affect the molecular
oscillations in other words behavior

01:03:59.130 --> 01:03:59.140
oscillations in other words behavior
 

01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:01.110
oscillations in other words behavior
would actually be upstream as opposed to

01:04:01.110 --> 01:04:01.120
would actually be upstream as opposed to
 

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:03.600
would actually be upstream as opposed to
downstream of the molecular oscillations

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:03.610
downstream of the molecular oscillations
 

01:04:03.610 --> 01:04:05.640
downstream of the molecular oscillations
so we were very conservative about this

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:05.650
so we were very conservative about this
 

01:04:05.650 --> 01:04:08.660
so we were very conservative about this
and and it turned out that over the next

01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:08.670
and and it turned out that over the next
 

01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:13.260
and and it turned out that over the next
two or three years that there were three

01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:13.270
two or three years that there were three

really had trouble publishing this paper
 

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:37.440
really had trouble publishing this paper
because everyone assumed this was

in a lengthy genetic screen to try to

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:50.170
in a lengthy genetic screen to try to
 

01:08:50.170 --> 01:08:55.140
in a lengthy genetic screen to try to
find other circadian mutants and we we

01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:55.150
find other circadian mutants and we we
 

01:08:55.150 --> 01:08:57.870
find other circadian mutants and we we
knew about the the remarkable work in

01:08:57.870 --> 01:08:57.880
knew about the the remarkable work in
 

01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:59.610
knew about the the remarkable work in
the young lab and we didn't want to

01:08:59.610 --> 01:08:59.620
the young lab and we didn't want to
 

01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:01.920
the young lab and we didn't want to
duplicate what they were doing looking

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:01.930
duplicate what they were doing looking
 

01:09:01.930 --> 01:09:04.230
duplicate what they were doing looking
for period altered mutations so we

01:09:04.230 --> 01:09:04.240
for period altered mutations so we
 

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:07.349
for period altered mutations so we
actually looked at a rhythmic mutations

01:09:07.349 --> 01:09:07.359
actually looked at a rhythmic mutations
 

01:09:07.359 --> 01:09:09.990
actually looked at a rhythmic mutations
and and it turns out that a rhythmic

01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.000
and and it turns out that a rhythmic
 

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.630
and and it turns out that a rhythmic
mutations are very easy to find we had

01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:12.640
mutations are very easy to find we had
 

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:14.400
mutations are very easy to find we had
more than 40 of them but they're very

01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:14.410
more than 40 of them but they're very
 

01:09:14.410 --> 01:09:17.220
more than 40 of them but they're very
hard to sort out to distinguish

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:17.230
hard to sort out to distinguish
 

01:09:17.230 --> 01:09:19.170
hard to sort out to distinguish
interesting ones from uninteresting ones

01:09:19.170 --> 01:09:19.180
interesting ones from uninteresting ones
 

01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:23.250
interesting ones from uninteresting ones
and so we devised a sub screen and the

01:09:23.250 --> 01:09:23.260
and so we devised a sub screen and the
 

01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:25.349
and so we devised a sub screen and the
sub screen for these mutants was to look

01:09:25.349 --> 01:09:25.359
sub screen for these mutants was to look
 

01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:27.190
sub screen for these mutants was to look
at which

01:09:27.190 --> 01:09:27.200
at which
 

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:30.520
at which
of the strains had non-cycling in very

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:30.530
of the strains had non-cycling in very
 

01:09:30.530 --> 01:09:34.060
of the strains had non-cycling in very
low period and timeless levels the idea

01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:34.070
low period and timeless levels the idea
 

01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:36.520
low period and timeless levels the idea
being that if we had hit upon the

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:36.530
being that if we had hit upon the
 

01:09:36.530 --> 01:09:38.500
being that if we had hit upon the
positive transcription factor we were

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:38.510
positive transcription factor we were
 

01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:42.400
positive transcription factor we were
looking for the X in in our diagram then

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:42.410
looking for the X in in our diagram then
 

01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:44.740
looking for the X in in our diagram then
then there should be no cycling and and

01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:44.750
then there should be no cycling and and
 

01:09:44.750 --> 01:09:47.320
then there should be no cycling and and
low levels and in fact we only found

01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:47.330
low levels and in fact we only found
 

01:09:47.330 --> 01:09:51.310
low levels and in fact we only found
three three mutant strains which met

01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:51.320
three three mutant strains which met
 

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:54.430
three three mutant strains which met
that criterion and two of those turned

01:09:54.430 --> 01:09:54.440
that criterion and two of those turned
 

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:58.000
that criterion and two of those turned
out to be alleles of cycle or B mal the

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:58.010
out to be alleles of cycle or B mal the
 

01:09:58.010 --> 01:10:00.070
out to be alleles of cycle or B mal the
ortholog and mammals and one of them

01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.080
ortholog and mammals and one of them
 

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:03.430
ortholog and mammals and one of them
turned out to be an allele of clock so

01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:03.440
turned out to be an allele of clock so
 

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:07.180
turned out to be an allele of clock so
in fact we we had closed the circle if

01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:07.190
in fact we we had closed the circle if
 

01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:12.460
in fact we we had closed the circle if
you like and and managed to identify the

you like and and managed to identify the
 

01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:14.530
you like and and managed to identify the
positive transcription factor the

01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:14.540
positive transcription factor the
 

01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:16.900
positive transcription factor the
heterodimer that drives period and

01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:16.910
heterodimer that drives period and
 

01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:19.360
heterodimer that drives period and
timeless which then represses clock and

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:19.370
timeless which then represses clock and
 

01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:21.610
timeless which then represses clock and
cycle and it turns out three of the same

01:10:21.610 --> 01:10:21.620
cycle and it turns out three of the same
 

01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:24.550
cycle and it turns out three of the same
four proteins function in the same way

01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560
four proteins function in the same way
 

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:27.520
four proteins function in the same way
in the same way in in mammals and so

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:27.530
in the same way in in mammals and so
 

01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:30.880
in the same way in in mammals and so
this is really conserved in the five

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:30.890
this is really conserved in the five
 

01:10:30.890 --> 01:10:32.830
this is really conserved in the five

an activator leas gives rise to the
synthesis of a repressor which then

surprisingly there's a delay between the
association of the activator and the

01:12:36.259 --> 01:12:36.269
association of the activator and the
 

01:12:36.269 --> 01:12:38.449
association of the activator and the
subsequent Association of the repressors

01:12:38.449 --> 01:12:38.459
subsequent Association of the repressors
 

01:12:38.459 --> 01:12:40.489
subsequent Association of the repressors
so the repressors build up and then

01:12:40.489 --> 01:12:40.499
so the repressors build up and then
 

01:12:40.499 --> 01:12:43.279
so the repressors build up and then
associate to turn off transcription and

01:12:43.279 --> 01:12:43.289
associate to turn off transcription and
 

01:12:43.289 --> 01:12:45.469
associate to turn off transcription and
it turns out to be to be quite

01:12:45.469 --> 01:12:45.479
it turns out to be to be quite
 

01:12:45.479 --> 01:12:48.739
it turns out to be to be quite
interesting that the profile if one does

great feature of association and so

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:21.570
great feature of association and so
 

01:13:21.570 --> 01:13:25.100

there's something that's very different

day as Jeff indicated these fruit flies

01:17:26.799 --> 01:17:26.809
day as Jeff indicated these fruit flies
 

01:17:26.809 --> 01:17:31.359

in the evening and that and then sleep

01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:33.800
in the evening and that and then sleep
 

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:36.970
in the evening and that and then sleep
at night and all that whole profile is

01:17:36.970 --> 01:17:36.980
at night and all that whole profile is
 

01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:40.089
at night and all that whole profile is
really controlled by those 75 neurons

01:17:40.089 --> 01:17:40.099
really controlled by those 75 neurons
 

01:17:40.099 --> 01:17:47.560

were out on and I were out on a hike a

01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:17.970
were out on and I were out on a hike a
 

01:29:17.970 --> 01:29:21.950
were out on and I were out on a hike a
few summers ago in New Mexico and we

01:29:21.950 --> 01:29:21.960
few summers ago in New Mexico and we
 

01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:23.720
few summers ago in New Mexico and we
came across this whoops

01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:23.730
came across this whoops
 

01:29:23.730 --> 01:29:28.910
came across this whoops
came across this plant which is called

01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:28.920
came across this plant which is called
 

01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:33.260
came across this plant which is called
the Colorado four o'clock and what I

01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:33.270
the Colorado four o'clock and what I
 

01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:34.670
the Colorado four o'clock and what I
want you to notice is that all the

01:29:34.670 --> 01:29:34.680
want you to notice is that all the
 

01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:38.390
want you to notice is that all the
blooms are closed and notice this this

01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400
blooms are closed and notice this this
 

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:42.530
blooms are closed and notice this this
little branch here I'm not I'm playing

01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:42.540

straight this is it two o'clock when

01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360
straight this is it two o'clock when
 

01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:47.270
straight this is it two o'clock when
we're going out on the hike two hours

01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280
we're going out on the hike two hours
 

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:49.840
we're going out on the hike two hours
later a few hours later we come back and

01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:49.850
later a few hours later we come back and
 

01:29:49.850 --> 01:29:54.550
later a few hours later we come back and
we see this at 6 p.m. so this remarkable

01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560
we see this at 6 p.m. so this remarkable
 

01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:59.240
we see this at 6 p.m. so this remarkable
plant rhythm is believed to be due to

01:29:59.240 --> 01:29:59.250
plant rhythm is believed to be due to
 

01:29:59.250 --> 01:30:04.720
plant rhythm is believed to be due to
the behavior of the pollinator hawkmoth

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:04.730
the behavior of the pollinator hawkmoth
 

01:30:04.730 --> 01:30:08.600
the behavior of the pollinator hawkmoth
which is active at night in the evenings

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:08.610
which is active at night in the evenings
 

01:30:08.610 --> 01:30:10.430
which is active at night in the evenings
and of course you're in a desert

01:30:10.430 --> 01:30:10.440
and of course you're in a desert
 

01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:12.320
and of course you're in a desert
environment that's arid water is

01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:12.330
environment that's arid water is
 

01:30:12.330 --> 01:30:16.760
environment that's arid water is
precious and it takes water pumped into

01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:16.770
precious and it takes water pumped into
 

01:30:16.770 --> 01:30:19.580
precious and it takes water pumped into
the petals of those leaves to open them

01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:19.590
the petals of those leaves to open them
 

01:30:19.590 --> 01:30:21.650
the petals of those leaves to open them
up so this appears to be a strategy it

01:30:21.650 --> 01:30:21.660
up so this appears to be a strategy it
 

01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:24.590
up so this appears to be a strategy it
seems to conserve water in an arid

01:30:24.590 --> 01:30:24.600
seems to conserve water in an arid
 

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:25.910
seems to conserve water in an arid
environment and have those blooms

01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920
environment and have those blooms
 

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:28.130
environment and have those blooms
available for pollination at times that

01:30:28.130 --> 01:30:28.140
available for pollination at times that
 

01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:29.960
available for pollination at times that
makes sense with regard to the behavior

01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:29.970
makes sense with regard to the behavior
 

01:30:29.970 --> 01:30:34.430
makes sense with regard to the behavior
of your pollinator another example of

01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:34.440
of your pollinator another example of
 

01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:38.920
of your pollinator another example of
these rhythms that are all around us is

01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:38.930
these rhythms that are all around us is
 

01:30:38.930 --> 01:30:42.650
these rhythms that are all around us is

with entries in a sleep log that's kept
 

01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:27.439
with entries in a sleep log that's kept
by the bed so that each day or evening

when the end of a individual gets into
 

01:45:30.119 --> 01:45:34.339
when the end of a individual gets into
bed they marked the time down and when

bed they marked the time down and when
 

01:45:34.349 --> 01:45:35.810
bed they marked the time down and when
they get out of bed they put another

they get out of bed they put another
 

01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:38.049
they get out of bed they put another
mark in the log so we have two

01:45:38.049 --> 01:45:38.059
mark in the log so we have two
 

01:45:38.059 --> 01:45:42.529

correlated pieces of data to consider so

01:45:42.529 --> 01:45:42.539
correlated pieces of data to consider so
 

01:45:42.539 --> 01:45:45.500
correlated pieces of data to consider so
the way the data are plotted here is to

the way the data are plotted here is to
 

01:45:45.510 --> 01:45:48.250
the way the data are plotted here is to
plot not just 24 hours but 48 hour

01:45:48.250 --> 01:45:48.260
plot not just 24 hours but 48 hour
 

01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:51.830
plot not just 24 hours but 48 hour
intervals in this process and what this

01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840
intervals in this process and what this
 

01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:55.339
intervals in this process and what this
allows us to do is compare the time that

01:45:55.339 --> 01:45:55.349
allows us to do is compare the time that
 

01:45:55.349 --> 01:45:57.319
allows us to do is compare the time that
each end that the individual is getting

01:45:57.319 --> 01:45:57.329
each end that the individual is getting
 

01:45:57.329 --> 01:45:59.540
each end that the individual is getting
into bed with the time that the

01:45:59.540 --> 01:45:59.550
into bed with the time that the
 

01:45:59.550 --> 01:46:01.279
into bed with the time that the
individual is getting out of bed so you

01:46:01.279 --> 01:46:01.289
individual is getting out of bed so you
 

01:46:01.289 --> 01:46:03.500
individual is getting out of bed so you

the dspd subjects tau 11 has a quite an
 

01:46:33.329 --> 01:46:37.040
the dspd subjects tau 11 has a quite an

the most important features are if we
 

01:46:38.519 --> 01:46:41.390
the most important features are if we
look at the in bed times versus the out

look at the in bed times versus the out
 

01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:43.160
look at the in bed times versus the out
of bed times we see that this is an

of bed times we see that this is an
 

01:46:43.170 --> 01:46:45.229

01:49:33.469 --> 01:49:33.479
rhythmicity at the cellular level given
 

01:49:33.479 --> 01:49:35.540
rhythmicity at the cellular level given
a wild-type form of cryptochrome one or

01:49:35.540 --> 01:49:35.550
a wild-type form of cryptochrome one or
 

01:49:35.550 --> 01:49:37.520
a wild-type form of cryptochrome one or
this variant form of cryptochrome one

01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:37.530
this variant form of cryptochrome one
 

01:49:37.530 --> 01:49:39.859
this variant form of cryptochrome one
and as you see here there was a very

01:49:39.859 --> 01:49:39.869
and as you see here there was a very
 

01:49:39.869 --> 01:49:42.830
and as you see here there was a very
consistent pattern of rhythmicity that

01:49:42.830 --> 01:49:42.840
consistent pattern of rhythmicity that
 

01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:44.659
consistent pattern of rhythmicity that
comes from the wild-type form the

01:49:44.659 --> 01:49:44.669
comes from the wild-type form the
 

01:49:44.669 --> 01:49:46.609
comes from the wild-type form the
full-length form of cryptochrome and

01:49:46.609 --> 01:49:46.619
full-length form of cryptochrome and
 

01:49:46.619 --> 01:49:49.819
full-length form of cryptochrome and
this truncated form gave a pattern with

01:49:49.819 --> 01:49:49.829
this truncated form gave a pattern with
 

01:49:49.829 --> 01:49:52.219
this truncated form gave a pattern with
a longer circadian rhythm about half an

01:49:52.219 --> 01:49:52.229
a longer circadian rhythm about half an
 

01:49:52.229 --> 01:49:55.129
a longer circadian rhythm about half an
hour longer than that provided by the

01:49:55.129 --> 01:49:55.139
hour longer than that provided by the
 

01:49:55.139 --> 01:49:57.589
hour longer than that provided by the
wild-type gene so clearly this gene is

01:49:57.589 --> 01:49:57.599
wild-type gene so clearly this gene is
 

01:49:57.599 --> 01:49:59.959
wild-type gene so clearly this gene is
capable of producing a change in the

01:49:59.959 --> 01:49:59.969
capable of producing a change in the
 

01:49:59.969 --> 01:50:02.750
capable of producing a change in the
circadian rhythm of that of the

01:50:02.750 --> 01:50:02.760
circadian rhythm of that of the
 

01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:08.330
circadian rhythm of that of the
recipient cells so once again the

01:50:08.330 --> 01:50:08.340
recipient cells so once again the
 

01:50:08.340 --> 01:50:11.270

right important new role for
 

01:50:16.979 --> 01:50:21.229
right important new role for
cryptochrome so this is the this of

01:50:21.229 --> 01:50:21.239
cryptochrome so this is the this of
 

01:50:21.239 --> 01:50:23.779
cryptochrome so this is the this of
course is the gene that is now modified

01:50:23.779 --> 01:50:23.789
course is the gene that is now modified
 

01:50:23.789 --> 01:50:28.040

in this case cryptochrome the work it

01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:28.050
in this case cryptochrome the work it
 

01:50:28.050 --> 01:50:30.859
in this case cryptochrome the work it
does is in conjunction with purr to form

01:50:30.859 --> 01:50:30.869
does is in conjunction with purr to form
 

01:50:30.869 --> 01:50:33.830
does is in conjunction with purr to form

that inhibitory complex that suppresses
 

01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:36.500
that inhibitory complex that suppresses
the activity of clock in cycles so

01:50:36.500 --> 01:50:36.510
the activity of clock in cycles so
 

01:50:36.510 --> 01:50:41.719
