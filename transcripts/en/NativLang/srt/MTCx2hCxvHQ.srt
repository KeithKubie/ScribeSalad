1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,483
Uh,

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:09,963
[inaudible]

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,400
phonemes and allophones.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,300
These are terms we use to make sense
of the way sounds work in a language.

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,400
Take just two sounds.

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,060
N and M to test of speakers here.

7
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:23,010
These two sounds is two phonemes.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,510
We see if we can find words
where switching one sound
for the other gives us a

9
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:30,600
completely different word.
Here's the word meet.

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,740
Switching the M two and
n gives us the word neat.

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,410
This is a minimal pair. The two words
different minimally by one sound only,

12
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,080
but what's the point of this? Well, by
holding all the other variables constant,

13
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,580
we can see if switching the sounds in
question changes the meaning of the word

14
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,350
is switching one sound for another
changes the meaning it follows that we're

15
00:00:55,351 --> 00:00:59,070
looking at two different words and
if they're two different words,

16
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,720
English speakers treat the two sounds
in question as different sounds in this

17
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:08,721
example and an m are contrasted and this
contrast tells us that and [inaudible]

18
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,810
are two distinct phone names in English.

19
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,010
A phoneme can have different
pronunciations. Take this sound.

20
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,300
K he comes up with a puff
of air in the word kite,

21
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,460
but not in the word sky.

22
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,540
These two sounds and are different,

23
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,660
but we hear them as
variants of the same sound.

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,520
We call these and
allophones of the phoneme k.

25
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,830
The same goes for mm
and in the word input.

26
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,310
I have heard that word pronounce both
input and input making mm and variants of

27
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,300
the same sound. Ella
phones of the phony and

28
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:56,340
the sounds and show up
in different places.

29
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,960
After s we hear only skyscan skirt,

30
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,700
but at the beginning of a
word we hear can keep cool.

31
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,890
These elephants show up in different
environments where we find one we won't

32
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:12,450
find the other and vice versa.

33
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,310
That kind of mutually exclusive
relationship is called complimentary

34
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,203
distribution.

35
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,410
Other elephants sounds can show
up in the same environment.

36
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,720
Go back to the word input.

37
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,520
Input varies with input in a
tomato, tomato sort of way.

38
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,740
These two allophones of the phoneme n
are in free variation with one another.

39
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,090
This last example shows you that one
sound like [inaudible] might show up as

40
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,020
allophones of multiple phonemes.

41
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,410
Hm is how people usually
pronounce the phoneme m,

42
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,330
but it's also how some people pronounce
the phoneme n in the word input.

43
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,570
In the next lesson,

44
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,170
I'll build on the concepts
of phony Minallah phone and
begin working through the

45
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:02,500
pronunciation system of a
foreign language. As we do that,

46
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,260
I'll help you uncover all
the basics of phonology

47
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:15,690
[inaudible].
