00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.994
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.461 --> 00:00:07.455
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.280
WILL NITZE: So as Tom said,
I am a visiting entrepreneur.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.740
I hail from Boston.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.720
About a year ago, I founded
a company called IQ bar.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.470
The basic one-sentence pitch
is, it's the first nutrition

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.130
bar optimized for the brain,
brain function, and brain

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.000
health.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.100
And I was invited to give
a chat about really what

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.210
whatever I thought you guys
would find interesting.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.710
My first thought
was maybe I'll talk

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.450
about the entrepreneurial
journey, the ups and downs,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.620
the vicissitudes of
starting a food company.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.510
But I think you guys
have a lot of exposure

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.790
to the ups and downs of
innovative businesses.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.630
And so I thought it
would be probably more

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.970
interesting to talk to
you guys about something

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.220
that I think a lot
about on a daily basis,

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.940
but maybe you don't
get as much exposure

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.140
to, which is this linkage,
this intimate linkage

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.290
between the food we eat and our
most precious organ, the brain.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.760
And so, a little bit more
background on myself.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.530
I studied government, as well
as psych and neuroscience

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.050
as an undergrad at Harvard.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.900
And during that time,
I became just totally

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.880
fascinated with
the brain, how it

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.940
works, how it fails,
how to optimize it,

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.860
how to make it work better.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.850
However, I failed to identify
a professional outlet

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.290
for that passion.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.610
And so, by default I ended up
taking a job in software, sales

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.870
and marketing, because I almost
didn't know what else to do.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.050
And very quickly realized
that was not for me,

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.670
selling B2B supply chain and
op software to oil and gas

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.750
companies, as unsexy
as that sounds.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.220
But quickly realized
that was not for me.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.460
I didn't want to spend the
next 30 years doing that.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.390
So concurrent to making
that realization,

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.370
I started experiencing
difficulties with my own brain.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.550
So I was getting mental fatigue,
trouble focusing, headaches,

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.920
things like that
on a daily basis.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.830
Basically, I just felt
terrible every late afternoon

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:15.820
of every day.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.660
And pretty good, I identified
diet as the cause of that,

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.890
as the root cause of that.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.710
And so my obsession
with the brain

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.140
expanded to include
nutrition, how

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.800
do I eat things that help
my brain function better

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.600
and help protect my
brain in the long run.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.620
So I started just using
myself as a Guinea pig.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.190
I self tested new dietary
trends, started voraciously

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.515
researching brain nutrition.

00:02:41.515 --> 00:02:46.840
And pretty quickly, I was able
to ameliorate those symptoms

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.430
that I was experiencing.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.940
And basically by transitioning
away from a Standard American

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.090
Diet, aka, SAD, I transitioned
to a much lower carb,

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.190
more paleo/keto--

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.710
just low carb in general diet.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.410
Basically, I was eating lot
more fats, and a lot fewer

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.890
carbs, which was the inverse of
what I grew up eating and had

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:09.970
eaten for decades.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.856
And everything got better.

00:03:12.856 --> 00:03:14.980
But I quickly became
frustrated, because there just

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.790
aren't that many solutions
for someone like me.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.580
I would have to make a salad
with 10 different components

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.480
to achieve the nutritional
goals I had for my brain.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.030
And so that was crazy to me.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.260
I was like how has
no one optimized

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.750
something for the brain.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.955
And so I-- well,
actually, while I

00:03:32.955 --> 00:03:35.080
was working in software,
on nights and on weekends,

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.630
I started developing
these products.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.020
Ultimately I developed a minimum
viable product, quit my job,

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.030
and kind of went all in on that.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.902
But that's just the
background on me.

00:03:44.902 --> 00:03:47.110
That's not really what I'm
going to be talking about.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.520
Today, I really want to discuss
three things predominantly.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.200
The first one is the
problem, the micro problem

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.280
for, I'm sure, a
lot of you, for me,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.950
and then just society
as a whole, which

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.440
is to redeem the broken
brain problem in America.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.050
The second thing is
diet's relation to that.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.390
How does diet
perpetuate that issue?

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.330
And why do we
consistently eat things

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.400
that are bad for
our brains, even

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.394
when we know that they're
bad for our brains.

00:04:17.394 --> 00:04:19.060
And then the third
thing is just Q&amp;A. So

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.420
you guys can feel free to ask
me about the slides I'm showing,

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.930
or about whatever you
want to ask about,

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.570
what it's like to
start a food company,

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.570
the ups and downs,
all that good stuff.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.210
Feel free to ask any of that.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.270
OK, so let's talk about
the problem and an overview

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.630
a few, frankly,
depressing stats.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.230
So when we talk about
the broken brain problem,

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.270
it's really twofold.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.760
There's a short-term
set of issues.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.680
And then there's a
long-term set of issues.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.510
So the short-term set of
issues is day-to-day issues.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.380
Most of us feel terrible
at 2:30 or 3:00 PM.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:59.620
So much so, that the 2:30 effect
has been coined as a phrase.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.870
So three in four
American workers

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.390
feel mentally fatigued
most days of the week.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.520
Most people are
mentally tired most

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.420
of the time, which is kind
of staggering to think about,

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.837
and has a bunch of implications.

00:05:10.837 --> 00:05:11.920
Some of them are economic.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.464
So that cost in the US, $140
billion in lost productivity.

00:05:16.464 --> 00:05:18.130
But you guys probably
don't care as much

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.770
about that as the quality
of life implications.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.230
So you just don't feel good.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.750
You're not as sharp.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.900
You gain weight, or you have
headaches, inflamed brain,

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.070
which causes depressed mood.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.440
There's a whole host
of short-term issues

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.100
that just make your
day less enjoyable.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.440
Now the long-term of that
is what happens when--

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.220
what happens when you eat
a brain unhealthy diet

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.930
for decades at a time?

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.970
Well, now we start seeing
disease proliferation.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.740
So I'll talk about
two in particular,

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.152
diabetes and Alzheimer's.

00:05:58.152 --> 00:05:59.610
And in a second,
I'll link the two.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.950
So diabetes, if we
reverse back to 1980s,

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.850
was one fourth of
what it is now.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.240
So it's quadrupled in
the last few decades,

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.670
and doubled by rate of diabetes.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.170
So obviously, there
are more people.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.535
But also, the rate of diabetes
is double what it was.

00:06:15.535 --> 00:06:19.242
And when we look at
Alzheimer's, there

00:06:19.242 --> 00:06:21.700
are roughly five million people
with Alzheimer's in the US.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.611
That's said to be
16 million in 2050.

00:06:24.611 --> 00:06:26.860
So it's going to triple in
the next couple of decades.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.130
So why am I in the same
breath talking about diabetes

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.820
and Alzheimer's?

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.130
Well, it turns out that the
two are intimately linked.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.100
So Alzheimer's is
actually called Type

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.630
3 diabetes now by many
doctors, nutritionists,

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.940
people in the health
and wellness space.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.690
Because you're 10 to 15 times
more likely to get Alzheimer's

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:47.980
if you have diabetes.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.240
So anyone who says there's no
link between food and cognition

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.520
is out to lunch,
no pun intended.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.550
But so that's the broken
brain problem at a high level.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.890
Now, how does diet
specifically relate to that?

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.690
So we'll rewind to your
fifth grade science class.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:07.960
How do you produce energy?

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.260
Well, you eat food.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.970
You break proteins down
into amino acids, fats

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:16.670
into fatty acids, and carbs
into glucose, blood glucose.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:21.130
Now what happens if the balance
of that is in favor of carbs?

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.870
You're eating a
bunch of pizzas, say.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.060
Well, your diet looks
kind of like that red line

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.650
you're seeing on the graph on
the left of the slide there.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.460
Basically, you're mass
producing blood glucose.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.700
Your body goes into crisis
mode, pumps insulin, the hormone

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.100
insulin, in your blood,
that ferries all that blood

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.260
glucose out into your cells.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.420
Some of it turns into energy.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.970
A lot of it turns into fat.

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:46.970
And then, the issue with
that is that insulin response

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:48.340
is an overcompensation.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.970
So you basically drain your
body of that blood glucose.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.120
And you feel terrible
like two hours later.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.080
That's the sugar
crash in an essence.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.940
And what happens if the net
balance is in the favor of fat?

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.740
Well, none of that happens.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.440
Your energy is much more stable.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.240
You don't mass produce insulin.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.852
You don't crash.

00:08:11.852 --> 00:08:13.060
None of that's controversial.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:18.485
That's all well known phenomena.

00:08:18.485 --> 00:08:20.110
What's a little bit
more controversial,

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:21.940
although I don't really
think it should be,

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.390
is the longer term
dietary implications.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.500
There's a bunch of
longitudinal studies

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:31.600
that look at people who eat a
ton of carbs relative to fats

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.970
and what happens to their
brain, relative to folks

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.789
who eat a ton of fats
relative to carbs.

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:40.870
And they're many times
more likely to develop

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.560
neurodegenerative diseases.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.340
I don't even fully understand
why that's so controversial.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.900
I think probably
because it's still

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.409
a holdover of if you're
not eating carbs,

00:08:52.409 --> 00:08:53.200
you're eating fats.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.100
And fats have been
demonized for decades.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.870
And people just aren't as
comfortable prescribing

00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:59.650
a high fat diet.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.810
So if we know that all
these bad things happen

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.360
to us on a daily basis
and over decades of time,

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.560
the question I think a
lot about is why aren't we

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.420
thinking more about
the foods that we're

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.820
eating as they relate to
the downstream impacts

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:16.420
on our brain?

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.340
Why does that not
even really register

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:22.300
when we decide what we're
eating for lunch, or even

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.114
at 2:00 AM on a Saturday night?

00:09:24.114 --> 00:09:25.280
Why is that not registering?

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.890
Although, I'm sure
you can probably

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:30.980
determine why in
that latter case.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.950
So I've thought
a lot about this.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:38.590
And to me, there are
really five reasons why

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:40.480
this doesn't register to us.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.580
I think the first reason
is that, quote, unquote,

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.310
experts aren't actually
experts, or continuously

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:46.330
discredit themselves.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.460
The second thing is
our biology actually

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.460
doesn't incentivize us to
think about this stuff.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.222
Culture doesn't incentivize us.

00:09:53.222 --> 00:09:54.930
There are way too many
things on our mind

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:56.524
when we're trying to pick lunch.

00:09:56.524 --> 00:09:57.940
And then we're
really, really good

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.400
at blaming things other than
food, when food in reality

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.400
is part of the problem.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.890
So I'll go through each
of those one by one.

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:07.360
So experts aren't
actually experts.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.880
So when we think about
health and wellness, who

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.630
is the paragon, who is
the person we go to,

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.310
or the average American goes to?

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:17.650
You go to your doctor, right?

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.480
It's not just when
you sprain your ankle,

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.900
it's preventative,
what can I eat

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.270
so I don't get sick later on.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.520
The problem with that
is, doctors aren't really

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.630
experts on nutrition.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:32.380
They take, on average,
they get 25 hours

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:35.400
of nutritional teachings
over the course

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.890
of four years of med school.

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:39.250
So basically, any
educated person

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:42.612
knows as much about
nutrition as your doctor,

00:10:42.612 --> 00:10:45.070
barring your doctor going off
and doing a bunch of research

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:46.930
of his or her own.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.920
So that's a problem.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.990
So maybe if doctors aren't the
experts, maybe it's the FDA,

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.560
or maybe it's some sort
of governmental body.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.429
It is, after all, the Food and
Drug Administration, right?

00:10:58.429 --> 00:11:00.970
The problem with that is if they
change their mind every five

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:03.590
years and often
discredit themselves.

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:05.290
I mean, there are
countless examples.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.544
These are just a few.

00:11:06.544 --> 00:11:07.960
I don't know if
you guys remember.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.090
I grew up in the early '90s.

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:12.070
Everything on the
grocery stores had

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:17.020
big, low-fat in bold letters,
and it's flying off shelves.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.870
That was because the
government basically

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.330
equated fat consumption
with getting a heart attack

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.000
in the late '70s through '80s.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.810
And so fat became this villain,
which it wasn't even before.

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:32.350
People used to eat butter,
high fat, dairy, and things

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:34.540
like that, liberally,
for a long time.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:37.784
Until this governmental
directive basically said,

00:11:37.784 --> 00:11:39.700
fat is bad, you're going
to get a heart attack

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.800
when you eat a lot of fat.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:46.400
Now again, decades later,
diabetes is up four X,

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.990
the rate is up two X. So,
obviously, that was wrong.

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:53.170
And you know that's
wrong partially

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.690
because you don't see low-fat
on things like you used to.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.490
Actually, in many cases,
it's the opposite.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:01.480
Similar deal with eggs.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.660
People freaked out that eggs
had a ton of cholesterol

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.742
and eggs were vilified.

00:12:06.742 --> 00:12:08.200
If you're going to
eat eggs, you're

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.270
going to pack cholesterol
in your arteries.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.760
You're going to
get heart failure.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.480
Subsequently the FDA came
out, in 2015, and said,

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.940
actually, there's
really no evidence

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.280
that dietary cholesterol
correlates strongly

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.380
with blood cholesterol.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.192
And so that high
blood cholesterol

00:12:25.192 --> 00:12:26.650
wasn't really
because of your eggs.

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.290
It was because of other factors.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.010
Similar deal with
salt. If you eat salt,

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:34.460
you're going to get super high
blood pressure and get sick.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.030
And that was basically
discredited for a series

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.970
of studies, starting in 2013.

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:42.900
So experts aren't really
experts is the bottom line.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.280
And that's a problem,
because where do you turn to.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.660
And if there are
no real experts,

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.576
then I'll just eat
whatever is in front of me,

00:12:48.576 --> 00:12:50.370
or what's served to
me, and I won't really

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:53.536
think about it that much.

00:12:53.536 --> 00:12:55.660
The second problem is that
biology doesn't actually

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.580
incentivize us to eat
a brain healthy diet.

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.190
So this was really
perplexing to a lot

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.030
of people for a long time.

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:04.090
The question of
why, if our genes

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:08.590
are supposed to be mostly right,
why does sugar taste so good?

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:10.460
Why do I crave sugar?

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.940
Why is my body pushing me
to eat this if it's just

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.490
going to hurt my body?

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.480
And what most people
are netting out to now

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.820
is that if you reverse
hundreds of thousands,

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.560
millions of years,
early humans, there just

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.880
wasn't all that much food.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.190
And so to survive,
you needed to eat

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:30.472
food that packed on fat, fatty
tissue, as much as you could.

00:13:30.472 --> 00:13:32.680
Because you're not going to
get a meal the next week,

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.780
and you're going to have to
survive on your own body fat.

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.680
So it works really well
when food is really sparse,

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.770
eating like 15 apples.

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:44.260
But that works terribly
when you could get

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.640
another 15 apples the next day.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:51.430
So our genes haven't caught
up the food abundant realities

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.920
of the modern era.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.670
So the second
biological issue is

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.420
our brain doesn't have
any pain receptors.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.794
You actually
literally don't know

00:13:59.794 --> 00:14:01.210
when you're hurting your brain.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:03.250
So you know if you
eat a bad oyster, that

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:06.790
hurts your stomach.

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:08.740
And you can see
dietary implications

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.880
in terms of weight gain
and weight loss, which

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.950
pain can be relevant to.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:16.930
But you just don't feel
pain in your brain.

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:19.600
So you could have a chronically
inflamed brain over decades

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.890
and you would never know it.

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:24.670
And that's what most people
have in America, a chronically

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.360
inflamed brain.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.450
And because you don't
have pain receptors,

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:29.812
you just don't know it.

00:14:29.812 --> 00:14:31.270
There are other
downstream effects.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.170
I feel tired and lethargic.

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:34.400
Well, that's not my brain.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.380
That's just what happens
when you get older,

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:40.760
and you rationalize
it in some other way.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:44.340
Another issue is that
culture does not incentivize

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:46.200
us to eat a brain healthy diet.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.710
When we think about the body
parts as they relate to diet,

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:53.110
it's like I want washboard abs.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:57.600
I want to look awesome
in my Instagram photo.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.890
That's actually not all
that bad, necessarily,

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:05.430
because what's good for
your body health wise tends

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:06.960
to be good for your brain.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.300
Where I think that's a
hugely missed opportunity

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.926
is that's just the baseline.

00:15:11.926 --> 00:15:13.800
When you're eating for
your body or your abs,

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.216
rather than your
brain, you're not

00:15:15.216 --> 00:15:17.730
layering on all the additional
things that could actually

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:22.230
enhance your cognitive function,
not drinking Lion's Mane tea,

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:27.756
or getting adequate amounts
of vitamin E, or magnesium,

00:15:27.756 --> 00:15:29.130
or what have you,
a whole laundry

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.710
list of things you really
should be feeding your brain.

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:35.040
You're just focused on what's
my macro nutritional balance

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.140
that's going to
lead to a six pack.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:41.850
So another issue
is, frankly, just--

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:45.090
I'm sure you guys have all
heard as American as apple pie,

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:45.810
right?

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:47.040
That's an American staple.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.920
It turns out apple
pie, most apple pie's

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.150
are terrible for your brain.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:55.304
But also, you just go
to any social gathering,

00:15:55.304 --> 00:15:56.220
what are they serving?

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.590
They're serving pizza and beer.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.780
You're throwing your
kid a birthday party.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:03.490
It's a pizza party,
probably with soda.

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:06.720
So the American staples of
the American social gathering

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:13.050
are all highly carb centric
and terrible for your brain.

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:15.030
And that's really
hard to change.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:18.570
A culture is going to be
one of the later things

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:22.920
to shift when we're looking
at all of these variables.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.810
Frankly, I'm not that
optimistic about--

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:29.385
I'm not going to short
the pizza and beer market,

00:16:29.385 --> 00:16:30.740
I'll put it that way.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.740
Although, I might
short Papa John's

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.310
in light of recent developments.

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:39.930
But I think actually
the biggest issue here

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:43.230
is that there are frankly
too many variables that

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:44.340
drive food selection.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.970
There are too many things
that cycle through our brain

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:51.080
when you reach to grab one
snack, or one meal, or another,

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.230
that we just can't
compute that many things.

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.780
And so we make bad decisions.

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.865
And let's just run
through eight of them.

00:16:58.865 --> 00:17:00.930
Satiety, feeling full.

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:04.980
That's a baseline, I want to
survive, so I'm going to eat.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:08.472
Proximity, that sandwich
on that table over there,

00:17:08.472 --> 00:17:10.680
I'm just going to grab that
and eat that because it's

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.420
closest to me.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:14.609
I want to satisfy my
taste buds' cravings.

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:16.619
I want to eat things
that make me happy.

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:20.130
Because we all associate
emotion with food.

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:24.506
I want that $80 French dinner
to feel like it was worth it.

00:17:24.506 --> 00:17:26.339
I'm just going to eat
what my co-workers are

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:28.079
eating for lunch.

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:30.240
I don't have time to
make this fish dish.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.670
I'm going to just
microwave this burrito.

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:37.000
Or the eighth is an
actual consideration

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.619
of what is this
doing to my body?

00:17:38.619 --> 00:17:40.410
So there are a couple
of interesting things

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:45.294
about all of these variables.

00:17:45.294 --> 00:17:46.710
The first thing
that's interesting

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:48.840
is that health is one of eight.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:49.860
Now, these are all--

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.080
the weightings of these
will vary, I'm sure,

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.470
amongst all of you,
for anyone really.

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:58.380
But just the sheer fact that
it's one of eight things

00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.950
is not good.

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:02.840
And by the way, a subset of
that brain consideration,

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.010
of that health consideration,
is brain health.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:07.927
So again, we get back
to that Instagram issue.

00:18:07.927 --> 00:18:09.468
You're eating for
health, but are you

00:18:09.468 --> 00:18:10.780
eating for brain health?

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:15.990
You're missing out on all these
additional layers of nutrients.

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:20.940
And then, the embarrassing
fact, the embarrassing reality

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.370
of this is, what is the strong--

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.950
after satiety, after
surviving, what

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:30.290
is the strongest determinant
of food selection?

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:34.140
It's proximity, literally
what's in the kitchen, what's

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.840
sitting in front of me,
what did someone serve me.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.990
So there have been a number
of studies around this.

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:43.090
And 65% to 70% of
people say they just

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:44.670
eat what's in front of them.

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:47.910
That's literally how
they choose food.

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:51.120
Again, can't really blame
them, because of the earlier

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.220
variables.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.270
No one really told them
what's good for the brain.

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.140
Culture didn't tell them to
eat brain healthy things,

00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:59.940
et cetera, et cetera.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.760
So the last thing I
wanted to talk about

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.970
is we're really good
at not blaming food

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:08.490
for things we sort of
should blame food for,

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:11.010
at least partially.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:12.880
So I'll run through
a couple of examples.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.710
Number one, we should get
tired of 2:30 every day.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:18.480
It actually turns out we do--

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.410
our biological clock is
such that we get drowsy

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:23.430
in the late afternoon.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.110
That's a natural cycle.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:27.527
But we totally
overestimate how strong

00:19:27.527 --> 00:19:28.610
that phenomenon should be.

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:31.560
It should be a transient thing
that frankly you can power

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.900
through with a cup of coffee.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:37.530
You shouldn't be sleeping
on your desk at 4:00 PM.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:40.020
And you can't attribute that
to that biological clock.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.180
That's almost certainly
attributable to that bowl

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.778
of pasta you ate at lunch.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:52.060
So the second thing
is we very often,

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.330
when something goes wrong health
wise, we say that's genetic,

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:57.550
it's in my family.

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:59.380
My dad had a heart disease.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.850
And so I'm more
likely to get it.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:02.740
And that's true.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.240
That it is true.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:08.650
The problem with that is
it's only part of the story.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:11.450
It's leaving out
this key variables.

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.930
So remember, I talked earlier
about Type 3 diabetes.

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:16.570
If you get diabetes, you're 10
to 15 times more likely to get

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:17.720
Alzheimer's.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.420
That has nothing to
do with genetics.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:23.290
That's a downstream impact
of your dietary choices

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:24.280
over decades of time.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:28.580
So half of the reason you're
going to get Alzheimer's is

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:29.080
genetic.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.260
But the other half is not.

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:32.530
It's lifestyle choices.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:35.490
You choose to smoke, it's
your diet, et cetera.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:39.500
It also leaves out the important
phenomenon of epigenetics.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.860
I'm not sure whether
you're familiar with this.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.940
You can literally change
your gene expressions.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:48.460
So 70% of your genes that are
tied to health and wellness,

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.780
longevity, whether you get
sick, and when you die,

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:55.450
70% of those genes, you
can turn on and turn off

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:57.630
based on lifestyle choices.

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:01.420
How much you sleep, what you
eat, if you smoke or not.

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:02.740
People don't really know that.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.650
They don't know that
their genes are malleable.

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:07.652
But they are.

00:21:07.652 --> 00:21:09.610
Cognitive impairments
are just a part of aging.

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:13.150
As I got older, I should
start forgetting stuff.

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:16.150
That doesn't have
to be true actually.

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:19.960
Your brain is programmed
to work well until you die.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:26.350
So Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,
any pathology is something

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:29.710
going wrong with that plan.

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:33.610
And us choosing lifestyle,
making lifestyle decisions that

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:38.170
are contradictory to what our
genes crave from a dietary,

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:44.380
sleep, social,
gratification standpoint,

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.160
contradicting
those genes desires

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.090
is what causes us
to have problems

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:55.990
and how our brains not operate
optimally at an older age.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:57.640
And then there's mood disorders.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:01.750
So I'm depressed or
anxious because there's

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:03.940
some sort of chemical
imbalance in my brain.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:07.180
Well, this is really
still poorly understood.

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:10.660
But what we do know
is that diet actually

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:14.450
correlates really strongly
with certain mood outcomes.

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:16.960
So I can't tell you
exactly what makes

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.940
people anxious or depressed.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:22.660
But I can tell you that
when people eat things

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:28.810
like flavonoids, or cocoa,
or green tea, or blueberries,

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:30.410
they are less likely
to get depressed,

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:33.480
or they're more likely to
ameliorate that depression

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.470
or anxiety.

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:39.330
People don't associate food with
mood as much as they should,

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:44.320
or at least with
bettering mood disorder.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.460
OK, so there are
a couple dynamics

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.710
that really complicate things.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:50.050
These are frankly things I
don't know the answer to,

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:53.440
but I think are interesting
to think about, and just

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.330
other reason why this
is a problem that

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:57.580
continues to get perpetuated.

00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:04.270
So number one, I think a lot of
so-called experts in this space

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:07.990
tend to prescribe things as
if we're all the same person.

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:10.810
The reality is if I
eat a bowl of rice

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:13.840
and my girlfriend
eats a bowl of rice,

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:18.150
and then we take blood
glucose tests of our blood,

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:20.050
I could look like
I'm pre-diabetic,

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:23.950
and she could look like
nothing happened at all.

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.980
Everyone reacts differently
to all the macronutrients.

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.290
And so that could
mean I can't eat rice.

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:32.410
That could mean she could
eat rice all the time.

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:39.550
So platitudinous prescriptions
for certain dietary,

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:42.220
adhering to certain
dietary paths just

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:45.430
don't work wholesale.

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:47.257
There's also an
argument, frankly,

00:23:47.257 --> 00:23:48.840
to be made for living
a little, right?

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.930
Like life isn't worth
living if I can't eat

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:56.630
pizza, that kind of thing.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:59.410
And I actually think
that's a valid argument.

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:02.150
Although I don't think
it's that valid, because--

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:04.590
and I don't think it's that
valid for anecdotal reasons,

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:06.760
my own anecdotes included.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.790
So if you-- and I would
recommend you try this--

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:13.700
let's say you drink
sweet tea every day

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.640
from like South Carolina.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.260
And then you just
go cold turkey.

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:19.690
You start drinking
unsweetened iced tea.

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:20.490
It's going to suck.

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:23.320
It's going to taste
terrible for like a week.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.660
And then it's going
to start tasting good.

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:29.290
And you're going to
take a sip of sweet tea

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:31.510
and it's going to
taste horrible.

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:35.950
Our bodies are incredibly good
at adapting to new dietary

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:37.090
adherences.

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:40.296
And I'm sure you guys,
if you drink a Coke now,

00:24:40.296 --> 00:24:41.920
and you haven't drank
soda in 10 years,

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:46.084
you're like how did I used to
pound three of these a day?

00:24:46.084 --> 00:24:49.420
Or at least that's what I did.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:52.860
But there is an argument there.

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:54.480
There's an interesting
agricultural,

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:59.790
like how do we feed the
world debate here also.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:03.090
This debate is relevant
to grass fed beef.

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:06.660
Grass fed beef is awesome
if you can pay for it.

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:09.330
But it's just not--
like all of America

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:11.160
would have to be grazing
land for everyone

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.510
to eat grass fed beef.

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:13.310
So that's awesome.

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:18.150
It's better for you, but
not everyone can eat it.

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:22.580
Same deal with, for instance,
the mass production of soy,

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:26.460
corn, other higher
glycemic products,

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.800
that we're really, really
good at producing a ton of

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.900
and feeding a lot
of people with,

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.897
but aren't actually that great
for the people we're feeding.

00:25:33.897 --> 00:25:35.230
I don't know the answer to that.

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:38.910
That's just a dynamic
that complicates things.

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:40.300
There are economic realities.

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.780
It's more expensive
to buy an avocado

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.740
than it is to buy sweet corn.

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.379
I also don't know
the answer to that.

00:25:48.379 --> 00:25:49.920
There's interesting
things thrown out

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.140
about what are we subsidizing?

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.090
Why do we need to
specifically subsidize

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:57.400
corn, versus this, versus that.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.380
Again, I don't know
the answer to that.

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.720
But it is a reality.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.715
It is cheaper to eat
at McDonald's and it

00:26:03.715 --> 00:26:06.720
will be for a long time.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.760
And then this last
point hearkens

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:11.530
back to what I was
talking about earlier.

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:13.950
There are no authorities.

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:17.160
The so-called authorities
keep changing their minds.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.464
And I don't see that changing.

00:26:18.464 --> 00:26:20.130
And to some extent,
that's a good thing.

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:22.440
Because that's the
whole nature of science,

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.960
is revising hypotheses.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.020
But it's certainly
frustrating when

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:31.410
eggs are good for you versus
bad for you every five years.

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:37.890
And then I just wanted to end
by giving a nod to the fact

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:42.130
that diet is, of course,
only one piece of the puzzle.

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:44.760
So you can eat the most
brain healthy diet ever.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:48.240
But if you aren't exercising
and aren't sleeping, frankly,

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.760
more importantly,
on the sleep front,

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.150
it's not going to
do much for you.

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:57.180
I think sleep is
sort of like this--

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.490
the Millennium
generation's cigarettes.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.620
I think we're just at
the tip of the iceberg

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:08.940
as far as how terrible
lack of sleep is for us.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:13.110
And honestly, it might even
eclipse the value of diet

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:15.330
in certain circumstances.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:17.760
So when we don't sleep,
we know that the brain

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:18.860
shrinks over time.

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.520
We're not producing new neurons.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.480
And our brain is shrinking.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.160
We also have mass
produced growling,

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.070
which is a hunger hormone.

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:28.620
So that's why you
stuff your face

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:31.754
after you pull an all-nighter.

00:27:31.754 --> 00:27:32.670
And you feel terrible.

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:34.230
Your mood is depressed.

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:36.559
You can't produce enough
serotonin, for example.

00:27:36.559 --> 00:27:38.100
Meanwhile, when you
exercise, we know

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.430
that your brain gets bigger.

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:41.520
People who exercise
literally have larger brains.

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.740
And more specifically,
a bigger hippocampus,

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.200
which is the memory
center of the brain.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:52.980
So you have a better memory if
you go for a run twice a week.

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.030
And that's it.

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:58.241
So I'd be happy to chat about--

00:27:58.241 --> 00:27:59.865
I don't know what
your guy's experience

00:27:59.865 --> 00:28:02.350
is with all this information.

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:05.580
I'm so in the weeds,
that it's hard to know

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.997
what I knew or
didn't know before,

00:28:06.997 --> 00:28:09.205
or what I thought about or
didn't think about before.

00:28:09.205 --> 00:28:10.920
Because I think about
this all the time.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:15.870
But I'd be happy to chat about
any of that, or about the food

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:18.220
business, or whatever.

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:21.542
AUDIENCE: What's your take on
nootropics and Alpha Brain?

00:28:21.542 --> 00:28:23.000
WILL NITZE: I've
tried alpha brain.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.060
I'm a huge Joe Rogan fan.

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:27.457
I listen to Joe Rogan
Experience all the time.

00:28:27.457 --> 00:28:29.290
That's the thing about
this whole lifestyle.

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:32.610
You get into the whole
quantified self, what's

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:34.616
my glucose, and all that stuff.

00:28:34.616 --> 00:28:35.490
It becomes addicting.

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:40.570
You start listening to
eight podcasts at once.

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:42.720
Alpha Brain is an
interesting one.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.230
I don't know a ton about it.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:48.840
Although, it was a lot more
sugary than I wanted it to be.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.859
The thing about
nootropics is, which

00:28:50.859 --> 00:28:52.650
for people who don't
know about nootropics,

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:55.210
nootropics is anything that
makes your brain work better.

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:58.620
So caffeine is a basic
example of a nootropic

00:28:58.620 --> 00:28:59.370
that we all know.

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:03.930
But there's also like a bunch
of crazy stuff you can eat

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:06.630
and you can't pronounce.

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:09.120
I think it's really
early days in terms

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:13.740
of what the downstream impact of
taking nootropics all the time

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:14.310
is.

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:15.780
Because it's
actually pretty new.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.730
And it's not even really
on the east coast.

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.460
It's like there are
these pockets of people

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.900
who are really into nootropics.

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.630
How can I hack my
brain to work better.

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:26.430
I mean to the extent
that people are micro

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:31.380
dosing on LSD in Silicon
Valley to get more creative.

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:32.430
Apparently it works.

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:35.370
So I don't know.

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:37.470
But to me, the big
question mark is what's

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:39.089
the downstream impact of that.

00:29:39.089 --> 00:29:39.630
I don't know.

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:43.230
What happens when you micro
dose on LSD for 10 years?

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:47.050
Maybe it's something not great.

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:50.626
But it's probably pretty
cool for 10 years.

00:29:50.626 --> 00:29:52.250
You probably do a
lot of creative work.

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:57.260
And it's the same deal with
like Adderall, or Ritalin,

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:57.760
or whatever.

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.680
We don't really know
the downstream impact

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.710
when people start taking
it in kindergarten when

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:04.680
they're like 80.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:05.990
We don't have the data.

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:07.820
But I'm very
interested about it.

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.500
I tested all that
stuff out on my--

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.840
not the LSD.

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:16.455
I test out nootropics
pretty regularly

00:30:16.455 --> 00:30:19.169
and it's fun to see
how your body reacts.

00:30:19.169 --> 00:30:20.585
Because it's like
you're not going

00:30:20.585 --> 00:30:24.950
to kill yourself by trying
something once or twice.

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:27.770
But we're just at the
beginning of that.

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:30.030
That's going to
explode in my opinion.

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:32.510
AUDIENCE: Follow-up question,
how does your product,

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:35.230
and what's in it, differ
from what's in a nootropic?

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:40.010
WILL NITZE: So what we're trying
to do is basically two things.

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:45.080
So at a basic level,
flip the carb-fat ratio.

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:48.380
So how do we make it low
glycemic, physically keto

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.090
friendly.

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:52.160
If you're too don't you keto,
how do we minimize the blood

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.060
sugar impact.

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.470
That's like a baseline.

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:58.490
Then I get back to the whole
culture and Instagram thing.

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:01.670
Then we also try and layer
on six different things

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:02.880
that help you in other ways.

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.846
So a lot of them are health
elements, like Omega 3s,

00:31:05.846 --> 00:31:07.220
you're not going
to get jacked up

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.980
if you eat a lot of fish oil.

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.526
And frankly, that's why
people don't regularly

00:31:12.526 --> 00:31:14.150
eat it that much,
because you don't get

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:15.980
an immediate feedback with it.

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:17.000
It's like yeah, I think
this is going to be

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.250
good for my brain in 10 years.

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:21.710
And then you forget to
take it the next day.

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:25.800
But the reality is that,
then, you should be taking it.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.750
So some are health related.

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:31.600
Some are more
neurogenesis related.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.680
Like Lion's Mane, for example.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.750
We're still young, in
terms of studies on that.

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:38.800
Lion's Mane is this
mushroom that helps you--

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.400
it makes you sharper.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.080
I mean, anecdotally,
I would try it.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:44.730
It helps you grow neurons.

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:50.830
So it helps expand your synaptic
connections in your brain.

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:54.020
So the stuff that
we layer on is not--

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:57.290
I mean, it's like a
2.49 nutrition bar.

00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:00.620
So you have to treat it as such.

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:03.750
But our goal is how do
you eliminate the crash,

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:06.440
put a bunch of brain
healthy things in it,

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.120
energize the brain.

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.700
It's not like having a Red Bull.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:14.810
Because the only-- there
are no biological shortcuts.

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:17.800
That's one of my favorite
lines, which I think is true.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.350
When you do pound a Red
Bull, that's the only way

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:23.480
to rapidly up here--

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:27.380
or even Adderall, or whatever
shortcut people take--

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:34.550
you will rapidly
up your cognition,

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:36.773
speed, processing
time, et cetera.

00:32:36.773 --> 00:32:39.099
But again, there's no
biological free lunch.

00:32:39.099 --> 00:32:40.640
You're going to come
down after that,

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:45.430
just like you did when you drank
a Coke or ate a bunch of pizza,

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:48.930
or whatever the case may be.

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:54.780
So that's what we try to do,
is on a more subtle basis,

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:58.160
take out the crash, take
out the glycemic load,

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.320
and layer on things
that help your brain

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.400
in a variety of ways.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:07.365
AUDIENCE: How do you determine
what's healthy fat level

00:33:07.365 --> 00:33:09.310
that people should be intaking?

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:12.200
Because as someone
trying to go towards more

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.117
of a fat heavy diet,
as I'm starting

00:33:14.117 --> 00:33:15.700
to drink Bulletproof
coffee and stuff.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.840
I'm slowly, over
time, be like I'm

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.560
afraid I'm just going to
be getting fat and not--

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:25.560
so how do you determine
what levels of fat you

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:28.910
should be intaking, and also--

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:32.336
WILL NITZE: You can weigh
yourself every couple of weeks.

00:33:32.336 --> 00:33:32.960
That's one way.

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:38.150
I was way into the
Bulletproof coffee thing too.

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:40.490
I was like so, I totally
drank the Kool-Aid.

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:43.730
I was like, this is so awesome.

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:45.032
It is awesome in some ways.

00:33:45.032 --> 00:33:46.740
It knocks out your
hunger in the morning.

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:50.439
When you're eating, basically
what Bulletproof coffee is,

00:33:50.439 --> 00:33:52.480
you get what's called
medium chain triglycerides,

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.640
or saturated fats,
which a lot of people,

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:58.130
it's like a four letter
word in a lot of circles.

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:00.590
But they're generally
accepted to be like the best

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:02.104
saturated fats you can eat.

00:34:02.104 --> 00:34:03.770
What that does is,
it goes in your liver

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:05.144
and breaks down
into these things

00:34:05.144 --> 00:34:09.040
called ketone bodies, which
is the only other brain

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.900
fuel, other than glucose, that
your brain can survive on.

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:16.429
When you fast, for example, the
way you survive is your body

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:17.900
turns fat into ketones.

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:21.170
Your body is literally
burning off fat, not glucose.

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:25.429
That's how you don't die
when you don't eat food.

00:34:25.429 --> 00:34:29.150
But I think the jury's
still out on what

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:30.949
the right balance of fat is.

00:34:30.949 --> 00:34:36.320
Like if you're a keto
fanatic, you've got all day.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.179
80% of your diet should be fat.

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:41.275
You should eat
virtually zero carbs.

00:34:41.275 --> 00:34:43.400
And you shouldn't even
really be counting calories,

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:47.174
because the whole calories
in, calories out thing

00:34:47.174 --> 00:34:49.429
has been pretty much debunked.

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:53.739
So my perspective is the proof
is kind of in the pudding.

00:34:53.739 --> 00:34:58.640
I would experiment and
try different levels.

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:01.250
Because again, everyone's
body reacts differently

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:03.860
to different levels of fat.

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:06.950
But like for me,
I've experimented

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:09.690
with a lot of ratios
and found what

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:13.910
I can eat so that I don't
get tired till like 7 PM

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:15.530
as the goal.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:19.940
And I don't gain
weight, the other goal.

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:20.720
So I don't know.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.970
That's not a very good answer.

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:25.730
But I would pick some
certain benchmarks.

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:29.630
And then just start gathering
data on how your body reacts.

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:34.770
It's different if you're
paleo, or keto, or whole 30.

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:38.110
AUDIENCE: Do you still
drink Bulletproof coffee?

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:40.190
WILL NITZE:
Sometimes, sometimes.

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:41.360
I don't eat breakfast.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.180
I do fast in the morning.

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:46.820
I'm doing this 16-8
protocol, where you only

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:49.130
eat during eight
hours of the day,

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:52.480
fast until-- you eat at
like noon and then 7:30.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.860
And then you just don't
eat the rest of the day.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.526
Well, I kind of cheat, because I
do drink coffee in the morning.

00:35:57.526 --> 00:36:00.910
But I'm not too
worried about that.

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:05.270
But yeah, I'm testing
that out on myself.

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:10.580
And that's been-- for a while I
needed some saturated fats just

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:11.700
to knock out my hunger.

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.680
But now I just kind
of power through it.

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:17.930
Bullet's worked well for me.

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:20.060
It's kind of expensive too.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:23.130
So do you want to spend
that much every morning?

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:25.850
I don't know, maybe you do.

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:28.740
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about your research and testing

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:29.320
process.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.960
I know that you mentioned,
it's really hard

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.850
to figure out if what
the experts are saying

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:33.912
is actually true.

00:36:33.912 --> 00:36:35.370
And then on the
other hand, there's

00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:37.036
like a lot of new
information coming out

00:36:37.036 --> 00:36:40.326
with all these new fad diets
or different products that

00:36:40.326 --> 00:36:40.950
are coming out.

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:43.450
So how do you figure
out what's necessarily

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:44.640
the source of truth for you?

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.810
And how do you test that?

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:47.040
Is it just on yourself?

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.020
Or is it among you
and your friends?

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:52.850
How do you get that data
and test it [INAUDIBLE]??

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:55.160
WILL NITZE: For me,
also, I'm not an expert.

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:57.780
I'm just some guy who is
really interested in it.

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:00.050
So you shouldn't take my
word as gospel either.

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:04.890
But for me, I think it all
starts with anecdotal evidence.

00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:08.510
So you know you body
better than anyone.

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:12.170
And as you start messing
with different ratios,

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:14.430
you'll find out what
works best for you.

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:18.370
So again, there's no
platitude that I can give you

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:21.350
where it's like
this is the ratio

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:23.720
and I'm tying that to
these four studies.

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.150
There's some high level stuff.

00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:27.230
If you look at
longitudinal studies,

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:29.720
people who ate a ton
of fat did better

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.190
than people who
ate a ton of carbs.

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:35.890
But their genetic makeup
is different than yours.

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:41.810
And so there are ways to
get quantitative about it.

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:44.804
Some people get really into it
and track their blood glucose.

00:37:44.804 --> 00:37:46.220
When you get your
annual physical,

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.530
you can see your
triglyceride level, basically

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:52.920
the fat in your blood.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:56.480
So that's why it's hard.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.842
You have to-- there
is no right answer.

00:37:59.842 --> 00:38:01.550
There are certain
things we know are bad.

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:03.740
Everyone agrees sugar is bad.

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.650
That's not a debate anymore.

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.730
The only reason
people didn't agree

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:14.030
on that is because the sugar
lobby basically covered up

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:16.560
a bunch of evidence decades ago.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:20.630
But anyway, we all
agree on some things--

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:21.890
sugar and fat.

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:25.040
There's these middle
ground saturated fats--

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:27.950
literally you ask
half of doctors,

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:30.982
and they'll say the
opposite saying things.

00:38:30.982 --> 00:38:32.690
They'll say, well,
don't eat a ton of it,

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:34.550
but really there's
no correlation

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:35.780
with long-term heart failure.

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.670
And the next one
will be like, do not

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:40.100
eat that, you're going
to die in 20 years.

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:42.560
So it's like who do
you-- if you move

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.330
from one general
practitioner to another,

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:48.980
you get the opposite
advice, so to the extent

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:51.730
you're interested
in gathering data

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:55.640
on your own anecdotal
diet, and follow

00:38:55.640 --> 00:39:01.829
broad based dietary guidelines,
like eat more fat than carbs.

00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:03.370
And then there's
just baseline stuff.

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:05.280
Just stop eating sugar.

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:08.019
OK, you wrap your
burrito and go,

00:39:08.019 --> 00:39:10.185
well, I'm not going to take
the wrap off my burrito,

00:39:10.185 --> 00:39:12.090
I'm just going to
eat my burrito.

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:16.840
I don't think you need to
get too militant about it.

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:20.480
See what works for you.

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:24.687
That's my best
answer to that one.

00:39:24.687 --> 00:39:26.270
AUDIENCE: So can you
talk a little bit

00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:29.840
about the journey of
going into the bar market,

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.913
being like that it's
pretty saturated

00:39:31.913 --> 00:39:35.060
and there's a lot of big
products in the market.

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:36.440
What's been your experience?

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.690
Why did you choose to
just jump into that?

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:40.820
And then what challenges
are you currently facing

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:44.630
with maybe getting into
stores and selling products?

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:47.470
WILL NITZE: The bar--

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:50.210
I thought of it from a
very simplistic standpoint.

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:54.860
I was like what mediums
of food or bev mediums

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:57.350
allow you to take 10
different things and jam them

00:39:57.350 --> 00:39:59.420
into one small serving size.

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.380
Basically only the bar medium.

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:06.960
There's like no other medium
you can really do that with.

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.420
So there's that reality.

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:14.960
Then it's a huge growing market
that my generation happens

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.620
to eat a lot of.

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:20.930
And it happens to be able
to sustain a lot of brands

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:22.390
and still allow them to grow.

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:27.620
I almost didn't even--

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:30.140
my outlook has always
been I'd rather

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:33.050
get into a competitive field,
where there's guaranteed

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:35.780
demand, than try
and fabricate demand

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:39.650
with hopes of a moonshot
success on the other end.

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:43.040
So I'm not trying to do
an Airbnb and [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:47.600
or $40 billion, or
whatever they're worth.

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.650
I don't want to go where
I know there's demand.

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:51.233
And then I want to
try and out-compete

00:40:51.233 --> 00:40:54.110
everyone who's there.

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:58.550
Because honestly, then my
destiny is more in my own hands

00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:01.770
than if I was trying
to fabricate demand.

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:05.750
The bar market is
incredibly tough.

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:08.630
I think people,
I think there are

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:11.540
ways you can make it
less tough by going where

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:12.950
other people aren't going.

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:16.850
So things like
e-commerce have totally

00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:19.370
changed the game for
not just the bar market,

00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:22.970
but any food that ships
relatively cheaply

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:25.730
and have a long shelf life.

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:29.370
You're kind of out of luck if
you make Kombucha, [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:31.080
online.

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.751
But if you sell a
bar, well people never

00:41:33.751 --> 00:41:35.750
used to buy them five
years ago, and now they're

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:37.520
buying it by five
boxes at a time.

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:41.750
You get paid now,
rather than 60 days.

00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:43.910
And you own that customer.

00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:46.230
Your website, you're
the only product there.

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:50.400
I think the traditional
route is incredibly tough.

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.660
It requires a lot of money.

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:54.190
If you want to get
into Whole Foods,

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:55.250
no one knows who you are.

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:57.910
You're one of 100 products.

00:41:57.910 --> 00:42:02.200
Why would anyone ever pick you,
unless you have a hot pink bar.

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.640
Which isn't a bad idea.

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.150
I considered that.

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:11.570
But you're going to have to hire
a bunch of people to sample it.

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:14.800
And there's capital
costs, there's time costs.

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:18.200
There's just a dozen headaches.

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:21.790
Whereas, the cool
reality now is,

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:24.700
you can go find all
those customers online.

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:26.830
And then go to Whole
Foods in six months,

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:29.140
and say, hey, 5,000 of
your customers in Boston

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:30.300
are buying the product.

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:34.360
You probably want to carry us.

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:37.460
So that's kind of how
we're approaching it.

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:39.580
But I also think we
want to frame ourselves

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:44.180
not as a bar company, but more
as a brain nutrition company.

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:47.290
The bar happens to be the
first medium we're starting in.

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:49.580
It's certainly not the last.

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:54.690
I think it would be cool to make
Opus oatmeal, or single serve,

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:57.300
add hot water kind of thing.

00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:03.010
I'm fascinated by the
cream coffee market.

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:06.400
If we frame ourselves
as a bar, we really

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.830
hamstringing our outlook.

00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:11.200
Whereas, our goal, we're
a brain health company

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.180
that happens to sell bars.

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:15.750
It's fine to be a bar company
that happens to sell bars.

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:18.840
It's just not as
interesting to me.

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:24.070
And I think people like latch on
to that ethos a little bit more

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:28.810
readily than, hey, this is
like fruits and nuts crammed

00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:31.840
together in a package.

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:34.690
But that's just my guess.

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:37.760
AUDIENCE: So you
were in college.

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.564
You studied psychology
and government?

00:43:40.564 --> 00:43:42.730
WILL NITZE: Government,
psychology and neuroscience,

00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:43.370
yeah.

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:44.215
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:44.215 --> 00:43:45.400
WILL NITZE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:49.560
AUDIENCE: So when you were
going through and thinking

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:53.160
about this idea, did
you have a lot of people

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:56.030
that would say, what do
you know about nutrition,

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:58.040
or did you question
on your own, am I

00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:01.610
qualified enough to be talking
about nutrition to people?

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:06.195
And where did you
learn all these things?

00:44:06.195 --> 00:44:07.840
Reading?

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:09.760
WILL NITZE: Yeah, I
don't think you ever

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:14.110
get rid of imposter
syndrome, by the way.

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:18.540
I've listened to a lot of
self-help type podcasts.

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:23.590
Apparently, all of the
highest performers still--

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:26.960
Jerry Seinfeld still
gets imposter syndrome.

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.440
You never feel like
you really should

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:35.320
be the guy or gal talking
about whatever topic it is.

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:39.820
That being said, I think a
total crutch for people to say,

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:42.584
well, you didn't
go to med school.

00:44:42.584 --> 00:44:44.750
The guy who founded Bulletproof
coffee, for example,

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:47.070
gets this all the time.

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:48.180
He's not a PhD.

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:49.870
He didn't go to Med school.

00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:52.330
But all this guy
does, Dave Asprey,

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:56.230
is research this stuff and
self test it, and test it

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:57.410
with his friends.

00:44:57.410 --> 00:45:00.160
It's like, who are you
going to trust, someone

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:04.680
who went to med school 30
years ago, when we like

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:08.350
had totally outdated perceptions
of what is good for the body

00:45:08.350 --> 00:45:11.050
and then talked zero
about nutrition?

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:15.160
Or some guy who lives
it, researchers it,

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:16.450
puts it in his own body?

00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:21.820
I would take the
latter in that case.

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:26.049
But it's not to say that
it's not a valid argument.

00:45:26.049 --> 00:45:27.340
It's like why should I listen--

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:29.090
that's why I say,
I'm not a doctor.

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:30.670
I'm not a nutritionist.

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:34.060
I happen to voraciously
research this stuff,

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:38.140
and live it, and test it,
and keep up on the latest

00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:40.630
and greatest research myself.

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:43.250
But I'm not a PhD.

00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:46.360
So yeah, you do get
that quite a bit.

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:50.710
What's nice is, you can latch
on to people who do have letters

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:52.032
after their name.

00:45:52.032 --> 00:45:53.510
OK, don't take my word for it.

00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:58.301
Go look at-- on our website,
we list 50 cited sources.

00:45:58.301 --> 00:45:59.550
OK, don't take my word for it.

00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:03.290
Go check out those 50 sites,
form your own opinion.

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:05.590
I aggregated them for
you and digested them.

00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:10.600
But ultimately, you go listen
to people who do have degrees

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:12.429
or what have you.

00:46:12.429 --> 00:46:14.470
Actually that's probably
the better way to do it.

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:16.434
I would start with that part.

00:46:19.384 --> 00:46:21.550
AUDIENCE: Who do you feel
as though are your biggest

00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:22.400
competitors?

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:26.030
There's not a lot of people
in the functional brain space.

00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:29.520
So who would you say
is your competitors?

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:32.280
WILL NITZE: Honestly,
it's like other--

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.140
again, the tricky
thing is there's not

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:38.250
that many people going out
looking for a product--

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:41.260
we try and hook people in
a number of different ways.

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:42.584
Maybe they're keto.

00:46:42.584 --> 00:46:44.250
So let's make sure
we're keto compliant.

00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:45.083
Maybe they're paleo.

00:46:45.083 --> 00:46:46.397
Let's make sure we're paleo.

00:46:46.397 --> 00:46:47.230
Maybe they're vegan.

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:48.540
Let's make sure we're vegan.

00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:50.340
I think the way
you hook them is--

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:52.770
so in those capacities,
our competitors

00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:54.850
are other things of that nature.

00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:58.150
So of like for keto, it
might be a Quest bar.

00:46:58.150 --> 00:47:01.130
For vegan, maybe
it's a Lara bar.

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:03.781
Paleo, maybe it's an RX bar.

00:47:03.781 --> 00:47:05.280
So you get a lot
of that, where it's

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:08.930
like I'm looking for a
product for this reason.

00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:10.680
And now we're competing
with these people,

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:13.230
because that's
how they found us.

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:15.870
So at a certain level,
there's a market

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:21.654
that happens to share
dynamics that we have.

00:47:21.654 --> 00:47:23.070
But then, there
are people who are

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:26.490
interested-- let's say
it's a senior citizen who's

00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:29.290
terrified of cognitive decline.

00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:31.320
Well now, are
competition-- and actually,

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:34.410
that's like a huge space for us.

00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:36.490
Because now you have a mandate.

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:41.910
They're terrified-- nothing
drives action like fear.

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:52.812
And so competition there
is like Hills, Prevagen.

00:47:52.812 --> 00:47:54.270
It could be a whole
host of things.

00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:56.640
Whatever other solutions
to that problem is.

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.180
Maybe it's nothing.

00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:01.540
Or a novel solution to that.

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:05.000
Again, we don't want to become
a nootrocutical or medicine,

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.830
we're again, a
2.49 nutrition bar.

00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:12.370
But we get a lot of interest
from people for that reason.

00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:15.870
So I'd say top competitors is
really just other bars that

00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:18.480
have shared characteristics.

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.984
AUDIENCE: Who's your
target market then?

00:48:20.984 --> 00:48:22.650
WILL NITZE: That's a
very good question.

00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:26.430
So we think all the
time about that.

00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:29.700
The way you speak to a
millennial and my grandmother

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:30.680
is very different.

00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:32.460
They care about
different things.

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:34.170
They want to be
messaged to definitely.

00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:38.190
They both could be
an awesome demo.

00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:40.290
Millennials because
they eat a lot of bars.

00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:42.807
Older folks, because they care
a lot more about brain health

00:48:42.807 --> 00:48:43.890
and have a lot more money.

00:48:47.272 --> 00:48:49.230
We're starting more so
at the Millennial group,

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:53.070
because it's easier and cheaper
to acquire them as customers.

00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:56.970
They go on Facebook
and Instagram more.

00:48:56.970 --> 00:48:57.785
They eat more bars.

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:02.820
But we're still
thinking that through.

00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:04.200
The jury's not out on that.

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:06.330
Once we get more
data, it honestly

00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:07.830
could-- because I
think the lifetime

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:11.370
value of older folks who are
more expensive to acquire,

00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:14.970
is way, way greater, because
they're buying every month.

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:17.040
It's almost like
a daily vitamin.

00:49:20.991 --> 00:49:23.490
AUDIENCE: What have you found
your most successful marketing

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:24.888
to be?

00:49:24.888 --> 00:49:29.937
[INAUDIBLE] marketing or
would Facebook be better?

00:49:29.937 --> 00:49:32.270
WILL NITZE: I'm dipping my
toes in AdWords a little bit.

00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:34.640
AUDIENCE: Nice.

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:41.300
WILL NITZE: But again, we
don't have a ton of data yet.

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:44.670
We like launched our
website a month ago.

00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:47.430
Yeah, we're super new.

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:49.290
So we're getting a lot of data.

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:52.250
We had a weird trajectory,
where we did crowd funding

00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:56.022
and we sold like
$90,000 worth of bars.

00:49:56.022 --> 00:49:57.980
Realized we wanted to
tweak a number of things,

00:49:57.980 --> 00:49:59.930
didn't sell for
like four months.

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:03.800
And then we went live
on a website and Amazon.

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:07.340
We're really still
acquiring data.

00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:10.490
And most of our data came back
from the crowdfunding thing,

00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:11.150
which is weird.

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:15.830
Because people convert
differently on a kickstarter

00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:19.840
than they do on
whatever dot com.

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:24.207
And they [INAUDIBLE]
an e-commerce setting.

00:50:24.207 --> 00:50:26.665
We're trying everything, like
Facebook, Pinterest, AdWords.

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:33.630
Even some guerrilla
marketing stuff.

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:36.080
I put a massive decal
on the back of my car.

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:40.640
It's pretty hideous looking, but
I've got like five exclamation

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:43.370
marks.

00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:45.440
I mean we're willing
to try anything

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:48.110
as long as it provides a ROI.

00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:52.190
We're still in the infancy
and testing all that.

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:53.660
AUDIENCE: Well,
thank you so much.

00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:55.510
[APPLAUSE]
