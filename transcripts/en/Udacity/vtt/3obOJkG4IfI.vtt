[Narrator] There are many answers to this; any 2 letters that are the same cannot decrypt to CS

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
because the way the monoalphabetic cypher works every time we see a G,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
it maps to the same letter, so G could decrypt to C,

00:00:13.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but that would mean the other G also decrypts to C and we can't get CS out.
