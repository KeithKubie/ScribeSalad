do you think that sir

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030
do you think that sir

think there is such a thing as a cure

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980
think there is such a thing as a cure
 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.430
think there is such a thing as a cure
for cancer in one with one particular

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440
for cancer in one with one particular
 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.320
for cancer in one with one particular
tree but certainly the accumulation of

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330
tree but certainly the accumulation of
 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.750
tree but certainly the accumulation of
treatments is the one which is making

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760
treatments is the one which is making
 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.550
treatments is the one which is making
the difference and I hope very much that

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.560
the difference and I hope very much that
 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.969
the difference and I hope very much that
this will add have one more work into

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979
this will add have one more work into
 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:08.320
this will add have one more work into
the armory which is becoming

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330
the armory which is becoming
 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.690
the armory which is becoming
increasingly useful and effective
