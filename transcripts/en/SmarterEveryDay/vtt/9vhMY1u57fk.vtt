If I were to personify my YouTube viewing habits would I want to look like this?

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.040
Hey. Hey. What're you doing? What're you doing?

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.080
Are you playing with me? Or do I want my free time to look like this?

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.660
I think the choice is pretty obvious.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.190
Education it is.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.000
[cat meow]

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.210
No. Not happening.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.980
Or do I want my free time to look like this?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.280
Oh my camera's on fire!

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.300
[blows on microphone] [laughs]

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.320
I just caught my camera on fire.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.360
My dead cat was on fire. Oh gah.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.400
