00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
We not necessarily involved in this

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.900
kind of judgement ourselves,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.900
but we recognize the phenomenon

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.380
in our society well enough.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.820
The more someone earn, the more
likely to be admired by strangers

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.820
and perceived as interesting and exciting.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.540
Respect appears all too often to be directly
awarded according to earnings.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.820
And in a related move, if you don't have
much economic endorsement,

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.720
it can be hard for your character
or views to be taken seriously.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.420
It's not a mystery that this
relationship got established.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.940
because there is so many conspicuous cases

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.840
where we find genuine link between talent,
effort, skill, contribution, and income.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.500
The most impressive example
involves brilliant surgeons,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.420
the authors of Matilda and Harry Potter,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.840
or the team behind the development of graphene.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.800
All these geniuses have a lot of talent,

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.280
they made a lot of money,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.000
and their contribution are terrific.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.560
They make a connections between high income and virtue seems right and natural.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.920
But, turn to the pages of economics
textbooks, and a very different

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.260
far less emotive account wages emerges.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.680
Economic states that : the wages are determined

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.740
not by the social contribution,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.960
but by number of people able
and willing to do a given job

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.820
that others won't done.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.720
If there's a lot of people able to complete the task

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.580
you won't need to offer very much
money to get their labor.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.060
And if very few people able to do the job,

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.200
you'll have to pay a lot more.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.240
But note that there's no room to judge

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.460
the worth of the work being done.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.040
The determined of wages is just

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.780
the strength of demand in relation to supply

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.180
Taken in one direction,

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.680
this explains the high salary of hit man.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.040
A person who can,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.300
for the most exact thing and difficult missions

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.840
where the target posses private guards and is

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.980
protected by triple layer security glass

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.500
extract an early seven-figure sum.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.580
Simply because almost no one on earth

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.600
is capable of carrying out such a complex maneuver.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.080
Taken in other direction, the same theory of wages,

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.980
explains the salary of modern hospice nurse.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.420
Charged with accompanying people

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.900
through their last days,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.600
a task as meaningful as one could imagine,

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.820
yet whose salary is

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.360
a tiny fraction of the murderous stipend.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.800
In neither case do the wages have any

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.100
connection to the contributions being made.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.700
It simply has to do with

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.580
how many people are capable of carrying

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.280
out a task,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.800
and how much demand there is for it.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.920
It is so happens in our society

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.360
some really wonderful quality like

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.020
consideration, sympathy, and hard work

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.040
are actually rather widespread,

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.200
which has deeply paradoxical consequence.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.840
Yo can employ someone

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.360
with astonishing qualities

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.400
and get away with offering them

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.340
pretty much nothing at all.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.500
The whole economic system

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.980
can seem entirely lacking in justice.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.240
And our minds rebel against the gross

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.740
violation of the principles of fairness.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.840
It's normal if we should
scan the horizon

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.020
in the hope of finding some
answers that can lessen the pain.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.440
In the history of the West,
there've been two huge

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.040
intellectual attempts to resolve
the impressions of injustice

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.320
around wages.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.280
The first is: Christianity.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.120
A doctrine which has insisted
that a person's worth

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.140
is to be determined in an entirely
different sense to the financial.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.780
After death, the person's soul
will be weighed by God.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.580
and his or her true merits
perfectly rewarded for eternity.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.260
Wages can't change here on earth,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.400
but the meaning of the wage will
in the eyes of Christianity

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.300
be altered, and the humiliation
of poverty should

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.940
hence lose some of it's bitter sting.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.300
The other huge attempt to introduce
justice was Marxism.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.980
Karl Marx's work argued for a
new world in which

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.600
workers would, for the the first time,
rewarded according to the worth

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.620
of their contributions to society.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.700
So down would go; the wages of a hit men,
casino owners, mining tycoons.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.460
And up go the wages of the nurse,
and the farmer.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.060
Communism would return justice
to income.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.860
In their own day, these seemed like a
very impressive solutions.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.140
Yet for different reasons,
they're not in any way things

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.160
we can now put our hopes on.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.980
The current economic order is pretty
firmly established and not about to change

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.300
any time soon.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.700
But the hopes remain for some
way of dealing with the disjuncture

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.140
between wages and contributions.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.800
It may be an odd place to look,
but the most immediately

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.940
usable solution to the situation

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.220
may lie in a really unexpected place;

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.220
the walls of an upper gallery
in the Wallace Collection
in London's Manchester Square.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.300
Home to a small painting called,
The Lace Maker,

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.460
by a little-known German artist
called Casper Netscher,

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.260
who painted it in 1664.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.320
We've caught the Lace Maker in what
looks like a quiet mid-afternoon.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.840
She's concentrating on a difficult task
carefully threading her needle.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.640
It would take her five hours just
to make one square centimeter.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.520
Her eye's will tire, she'll make
something dazzling and moving,

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.300
an externalization of the best sides of her nature.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.680
And yet, her reward for the exquisite
craftmanship will be a few pennies at best.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.100
Lace making was a major industry for
women in 17th and 18th century.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.460
But as it happens, it was also one of the
lowest paid for a stubborn unbudgable

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.500
reason we coming now to understand.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.040
Lots of people could do this work.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.500
Interestingly, many artists were drawn
to paint lace maker at their task.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.100
The artists had no hopes of
reforming how lace makers got paid,

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.240
but hey had the ambition to change
the lives of lace makers nevertheless

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.480
They wanted to use art to alter
the status of these lace maker

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.240
by directing viewers to the 
intelligence and dignity

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.800
of the craft of  lace making.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.980
They hope to redeem the social standing
of this economically slighted class.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.060
What the artist were doing with lace makers
a general capacity of art

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.980
to redraw what we think as prestigious
and to return proper appreciation

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.420
for what certain people.
Especially those deemed marginal

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.180
by the dominant social hierarchy

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.360
are and do.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.400
Sadly, for all the status we accorded,

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.180
art is actually a pretty small thing in the world.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.680
But the move that art has made,
needs to, and can be redeployed

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.800
on a much larger scale

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.300
Art is a mechanism for appreciation.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.980
which is particularly adept at a close 
study in which an individual might be deserving

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.440
of tenderness, sympathy and admiration;

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.200
and yet neglected by the wider world.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.520
The goal of art is to increase the amount of dense

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.180
and accurate information about people's jobs.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.780
So we can stop using mere wages

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.400
as our measuring rods.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.280
Once we get to know people well,

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.640
in art or otherwise,the state of their bank balance

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.480
invariably declines a little.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.200
And what they're really bringing
to their task starts to emerge

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.560
along with the fairer way of
distributing honor and respect.
