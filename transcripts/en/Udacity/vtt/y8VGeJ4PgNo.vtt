00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.161
Before we do some exercises,

00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:05.321
I want you to go back to Xcode and
open up the Maze project.

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:09.815
Once you have it open, I want you
to navigate to the Move.swift file.

00:00:09.815 --> 00:00:17.525
It's located under Maze &gt; UnderTheHood
&gt; MazeMoves, and then Move.swift.

00:00:17.525 --> 00:00:19.093
This is where we describe
the Move struct.

00:00:19.093 --> 00:00:24.525
But it's just a single file, and
that seems a little confusing.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:27.110
Since the robot is
moving more than once,

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.520
don't we need more than one Move struct,
or more than one Move.swift file?

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.390
The answer is no.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.110
Think back to the analogies we used,
like engine blueprints.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.590
In the blueprints, a particular
component was defined only once.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.801
But actual instances of the component
will physically exist in tens and

00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:46.205
thousands of actual engines.

00:00:46.205 --> 00:00:48.930
And that's what this file is.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.370
It's like the blueprint for
the Move struct.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.427
We create this single blueprint, as we
can see here in the Move.swift file, and

00:00:55.427 --> 00:00:59.081
then we can create many instances of
the Move struct in our application.

00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:04.959
In programming lingo,
we'd call this blueprint a definition.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:09.430
Or we would say that in the Move.swift
file, we define the Move struct.
