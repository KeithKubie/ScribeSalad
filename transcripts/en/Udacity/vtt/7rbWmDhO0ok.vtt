We saw earlier that we could add
a map fragment or a layout file and

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.270
set properties on it to get some
pretty interesting and cool maps.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.980
We even had a 3D fly over of New York
city that was pretty cool right?

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.710
Well that just scratches
the surface of the types of app

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.000
that you can build with map integration.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.050
The XML based maps always
start in the same location and

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.120
that can be limiting for a mobile app.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.980
So in order to get
a little more power and

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.600
flexibility, we're going to switch gears
and start using the Google Map objects

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.009
to compliment the map
fragment using Java code.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.120
Once we've gotten that, it then becomes
really easy to set properties and

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.490
respond to user events on the map.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.910
Let's start with an example where
we set the different map types

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.220
such as the standard map,
the satellite view or the hybrid view.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.250
In this app,
you can see a map of New York City.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.740
And I have control
over this map by touch.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.090
I can panoram the map, and as you can
see, I can pinch to zoom in and out.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.130
When I press the buttons at the top
of the map, Map, Satellite and

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.430
Hybrid, I can change the map type.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.770
So if I touch Satellite,

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.050
I now can see details of the buildings
taken from Satellite images.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.120
Here you can see Madison Square Garden
and even when I zoom in I can

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.630
begin to see some of the seating
plans in Madison Square Garden.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.680
And of course Hybrid gives
me a hybrid of the two.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.170
I can see satellite but

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.600
I can also see data such as landmarks
like the Empire State Building and

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.830
street names such as Fifth Avenue,
as you can see here.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.140
I've done all of this using a Google
map object in my Java code.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.280
This is slightly different
from the fragment that

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.600
you used in the earlier sample.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.240
And we're going to dive in to take
a look at how to do this next.
