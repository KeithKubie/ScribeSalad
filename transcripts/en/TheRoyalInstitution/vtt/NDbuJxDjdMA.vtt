00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.040
Of course there are animals that talk.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.480
Knowing my luck, these two champion Indian
hill mynas

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.840
will now from this moment on be as silent
as the grave.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.760
But there we are.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.220
Polly put the kettle on.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.400
Bird: Polly put the kettle on.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.920
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.680
I'm not going to improve on that.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.960
I don't think I have a chance...
- Yeah.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.040
I beg your pardon.

[SIR DAVID WOLF WHISTLES]

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.660
[BIRD WOLF WHISTLES]

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.900
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.180
There are as you know a number
of birds clearly that can talk.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.180
[BIRD NOISE]
I beg your pardon?

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.800
What?

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.570
But actually you see, she doesn't actually
know Polly

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.660
and she doesn't even care whether the kettle
is put on or not.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.860
She is not actually speaking.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:24.620
What she, he is doing, is simply
imitating a call in the same way

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.750
as we might imitate a blackbird's call.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.800
He is simply singing our call with
no knowledge of what the meaning is.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.680
And of course it's true to say that there
are talking birds

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.299
but they aren't using language obviously

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.020
in the way in which we are using language.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.980
And one would, I mean what one can say clearly,

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.289
is that they actually have the apparatus.

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.600
They have the equipment in their throats

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.700
to speak most of the sounds that we make and
a lot more besides.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.780
But they don't presumably have in the brain

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.110
the sort of mechanisms that are required to
speak.
