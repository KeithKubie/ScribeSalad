00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.551
If you follow me on Instagram, you probably
know I went to the North Pole recently, and

00:00:03.551 --> 00:00:05.650
this time of year the sun never sets.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:06.680
It was crazy.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:14.090
Why is it so hard to sleep when it's light
out?!

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.919
Hey light sleepers, Trace here.

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:17.269
This is DNews.

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:21.960
Everything sleeps (or has some kind of active
and inactive cycle), but not everything sleeps

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.529
at night, like we do.

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.480
Regular DNews watchers will know about the
circadian rhythm, the pattern of sleep and

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.670
wakefulness connected to the amount of light
entering the eye.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.900
When we perceive daylight, our brains lessen
the release of melatonin, making us more wakeful,

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.200
and at night?

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.770
More melatonin, more sleepy.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.900
But, it’s not just about sleepiness.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.070
Even self-proclaimed night owls need darkness
to sleep.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.840
We evolved to sleep in the dark, and we know
this because when it's dark our hormone levels

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.719
fluctuate causing widespread changes in our
physiology.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.690
Melatonin lowers blood pressure, sugar levels,
and body temperature.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.859
Leptin makes us less hungry.

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:58.739
Both of these prep us for rest.

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.079
When we're sleeping, the levels of cortisol,
a stress hormone, drop, and our immune function

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.100
improves.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.049
Even though this explains why we sleep at
night, it doesn't tell us why we evolved this

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:10.049
way.

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.140
Sleeping at night is actually kinda weird.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.460
Only 20 percent of mammals sleep at night.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.530
Most mammals are nocturnal, spending their
days tucked away for sleepytime.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.700
A study of fossils from the last 100 million
years found nocturnal species evolved even

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.840
before mammals appeared.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.700
Primates don't have a specific pattern of
day-night cycling, in fact, a study in the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.899
American Journal of Physical Anthropology
looked at fossils of primates and found species

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.530
can be either diurnal (day active) or nocturnal
(night active).

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.049
But because we sleep at night, modern humans
probably evolved from a diurnal group of ancient

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.049
primates.

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.520
And this is supported by scientists who study
pre-industrial societies.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.020
They've found humans went to sleep just after
sunset for a while, woke up, were active in

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.229
the middle of the night (in the dark), then
slept again -- that's called second sleep.

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.180
That's our natural order, sleeping twice,
in the DARK.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.220
But now, even a little light can mess up your
sleep schedule.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.340
Because our brain is watching, alllllways
watching and gets confused when any light

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.810
is present… because it didn't evolve to
have light at night.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.000
Even when your eyes are closed your brain
sees light through your eyelids, and lowers

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.440
melatonin release.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.750
You're affected by glowing electronics, digital
clocks, and lights from other rooms or the

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.660
street that shine onto you.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.320
A study with rats found they slept in different
positions and had different sleep behaviors

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.860
when exposed only to twilight sleep, and a
study with hamsters found signs of depression

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.140
when they slept with light at the equivalent
of a glowing tv screen in their room.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.200
Studies have correlated excess light at night
with breast cancer, and darkness at night

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.880
with better performance of a breast cancer
drug, and even connected lessened tumor growth

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.190
with more sleep.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.460
Not to mention all the normal immune, obesity,
depressive and other health effects associated

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.960
with sleep.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.570
So, while we don't know exactly why we evolved
to sleep in the dark, we know our eyes and

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:13.420
brains have adapted to work better during
daytime and not at night… thus, we should

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.100
sleep in a dark room, regardless of the actual
time of day.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.120
And this is supported by the National Sleep
Foundation, so... maybe… *yawn* I should

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.820
just… have a nap.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.840
Gimmie that pillow.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:34.910
And if you are going to have a nap, sleep
soundly because AT&amp;T Digital Life smart home

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.330
security helps keep you connected to you home,
so there are no more what ifs.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:47.720
*yawn again* Why is it that Yawning makes
you want to yawn?

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.810
Why do we even YAWN!?

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.000
This ooooooooold video opens wide and checks
on this weird universal behavior.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.470
Do you sleep in PURE DARKNESS?

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:03.430
Or are you more of a meh, I'll sleep anywhere,
kind of person?
