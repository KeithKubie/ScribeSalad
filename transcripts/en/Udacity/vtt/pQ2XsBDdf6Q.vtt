00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.296
When we were talking to Grant earlier about his future profit, he was really

00:00:04.296 --> 00:00:09.021
interested in the maximum point on this parabola. Since this point indicated the

00:00:09.021 --> 00:00:13.559
vertical value, the p value, of the maximum profit he could make. This maximum

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.314
point is called the vertex of the parabola, or at least it is for this parabola.

00:00:18.314 --> 00:00:22.280
Now considering how much it mattered to Grant, and just looking at what a

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.306
special point this is on the given parabola, the vertex is clearly pretty

00:00:26.306 --> 00:00:30.834
crucial. So let's focus on this for a second. If you have a parabola shaped like

00:00:30.834 --> 00:00:35.122
this, opening upward, does the vertex have the maximum or minimum y value for

00:00:35.122 --> 00:00:39.357
any point on the curve? What about for a parabola shaped like this, opening

00:00:39.357 --> 00:00:39.970
downward?
