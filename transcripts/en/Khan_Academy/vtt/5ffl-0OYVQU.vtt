00:00:00.492 --> 00:00:03.511
- [Voiceover] Let's talk a
little bit about DNA Cloning.

00:00:03.511 --> 00:00:05.819
Which is all about making identical copies

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.822
of a piece of DNA.

00:00:07.822 --> 00:00:09.999
And usually it's a piece of DNA

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:11.798
that codes for something we care about,

00:00:11.798 --> 00:00:14.918
it is a gene that will
express itself as a protein

00:00:14.918 --> 00:00:18.258
that we think is useful in some way.

00:00:18.258 --> 00:00:19.975
Now you might have also
heard the term cloning

00:00:19.975 --> 00:00:23.225
in terms of the Clone Wars in Star Wars

00:00:23.225 --> 00:00:25.209
or Dolly the sheep

00:00:25.209 --> 00:00:26.931
and that is a related idea.

00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:30.523
If you're cloning an animal
or an organism, like a sheep,

00:00:30.523 --> 00:00:32.865
well then you are creating an animal

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:36.814
that has the exact genetic
material as the original animal.

00:00:36.814 --> 00:00:39.284
But when we talk about
cloning and DNA cloning

00:00:39.284 --> 00:00:41.853
we're talking about something
a little bit simpler.

00:00:41.853 --> 00:00:44.778
Although, as we'll see, it's
still quite fascinating.

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:48.550
It's identical copies of a piece of DNA.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.824
So how do we do that?

00:00:50.824 --> 00:00:54.433
Well let's say that this is a
strand of DNA right over here

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:55.945
and I'm just drawing it as a long,

00:00:55.945 --> 00:00:57.960
but this is a double-stranded,

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.793
and I'll just write it down,

00:00:58.793 --> 00:01:00.253
this is double stranded.

00:01:00.253 --> 00:01:01.681
I don't want to have to take the trouble

00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:03.357
of keep drawing the multiple strands.

00:01:03.357 --> 00:01:04.656
Actually, let me just draw,

00:01:04.656 --> 00:01:07.371
let me just try to draw the two strands

00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:08.883
just so we remind ourselves.

00:01:08.883 --> 00:01:10.021
So there we go.

00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:12.767
This is the double-stranded DNA

00:01:12.767 --> 00:01:16.100
and let's say that this part of this DNA

00:01:17.676 --> 00:01:20.426
has a gene that we want to clone.

00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:24.649
We wanna make copies of
this right over here.

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:26.066
So gene to clone.

00:01:27.592 --> 00:01:28.759
Gene to clone.

00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:31.557
Well, the first thing we wanna do

00:01:31.557 --> 00:01:34.045
is we wanna cut this gene out some how.

00:01:34.045 --> 00:01:35.393
And the way we do that

00:01:35.393 --> 00:01:37.523
is using restriction enzymes.

00:01:37.523 --> 00:01:39.424
And there's a bunch of
restriction enzymes,

00:01:39.424 --> 00:01:40.919
and I personally find it fascinating

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:43.748
that we as a civilization
have gotten to the point

00:01:43.748 --> 00:01:46.657
that we can find and
identify these enzymes

00:01:46.657 --> 00:01:49.908
and we know at what points
of DNA that they can cut.

00:01:49.908 --> 00:01:51.615
They recognize specific sequences

00:01:51.615 --> 00:01:52.834
and then we can figure out

00:01:52.834 --> 00:01:55.776
well which restriction
enzyme should we use

00:01:55.776 --> 00:01:57.855
to cut out different pieces of DNA,

00:01:57.855 --> 00:02:00.879
but we have gotten to that
point as a civilization.

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:02.862
So we use restriction enzymes.

00:02:02.862 --> 00:02:04.847
We might use one restriction enzyme,

00:02:04.847 --> 00:02:06.894
Let me use a different color here,

00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:10.073
that latches on right over here

00:02:10.073 --> 00:02:12.960
and identifies the genetic
sequence right over here

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.918
and cuts right in the right place.

00:02:15.918 --> 00:02:18.616
So that might be a restriction
enzyme right over there

00:02:18.616 --> 00:02:21.103
and then you might use
another restriction enzyme

00:02:21.103 --> 00:02:24.467
that identifies with the
sequence at the other side

00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:26.288
that we wanna cut.

00:02:26.288 --> 00:02:28.238
So let me label these.

00:02:28.238 --> 00:02:31.116
These, those things right over there

00:02:31.116 --> 00:02:34.091
those are restriction enzymes.

00:02:34.091 --> 00:02:35.758
Restriction enzymes.

00:02:39.161 --> 00:02:40.640
And so now you would have,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.494
after you applied the restriction enzymes,

00:02:42.494 --> 00:02:45.549
you will have just that gene.

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.378
You might have a little bit
left over on either side

00:02:48.378 --> 00:02:50.621
but essentially you have cut out the gene.

00:02:50.621 --> 00:02:53.188
You've used the restriction
enzymes to cut out your gene

00:02:53.188 --> 00:02:56.050
and then what you wanna
do is you wanna paste it

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.871
into what we'll call a plasmid.

00:02:57.871 --> 00:03:01.538
And a plasmid is a piece
of genetic material

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.070
that sits outside of chromosomes

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.516
but it can reproduce along,

00:03:06.516 --> 00:03:08.873
or I guess we can say can replicate

00:03:08.873 --> 00:03:12.125
along with the machinery of the,

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:14.107
the genetic machinery of the organism.

00:03:14.107 --> 00:03:15.196
Or it can even express itself

00:03:15.196 --> 00:03:17.520
just like the genes of the organism

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.349
that are in the chromosomes,
express themselves.

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.787
So then so this is where we cut,

00:03:22.787 --> 00:03:23.713
let me write this,

00:03:23.713 --> 00:03:25.296
we cut out the gene

00:03:26.607 --> 00:03:28.330
and then we wanna paste it

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.497
then we wanna paste it into a plasmid.

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:35.839
And plasmids tend to be circular DNA

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:38.326
so we will paste it into a plasmid.

00:03:38.326 --> 00:03:39.757
And in order for them to fit

00:03:39.757 --> 00:03:43.852
there's oftentimes these
overhangs over here.

00:03:43.852 --> 00:03:45.467
So you might have an overhang over there,

00:03:45.467 --> 00:03:47.628
you might have an overhang over there.

00:03:47.628 --> 00:03:50.424
And so the plasmid that we're placing in

00:03:50.424 --> 00:03:54.033
might have complimentary base
pairs over the overhangs,

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:56.081
which will allow it easier,

00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:59.770
it will become easier for
them to react with each other

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.825
if they have these overhangs.

00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:05.963
So let me, we're pasting
it into the plasmid.

00:04:05.963 --> 00:04:06.922
And this is amazing

00:04:06.922 --> 00:04:08.368
because obviously DNA,

00:04:08.368 --> 00:04:10.254
this isn't stuff that we can, you know,

00:04:10.254 --> 00:04:11.457
manipulate with our hands

00:04:11.457 --> 00:04:14.723
the way that we would copy
and paste things with tape.

00:04:14.723 --> 00:04:16.397
You're making these solutions

00:04:16.397 --> 00:04:18.219
and you're applying the
restriction enzymes.

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:20.851
The restriction enzymes are just in mass

00:04:20.851 --> 00:04:21.924
cutting these things.

00:04:21.924 --> 00:04:23.517
They're bumping in just the right way

00:04:23.517 --> 00:04:25.338
to cause this reaction to happen

00:04:25.338 --> 00:04:26.996
then you're taking those genes

00:04:26.996 --> 00:04:28.782
and you're putting them with the plasmids

00:04:28.782 --> 00:04:31.237
that happen to have the
right sequences at their ends

00:04:31.237 --> 00:04:32.926
so that they match up

00:04:32.926 --> 00:04:36.502
and then you also put in
a bunch of DNA ligase.

00:04:36.502 --> 00:04:37.419
DNA ligase,

00:04:40.053 --> 00:04:42.490
to connect the backbones

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.066
right over here.

00:04:44.066 --> 00:04:47.562
And we also saw DNA ligase
when we studied replication.

00:04:47.562 --> 00:04:49.395
So that is DNA ligase,

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.493
which you can think of
it as helping to do,

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:55.510
helping to do the pasting.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.321
And so now we have this plasmid

00:04:58.321 --> 00:05:01.003
and we want to insert it into an organism

00:05:01.003 --> 00:05:03.358
that can make the copies for us.

00:05:03.358 --> 00:05:05.456
And an organism that's typically used,

00:05:05.456 --> 00:05:10.267
or a type of organism is bacteria
and E. coli in particular,

00:05:10.267 --> 00:05:11.584
and so what we could do is,

00:05:11.584 --> 00:05:15.501
we could, let's say that we have a bunch,

00:05:15.501 --> 00:05:19.418
let's say you have a vial right over here.

00:05:19.418 --> 00:05:22.897
You have a vial and it
has a solution in it

00:05:22.897 --> 00:05:25.705
with a bunch of E. Coli.

00:05:25.705 --> 00:05:26.550
A bunch of E. coli.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.153
And you actually wouldn't
be able to see it visually

00:05:28.153 --> 00:05:31.615
but there is E. coli in that solution.

00:05:31.615 --> 00:05:34.248
And then you would put your plasmids,

00:05:34.248 --> 00:05:36.296
which would be even harder to see,

00:05:36.296 --> 00:05:40.524
in that solution and
somehow we want the E. coli,

00:05:40.524 --> 00:05:43.302
we want the bacteria
to take up the plasmid.

00:05:43.302 --> 00:05:45.285
And the technique that's typically done

00:05:45.285 --> 00:05:47.684
is giving some type of
a shock to the system

00:05:47.684 --> 00:05:51.033
that makes the bacteria
take up the plasmids.

00:05:51.033 --> 00:05:53.196
And the typical shock is a heat shock.

00:05:53.196 --> 00:05:56.464
And this isn't fully understood

00:05:56.464 --> 00:05:58.694
how the heat shock works

00:05:58.694 --> 00:05:59.816
but it does

00:05:59.816 --> 00:06:02.318
and so people have been
using this for some time.

00:06:02.318 --> 00:06:04.887
So if you have a bacteria,

00:06:04.887 --> 00:06:07.781
you have a bacteria right over here,

00:06:07.781 --> 00:06:09.781
it has its existing DNA,

00:06:11.243 --> 00:06:15.273
so this is its existing genetic material

00:06:15.273 --> 00:06:17.907
right over there, let me label this.

00:06:17.907 --> 00:06:19.657
This is the bacteria.

00:06:20.735 --> 00:06:24.441
You put it in the presence of our plasmids

00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:27.121
so you put it in the
presence of our plasmid

00:06:27.121 --> 00:06:29.136
and you apply the heat shock

00:06:29.136 --> 00:06:33.086
and some of that bacteria is
going to take in the plasmid.

00:06:33.086 --> 00:06:35.865
It's going to take in the plasmid.

00:06:35.865 --> 00:06:39.615
And so just like that,
it's going to take it,

00:06:40.513 --> 00:06:42.254
it's going to take it in.

00:06:42.254 --> 00:06:43.928
And so what you then do

00:06:43.928 --> 00:06:47.958
is you place the solution
that has your bacteria,

00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.509
some of which will have
taken up the plasmid,

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:51.372
and you put it

00:06:51.372 --> 00:06:54.378
and then you try to grow
the bacteria on a plate.

00:06:54.378 --> 00:06:55.428
So let me draw that.

00:06:55.428 --> 00:06:56.678
So let me draw,

00:06:57.691 --> 00:06:59.608
so here we have a plate

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.792
to grow our bacteria on,

00:07:04.792 --> 00:07:08.548
and it has nutrients right over here

00:07:08.548 --> 00:07:11.377
that bacteria can grow on.

00:07:11.377 --> 00:07:13.587
It has nutrients.

00:07:13.587 --> 00:07:15.780
It has nutrients, and so you could say,

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.837
okay well put this here

00:07:16.837 --> 00:07:19.585
and then a bunch of
bacteria will just grow.

00:07:19.585 --> 00:07:21.144
So you would see things like this,

00:07:21.144 --> 00:07:24.347
which would be many, many,
many cells of bacteria,

00:07:24.347 --> 00:07:25.825
there would be colonies of bacteria.

00:07:25.825 --> 00:07:26.980
You could just let them grow

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.378
but there's a problem here.

00:07:28.378 --> 00:07:30.702
Because I mentioned some of the bacteria

00:07:30.702 --> 00:07:32.181
will take up the plasmids

00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:33.384
and some won't.

00:07:33.384 --> 00:07:34.570
And so you won't know,

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.553
hey when this bacteria,

00:07:36.553 --> 00:07:39.804
when it keeps replicating
it might form one of these,

00:07:39.804 --> 00:07:41.982
it might form one of these colonies.

00:07:41.982 --> 00:07:43.803
So this is a colony that you like.

00:07:43.803 --> 00:07:45.672
So this one is a good colony,

00:07:45.672 --> 00:07:47.020
put a checkmark there.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.360
But maybe this colony is
formed by an initial bacteria

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.563
or a set of bacteria that
did not take up the plasmid

00:07:54.563 --> 00:07:57.489
so it won't contain the
actual gene in question.

00:07:57.489 --> 00:07:59.260
So you don't want that one.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:03.097
So how do you select for the bacteria

00:08:03.097 --> 00:08:06.396
that actually took up the plasmid?

00:08:06.396 --> 00:08:07.874
Well, what you do is

00:08:07.874 --> 00:08:10.492
besides the gene that you care about

00:08:10.492 --> 00:08:12.621
that you want to make copies of,

00:08:12.621 --> 00:08:14.371
you also place a gene

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.713
for antibiotic resistance

00:08:19.816 --> 00:08:21.490
in your plasmid.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.611
So now you have a gene for
antibiotic resistance here,

00:08:24.611 --> 00:08:26.820
and so only the bacteria,

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.854
and I think it's amazing
that we as humanity

00:08:28.854 --> 00:08:30.625
are able to do these types of things,

00:08:30.625 --> 00:08:33.762
but now only the bacteria
that have taken up the plasmid

00:08:33.762 --> 00:08:35.923
will have that antibiotic resistance.

00:08:35.923 --> 00:08:38.540
And so what you do is in your nutrients

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:41.904
you grew nutrients plus antibiotics,

00:08:41.904 --> 00:08:43.807
plus an antibiotic.

00:08:43.807 --> 00:08:47.756
Antibiotic, and so this one will survive

00:08:47.756 --> 00:08:49.447
'cause it has that resistance.

00:08:49.447 --> 00:08:52.632
It has that gene that allows
it to not be susceptible

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:53.884
to the antibiotics.

00:08:53.884 --> 00:08:56.387
But these are not going to survive.

00:08:56.387 --> 00:08:57.671
They're not even going to happen.

00:08:57.671 --> 00:08:58.728
They're not even going to grow

00:08:58.728 --> 00:09:00.775
because there's antibiotics mixed in

00:09:00.775 --> 00:09:02.271
with those nutrients.

00:09:02.271 --> 00:09:03.994
And so this is a pretty cool thing.

00:09:03.994 --> 00:09:06.205
You started with the gene
that you cared about,

00:09:06.205 --> 00:09:09.455
you cut and pasted it into our plasmid.

00:09:10.497 --> 00:09:12.706
Let me write the labels down,

00:09:12.706 --> 00:09:16.289
into our plasmid that
also contained a gene

00:09:17.355 --> 00:09:19.938
that gave antibiotic resistance

00:09:20.996 --> 00:09:23.271
to any bacteria that takes up the plasmid.

00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:26.571
You put these plasmids in
the presence of the bacteria

00:09:26.571 --> 00:09:28.083
or you provide some type of a shock,

00:09:28.083 --> 00:09:30.910
maybe a heat shock, so that
some of the bacteria takes it up

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:33.040
and then the bacteria starts reproducing.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:37.965
And as it reproduces it also
is reproducing the plasmids

00:09:37.965 --> 00:09:41.639
and because it has this
antibiotic resistance

00:09:41.639 --> 00:09:44.906
it is going to grow on this
nutrient antibiotic mixture

00:09:44.906 --> 00:09:47.685
and the other bacteria that
did not take up the plasmids

00:09:47.685 --> 00:09:49.278
are not going to grow.

00:09:49.278 --> 00:09:51.650
And so just like that you can take this,

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.983
you can take this colony right over here,

00:09:54.983 --> 00:09:57.145
and put it into another solution

00:09:57.145 --> 00:09:58.511
or continue to grow it

00:09:58.511 --> 00:10:01.729
and you will have multiple
copies of that gene

00:10:01.729 --> 00:10:05.157
that are inside of that bacteria.

00:10:05.157 --> 00:10:06.182
Now the next question,

00:10:06.182 --> 00:10:09.188
and I'm over simplifying
things fairly dramatically

00:10:09.188 --> 00:10:11.171
is well you now have a bunch of bacteria

00:10:11.171 --> 00:10:13.042
that have a bunch of copies of that gene,

00:10:13.042 --> 00:10:14.731
how do you make use of it?

00:10:14.731 --> 00:10:16.746
Well, the bacteria themselves,

00:10:16.746 --> 00:10:19.820
let's say that gene is for
something you want to manufacture

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.277
say insulin for diabetics,

00:10:22.277 --> 00:10:24.764
well you could actually use
that bacteria's machinery,

00:10:24.764 --> 00:10:27.787
we used its reproductive machinery

00:10:27.787 --> 00:10:30.419
to keep replicating the
genetic information,

00:10:30.419 --> 00:10:34.141
but you can also use its
productive machinery,

00:10:34.141 --> 00:10:35.297
I guess you could say,

00:10:35.297 --> 00:10:37.231
it's going to express its existing DNA

00:10:37.231 --> 00:10:40.189
but it can also express the
genes that are on the plasmid.

00:10:40.189 --> 00:10:43.781
And in fact that's what
would give the bacteria

00:10:43.781 --> 00:10:45.341
its antibiotic resistance

00:10:45.341 --> 00:10:47.552
but if this gene was say for insulin,

00:10:47.552 --> 00:10:51.719
well then the bacteria will
produce a bunch of insulin,

00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:55.402
a bunch of insulin molecules,

00:10:55.402 --> 00:10:57.564
which you might be able
to use in some way.

00:10:57.564 --> 00:10:59.124
And I'm not going to
go into all the details

00:10:59.124 --> 00:11:00.718
of how you will get the insulin out

00:11:00.718 --> 00:11:02.181
and how you could make use of it,

00:11:02.181 --> 00:11:03.886
but needless to say,

00:11:03.886 --> 00:11:06.873
it's pretty cool that we
can even get to this point.
