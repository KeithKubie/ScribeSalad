Sharon Rechter:
My partner Guy Oranim and I

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:11.166
started BabyFirst
with the idea and a passion

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.066
to create good
educational content

00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.633
for babies, toddlers,
and their parents.

00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:19.300
Today we have over 30 million
downloads for BabyFirst apps.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.333
When we learned about
the family category

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.666
on the GooglePlay store,

00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:26.200
it was a hundred percent match
to the BabyFirst values,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.266
because a BabyFirst app
will always have a family value

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.666
to allow a child and a parent
to interact

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:34.066
and it will always have
age-appropriate content.

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.466
We have seen that parents
can easily find

00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.600
the content
they are looking for.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.333
We now have 40% more downloads
on GooglePlay

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.266
than we do on other platforms.

00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:46.100
We like that.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.933
Yuval Rechter: The store listing
experiments tool

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.933
really allows us to know
what works in the store,

00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.100
which icon works,
which video works,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.733
which screenshot works.

00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.733
For the first time,
we can actually test it

00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.500
with real Android users,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.200
just knowing--and 100% almost--
what actually works.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.366
And that's what we like.

00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.666
It's a drag-and-drop.

00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:05.366
You can allocate
some of the traffic

00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.533
to the new experiment.

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.433
So the risk is low.
The benefit is high.

00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:11.933
In "ABC," for example,
when we tested the icons,

00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:14.733
we tried to do a darker icon
or a brighter icon.

00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.566
In the icon itself,
different colors.

00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:19.133
We tried to do two-dimensional
or three-dimensionals,

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.933
and actually see
what works better for the user

00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:23.766
and what is more visible.

00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:26.166
After running the experiments
on the "ABC" app,

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:28.966
we saw 140% increase
in the downloads.

00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:31.100
It was great.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.833

00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:37.466
In the "Play Phone" app,
we tested screenshots.

00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:40.233
We implemented an image of a
phone in the screenshot itself.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:43.100
We played with text,
with colors, with shapes.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.133
And this resulted in an increase
of 11% in organic downloads.

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:49.166

00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:50.600
Another simple thing
that we have done,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.866
we have localized our store
listing page in ten languages.

00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:57.233
This resulted in an increase
of 150% in organic downloads

00:01:57.233 --> 00:01:58.833
outside the U.S.

00:01:58.833 --> 00:02:01.233
Through a combination of
store experiments,

00:02:01.233 --> 00:02:03.500
the family category,
localization,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.533
we're able to see
a 50% increase in downloads

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:08.166
across our portfolio.

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:10.666
Sharon: I think
we're super lucky.

00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:13.366
We get to work
on something we love.

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:15.833
We make kids happy
every single day.

00:02:15.833 --> 00:02:19.300
Now we intend to offer
even better apps for kids

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.600
but also talk to the moms,

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.300
because we have their trust
right now

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.333
and want to help make
moms' life easy.

00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:26.866
We're super excited
about the future,

00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:28.166
because the model works

00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:30.133
and we can't wait for it.
