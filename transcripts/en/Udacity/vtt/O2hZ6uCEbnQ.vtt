00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:04.428
So let's try another one. If environment played little to no role and genetics

00:00:04.428 --> 00:00:08.076
played a large role in personality formation, what pattern of results do you

00:00:08.076 --> 00:00:13.405
think we would see? We'd see similar personality styles between close relatives

00:00:13.405 --> 00:00:18.616
regardless of where they grew up. We'd see similarity in personality between

00:00:18.616 --> 00:00:22.852
only close relatives who were raised together. We'd seem similarity in

00:00:22.852 --> 00:00:27.230
personality between all relatives only if they were raised together. Or

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.060
finally, we'd see similarity in personality would increase as genetic closeness

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.659
increased.
