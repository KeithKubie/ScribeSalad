[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.580
KEVIN GOVER: So as you
heard, my name's Kevin Gover.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.060
I'm the director of the National
Museum of the American Indian.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.510
If I lapse into jargon,
I'll say "NMAI,"

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.000
because it sort of
rolls off my tongue now.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.800
But that's our museum.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.250
The NMAI is a
Smithsonian Museum.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.820
We were, I believe, the
19th of the now 20 museums

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.729
and research centers that are
part of the Smithsonian system.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.990
It is by far the largest
museum complex in the world.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.470
Most of our museums are located
in Washington, but not all.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.890
And our most recent
addition to the Smithsonian

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.110
was the National Museum of
African American History

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.680
and Culture.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.950
So as you heard, I am the
director of the museum.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.780
What might surprise
you about me is

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.670
that I was trained as a lawyer.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.080
I went to law school.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.800
And I actually practiced
law for a number of years

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.750
and really liked it.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.040
I can't yet account for
why I'm not still a lawyer,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.230
except that I got
this opportunity

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.690
to come to the Smithsonian
and run the National

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.260
Museum of the American Indian.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.830
Let me give you a brief
history of our museum.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.240
In the early 1900s, there
was a wealthy New Yorker

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.880
named George Gustav Heye.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.080
And Mr. Heye was part of
the Standard Oil fortune.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.680
That seems to be where
he made his money.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.120
But he developed, for reasons
we haven't quite teased out,

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.280
a passion for collecting Native
American ethnographic material.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.040
Now, what was going on at
this time in the world--

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.110
or in the Native world--

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.770
was that there was a presumption
that Native Americans would

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.560
soon fade into
history and that there

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.330
would no longer be American
Indians in the United States.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.100
Not only was that
thought to be true,

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.030
it was quite deliberately
hoped that it would be

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.530
true by the federal government.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.640
And policies that the
government set up at the time

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.620
were really intended to see that
the tribes simply faded away

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.780
and that Native Americans would
no longer be a distinct part

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.480
of the American population.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.730
It wasn't so much extermination
as it was assimilation,

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.790
and it was quite literally
called an assimilation policy.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.510
So the anthropologists and
scholars of the time, these

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.780
are the folks that brought
us such insights as the race

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.690
science, where they
were measuring skulls

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.270
to determine the brain pan
capacity of the different races

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.740
and, from that,
drawing some pretty

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.190
broad conclusions
about the intelligence

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.170
of the different races.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.480
But these fellows
were in a near panic,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.280
because if Indians
were going to go away,

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.930
there was not any time to lose
in collecting their material

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.830
culture and learning
about these societies

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.570
that they had created.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.180
So Mr. Heye was a
part of that movement

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.030
that we now call
salvage anthropology

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.760
and spent his fortune moving
around not just the United

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.290
States, but also Canada and
Central and South America,

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.950
collecting what remained
of Native American material

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.540
culture at that time, so much
so that he managed to collect,

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:46.370
by the mid-1900s, a collection
of around 800,000 items.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.700
At first, he was keeping all of
these things in his apartment

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.710
there in New York,
which we have to assume

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.030
was a fairly large apartment.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.480
But a few hundred
thousand items would

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.400
be a little much for anyone.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.340
So his wife said, you
know, this isn't working.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.590
It's either these things
have to go, or I have to go.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:13.220
So his second wife, fortunately,
was more open to his passion.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.410
And we have some
cute pictures of them

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.529
out on archaeological
expeditions together wearing

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:20.300
the pith helmets and everything.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.910
Very much a love story.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.600
So Mr. Heye opened his museum
in New York City in 1916.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.650
And he passed away in the
1950s and left, really,

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.660
a quite handsomely
endowed museum

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.280
behind with one of the, if
not the, greatest collection

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.090
of Native American
material in the world

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.440
and in a good endowment
for continuing operations.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.910
Unfortunately, by the
1980s, the character

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.850
of the neighborhood where
he had built this museum--

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.650
this was at 155th Street
and Broadway in New York--

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.310
was not what it once was,
and attendance at the museum

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.690
collapsed.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.750
And they were still
dependent on charging people

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.320
to get into their museum in
order to finance operations.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.420
So long story short,
the collection

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.940
was in some considerable risk
of being broken apart and sold.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.010
It was at that point
that there were

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.300
several Native American members
of the board of the Museum

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.720
of the American Indian,
and they very much

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.140
wanted to see this
collection not just rescued,

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.370
but that it become the backbone
of a new Smithsonian National

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.710
Museum of the American Indian.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.875
And so after a lot of
haggling and a lot of drama

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:45.530
and a lot of
politics, the powers

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.390
that be in New York City,
New York state, the US

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.080
Senate, and the House of
Representatives, and finally,

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.930
the Smithsonian
Institution itself

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.840
came together and
struck a grand bargain

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.370
by which the assets of the
Heye Foundation's museum,

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.230
the Museum of the
American Indian,

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.470
would be transferred
to the Smithsonian.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.470
And the Smithsonian would
establish a National Museum

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.930
of the American Indian.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.890
There were two important
conditions for our purposes.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.520
One was that the
Smithsonian and the National

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.910
Museum of the American
Indian always have

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.490
a location in New York City.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.550
And so we are the only
Smithsonian Museum

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:38.210
with separate locations in
both Washington and New York.

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.780
Our New York location, for those
of you who travel to New York,

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.130
is down by Battery Park.

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.250
It's in the Alexander
Hamilton US Custom

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:51.320
House, which is a glorious old
Beaux-Arts building literally

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.290
across the street
from Battery Park.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.330
It was also a condition
that the Smithsonian

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.270
would build a state
of the art facility

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.740
for the care and maintenance
of the Heye collection.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.330
And the National Museum of
the American Indian did that.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.640
We have a beautiful facility
in Suitland, Maryland,

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.280
just outside of Washington,
which is now home to Mr. Heye's

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.020
collection.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.280
And then finally, the advocacy
of the Native American people

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.230
on the board required
that there be

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.210
a museum on the National Mall.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.430
Now, that was no small
matter, because at that time,

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.420
it was thought there was only
one place on the National Mall

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.270
where there would be
another Smithsonian Museum.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:42.210
And that's at the corner of 3rd
Street and Independence Avenue.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:45.420
The Smithsonian had
in mind that they

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:49.140
were going to build
what was quaintly

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:55.580
referred to back in the
1980s as a "museum of man."

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.420
What that really is,
aside from the sexist

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:05.900
title, is an anthropology
museum to examine cultures

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.300
from all over the
world, blah, blah, blah.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.540
So it would have been just
another anthropology museum.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.090
But it would be a Smithsonian
anthropology museum,

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.790
so it was no small matter.

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:19.220
Over time, the
Smithsonian was persuaded

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.400
that its interests lay
with having a National

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.830
Museum of the American Indian.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.520
There were some very
powerful members of Congress

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:33.350
who supported the idea and
basically told the Smithsonian,

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.650
you are going to do this.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.230
And eventually, the
Smithsonian agreed.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.320
And so the National Museum
of the American Indian

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.800
was established by
Congress in 1989.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.690
We opened our museum
in New York in 1994,

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.610
opened the Cultural
Resources Center

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:56.480
in Suitland, the home of
the collections, in 1999,

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:01.250
and opened our museum on
the National Mall in 2004.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:05.270
On the day of the opening of
the museum on the National Mall,

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.990
they estimate there were
about 25,000 Native Americans

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:12.830
from all over North, South,
and Central America who

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:14.180
attended that opening.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.580
And it was really quite a sight.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.140
Newspapers being
what they are, they

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.598
were saying things like, this
is the most Indians that have

00:09:20.598 --> 00:09:23.160
ever, ever been in this area.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.500
And of course, there's no
way for us to know that.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.740
But it's the thought
that counts, I suppose.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.560
So we'll just kind
of go with it.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.240
So that's how we came to be.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:41.930
And the museum is
doing all the things

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:44.840
you would expect a museum
to do in this day and age.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.450
We, of course, take good
care of our collections.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.780
We have exhibitions in
both of our museums.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.670
Between the two, we draw about--

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.820
a little short of 2
million visitors a year

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.530
come to our museums.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.620
We do programs,
cultural art programs,

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.740
as well as educational programs.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:09.080
We have an online presence
that we're constantly

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:14.240
trying to upgrade and
make a lot more vibrant.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:19.710
But we are now very much
a mainstream museum.

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.820
The museum did accomplish
two extraordinarily important

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.890
things in its early years.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.930
One was that, under
the legislation

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:30.470
that established the
museum, both the National

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:32.870
Museum of the American
Indian and the National

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.900
Museum of Natural History,
which is one of the oldest

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:40.460
museums in the system, were
required to begin immediately

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:44.450
returning to Native
American communities

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:47.850
human remains that originated
in those communities.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.390
The Smithsonian had
collections of something

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:54.200
like 18,000 sets
of human remains

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:59.810
that had been collected mostly
in the late 19th century, many

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:01.910
of them from
battlefields, many of them

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:05.000
from graveyards
that were identified

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.650
as the country moved west.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:11.720
And they were dug up, packaged
up, and sent back to Washington

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.800
to be a part of the
collections of the Smithsonian.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.990
When Senator Daniel Inouye
of Hawaii learned about this,

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.190
he was mortified and outraged.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:27.650
And it wasn't much challenged
that those things, those

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:31.700
remains, should be returned to
their originating communities.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:36.110
The mandate was later expanded
to include sacred objects that

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.240
were in the possession
of the Smithsonian

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.820
and objects of
cultural patrimony.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.660
And so both of the two
museums, now, Natural History

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:50.000
and American Indian, maintain
active repatriation programs.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.320
And we are returning things
that, in all honesty,

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.230
never should have left
those communities.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.870
So it's an interesting
exercise in trying

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.970
to correct a historical wrong.

00:12:04.419 --> 00:12:05.960
The other thing the
museum did that I

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.950
think is tremendously
important and that

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:13.520
now seems a little bit,
again, rather quaint

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.820
is the idea that Native
American people themselves

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.280
ought to be involved
in the interpretation

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.310
of their material culture
and their history.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:24.300
Now, that hopefully
seems really,

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:28.200
really obvious to all of you
that that is as it should be.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.340
But it was a genuinely
revolutionary concept

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:36.020
in the early 1990s, because
traditionally, the practice

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.200
had been that experts--

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.930
almost all non-Indian experts--

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:45.260
would study the material
culture of a community

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.390
and go out and interview
the Indian people

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.310
and then come back and
report to the world,

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:52.460
this is who these
people are, and these

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.420
are the things they
believe in, and this is why

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.730
they do things the way they do.

00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:00.300
Well, it probably
doesn't surprise

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.090
you to learn that they
quite often, perhaps even

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.830
most of the time, got it wrong.

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:11.920
Because when you don't actually
involve Native people directly

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.480
in the curation
of this material,

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.980
you're almost certainly going
to get large parts of it wrong.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.770
Nevertheless, it
was museum practice

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:26.410
throughout the country, and
still is in places like Europe,

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.140
that non-Indian
experts would be given

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:33.760
the authority to interpret
Native American culture.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.450
The museum came out of the box
basically saying, that's wrong.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:40.060
That is exactly the
wrong way to do it.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:45.100
The only legitimate way, the
only proper, scholarly method

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.670
for examining these
cultures and this material,

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:52.450
is to involve Native American
people themselves directly

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.190
in that interpretation.

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:58.720
And what seemed like a
radical concept 25 years ago

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.330
is now very much
mainstream museum practice.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:06.370
And I think, wow, that movement
had begun before the NMAI came

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.080
into existence.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.330
It certainly
accelerated, and the fact

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:14.140
that it was a Smithsonian Museum
that was saying these things

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.750
really made all the difference
in getting the museum

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:20.180
world to change its ways.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:24.150
So we do all the usual
things that a museum does.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.300
We have lots of
wonderful exhibitions,

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.930
and we quarrel with the critics
over whether they're good

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.840
or not.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:36.350
But what I want
to talk more about

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:40.430
is how we're trying to reach
out beyond the museum walls.

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:44.060
Obviously, that takes
place through technology.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.120
And I will hasten
to add that we are

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.670
in no way, shape, or form,
at this time, masters

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.590
of the technology.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.380
The Smithsonian somehow
managed to fall 10 or 15 years

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.600
behind the rest of the world.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.480
And it really is
quite curious to me.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.200
I came aboard at
the museum in 2007.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.660
Not that I'm a
technological expert,

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:09.980
but I was surprised
to see that we

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:15.830
were doing little more than
the basics at the Smithsonian.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:18.020
Everybody had a website.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.470
I sort of think about the
Smithsonian in the '90s

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:24.830
and think how amazed
everybody must have

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.860
been at something like email.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.640
Because this is an old place.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:38.540
It will be celebrating its 175th
anniversary in 2021, I believe.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:45.110
And there's a reason
that the dinosaur exhibit

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:50.330
at the Smithsonian is so famous,
because it sort of embodies

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:54.230
the essence of how we
are, especially when it

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.030
comes to technology.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:16:00.960
But having said that, we
are trying to do better.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.520
One of our projects is
called Native Knowledge 360.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.720
And this is an
attempt to address

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.760
what Olivia was talking about,
that Native American students

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.310
are not doing well.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.970
And I believe much of the
reason they're not doing well

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:23.990
is that they simply don't see
themselves in the curriculum

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:27.260
as it's being taught now.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:33.470
When I was growing up
and learning in school,

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:37.310
I remember not
learning a single thing

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:41.120
in school that made me
proud of my ancestors.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.330
And I think that was the
experience of most people

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:45.590
my age.

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:47.840
And it was distressing,
when we undertook

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:52.400
a study of the textbooks that
are in use across the country,

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.000
to learn that they really
haven't changed very much.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.540
There might be just a
smidge more material,

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.780
but Native Americans still
disappear from the history

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:07.490
books around 1900, never to
be seen or heard from again,

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:11.510
almost as though the American
policy of assimilation

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:15.980
had succeeded in doing
away with all the Indians.

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:20.480
At the same time,
weirdly, our visitors

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.800
don't come to our
museums as blank slates.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.339
They come there knowing
something about Indians,

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:31.370
because there are still things
about Indians sort of out

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:32.720
in the ether.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.990
Certainly, there is
in the curriculum

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:39.260
of the public schools.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.030
And in the popular
culture, there

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:45.050
is still a lot about Indians.

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:50.450
And of course, the problem
is that those ideas,

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:54.290
when they're not incomplete,
are almost entirely false.

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:56.420
But our visitors
come to the museum

00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:00.920
believing them and thinking
that, I know all about this.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.630
And museum visitors
are kind of weird,

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:06.460
because one of the reasons
they come to a museum

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.170
is they want to see
what they already

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:11.710
know confirmed by an authority.

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:14.620
And interestingly,
museums are still

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:18.760
regarded as one of the most
authoritative and credible

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.770
institutions in the country.

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:23.470
While many of others have
suffered quite dramatically,

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:28.300
whether it be our political
bodies or the media, even

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.180
universities, museums
are still kind of held

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.250
in very high regard.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:36.300
And so if you go to a museum
and you see something,

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.560
then you can say, I knew that.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.960
Then that makes you a
really smart guy, right?

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.700
And so we had to
deal with visitors

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:49.690
who were coming to our museum
and saying, what is this?

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:51.280
We have no idea what this is.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.550
Because we weren't sort
of playing to the things

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.510
they already know.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:00.610
And it doesn't
just bewilder them.

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:04.540
It kind of makes them mad
and is off-putting to them.

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:05.830
So we began thinking about--

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.600
one possible response
we could have is,

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:15.220
hey, we're the experts now,
and so just shut up and listen.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:19.400
That's usually not the
road to persuading somebody

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.560
of what you're trying to say.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:27.540
And so we thought, well, let's
maybe talk about these stories

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:33.090
that they know and see if
we can help them gain more

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:37.920
understanding by that method.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.920
So you probably all
know the stories

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.770
that I'm going to talk about.

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:48.240
If you had to say, what
are the five things

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.770
every American knows about
Native American history?

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:54.570
Most often, they're
going to include

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:57.940
things like the first
Thanksgiving, of course.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.210
That, by the way, is why
November is Native American

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:01.890
Heritage Month, isn't it?

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:05.790
Because this is the
time of year when we all

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:09.360
think about Indians, right?

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.240
Another would be Pocahontas.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:18.040
And you notice how sturdy
Pocahontas' presence

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:22.010
in the American culture is
when she's back in the news

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:27.980
and it's 2018, when she
died nearly 400 years ago.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.830
Some of the other stories
would be Little Bighorn,

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:34.610
of course, which is weird,
because it was a crushing

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.680
defeat for the American army.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:41.070
And yet people love this
story about Little Bighorn.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:44.910
And we're really
curious about that.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.420
In fact, I think of some
of our work as being,

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.630
we're doing anthropology
on white people

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:53.870
to try to understand
their strange beliefs

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:58.420
and their strange culture
and how they view themselves.

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:02.120
And that's kind of fun for us.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.890
So seriously, we started
thinking about, well,

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:09.650
why are these
stories so powerful?

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:14.510
One of the things that we began
thinking about is every culture

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:15.620
has origin myths.

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.610
Every culture has
a way of saying,

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:20.150
this is where we come from,
because that's about who

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:23.810
we are, right, as a people.

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:26.940
So we started thinking about
origin myths of the United

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.970
States.

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:31.434
And if you thought about
it for just a minute,

00:21:31.434 --> 00:21:33.350
you would come up with
several of them, right?

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:36.170
Certainly Columbus
discovering America.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.850
That's part of the
American origin myth.

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:42.270
Even though Columbus never
set foot in North America,

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:48.290
he is still claimed as
the discoverer of America.

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:52.910
But others, maybe a
little more subtle,

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:56.510
are things like the first
Thanksgiving, right?

00:21:56.510 --> 00:22:01.010
If you're in New England, that
is the American origin myth

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:02.180
in New England.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.100
Everybody knows about
the first Thanksgiving.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.110
Everybody knows
where Plymouth is.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:09.620
Everybody knows the story of
Squanto, the friendly Indian

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:13.910
who taught the Pilgrims to
grow corn, blah, blah, blah.

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:18.290
In our part of the world down in
the DC area, the mid-Atlantic,

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:22.490
the origin myth is
Pocahontas and Jamestown.

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:25.550
And everybody knows
the story of Pocahontas

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.800
in that part of the country.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:28.640
And I got curious.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.430
As we sort of move
across the country,

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:34.010
the origin myths are
always different.

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:35.940
And they're changing.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:40.520
So here in California,
there are a couple

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.050
of very powerful origin myths.

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:45.800
One is the Spanish missions
spreading up and down

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.810
the state.

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:49.820
But the other, of
course, is the gold rush.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:53.510
And these are California's
origin stories.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:55.550
It explains how the
state came to be

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:58.370
and why we're so
special, because we

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:01.070
are the descendants of these
people who did these things.

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:07.550
Anyway, so we're thinking
about, OK, well, this

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:10.170
is why they know those stories.

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:12.670
What is it about those
stories that's so special?

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:16.990
By the way, we know that these
are origin myths of the United

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:20.280
States, because if you
go into the castle--

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:24.270
the castle-- into the
Capitol of the United States,

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:26.070
in the rotunda--

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:29.790
the castle's what we refer to
Smithsonian headquarters as.

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:35.040
It's a red castle building, so
that was a slip of the tongue.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.250
In the Capitol, in
the rotunda, there

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.300
are eight very
large paintings sort

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:43.950
of circling around
the Capitol rotunda.

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:47.760
And of those, several
involve Indians.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.370
One, the most
striking, perhaps, is

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:56.056
there is a huge painting of
the baptism of Pocahontas.

00:23:56.056 --> 00:23:59.040
So Pocahontas is clearly
a Founding Mother

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.500
of the United States.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.806
Another is the "Embarkation
of the Pilgrims."

00:24:04.806 --> 00:24:06.180
It wasn't the
first Thanksgiving.

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.450
It was when the Pilgrims left
Europe to come to the New World

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:12.030
seeking religious liberty.

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:15.750
Another, my personal
favorite, is De Soto

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:18.096
discovering the Mississippi.

00:24:18.096 --> 00:24:19.470
And it's an
interesting painting,

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:21.450
because there's a whole
Indian village there

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:23.700
that De Soto is standing in.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.490
And I thought, and they never
noticed the Mississippi River

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:28.170
right here?

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:30.550
So De Soto discovers
the Mississippi.

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:33.289
Anyway, these are
origin myths, right?

00:24:33.289 --> 00:24:35.580
These are the stories we tell
ourselves about ourselves

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.190
that make us feel special.

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:40.900
So let's start looking
at a couple of them.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.050
One is the first Thanksgiving.

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:44.820
We all know the story.

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:45.870
The Pilgrims arrive.

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:48.720
They almost starve to
death that first winter.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.400
Then the friendly
Indian, Squanto,

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.410
shows up to teach
them how to grow corn.

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:56.006
And later that year, they're
thriving, and they're happy,

00:24:56.006 --> 00:24:56.880
and they're well fed.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.430
And they decide, let's
have our Indian friends

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:04.830
over for a harvest feast at
the end of our first year

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:08.670
to give thanks for
our good fortune.

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:10.800
So that's a fine story, right?

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.200
Kind of makes you feel good.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:16.920
There's the hardiness
of these first Americans

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.210
that have arrived.

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:24.030
And they were fleeing
religious bigotry.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:27.180
There's even a touch of
racial harmony in this story.

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:30.990
And so it's like, yeah,
that's who we are.

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:34.260
This is part of us.

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:37.230
Well, as you would
expect, because we are,

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:39.360
after all, just
human beings, it's

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:44.770
a little more complex and
a lot more messy than that.

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:47.440
But it is a really cool story.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.660
And so it's true.

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:52.440
The Pilgrims arrived in--

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.860
why you would want to
land in a new world

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:59.890
in a climate like that in
November is quite beyond me.

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:01.300
But that's what they did.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.570
And so naturally, they
almost starved to death,

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:07.650
because they weren't able
to grow food that year.

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:13.470
What they did do was find
the winter stashes of corn

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:17.970
that a nearby Wampanoag
village had stored.

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:21.150
And they literally
survived on this.

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:23.130
You're asking, so why
did the Wampanoag let

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:24.360
them have all that corn?

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.817
They were all dead.

00:26:25.817 --> 00:26:26.400
They had died.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.790
A smallpox epidemic had
moved through the area

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:32.730
immediately before the
arrival of the Pilgrims.

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:36.990
And so there it was,
there for the taking.

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:41.060
A second element to the
story is Squanto himself.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.790
Everybody know about Squanto?

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:44.910
Did everybody
learned that story?

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:46.020
No, OK.

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:49.830
Well, Squanto is the famous
friendly Indian, right?

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:53.280
Well his real name
was Tisquantum.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.370
And he wasn't quite as friendly
as they make him out to be.

00:26:56.370 --> 00:27:00.600
But he's an interesting
guy, because when

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:07.280
the Pilgrims arrived,
Tisquantum spoke English.

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.550
Now, how did that happen, right?

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:12.110
The Pilgrims are supposed
to be the first Englishmen

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:14.570
to show up in the New World,
and there's this Indian guy

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:17.369
going, hey, what's up?

00:27:17.369 --> 00:27:19.910
I mean, that would have freaked
me out if I were one of them,

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:22.042
right?

00:27:22.042 --> 00:27:25.430
But yeah, what had
happened is Tisquantum

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:29.930
had been kidnapped and taken
aboard an English fishing

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:30.800
boat--

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.890
and they were fishing the
North Atlantic at the time--

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:39.290
carried back to Europe as a
slave, and later was redeemed.

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:44.160
The Crown was dismayed when they
learned that this had happened.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.110
And he made his way back.

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:53.330
He was brought back to his town
there in Massachusetts only

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:57.180
to discover that they had
been wiped out by smallpox.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.570
So now, Tisquantum
is there, and he

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:03.020
becomes the go-between
between the Pilgrims

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:07.970
and the Wampanoag
Confederacy in the area.

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:14.930
So now, we've got a more
interesting story, right?

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:17.360
Because it wasn't just,
Squanto the friendly Indian

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:23.120
comes in and grunts and does
sign language to communicate.

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.430
But in fact, he's
negotiating with them

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:30.080
and engaging,
literally, in diplomacy

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:34.460
with these newcomers who were
welcomed by the Wampanoags,

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:38.090
because the Wampanoags
had just suffered mightily

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:40.310
in the smallpox epidemic.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:45.030
And the surrounding
tribes and confederacies

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:49.500
smelled their weakness, and so
the Wampanoags needed allies.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.800
And the Pilgrims could be
very formidable allies,

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.680
and so they did.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.190
And as it happens,
a year later, they

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:04.980
did, in fact, have a meal
together, have a celebration,

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:08.230
with both sides bringing
food and just having

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:09.120
a good old time.

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:13.800
They played a little
football, as we do now.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.779
And it was great.

00:29:16.779 --> 00:29:17.320
It was great.

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.220
A good time was had by all.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:23.440
But it didn't happen
the year after that.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.935
I mean, there wasn't an
annual Thanksgiving feast

00:29:25.935 --> 00:29:27.310
where they go,
hey, remember when

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:28.518
we had the Indians come over?

00:29:28.518 --> 00:29:30.640
Let's do that again this year.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.150
It didn't happen.

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:36.460
So this thing happened in 1621.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:40.480
And it was literally 200
years before it actually

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.510
came to the attention
of the American people

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:46.930
again as a thing.

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:49.690
And they found an
old journal that was

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:51.550
kept by one of the Pilgrims.

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:55.390
And this old journal,
in a single sentence,

00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:57.430
a single phrase, said,
the Indians came over,

00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:59.110
and we had a feast.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:00.400
That's it.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.820
That's all that
was said about it.

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:07.050
But now, we have this whole
Thanksgiving industrial complex

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:10.560
built up, right, where we all
know what we're supposed to do.

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.900
We're supposed to eat a lot on
Thursday, shop a lot on Friday,

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.170
watch football on
Saturday and Sunday.

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:19.680
Because that's what you
do if you're an American.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:26.070
And we base it all on this
thing that happened in 1621.

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:28.650
And so that's sort of
interesting how all of that

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:30.930
works.

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:33.900
The rest of the story
is not quite so happy.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.870
And it kind of blows up
the Thanksgiving thing,

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:41.520
because about 40 years later,
the Pilgrims and the Wampanoags

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:45.240
engaged in what was probably
the most devastating war ever

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:48.480
fought in North America--
devastating in terms

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.570
of the percentage
of the two peoples

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:54.760
that were killed
in the engagement.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.420
It was called King Philip's War.

00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:00.695
There came a point where the
Pilgrims and their successors

00:31:00.695 --> 00:31:02.820
kept coming and saying, we
need a little more land.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.230
Can you hook us up?

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:06.762
And the Wampanoags were
going, well, you know,

00:31:06.762 --> 00:31:08.970
we're getting really
short, but damn, that's

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:10.540
some nice stuff
you're offering us.

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:11.980
So we're going to take it.

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:15.120
Until the point came where
the Wampanoags could no longer

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:18.090
survive on the land that they
had, and the Pilgrims were not

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:21.390
showing any interest in being
helpful to them at that point,

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:23.640
because they had
what they wanted.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.480
And so there was a war.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.330
And it was absolutely
devastating

00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:30.310
to the New England tribes.

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:35.250
The chief of the
Wampanoags, King Philip,

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:39.450
as he was called by the English,
was ultimately captured.

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:45.000
His head was put on a pike
at the entrance to Plymouth

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.650
and stayed there for 20 years.

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:53.690
And so that's not the same
story as the first Thanksgiving,

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:54.380
right?

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:56.420
But they're really inseparable.

00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:00.740
And it seems like we should
know all of those things.

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:03.260
Let me tell you one more that's
a little bit-- well, maybe

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:05.710
a little bit more uplifting.

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:08.180
And that is the
story of Pocahontas.

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:10.940
So Pocahontas was real.

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:14.030
But if you learned
it the way I did,

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:16.610
we all know that
Pocahontas saved

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:21.110
John Smith from the
Jamestown colony

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:24.920
from being executed by
her evil father, Powhatan,

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:28.340
and went on to marry him.

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:31.580
And so here, again, we have
all these cool elements

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.860
of a good origin myth, right?

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:39.020
We have this interracial
harmony idea again.

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:41.940
And we have a love
story to boot.

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:44.870
So this is a good story.

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:49.010
And you have a beautiful
young Indian woman

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:53.510
in her buckskin cocktail dress
talking to animals and singing

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:54.710
songs.

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:57.230
So it's nice, right?

00:32:57.230 --> 00:33:00.890
But I'm sure you won't
be surprised to learn

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:03.530
that's not quite what happened.

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:05.840
As it happens,
Pocahontas was 11 years

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:13.880
old when she first met John
Smith, who was 28 at the time.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:18.080
There was, in fact, an
engagement between the Powhatan

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:23.030
Confederacy and the
Jamestown colonists,

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:26.870
who survived only because
they were provided food

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:29.420
by the Indians.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:33.830
But the rest of it is a lot
messier than we might hope.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:36.560
Pocahontas did not, in
fact, marry John Smith.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:41.030
And historians now agree that
it's extraordinarily unlikely

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:46.800
that she saved his life from
being executed for two reasons.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:50.210
The only written
source for this story

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:54.620
was a book that John
Smith himself wrote,

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:56.510
and I'm afraid he
was known to be

00:33:56.510 --> 00:34:00.170
a terrible liar and
the hero, of course,

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:01.880
of every one of his stories.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.520
So there is reason
to be skeptical.

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.590
The other thing, though,
is that he wrote a book

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:09.980
about a similar adventure in the
Middle East, where, would you

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:13.820
believe it, the exact
same thing happened where

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:15.650
a local princess
saved him from being

00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:18.350
executed by her evil father.

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:24.770
And so that that struck
everybody as probably not true.

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:26.780
So none of that happened.

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:29.150
What did happen, though,
was that Pocahontas

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:31.580
married a man named John Rolfe.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:34.370
She did convert to Christianity.

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:36.049
The sources are mixed.

00:34:36.049 --> 00:34:38.090
Different people would
tell you different stories

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:41.150
about just how voluntary
her conversion was.

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:44.560
But she did convert
and was baptized.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.820
And so there it is in
the Capitol rotunda,

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:48.739
the "Baptism of Pocahontas."

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:51.150
She looks very lovely
in her white gown.

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:54.020
And the sun is shining through
the window right down upon her.

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:56.305
So we're all good here.

00:34:56.305 --> 00:34:56.929
We're all good.

00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:58.280
It was another good story.

00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:04.180
Pocahontas then went
with her husband

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:09.790
to England, where they
had a child, Thomas Rolfe.

00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:15.790
And upon setting out to return
to America, Pocahontas fell ill

00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:19.940
and died at the age of 23.

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:25.270
So that's seems like the
end of the story, right?

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:28.800
Well, Pocahontas lives on.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.770
So why is that exactly?

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:36.200
Well, if you go to Virginia,
where I now live, and you throw

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:39.500
a stone down pretty
much any street,

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.840
you're going to hit at
least one person who

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:45.350
says they are a direct
descendant of Pocahontas.

00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:49.760
And this is fascinating,
right, because it tells us

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.290
a couple of things.

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:57.560
But one of them is that people
feel this interesting need

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:07.010
to connect, somehow, to a
Native American heritage.

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:11.450
In Virginia, they
had a huge society

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:13.940
of people who labored
mightily to establish

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:17.150
that they were, in fact,
descendants of Pocahontas.

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:20.120
And I mean, by the
thousands, there

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.700
are members of this society.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:27.560
And all the First
Families of Virginia

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:31.310
wanted to prove they were
descended from Pocahontas.

00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:34.620
And they'd pull out the books
and records and all that

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:36.050
and finally put
in an application.

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:39.360
And if you got in, you were
like an uber Virginian.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.760
You weren't just a Virginian.

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:43.235
I mean, were as good as it gets.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.280
Four of the first six
presidents come from Virginia.

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:50.020
So this is no small matter.

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:53.350
These were the aristocrats
of the United States,

00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:57.850
and they wanted to be known as
descendants from Pocahontas.

00:36:57.850 --> 00:37:03.340
Well, I'll skip past the fate
of the Powhatan Confederacy

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:05.950
except to ask you, when's
the last time you heard

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:07.851
about the Powhatan Confederacy?

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:17.080
In 1924, the state
of Virginia started

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:20.110
thinking about its Jim
Crow laws and decided they

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:22.780
needed a little brushing up.

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:27.460
So they passed a law called
the Racial Integrity Act.

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:30.340
Now, under the
Racial Integrity Act,

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:33.280
there were only two kinds
of people in Virginia.

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.840
And it determined
their legal status,

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:37.420
and it's what would show on
any public records regarding

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:38.770
their existence.

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:42.670
You had white people, and
you had colored people.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:49.390
Now, colored people were
black people, Indians, Asians,

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:54.430
anybody who wasn't 100% white.

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:56.800
And they meant that 100%.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:02.800
If there was any other
ancestry in your line,

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.930
then you were colored.

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:08.050
And needless to say, it was
disadvantageous under Virginia

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:09.850
law to be colored.

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:16.920
But then they thought,
wait a minute.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:20.269
All of our aristocratic
families have

00:38:20.269 --> 00:38:21.810
worked very hard to
establish they're

00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:24.300
descended from Pocahontas.

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:28.410
And so they are all colored.

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:31.840
Isn't that awesome?

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:36.240
Well, they were too
clever to let that stand.

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:42.240
So they passed a law that said,
except if you're 1/16 or less

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.040
Native American.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:48.210
Then you can still be a white
person under Virginia law.

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:51.738
And they called it the
Pocahontas Exception.

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:56.890
So you see, Pocahontas has
some real staying power, right?

00:38:56.890 --> 00:39:00.460
Pocahontas is still
making news in the 1920s.

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:04.589
So fast forward to the
1960s, and Jim Crow

00:39:04.589 --> 00:39:05.380
is still in effect.

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:09.230
The Racial Integrity
Act is still law.

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:12.940
And one of the provisions is
that white people and colored

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:17.330
people may not marry one another
in the state of Virginia.

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:20.740
This law was challenged
by a couple named

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:23.200
Mildred and Richard Loving.

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:27.190
Now, if you read Mildred
Loving's obituary

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:30.910
in "The New York Times,"
it says that Mildred Loving

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:35.330
identified herself as
a Rappahannock Indian.

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:38.630
And in the part of the
state where she came from,

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:40.160
that's not far-fetched at all.

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:46.670
People were there and mixing
for 400 years by that point.

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:49.360
But Mildred thought of herself
as a Rappahannock Indian, not

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:54.620
even as an African-American,
although she was clearly

00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.960
of African-American
descent, as well.

00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:00.560
So Richard and Mildred
challenged the law.

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:03.890
Lo and behold, the
Supreme Court, in 1967,

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:07.700
strikes down the prohibition
on interracial marriage

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:10.230
in Virginia and everywhere else.

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:14.400
Now, that may seem like a
long time ago to some of you.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:17.240
But not so much to me, because
my parents moved to Virginia

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.950
in 1970.

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:21.950
If we'd moved there
three years earlier,

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:24.800
their marriage would have
been prohibited under the laws

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.210
of the state of Virginia.

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:28.910
So it's not all that long
ago that these things

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:29.570
were going on.

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:36.440
Then, of course, in the 1990s,
Pocahontas had a good year.

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:40.010
In 1995, she's back in the news,
back in the popular culture.

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:42.310
Disney makes a movie about her.

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:44.000
It's awesome.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.310
All the little girls
could sing the song

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:49.130
where the wind's blowing
through her hair,

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:53.450
and she's grappling with
the moral dilemma of what

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:55.520
her obligations are
to her own people,

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:58.910
as opposed to these lovely
new people from England.

00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:02.660
And that becomes, once again,
the story of Pocahontas.

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:06.920
So you see how really
powerful these stories are.

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:09.740
They keep coming back.

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:13.550
And it's just really
interesting to me,

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:19.100
setting aside that it's such
insulting behavior that, when

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:23.330
looking for a name
everybody would recognize

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:26.690
to hurl as an insult against
a non-Indian pretending

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:31.360
to be an Indian, the president
would land on Pocahontas.

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.300
So it just gives you an
idea of how deeply ingrained

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:35.350
this stuff is.

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:41.620
So what we're saying-- there
are other origin stories

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:42.550
that we could go into.

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:45.940
The Trail of Tears
in the southeast

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:48.490
is part of their origin story.

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:51.940
As I said, the Indian Wars, and
Little Bighorn in particular,

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:55.880
and here, the gold rush.

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.480
We want to do two things.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:59.990
We know teachers are
teaching about these things.

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:02.257
And because of the material
that's available to them,

00:42:02.257 --> 00:42:04.340
we don't expect them to
go out and do the research

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:06.010
and learn all this stuff.

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:08.120
They're kind of busy people.

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.100
They're still teaching
it badly, given

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:12.980
what they've got to work with.

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:18.380
But the second thing is there's
a larger concern for all of us,

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:22.490
really, that history is
being taught in this way,

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:26.420
that these stories continue
to be taught as they were

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:32.240
100 years ago and 200 years
ago when the truth is much more

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.470
complicated.

00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:39.410
And especially in our
increasingly diverse world,

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:42.050
the least we can
do, it seems to me,

00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:47.120
is tell our origin stories in
a way that are more inclusive.

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:51.076
Now, this is very
difficult. It sounds easy,

00:42:51.076 --> 00:42:52.700
but it's really hard
when you're trying

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:54.510
to construct a narrative.

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:57.950
And so we are grappling
with that right

00:42:57.950 --> 00:43:00.650
now, as are other
museums, in how

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:04.910
to tell stories in a way
that is genuinely inclusive

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:08.810
and tremendously complex.

00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:12.440
We don't have a lot to
work with, sometimes,

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:14.480
in telling a story.

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:18.980
Nobody wants to stand
there and read what I just

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:21.110
told you on a wall in a museum.

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:26.210
That's incredibly boring,
and the visitors won't do it.

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:29.600
Most of our text, we've
got about 150 words

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:35.160
to work with to make usually
a pretty complicated point.

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.130
So we need to get
good at that, though.

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:39.770
That's the challenge
that's before us.

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:43.100
But more generally,
we need people

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:48.710
to be a lot more interested
in the complexities of history

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:53.150
and not just accept
these simple narratives.

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:57.890
The reason our current
political discourse sometimes

00:43:57.890 --> 00:44:03.160
seems so stupid and ignorant
is because American students

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:07.240
have not been taught things that
are true about their country.

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:11.560
And so one of the ways that
I've learned to think about it--

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:15.490
and I'm not always
good at it, but I try--

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:19.960
is to basically put myself
in their shoes and say,

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:23.320
the things that these people
believe about our country

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:26.530
are things I used to
believe about our country,

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:28.360
because that's
what I was taught.

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:31.420
And that's what I pick up
in the popular culture.

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:37.030
And so we should be
both humble and generous

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:40.480
in thinking about
it and in talking

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:44.410
about it to others who are
going to be-- let's face it.

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:47.380
They're going to
resist this idea,

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:52.240
because these heroic
narratives are--

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:55.700
did I lose my mic?

00:44:55.700 --> 00:45:02.270
These heroic narratives are
so much more satisfying,

00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:06.160
whereas the true stories leave
us just a little unsettled.

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:08.120
But I suggest that
maybe unsettled

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.480
is the way we should be.

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.730
So I'm going to
stop right there.

00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:14.990
And by the way,
these are the stories

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:16.560
we need to move
into the classroom.

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:18.560
Now, we don't want to be
teaching fourth graders

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:21.540
about mayhem and murder.

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:26.420
But neither should we
let their only encounter

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:31.206
with Native American history
be a happy, happy story

00:45:31.206 --> 00:45:34.850
of happy Indians and white
people all getting along.

00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:38.900
We need to start teaching them
early that it's complicated,

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:40.880
and they were just
people, just like us.

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:42.470
And they did good things.

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:44.180
They did bad things.

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:45.800
And we should know
about all of them,

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.040
if we're to draw a true
lesson from the history.

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.150
So I'm going to stop
and see if anyone would

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:52.670
like to ask some questions.

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:55.890
Or if you'd like me to
just leave, it'd be OK.

00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:57.390
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
thanks for the talk.

00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:58.760
I had a question.

00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:01.310
Are there any lesson
plans that you've either

00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:04.970
prepared for teachers or lesson
plans that others had prepared

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:06.999
but that you endorse?

00:46:06.999 --> 00:46:08.540
KEVIN GOVER: Oh,
both good questions.

00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:14.470
Yes, there are lesson plans
on our website, nmai.si.edu.

00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:21.050
And that's the museum's website.

00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:25.880
Well, there's a tile for
NK360, or Native Knowledge 360.

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:29.150
But there's only a few, and so
we are trying to populate that.

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:32.720
I mean, we need dozens in
order for it to be adequate.

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:35.880
And we're working on that.

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:40.380
As for others that we
endorse, we haven't yet,

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:41.740
but they are out there.

00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:44.790
We've seen some good
material, and another phase

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:49.470
in the project will be to add
those or at least add links

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:52.914
to those resources to the
things we're putting online.

00:46:52.914 --> 00:46:53.414
Sir.

00:46:53.414 --> 00:46:55.580
AUDIENCE: So there seems
to be a lot of whitewashing

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:56.460
of the history.

00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:58.780
Even the terminology,
like American Indian,

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:00.604
seems really whitewashed.

00:47:00.604 --> 00:47:02.020
The types of
stories, it's usually

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:05.140
related to Pilgrims
or European colonists

00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:06.400
or something like that.

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:08.500
Are there any efforts
to preserve just truly

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:09.640
Native stories?

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:10.950
KEVIN GOVER: Oh, yeah.

00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:11.450
Sure.

00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:18.040
The Indian nations have
origin myths of their own.

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:22.540
And those don't involve
Columbus or Pilgrims or anything

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:23.540
like that.

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:25.160
So yeah, those
stories are there.

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:28.930
And one thing I will
credit the anthropologists

00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:32.280
of the late 19th and
early 20th century with

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:34.840
is they were
incredibly inquisitive,

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:37.130
and they did collect
a lot of stuff.

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:40.210
And so to the extent
those stories did not

00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:43.460
survive in the oral tradition
within the community,

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:46.441
they did survive in some
of these library resources.

00:47:46.441 --> 00:47:46.940
So yeah.

00:47:49.604 --> 00:47:52.270
AUDIENCE: I think you started to
get into this just a little bit

00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:54.070
at the very end,
but I was wondering

00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:58.930
if you had any more thoughts
on how you would introduce

00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:01.300
these stories to
children at a younger age

00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:04.930
and at a time when they
really aren't able to absorb

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:08.620
the complexity of it, but
there's some introduction

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:09.892
there to build on later.

00:48:09.892 --> 00:48:11.350
Because certainly,
my experience is

00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:14.440
that the largest portion of
Native American history I

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:17.259
learned was probably in
second through fifth grade,

00:48:17.259 --> 00:48:19.050
and then I spent time
slowly unlearning it.

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:21.700
But they talked about it
less, so it was kind of--

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:26.530
I grew up in Massachusetts,
too, so the whole Pilgrims'

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:28.840
first Thanksgiving was a
big thing that we would

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:31.370
celebrate in elementary school.

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:32.120
KEVIN GOVER: Yeah.

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:35.140
So first of all,
I should quickly

00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:38.440
say I'm not an educator
and certainly not

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:42.050
an elementary school educator.

00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:43.990
We think about
this all the time.

00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:45.430
I'll give you a great example.

00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:50.020
I was here a couple of years
ago up in Sonoma County.

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:55.280
And in Sonoma, there is
a mission still standing,

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:58.240
the Sonoma mission,
which is a state park.

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:01.780
It's the only one of the
Catholic missions that

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:04.000
was not returned to the church.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.757
So if you go in there,
there's a little exhibit

00:49:07.757 --> 00:49:09.340
with a little bit
of history about it.

00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:12.970
They note that the Indians
were not always well treated,

00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:16.864
but they don't
really focus on it.

00:49:16.864 --> 00:49:18.280
But the real problem
is that there

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:21.200
was a group of kids playing
out in the courtyard

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:23.540
of the mission.

00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:26.700
And so I go out to
see what's going on.

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:29.320
And it looked like
it was a fourth grade

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:33.220
class that was there
to visit the mission

00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:34.870
and learn some history.

00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:41.540
The teachers and the chaperones
were dressed up as priests,

00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:46.280
as if they were the priests
of the mission, which

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:50.300
meant that the kids
who were there visiting

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:51.680
were the Indians.

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:54.470
And some of them, in fact,
dressed up as Indians.

00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:59.030
And so they were going from
station to station playing.

00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:02.150
They were making candles, and
they were weaving baskets,

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:05.910
and they were spinning wool,
and that sort of thing.

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:10.070
And I thought,
again, you don't want

00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:15.350
to take fourth graders down
the road of murder and rape.

00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:16.970
On the other hand,
there's no way

00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:19.910
they should be left-- this
will be their only exposure

00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:23.960
to Indians for probably
quite some time

00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:25.910
in their formal education.

00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:28.160
They shouldn't go away
thinking that the missions were

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.590
fun for the Indians, right?

00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:33.650
Now, there are ways to
teach, and you sort of pose

00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:36.830
questions to children and
say, so what must that

00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:41.780
have been like for a child to
be taken from their parents

00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:45.830
and made to work in a mission?

00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:49.430
What would that be like to have
to work so many hours a day

00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:52.680
growing food or doing whatever?

00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:56.880
And so yeah, there
are ways to do it.

00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:00.270
And we should do it.

00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:01.444
We should do it.

00:51:01.444 --> 00:51:02.360
Because you know what?

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.430
It sucks for those
little kids later

00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:06.590
when they begin to
learn, as I did,

00:51:06.590 --> 00:51:08.450
that it wasn't a happy story.

00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:12.690
And that can be really
quite disconcerting.

00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:15.170
AUDIENCE: So thank
you for the talk.

00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:19.130
How does the museum
deal with the struggle

00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:22.250
between telling other
visitors the history

00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:25.640
and connecting them to the
current American Indians who

00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:33.500
are living in the reserve and
struggling the North Dakota--

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:34.450
the Keystone Pipeline?

00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:35.200
KEVIN GOVER: Yeah.

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:37.730
AUDIENCE: There is modern
issues that actual people

00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:38.450
who are living--

00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:41.780
I feel like sometimes,
going to the museum,

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:44.420
when you are not the
powerful part of the story,

00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:46.520
it feels like we are
mythical creatures,

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:50.030
and these people disappeared,
never exist anymore.

00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:54.290
And the history, being
good or bad, it's history.

00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:55.790
And how does the
museum connect them

00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:58.430
to know these
people are actually

00:51:58.430 --> 00:52:00.800
real people living
right now and suffering

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.370
as they used to suffer?

00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:04.000
How does the museum
deal with that?

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.832
KEVIN GOVER: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:52:05.832 --> 00:52:07.040
It's the right question, too.

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:12.050
So one of the
consequences of involving

00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:15.620
Native people themselves in the
interpretation of the material

00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:19.440
is that they won't leave it at,
this is the way it used to be.

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:22.880
They always want to say,
this is how we are now.

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:25.850
One way I could have told the
end of the Pocahontas story

00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:32.120
might be that in the past two
years, eight tribes in Virginia

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:34.700
were finally accorded
recognition by the United

00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:37.100
States as Indian nations.

00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:39.770
They had gone the entire
history of the United States,

00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:44.420
despite having obviously been
there from time immemorial,

00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:46.760
without being recognized
by the federal government

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:50.180
or eligible for the services
that other Indians received.

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:53.240
So they're still there,
and they're still

00:52:53.240 --> 00:53:00.360
working and trying to
succeed as Native people.

00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:03.800
The other thing, though,
is we, in our exhibitions,

00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:06.480
try not to leave them
in the past, too.

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:08.930
So we have an exhibition
about the history

00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:15.500
of treaties between the United
States and the Native nations.

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:22.540
The last portion of the
exhibit, actually, is--

00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:27.290
there was a mile marker at
the Standing Rock camp, where

00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:29.300
all these different
people were putting up

00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:31.940
the names of their tribes
and point a direction

00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:36.080
and say how many miles it
was to where they were from.

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:38.220
They gave it to us.

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:43.430
And so that is in our exhibition
about treaties, where we're

00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:45.920
saying, treaties still exist.

00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.900
Native people still exist.

00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:50.420
This relationship still exists.

00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:53.840
And so now, it's on
us, who are here now,

00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:58.100
to say what the next
chapter is going to be.

00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:00.920
It's not hard, right?

00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:03.530
Indians are generally
invisible in

00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:07.050
contemporary American society.

00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:08.870
But you just have to
know where to look,

00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:10.910
because they're not
invisible to us,

00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:15.620
and they're certainly not
invisible in our museum.

00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:17.720
Most of our art
exhibitions are actually

00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:19.700
contemporary Native art.

00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:23.060
And it's as beautiful
and as weird

00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:27.440
as other contemporary art is.

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:28.940
SPEAKER 1: Thank
you so much, Kevin.

00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:30.160
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:30.510
KEVIN GOVER: You're welcome.

00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:30.980
Thank you.

00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:31.250
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:31.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:34.460
And thank you, everyone,
for your questions.
