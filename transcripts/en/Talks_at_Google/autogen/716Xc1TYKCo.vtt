[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:08.570
ALISON: I have the great
pleasure of introducing Erin.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.290
Erin Weed is the founder of
Girls Fight Back, a women's

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.930
safety education company.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.480
After teaching live
self-defense seminars

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.440
to over one million
people worldwide,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.054
she sold Girls
Fight Back in 2013.

00:00:20.054 --> 00:00:21.470
And since then,
she's been working

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.220
as a speaker, an author, and a
communications strategist who

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.960
helps people seek their
purpose and speak their truth.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.254
This past fall, she
spoke at TEDxBoulder,

00:00:31.254 --> 00:00:33.045
which is actually how
our Women [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:33.045 --> 00:00:33.920
Committee found Erin.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.610
We were scouring
the TEDxBoulder site

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.850
and all the different videos.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.569
And we were all
blown away by Erin

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:41.360
so we're really, really
excited to have you

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.414
in the room today, Erin.

00:00:43.414 --> 00:00:45.080
She's going to talk
to us today and what

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.092
she talked to
TEDxBoulder about how

00:00:47.092 --> 00:00:48.550
to connect with
one another, right,

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.591
connecting authentically.

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:51.602
And that is one of
the primary things

00:00:51.602 --> 00:00:52.810
we brought her in here today.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.768
She's about to do that
with us and kind of help

00:00:54.768 --> 00:00:56.600
us speak more authentically.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.430
With that, please help
me welcome Erin Weed.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.370
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:02.736 --> 00:01:03.860
ERIN WEED: Hello, everyone.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.510
I'm so happy to be here.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.505
Are we projecting?

00:01:06.505 --> 00:01:08.300
Is this good?

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.090
OK.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.590
All right.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.310
You can magically
make it happen.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.830
We're Google, right?

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.150
Isn't that what you do here?

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.920
You magically make
things happen.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.270
But my name is Erin Weed.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.750
I'm really excited to be here
on International Women's Day.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.310
This is a big day, a
big deal for all of us.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.590
I've spent a good amount
of my career working

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.950
in the women's industry--
realm, if you want to call it.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.680
And it's a place that
I feel very at home at,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.045
but I also feel like
really inspired that I

00:01:33.045 --> 00:01:34.687
saw a few men in the room.

00:01:34.687 --> 00:01:36.020
I think that's really important.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.370
We've got to be super
inclusive, and this

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.480
is so much bigger than women.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.470
We're only half the world.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.928
There's another
half, and we've got

00:01:40.928 --> 00:01:42.332
to bring the whole thing in.

00:01:42.332 --> 00:01:44.540
And one of the things we're
going to talk about today

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.924
is how to seek our purpose
and speak our truth.

00:01:47.924 --> 00:01:49.340
And one of the
reasons that I feel

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.990
so passionately about this topic
is because of women's issues.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.920
If we don't know what's
real inside of us

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.510
and if we don't know how
to show up and communicate

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.540
in a strong, powerful, and
clear way that doesn't alienate

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.700
and terrify people,
then how can we

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.870
ever expect to make progress?

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.229
So that's one of the
reasons that I am here today

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.699
is to share with you a tool--

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:12.350
because I don't want to stand
up here and talk and keynote

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.117
the whole time.

00:02:13.117 --> 00:02:15.200
I want to just give you a
little bit of background

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.940
and explain some concepts.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.700
But then we're going to do
an exercise where you all

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.100
are going to learn how to
show up more authentically

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.870
in your conversations.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.260
This is beneficial when it comes
to your personal life obviously

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.275
but even in business as well.

00:02:29.275 --> 00:02:30.900
So I'm going to show
that to you today.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.679
But first, I wanted to give you
a little background on things.

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:37.220
I actually wanted to kick off
by sharing with you this really

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.680
weird dream I had recently.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.066
We all have weird dreams.

00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:42.440
I don't know if
mine are weirder,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.970
but I had this weird dream.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.200
It was just a few weeks ago.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.970
And I feel the need
to share it with you

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.550
because it felt like
one of those dreams--

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.140
it's so simple and so clear.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.290
Yet you wake up in the morning,
you're like, what was that?

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.810
And then later on,
you're like, duh,

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.470
it was like almost
so spelled out

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.053
that I couldn't get
my head around it.

00:02:59.053 --> 00:03:00.390
So here's the dream.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.800
So I'm in this room, and
it's like a full white room.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.640
And I am a glowing egg,
like a little ball,

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.440
like that's all I am, right.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.500
And I look around in the
rest of this white room,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.380
and there's a bunch of glowing
eggs, and that's all we are.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.980
But I can tell, even by looking
at all these little glowing

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.010
marble-looking things,
we're all different.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.270
Now the only exit point
from this weird white room

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.270
is this amazing
slide that you would

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.670
find at like a
McDonaldland sort of deal.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.220
It's like crazy
colors, woo, you know,

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.690
there's like a real
party feel to it.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.280
So one by one, each of
these glowing little orbs

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.580
would go up to the
entry of the slide,

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.030
and a word would be thrown at
them like freedom or abundance

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.110
or love.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.990
And they'd be like, OK, got
it, and they'd go, "Wee,"

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.910
and they'd like go
down, down, down, down.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.490
And this "wee" went on forever.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.230
And finally, it was my turn,
and I got the word authentic.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.850
And I was, like, "Wee."

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.320
And on the way down, I
remember thinking, wow,

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.830
this is going to be
intense because to show up

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.262
authentically can
be a challenge.

00:04:10.262 --> 00:04:11.970
And what I later
learned about this dream

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.928
was that all of us--
these little glowing orbs,

00:04:13.928 --> 00:04:16.575
like maybe this is some weird
explanation of what life is,

00:04:16.575 --> 00:04:18.510
is that we come
into these bodies.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.011
And we get this one shot to
show up in a particular way,

00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:24.510
to learn something, to teach
something, to be a certain way.

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.390
And maybe it's as
simple as just one word.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.190
So mine being
authentic, I'm here

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.070
today to talk to
you just about that.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.090
And I wanted to kick
it off with a quote--

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.790
and forgive me in
advance if I trip.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.020
It's probably a 100% likelihood.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.940
I'm no ballerina.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.860
But I wanted to kick off
with a quote from Carl

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.300
Jung, a famous psychologist.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.550
He said, "The
privilege of a lifetime

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.430
is to become who you truly are."

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.080
"The privilege of a lifetime is
to become who you truly are."

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.897
It really is a privilege.

00:04:56.897 --> 00:04:58.480
And on this International
Women's Day,

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.420
I just want to
take a quick moment

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.400
to honor the fact that
we have the privilege

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.460
to do the kind of introspection
to show up authentically.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.796
Because when you're
in a war zone,

00:05:07.796 --> 00:05:10.170
when you're wondering how
you're going to feed your kids,

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.410
when you're living in
extreme poverty or terror

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.470
or even if you're in
our world, our paradigm,

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.570
and you're afraid to
go to work, or you're

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.880
afraid to come home from
work-- if there's something

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.020
in your life that's not
giving you the privilege

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.160
to show up authentically, then
how can you possibly expect to?

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.390
So we do have great
privilege living in this time

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.070
and in this place.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.820
One of the things that I've
noticed about Western women

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.100
is that sometimes that
comes a little shame

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.300
with that or guilt of like,
uh, how could I even be upset

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.050
about that meeting
that just went horribly

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.091
when I know that someone's
getting bombed halfway

00:05:45.091 --> 00:05:47.910
across the world, right.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.770
I think it's our
responsibility, though.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.380
It's our responsibility to own
that privilege and to rock it.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.510
Because what I've learned
about authenticity,

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.330
and when we show up,
it's like a ripple that

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.580
creates this energetic
force field around the world

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.680
to help other people
show up for real as well.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.770
So today let's do the
work for the women who

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.590
can't do the work
themselves and let's

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.850
really affect the world
by creating that ripple

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.410
so that other people can
show up that way, too.

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.414
So "the privilege of a lifetime
is to become who we truly are,"

00:06:19.414 --> 00:06:20.580
and we'll come back to that.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.360
But I wanted to give you a
little background about me

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.440
and how I got to this point.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.910
I believe in connection.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.540
I believe in connection
of ourselves and ideas

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.460
to other people.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.600
And when we can make
those connections,

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.360
that's when we truly
change the world.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.840
A woman named Susan
Pinker gave a TEDx talk.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.330
And her talk-- she's
a psychologist--

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.420
her talk was all
about how connection

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.590
is one of the number one things
that can lengthen our life.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.805
Like if you want to know
how to live to over 100,

00:06:58.805 --> 00:07:00.180
it comes down to
the connections.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.888
Now you might think,
oh, it's about diet.

00:07:01.888 --> 00:07:02.850
It's about exercise.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:03.600
It's actually not.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.190
Those are pretty
low on the list.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.520
The top two are social
integration and close

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.110
relationships.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.690
And she did a whole Ted Talk
on this, and it was amazing.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.150
But I believe that it's
even more than that.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.250
It's not just having
a close relationship.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.930
It's having an authentic
close relationship.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.900
So how do we show
up in that way?

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.660
So I learned how to
do this back in 2001.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.370
I had just graduated
from college.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.480
I grew up in Chicago, went to
Eastern Illinois University.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.980
And all I could think about,
being in that little farm town,

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.810
was getting the
heck out of there

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.525
and moving to the Big Apple.

00:07:35.525 --> 00:07:37.650
So I moved to New York
City, no money in my pocket,

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.370
no job, the whole deal.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:42.570
They make sitcoms about
this all the time, right,

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.260
the girl from the farm town
who goes to the big city.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.470
That was me.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.380
So I moved to New York,
and all I wanted to do

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.480
was get a job in
television production.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.140
I've always been a storyteller.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.620
I was a speech
communications major.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.855
No one actually gives
speeches for a living that

00:07:57.855 --> 00:08:02.160
do that major so a funny irony.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.720
But I really wanted
to tell stories,

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.610
and I wanted to
tell real stories.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.370
So I wanted to work in
documentary production

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:09.600
so I moved out there.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.970
And for a year, I was
working on all sorts

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:16.470
of documentaries for History
Channel, MSNBC, really

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:17.910
riveting stuff.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.490
Now also the other
side-- if anybody's ever

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.820
worked in production, it's
not a very well-paid field,

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.580
and so a lot of people
have side hustles.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.660
So one of my side hustles
was working as an extra

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.920
in reality television.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.748
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:38.100
Just let that sink
in for a minute.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.470
Working as an extra
in reality television,

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:43.590
being paid to make
reality TV seem more real.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:49.830
And that was an interesting
petri dish of what is real

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:50.790
and what is not real.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:53.290
And what I learned is that there
was a lot of inauthenticity

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:53.990
in our world.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.590
I was kind of
shocked at the time

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.840
at just how much there was.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.780
But I remember, through that
experience, thinking to myself,

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.520
we have got to
show up more real,

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.490
and it's a choice how
real do you want to be.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.670
And we have that choice
every single day.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.250
So I bopped back and forth
between making documentaries

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.720
during the daytime
and working as, like--

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.100
OK, let me just tell
you exactly what I'd do.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.920
So I worked for the show
called, "ElimiDate."

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.370
It is as classy as it sounds if
you haven't seen the late night

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.110
reruns on Bravo.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:26.580
So "ElimiDate," it's one person.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.910
They go on a date with four
people of the opposite sex.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.200
And throughout the night,
all these four people

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.270
get "elimidated" until
there's one person left,

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.640
and then you like ride off
into the sunset together.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.410
And usually in the midst
of it, there's fighting.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.280
There's drunkenness.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.290
There's belligerence.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.430
It's-- it's insane.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:46.140
Anyway it taught me a lot about
that question of like how real

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.990
do you want to be by simply
observing people who are

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.780
showing up as so inauthentic.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.610
But the thing is about New
York, I had such a great time.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:57.270
Whether it was making
movies or making crappy TV,

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:01.570
I was just having a
blast in this experience.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:03.990
So I was doing that
for about a year when

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:07.860
I got a phone call that one
of my best friends from back

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.230
where I went to college at
Eastern Illinois University,

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.410
named Shannon McNamara, had
been murdered while fighting off

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:16.290
an attacker in her apartment.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:20.140
This was one of those
game-changing moments where

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.560
it kind of reminds me
almost of "The Matrix,"

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.970
when Neo is given the choice
between the two pills.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.600
And he has the choice to
go to the real world, which

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.770
is kind of darker and gritty
and intense and scary and

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.410
uncertain, or live
in the program, which

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:42.330
is light and orderly and very
sensical and predictable and

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:43.535
safe.

00:10:43.535 --> 00:10:45.660
And in that moment of
getting the news that Shannon

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.140
had been killed,
I was like, wow,

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.550
like there's this whole
underbelly of the world.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.121
I mean, I'm almost embarrassed
to like that point in my life,

00:10:54.121 --> 00:10:55.870
I really hadn't gone
through anything bad.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.110
I really was one of
those people that had had

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.820
kind of a sheltered existence.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:04.110
And so I remember getting that
news and just the whole world

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.760
shifting and seeing it in
a different perspective.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.520
And I went home for the
wake and the funeral.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.310
Well, that first
night, I decided

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.400
to have a campfire in
my parent's backyard

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.350
and pull together
all of our friends.

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:18.780
Because when something
really bad happens,

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.150
I feel one of the most
healing things we can do

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:24.780
is share our perspective on
what did happen, to speak up,

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.730
to speak our truth.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.047
And so I had this
bonfire, and most

00:11:29.047 --> 00:11:30.630
of the people in
attendance that night

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:34.500
were me and Shannon's
sorority sisters.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.790
And so we're sitting around.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:39.480
We're all, you know, in the ages
of, let's say, like 19 to 22

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.156
for the most part.

00:11:41.156 --> 00:11:43.530
And for the first few hours,
we're talking about Shannon.

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:45.660
We're talking about who
could have done this

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.520
because, at that point,
the guy who murdered

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.840
her had not been caught.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.560
So it was just a super
intense time around that.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.600
But I noticed, as the
evening progressed,

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.330
we stopped talking
specifically about Shannon,

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.540
and we started talking
about our own experiences

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:04.680
as women in regards
to safety and fear.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.830
And I started hearing some of
my best friends in the world--

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:12.780
educated, strong, smart,
bold, beautiful women--

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.929
say things like, you know what,
after what happened to Shannon,

00:12:16.929 --> 00:12:19.095
I don't want to take that
internship at the hospital

00:12:19.095 --> 00:12:21.900
in downtown Chicago because it
just probably isn't safe to be

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.582
walking to my car at night.

00:12:24.582 --> 00:12:26.310
Or after what has
happened to Shannon,

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.620
I've learned that, you
know, this guy I'm dating,

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.720
we've been talking about
moving in together.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.280
And I was thinking about
breaking up with him.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.405
I don't think he's my guy,
but I might as well just

00:12:34.405 --> 00:12:37.290
move in with them because
it's probably safer

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:39.660
to not sleep alone at night.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.900
Then another friend saying,
I had this whole trip planned

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.750
to backpack Europe solo.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.330
And all of a sudden,
after this has occurred,

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:52.590
it just feels like a really
radically unsafe thing to do.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.950
This went on for
hours, hours of us

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:58.429
strong, empowered, bold,
educated women talking

00:12:58.429 --> 00:12:59.970
about all the things
we weren't going

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:03.960
to do because fundamentally
we were afraid.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.240
And I remember just
listening that whole night

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.390
and really taking it all in
and realizing the injustice--

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:12.894
not just of violence but
of the fact that we weren't

00:13:12.894 --> 00:13:15.060
able to be who we truly are
because fundamentally we

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.490
were afraid to be.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:21.330
And that seemed like the bigger
injustice in the two things

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:22.505
in that moment.

00:13:22.505 --> 00:13:23.880
Because I thought
to myself, what

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.088
would Shannon be upset about?

00:13:25.088 --> 00:13:26.740
She'd be pissed about that.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.740
She'd be upset that we
weren't taking the trips,

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.690
and we weren't being
with the right people,

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:33.620
and we weren't taking the jobs
that were going to fill us up.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.559
That's what she'd
be upset about.

00:13:35.559 --> 00:13:37.100
And so that was the
first time that I

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.010
started to realize the power
of speaking truth, especially

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:41.400
in a healing
situation like that.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.450
Well, the next day was the wake.

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:48.370
And it's one of these wakes
when someone young dies, I mean,

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:50.930
they're just huge, right,
just hundreds of people.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.870
She was a very loved person,
an All-American athlete,

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:56.110
very popular woman.

00:13:56.110 --> 00:14:00.140
And so we're waiting for hours
to get to the front of the wake

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.130
and to pay our respects
and to meet her family.

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:04.880
And so in these hours,
I had a lot of time

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.340
to think about
what had occurred.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:09.842
And by the time we
got to the front,

00:14:09.842 --> 00:14:11.300
I'd been thinking
about, well, what

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.130
are you going to say
in those situations?

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.370
Like how do you
speak your truth when

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:18.300
it's almost like the
unspeakable has happened?

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.830
How does that work?

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:21.890
And so I had to kind of
surrender at that moment

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:24.480
when we got up to the front
to just be, like, all right,

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.880
well, whatever's going to
come out is going to come out.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.240
And I'm just going to have
to be at peace with that,

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.230
but I'm just going to have to be
real in the awfulness of this.

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:33.700
Well, before I met her family,
I kneel in front of her casket,

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:38.210
and I just remember thinking,
this feels so unsolvable.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:40.432
This feels so permanent
and unfixable.

00:14:40.432 --> 00:14:42.140
But then I also had
a moment where I was,

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:45.080
like, I don't think people
who have passed in the way

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.350
that she did would want us
to stay paralyzed in that.

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:50.990
I think that we
don't have to put

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.880
a period at the end of
those kinds of stories

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.190
when those injustices happen,
but we need to put a comma.

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:56.731
And we need to keep
speaking for them

00:14:56.731 --> 00:14:58.900
because they can't
speak for themselves.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.250
And so I get up, and
I meet her family.

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:02.750
Now you know when
you go to college,

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.190
and you have these like
super tight friends

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:05.690
that are-- they're
like your family,

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:08.120
but you never know where they
came from because you're not

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.369
hanging out with their family.

00:15:09.369 --> 00:15:10.130
They're far away.

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.019
So I'd never met her mom,
Cindy, but I had always

00:15:13.019 --> 00:15:14.810
heard so much about
her, and she apparently

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.480
had heard so much about me
because I introduce her.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.680
I'm like, hi, I'm Erin Weed.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.070
I'm so sorry about
what's happened.

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:22.460
And she just like cuts me off.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.962
She's like, oh, you're Weed.

00:15:24.962 --> 00:15:27.420
It's like, hey, man, when you've
got a last name like Weed,

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.240
you've got to like just
own that, you know.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.752
So in college, I was Weed.

00:15:31.752 --> 00:15:33.960
By the way, I'm totally
running for governor someday,

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.678
like governor of
Colorado, um, come on.

00:15:37.678 --> 00:15:38.514
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.180
Get all the trustafarians
on Pearl Street

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:42.305
to be my campaign managers.

00:15:42.305 --> 00:15:45.341
It'll be awesome, you know.

00:15:45.341 --> 00:15:47.090
So Cindy's like, oh,
my gosh, you're Weed.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.310
And it's like, oh, yeah,
this is kind of weird, OK.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:53.330
We're just having this
moment, and we're laughing.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:54.997
And she goes-- she
just grabs my hand.

00:15:54.997 --> 00:15:56.330
We have this instant connection.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.120
She said to me, you
know what, Weed?

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.242
It's so crazy.

00:16:00.242 --> 00:16:01.700
But even after the
worst thing that

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.280
has happened, the
losing a child--

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.530
I don't know that there's
too many more worse things

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.160
that can happen in a human
existence-- she said,

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.970
you know, there's
something worse.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.070
And I was like,
what could possibly

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:15.950
be worse than what has
occurred, like this moment?

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.020
What could possibly be worse?

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:21.500
She's like, what's worse
is that I'm so afraid

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.290
that the world is going
to forget about her.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:29.192
I'm so afraid that everyone's
going to forget her name.

00:16:29.192 --> 00:16:30.650
And I remember in
that moment, just

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:35.870
being like, wow, just the moment
of that sinking in, of that--

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.610
how we can have levels of fear.

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:40.160
And how her bigger
fear in that moment

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.180
was just the forgetting of
people not hearing about her

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.084
anymore.

00:16:45.084 --> 00:16:47.750
And I think a lot of us have had
that fear, maybe for ourselves.

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:49.850
If you've ever been faced
with your own mortality

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:53.222
or the mortality of a loved
one, what if people forget?

00:16:53.222 --> 00:16:55.430
And I remember in that moment
as a 22-year-old woman,

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:56.300
just being like,
you know what, that

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.755
is one thing I know how to do
because I have a big mouth.

00:16:58.755 --> 00:16:59.630
And I can make sure--

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:00.740
I can't solve violence.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:03.590
I can't end murder,
but I know how to talk,

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:07.010
and I can get other people to
talk and speak their truth.

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:08.930
And so I kind of
walked away from that,

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:13.460
realizing the power of speaking
truth transcends death.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:17.849
It transcends tragedy, and
all of those different things.

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:20.540
What I ended up doing, with
the help of many, many people--

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.550
a great community,
is starting a company

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.224
called Girls Fight Back.

00:17:24.224 --> 00:17:25.640
And what we did
was women's safety

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.260
and self-defense seminars.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.210
We mostly went into high
schools and colleges

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:30.655
all across the world.

00:17:30.655 --> 00:17:32.030
In addition to
the United States,

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:35.030
we also expanded into
India and Pakistan.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:38.090
And we localized the content
so that it was specific

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:41.390
to their culture and to the
safety risks that they faced.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:44.540
And in addition to all that,
we were doing the radio shows

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.270
and the TV shows, and I wrote
a book and a magazine column

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:49.590
for "CosmoGirl,"
and it was amazing.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.250
It was just such an
incredible program.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:54.290
But at some point--

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:56.300
there came this
point about 12 years

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.450
in in that period of time,
I'd had two children.

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:01.466
A lot of things had shifted.

00:18:01.466 --> 00:18:02.840
And there came
this point where I

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:07.040
realized it was no
longer my story to tell.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.820
It felt like it was almost this
old story, not like it wasn't

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.100
significant, but almost
like I had crossed

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.890
the bridge from pain to peace.

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:19.505
And I noticed that a lot of
times in the victim world--

00:18:19.505 --> 00:18:22.430
it doesn't matter what
one is a victim of--

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:24.680
sometimes people can
get stuck in the story,

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:27.316
and that prevents us
from being in our truth.

00:18:27.316 --> 00:18:28.940
And I started to give
myself permission

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:34.470
to let that story not need to be
the center of my being anymore

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:38.020
and to just let it go
and to let it dissipate.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.320
So as I started doing that,
it was very kind of painful

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.620
because sometimes we can be
identified by our stories.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:47.560
It's almost like this egoic
attachment that we have.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.830
Well, I'm the woman
that NBC calls

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.870
when something bad
happens, and I'm there

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.540
to be able to show up and
offer safety strategies,

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.940
and that's who I am.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:58.885
Or is it?

00:18:58.885 --> 00:19:00.510
And so it started to
kind of slip away,

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:02.750
and the identity
started to slip away.

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.420
And so I ended up
selling the company

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.420
because I knew that it
was time for someone else

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:09.180
to tell that story and
their version of it.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.101
And I had a bit of
an identity crisis

00:19:11.101 --> 00:19:13.350
because, at that moment, I'm
like, well, who am I now,

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:16.100
you know, if I'm not
the ass-kicking girl?

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.600
Because by the way, I'm one of
the most highly trained women

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.890
in the world in ass-kicking.

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:20.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.950
Like, I'm really fun at
parties, like just-- ah.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:27.540
So it's a really handy skill
that you can do nothing with,

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:28.040
right.

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:35.900
So I found myself in a little
bit of a crisis of sorts.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.520
It wasn't midlife, but
definitely a crisis.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:39.900
I started thinking
about what I'd

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.150
learned about seeking
purpose and speaking truth,

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.160
and how can I show
up in a new way

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.960
and do both of those things.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.267
I started working for TED
and TEDx and TEDxBoulder,

00:19:50.267 --> 00:19:52.350
started coaching for them,
developed their speaker

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:54.630
coaching program,
also TEDxMileHigh.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:57.600
And I was just so excited about
this idea of really distilling

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.900
down our truth into like
the 10 to 18 minutes,

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.030
turning it into a story
that can really captivate,

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:06.050
and then affecting
audiences by it,

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:08.280
I start like doing the
speaker coaching thing.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.400
But I realized that
there's so much more to it.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.620
When you get somebody
that's like a TED speaker,

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.450
and they're
brilliant, and they've

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:18.540
got these amazing ideas, and
they've done these epic things,

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.890
and they come in, I
was thinking to myself,

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:22.830
I don't want to just
make them shiny.

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:26.670
I want them to seek their truth
and share that with the masses

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.877
because that's going to
be so much more powerful.

00:20:28.877 --> 00:20:30.960
So I came up with this
thing called The Dig, which

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.376
I'm going to share
with you today,

00:20:32.376 --> 00:20:35.850
at least a little snippet
of it, because these people

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:38.246
needed to understand their
purpose and their why

00:20:38.246 --> 00:20:39.620
and their drive
behind it if they

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.244
were going to really
be able to show up

00:20:41.244 --> 00:20:43.860
and communicate authentically.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:48.180
But I feel like speaking
truth not only affects us

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:51.570
in the personal but also
in the business world.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:54.150
Shortly after I sold
Girls Fight Back

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:55.650
and started working
for TED, there

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:59.400
was also kind of a personal
churning that was happening.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.940
I was starting to realize
that the marriage I was in

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.390
was not a good marriage.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:05.760
It was-- he's not a bad person.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:10.410
But it was really built on some
pretty inauthentic foundations.

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:13.020
And this was rough because not
only had I lost my Girls Fight

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.540
Back identity at that
point, my other identity

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.910
was being a married
mom of two kids.

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:21.390
And I started getting really
shaken at the idea of,

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:23.857
like, I don't think I'm
supposed to be here anymore.

00:21:23.857 --> 00:21:25.440
I don't come from a
family of divorce.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.200
I actually used to hold a
lot of judgment around it.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.075
And I remember being in
that moment of being,

00:21:30.075 --> 00:21:32.050
like, oh, man, this
is going to be so bad,

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:33.508
but this is what
I have to do to be

00:21:33.508 --> 00:21:36.270
real is to leave this marriage
that was not healthy, probably

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:37.846
for either one of us.

00:21:37.846 --> 00:21:40.060
So it was very painful.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:43.700
But I started to go through
the process of moving.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.320
Now when I put my
house on the market--

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.549
at the time we had been
living in Broomfield--

00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:50.340
and I put my house on
the market and, like,

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:51.423
how do you find a realtor?

00:21:51.423 --> 00:21:54.170
Well, apparently I find it
by like the grocery carts.

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:55.725
You know those realtors?

00:21:55.725 --> 00:21:57.270
Like, what a bizarre
place to like

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:59.220
put an ad, like where
your baby's butt sits,

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.654
like, all day, whatever.

00:22:00.654 --> 00:22:01.820
It worked for me apparently.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:05.190
So this guy looked friendly, so
I was like, hey, I'll call him.

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.210
So I called him.

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:08.220
I think his name
was John, I forget.

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.794
But he comes over, and
it's like him and his wife.

00:22:10.794 --> 00:22:12.210
And they're like
this dynamic duo,

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:13.530
and they've got their
whole system down.

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:15.620
And they're like, OK, what do
you want to sell the house for,

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:16.830
and how many bedrooms
does it have?

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:17.640
And does it have a basement?

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:18.540
Is it finished?

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.100
And what's the garage like?

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.800
So they were, like,
had it locked down.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.370
It was tight.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:25.536
Like from a business
perspective, how they showed up

00:22:25.536 --> 00:22:27.870
was like completely solid.

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:32.340
But never once did they ask
why I was selling my house.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:35.340
They had no idea what
was going on personally.

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.100
They were so in their
heads about the facts

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.440
of what was occurring and
how they could help me

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.900
in that sense that they
weren't really looking

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:44.490
at the bigger
experience of what does

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:47.520
it mean to let go of your home.

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.960
And that was OK
because their job

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.150
was to sell my house, right.

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:52.470
Well, they did a good job.

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:54.240
Within one day,
my house was sold,

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.420
and it was sold to
someone with a cash offer.

00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.280
Now a few weeks
after that happened,

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.009
everything was like done.

00:23:01.009 --> 00:23:01.925
I'm moving to Boulder.

00:23:01.925 --> 00:23:03.520
I'm moving forward.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.600
Somebody asked me, hey, what's
the name of your realtor

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.730
because I want to
sell my house, and you

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:10.020
sold quick and everything.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.741
For the life of me, you
guys, I could not remember.

00:23:12.741 --> 00:23:14.490
I could not remember
these people's names,

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:14.970
and I still do--

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:15.600
I still don't know.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.475
I mean, I called the
dude John because that's

00:23:17.475 --> 00:23:21.060
like statistically a good
likelihood, but I mean,

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:24.390
I didn't know, and
I think the reason

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:27.990
is because there was no
connection beyond just

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:31.200
the facts and what was
going on in the head.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.100
Now on the flip side, as
I was starting to move,

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.600
I was looking for movers.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.210
There were no ads on
grocery carts for that

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.040
so I had to do a
little more digging--

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.510
a little more yelping.

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:46.410
I found this random
company, and I hired them.

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:49.680
And this duo of
dudes were amazing

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.590
and one specifically,
his name was Frederick.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:55.980
And he was this super
charismatic guy,

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:56.855
who loved his job.

00:23:56.855 --> 00:23:58.800
He used to work in tech.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.299
And I remember asking him,
like, hey, Frederick--

00:24:01.299 --> 00:24:03.840
kind of doing the whole business
professional meeting someone

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:04.770
thing--

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:07.150
and how do you do what you
do and how did you get here?

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:08.100
He's like, I used
to work in tech.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:09.600
But I wanted to be a mover.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.250
I wanted to haul stuff.

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:13.320
And he's like, not only
do I want to haul stuff,

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.000
I want to move people.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.359
And I'm like, oh, this
is exciting, you know.

00:24:20.359 --> 00:24:22.900
And he probably read the look
on my face of being like, what?

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.270
And he's like, yeah,
we're going to move you,

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:27.656
but I'm going to "mooove" you.

00:24:27.656 --> 00:24:30.015
And I'm like, OK.

00:24:30.015 --> 00:24:34.050
I sort of like feel the need
to "mooove" while he talks.

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:35.937
And so he was like,
do you feel me?

00:24:35.937 --> 00:24:37.270
You know what I'm talking about?

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:39.720
I'm going to "mooove" you,
and I was like, not really.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.370
He's like-- he's like, why
are you selling your house?

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:44.880
And I was like, I'm
selling my house

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.088
because I'm getting divorced.

00:24:46.088 --> 00:24:47.650
Why are you getting divorced?

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:48.150
Whoa!

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:50.787
Going there, bam, you know.

00:24:50.787 --> 00:24:52.620
And in that moment,
though, I was like, wow,

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:53.670
that's so appropriate.

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:55.950
That is so appropriate because
he was being real and curious.

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:57.575
There was no judgment
in that question.

00:24:57.575 --> 00:24:59.137
He was just
legitimately curious,

00:24:59.137 --> 00:25:01.470
like, oh, you're moving because
you're getting divorced.

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:02.400
Why?

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.780
What happened?

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:07.570
So you know, I actually told
him a few things, whatever.

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:09.810
And, uh, he's like,
all right, all right.

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:11.520
It's time to
"mooove" you forward.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.644
This is not a house.

00:25:12.644 --> 00:25:14.310
This is your life,
and we're moving you.

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:18.990
You know, like, he was giving
me this sermon in my kitchen.

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:22.140
And I started realizing, oh,
my gosh, this is a mover.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:26.220
His only job is
to move my stuff.

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:31.050
And yet his why, his authentic
meaning for what he does

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:33.330
is that he wants
to "mooove" people.

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:35.760
He wants to like take
them from this phase

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.010
and get them into the
next phase of their life.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:40.860
He was able to see that
this wasn't about a moving

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:41.910
truck and strong muscles.

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:45.840
This was about helping
people make hard transitions.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.730
And because he did
that, two weeks later,

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:49.590
when somebody asked me for
a recommendation on a mover,

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:50.480
I'm like, oh, my god.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.390
You gotta call Frederick.

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:52.710
Here's his cell phone number.

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:55.153
We just texted the other day.

00:25:55.153 --> 00:25:56.115
[INAUDIBLE]

00:25:56.115 --> 00:25:57.077
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:02.820
So I feel like we can
learn a lot in business,

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.250
in addition to our
personal lives, if we're

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:07.930
willing to show up more
than just in our head

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:10.530
and in our thoughts and just
the transactions, where we're

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:12.600
actually able to
get with each other

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.840
and connect on the heart
level and the core level of,

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.040
like, what do you want.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.080
How can we get you
where you want to go?

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.821
We can feel that.

00:26:20.821 --> 00:26:23.070
And so that's what I want
to share with you guys today

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:27.160
and actually give you the
experience of how to do that.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.715
And the way we're going to
do that is this exercise.

00:26:29.715 --> 00:26:30.870
This is part of The Dig.

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:33.150
I call it Head Heart Core.

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:38.010
And the difference between
mysterious John, the realtor,

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:40.140
and awesome
Frederick, the mover,

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:43.410
was that Frederick showed
up from all three places.

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:46.230
He was willing to connect
with me on the facts.

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:48.390
He was willing to connect
with me on the feelings.

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:52.560
And he was willing to connect
with me on the desires,

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.200
and he was willing
to hold all of it.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.040
And I think we can all
show up in this way.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:01.650
This is how we be authentic is
communicating the facts, yes,

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:04.860
and the feelings, yes,
and the desires, yes.

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:08.790
But we do it, not just from
a place of transparency,

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:11.710
but from authenticity.

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:14.220
Now I gave a TEDxBoulder
talk just this past fall,

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:15.760
and it was on that topic.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.510
What's the difference between
being transparent and being

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:19.830
authentic?

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:23.520
My opinion is that it's showing
up in all three of these,

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.350
from the head, the
heart, and the core.

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:26.890
Have you ever met
somebody who is

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:29.140
just one of these people
that just spouts off anything

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:31.556
in a moment, and they're like
super proud of how authentic

00:27:31.556 --> 00:27:32.520
they are?

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.644
Even when they're hurting
people and making people cry?

00:27:35.644 --> 00:27:37.310
I actually don't think
that's authentic.

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:40.012
That's wounded
transparency, and those

00:27:40.012 --> 00:27:41.220
are totally different things.

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:44.730
Just because you have no filter
doesn't make you a real person.

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:47.700
It makes you a wounded person
who's not doing the work

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.050
to find out what's really true.

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:51.180
Because the reality
about authenticity

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:53.730
is that, if we go and
communicate about what

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:56.760
we feel about something from the
head, the heart, and the core,

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.220
it usually ends in
a very soft place.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:03.120
It doesn't usually end in
like poisonous vitriol.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:03.990
OK.

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:08.340
Our truth, I believe for
most people, is a kind truth.

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.750
It is a peaceful truth.

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:13.119
It is one who wants best for
self but best for others.

00:28:13.119 --> 00:28:15.660
So today what I want to do is
take you through the head heart

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:16.584
core exercise.

00:28:16.584 --> 00:28:18.000
This is something
that I developed

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.950
as I started working
with these TED people

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:22.080
from all over the world,
who were trying to show up

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.240
like the realtor,
but really they

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.930
had to show up like the mover.

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:27.430
They were trying
to show up and just

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:30.210
talk about their new
scientific innovation,

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:32.310
and they just
wanted to stay here.

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:33.801
But they needed
to drop down here

00:28:33.801 --> 00:28:36.300
about what they felt about it
and what they believe for it--

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:37.890
what they desired for it.

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:42.420
And that is what really started
my new company because that

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:43.949
was the thing that was working.

00:28:43.949 --> 00:28:46.490
So people fly all over the world
to work with me on their TED

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:48.212
talks, but what
they're really getting

00:28:48.212 --> 00:28:49.920
is a better
self-understanding about what

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.840
their truth is and
permission to actually share

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:52.390
that with people.

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:52.890
And guess what?

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:54.300
On the other side
of that, people

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.480
are so excited because
now you have given them

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.090
permission to show
up in that way, too,

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:02.880
and that's the ripple
I'm talking about.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:07.560
So let's talk about the head,
the heart, and the core.

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:11.130
The head is feeling-- or I'm
sorry, the head is thoughts.

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:12.630
It is things that we think.

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:15.420
It is things that are
undisputedly true, things

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:19.810
like your age, if you have
a dog, where you're from,

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:21.090
where you went to college.

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:23.290
These are our head facts.

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:26.790
They are things that
are indisputable.

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.630
The next part is the heart.

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:30.740
These are feelings.

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:33.154
This is what's true for you
emotionally in that moment.

00:29:33.154 --> 00:29:34.570
The thing about
being in the heart

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:36.910
is that it's
changing constantly.

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:39.190
What's true for you
emotionally 10 minutes ago

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:40.510
could be true for--

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:42.634
could be totally different
than what's true for you

00:29:42.634 --> 00:29:43.970
10 minutes from now.

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:46.000
So part of the trick
about being in the heart

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.760
and why so much of our culture
doesn't stay here or go here

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:52.420
even is because it
requires presence.

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:53.980
It requires us to
actually stop--

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:54.790
[INHALES]

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:55.600
[EXHALES]

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.740
--and breathe and feel
for a second to even know

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.250
what's happening there.

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:02.927
So we have a lot
of unconsciousness

00:30:02.927 --> 00:30:04.510
happening in our
culture because we're

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:05.593
just not dialed into that.

00:30:05.593 --> 00:30:09.110
And then finally the
core is I desire.

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:10.890
It's what we want.

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:14.407
Now especially women, we're kind
of trained to keep that under

00:30:14.407 --> 00:30:16.990
wraps a bit, like no one wants
to hear a woman walking around,

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:17.980
telling about what she's--

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:20.521
talking about what she desires--
what she wants in the world.

00:30:20.521 --> 00:30:21.520
She sounds demanding.

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.830
Well, guess what, when we do
this part of the exercise, what

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:25.210
you're probably going
to notice in the room

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:27.160
is when you get a
room full of people

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.450
who are showing up and
talking about what they want,

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:31.342
there's this energy
of, like, yeah!

00:30:31.342 --> 00:30:32.549
Yeah!

00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:34.090
You know, like,
because what you want

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:36.250
is probably very similar
to what other people want.

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:38.833
And, like, can't we all please
just give each other permission

00:30:38.833 --> 00:30:41.080
to say what we want?

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:46.060
It's so freeing for everyone
and even in relationships even.

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.460
Have you ever been in a
relationship with somebody

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:49.780
where they're like mad at you.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:50.906
You can't figure out why.

00:30:50.906 --> 00:30:52.530
And they won't tell
you what they want,

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:53.988
but you're trying
to figure it out.

00:30:53.988 --> 00:30:57.140
I mean, like, that is a
losing battle for everyone.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.140
But if they just
say it, even if it

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:00.640
means the relationship
is over, it's

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:05.330
such a relief because you're
finally in the truth of it.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.540
So what I'd love to
do is just not just

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:10.990
explain this but actually give
you guys an experience of what

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:13.780
does it mean to be in the
head, heart, and core.

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.000
And like I said, I developed
this for TED speakers

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.540
because this is the ingredient--
for any of you who do public

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.650
speaking--

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:21.970
this is how you speak.

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:27.345
You find the balance of I
think, I feel, and I want.

00:31:27.345 --> 00:31:29.470
If you can find the balance
of those three things--

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:31.150
and for every speech,
it's different

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:33.710
depending on the
intention of the outcome.

00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:35.110
But if you can
find that balance,

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:36.526
that's how people
are going to get

00:31:36.526 --> 00:31:39.500
the most full authentic
expression of you.

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:42.250
And on the other side of that
is where the connection occurs.

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:44.657
So it happens in
one-to-one situations,

00:31:44.657 --> 00:31:46.240
one-to-some settings
if you're leading

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.370
a team, or one-to-many,
like giving a talk

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:50.080
or even getting a webinar.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:53.650
So head, heart, core,
it's like a recipe.

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:57.180
So I was wondering if I
could get maybe three brave

00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:02.947
volunteers to come up here and
help me out with an exercise.

00:32:02.947 --> 00:32:05.530
It's going to require speaking
from the head, heart, and core.

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:08.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.392
ERIN WEED: Yeah, give
a round of applause.

00:32:11.392 --> 00:32:12.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:15.264
We've got another one here.

00:32:15.264 --> 00:32:16.232
All right.

00:32:16.232 --> 00:32:18.180
We need one more.

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:19.474
All right, OK.

00:32:19.474 --> 00:32:20.866
Round of applause.

00:32:20.866 --> 00:32:21.759
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:22.258 --> 00:32:23.190
All right.

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:26.610
Why don't we shift you
guys over here a bit.

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:28.310
OK.

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:30.530
So first of all,
thank you guys so much

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:32.330
for showing up for this.

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:35.090
It can be kind of a
brave and scary thing

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:36.860
to intentionally
speak your truth.

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.720
And what I want to
do before we begin

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.790
is almost put a little
bubble around this room.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:43.520
You know, for all of you
up there, for all of you

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.280
down here, for all of us
on stage, just kind of

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.220
imagine we have a bubble
of safety for a moment.

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:51.050
I know even before
I came on stage,

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:52.580
your first session
was some people

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:55.220
were sharing some really
amazing powerful stories.

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:58.340
So let's kind of like
reclaim that energy of safety

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.670
because we've got to have safety
to show up and speak our truth.

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:06.890
So this exercise,
what we're going to do

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:09.540
is we're going to simply
introduce ourselves.

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:13.010
So I'm going to model it,
then our three friends up here

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:16.910
are each going to
do their custom

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:19.910
piece of what I've modeled
and introduce themselves.

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:22.310
And then we're going to
have you guys pair up,

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:25.160
and you guys are going to
do this with a partner.

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.262
So I want you to experience
it as well as learn it.

00:33:28.262 --> 00:33:29.720
So what we're going
to do basically

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:35.010
is introduce ourselves three
times, first from the head,

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:38.080
then from the heart,
then from the core.

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.830
Now you might be thinking,
well, that's a bit repetitive,

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:42.782
and it's actually not.

00:33:42.782 --> 00:33:44.990
Because introducing ourselves
from these three places

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:46.622
is a totally
different experience.

00:33:46.622 --> 00:33:48.080
And what I'd like
for you to notice

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:52.220
as we're doing this exercise
is how it is in your body

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.560
and what comes
out of your mouth.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.060
There's only one
rule in all this.

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:58.700
Outside of just
confidentiality and safety--

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:00.140
can we all agree to that?

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:01.940
OK.

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.190
So outside of
that, the only rule

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:07.976
is that you can't rehearse
while other people are talking.

00:34:07.976 --> 00:34:08.888
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.260
People always laugh at
that because it's true

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.699
because that's what
we're all doing.

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:20.480
Even the most present, amazing
person, we're all rehearsing.

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:22.650
Some of us are better
at it than others

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:25.580
so it's just less
obvious, but we're all

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:26.630
doing it all the time.

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:28.213
Now let's think about
it for a moment.

00:34:28.213 --> 00:34:31.600
What are the repercussions
of a whole world

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.220
where everyone is rehearsing
while other people are talking?

00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:35.471
AUDIENCE: We're not listening.

00:34:35.471 --> 00:34:36.761
ERIN WEED: We're not listening.

00:34:36.761 --> 00:34:38.630
But even worse, on the
other side of that,

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:40.280
we're not connecting.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.889
That thing that's like
a survival deal, that

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:45.080
can actually increase
our lifespan,

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.790
we're not getting
that, and we have

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:49.460
a very lonely separate
world right now,

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.800
despite being how
connected we are.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:55.389
So we need to start
with being present.

00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:57.647
And in order to do
that, we need to trust

00:34:57.647 --> 00:34:59.730
that if we show up presently
from the head, heart,

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:03.879
or core, whatever's going
to come out is perfect.

00:35:03.879 --> 00:35:06.170
And it's probably going to
be 10 times better than what

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:11.180
you rehearsed, and I've
seen this firsthand, OK.

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:16.400
So while we're all
not rehearsing,

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.060
I'm going to kick this off.

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:19.580
Now can I have a timer?

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:21.170
Is someone good with the phone?

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:23.275
OK, cool, Jess.

00:35:23.275 --> 00:35:25.650
Sometimes I try to do it, and
I screw up the whole thing.

00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:26.360
All right.

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.790
I get like so into
it, and then--

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:30.630
OK, can you do like 60 seconds?

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:33.350
So there is a time component.

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:36.110
The reason is, I'm
a hyper distiller.

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:38.510
I don't think we need
a ton of time and space

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:40.544
to do some of things
we think that we need.

00:35:40.544 --> 00:35:41.960
Things like getting
to your truth,

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.240
people are, like, whoa,
that sounds heavy and long.

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.642
Not really.

00:35:45.642 --> 00:35:46.850
Want to know how I know this?

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:47.933
Because I a five-year-old.

00:35:47.933 --> 00:35:50.690
She gets to her
truth really fast.

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:53.249
Right now, she's in a phase
where she's not wearing shoes.

00:35:53.249 --> 00:35:54.290
Everybody knows about it.

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:54.940
It's very clear.

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:56.564
I'm not going to wear
shoes today, Mom.

00:35:56.564 --> 00:35:57.950
OK.

00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:58.622
All right.

00:35:58.622 --> 00:35:59.330
She's very clear.

00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:00.930
That's speaking from the core.

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:02.060
I will not wear shoes.

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.268
But it doesn't take a long
time to get to your truth.

00:36:04.268 --> 00:36:06.860
What does take a long time is
to filter out all the stuff

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:08.540
that we have that
stopped us from having

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.790
permission for ourselves
to speak our truth.

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:13.290
That's a totally different thing
that we all have as adults.

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:15.335
But this process will
help us take it through.

00:36:15.335 --> 00:36:17.750
So with one minute
on the clock, I'm

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:19.650
going to introduce
myself from my head,

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:21.974
facts only, completely
unrehearsed.

00:36:21.974 --> 00:36:24.140
What you're probably going
to notice within yourself

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:27.350
and maybe watching other
people is that some of us

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:28.550
are really good in the head.

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:30.216
Some of us are really
good in the heart.

00:36:30.216 --> 00:36:31.850
Some of us are really
good in the core.

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:33.391
Most of us are not
good at all three,

00:36:33.391 --> 00:36:35.210
or I shouldn't say not good.

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:36.690
It's just not comfortable.

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:39.469
It's not like you're
go-to, and that's OK.

00:36:39.469 --> 00:36:41.510
I'm not here to teach you
how to be better at it.

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:43.910
I'm just here to teach you
how to bring consciousness

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:47.232
to when you're in which
space for better, for worse.

00:36:47.232 --> 00:36:51.136
So one minute, all right,
Jess, let's do this thing.

00:36:51.136 --> 00:36:52.460
Ah, OK.

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:57.740
Facts only, if I say a
feeling, you kind of go, eh.

00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:59.420
Totally non-abrasive.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.700
All right, so facts only.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:03.790
My name is Erin Weed.

00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:05.780
My middle name is Underwood.

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:10.910
I was made fun of a lot for my
weird name through growing up.

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:14.630
Graduation ceremonies were
kind of the biggest part.

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:18.240
Erin Underwood Weed, and
everyone would laugh.

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.640
I don't think it's that
funny but whatever.

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:24.200
I am from Chicago, lived
in New York after that,

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.120
have started a few companies.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:30.594
I have two children,
ages eight and five.

00:37:30.594 --> 00:37:36.000
We live in Boulder,
just moved last week.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.250
Thought I would make
it more interesting

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:41.490
and adopt a puppy this weekend.

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:46.230
So far that's proven to be
intellectually factually true.

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:47.777
It's more interesting.

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.950
I am learning to
play the ukulele.

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:54.030
AUDIENCE: Eh.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:55.820
ERIN WEED: OK, thank you.

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:57.090
So there are my facts.

00:37:57.090 --> 00:38:00.847
So now-- um, you also notice
I kept my head on my-- my hand

00:38:00.847 --> 00:38:01.930
on my head the whole time.

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:03.888
You're probably wondering
why I was doing that.

00:38:03.888 --> 00:38:04.625
Here's why.

00:38:04.625 --> 00:38:06.750
This exercise is about
teaching conscious awareness

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:09.210
about when you're in your head,
your heart, and your core.

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:11.760
The reason I'm doing that is
so that you can have the power

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.652
to shift out of your
head, heart, or core

00:38:13.652 --> 00:38:17.320
and into a different place
in your communications.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.020
So for this exercise,
we're all going

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:21.930
to put our hands where we're
speaking from so that we can

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:23.890
start learning where we are.

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:24.720
Make sense?

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.220
Like kinesthetic
learning, OK, cool.

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:27.980
So hand on your
head, one minute,

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:30.300
facts only about who you are.

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:33.660
LISA: Hi, I'm Lisa [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:37.754
I moved to Denver
recently from New York

00:38:37.754 --> 00:38:41.130
and from-- we moved to
New York from Seattle,

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:43.404
so that's where I
originally come from.

00:38:43.404 --> 00:38:51.240
And I got engaged in October,
and we have a small dog.

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:52.122
His name is Connor.

00:38:52.122 --> 00:38:54.450
The small dog's name is Dobbie.

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:55.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:58.840
We call him our son.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.410
He'll be a junior
senator some day.

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:02.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:10.196
My fiance Connor just got a
job, and I am switching teams to

00:39:10.196 --> 00:39:14.815
[? payments, ?] and I am
going to take 30 days off

00:39:14.815 --> 00:39:18.888
in between to [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:18.888 --> 00:39:21.792
How much time do I have left?

00:39:21.792 --> 00:39:22.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:26.820
I do a little bit
of weightlifting.

00:39:29.796 --> 00:39:30.784
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:31.284 --> 00:39:32.772
AUDIENCE: Woo!

00:39:32.772 --> 00:39:35.248
ERIN WEED: Great job.

00:39:35.248 --> 00:39:35.748
OK.

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:40.680
LESLIE PACE: Hi, my
name is Leslie Pace.

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:43.620
I am a Colorado native.

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:45.250
However, I was born in Oklahoma.

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:46.910
I moved here when I was six.

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:51.600
I grew up in Aurora, Colorado,
and went to [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.396
High School out that way,
if anybody is familiar,

00:39:54.396 --> 00:39:56.260
probably not.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:40:00.102
Then I graduated from there
and went to the illustrious

00:40:00.102 --> 00:40:02.600
Howard University in
Washington, DC, where

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:05.147
I studied Computer Information
Systems with a minor

00:40:05.147 --> 00:40:07.110
in Information Assurance.

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:11.166
And I also learned how to
juggle my men very well.

00:40:11.166 --> 00:40:11.861
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:12.361 --> 00:40:18.680
[INAUDIBLE] I, then from there,
left DC and came back home.

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:21.040
I was managing
restaurants in DC,

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:24.930
and my dad was, like, we
paid for you to go and manage

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:26.770
restaurants?

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:30.320
And so I said no
and I came home.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.000
And I started working at a
startup called Zen Planner

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.810
in [INAUDIBLE] and they
do information systems

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:40.410
for fitness businesses,
and I got my [INAUDIBLE]..

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:42.774
ERIN WEED: All right, thank you.

00:40:42.774 --> 00:40:43.716
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:50.290
PAIGE: My name is Paige
Jessica [INAUDIBLE],,

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:53.341
and my name never fit
on Scantrons growing up.

00:40:53.341 --> 00:40:54.213
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:54.712 --> 00:40:57.300
And I'm an admin in gTech.

00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:59.420
I've been at Google
for eight years.

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:04.930
I started out as a TBC
and became a FTE in 2011.

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:09.020
I just recently, in August,
moved from California

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:10.303
to Colorado.

00:41:10.303 --> 00:41:12.660
And aside from a one-year
stint in Germany,

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:14.930
it's the only time I've
lived outside of California,

00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:19.250
but I'm really
excited that I left.

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:24.105
I got my degree in German
and International Relations.

00:41:24.105 --> 00:41:28.270
I live with my boyfriend
Noah and our two dogs, Budget

00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:29.638
and Bogart.

00:41:29.638 --> 00:41:30.614
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:33.305
I love to--

00:41:33.305 --> 00:41:35.750
ERIN WEED: You can't
love it, but you can--

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:38.790
PAIGE: Yep, I am outside a lot.

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:39.786
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:47.124
And I'm going on a
cruise next week.

00:41:47.124 --> 00:41:49.594
ERIN WEED: All
right, good stuff.

00:41:49.594 --> 00:41:50.582
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:52.830
OK.

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:54.380
So now it's your turn.

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:57.540
I'd love you to find a partner
and one minute for each of you.

00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:59.030
I'll tell you when
the minute's up.

00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:05.094
So remember hand on the head,
facts only, ready and break.

00:42:05.094 --> 00:42:06.516
30 seconds to find a partner.

00:42:06.516 --> 00:42:07.938
If you need a partner--

00:42:07.938 --> 00:42:10.310
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:16.256
OK, so what did you all notice
about speaking from the head?

00:42:16.256 --> 00:42:17.854
Just holler it out.

00:42:17.854 --> 00:42:19.470
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:21.120
It's hard to not
say things you like.

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.462
Yeah, what else did you learn?

00:42:23.462 --> 00:42:25.007
AUDIENCE: You run out of facts.

00:42:25.007 --> 00:42:26.340
ERIN WEED: You ran out of facts.

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:26.760
OK.

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:27.960
AUDIENCE: I ran out of time.

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:28.650
ERIN WEED: Ran out of time.

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:29.241
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:29.241 --> 00:42:30.740
She's like, I could
have kept going.

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:32.546
We've got a head
person right here.

00:42:32.546 --> 00:42:34.976
AUDIENCE: It was hard
to disconnect emotion

00:42:34.976 --> 00:42:36.440
from facts at times.

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:38.549
ERIN WEED: OK, great.

00:42:38.549 --> 00:42:40.757
AUDIENCE: The stuff they
said was pretty interesting.

00:42:40.757 --> 00:42:41.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:45.290
ERIN WEED: You're like,
I'm a totally lame person.

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:47.440
What a tough discovery
at a workshop, you know.

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:52.970
Well, the great
thing about head--

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:55.552
like this is by no means--
the punch line is not,

00:42:55.552 --> 00:42:58.010
like, don't stay in your head--
don't like go to your head.

00:42:58.010 --> 00:42:59.343
Like, that's not the punch line.

00:42:59.343 --> 00:43:02.331
The punch line is don't
live in your head, OK.

00:43:02.331 --> 00:43:03.830
And that's what a
lot of our culture

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:05.180
does is we live in our head.

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:07.760
Like networking
events, great example.

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.050
You go to a networking event.

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:10.550
What are the two
questions people ask you?

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:11.720
AUDIENCE: What do you do?

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:12.500
ERIN WEED: Where are you from?

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:13.580
And what do you do?

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:16.670
Right, over and
over and over again.

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:19.400
And it's-- what it leads
to is just this culture

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:22.220
of disconnection because that's
like where we're starting.

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:24.620
Now I don't have a problem
with starting there,

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:27.856
if you use it as a jumping off
point to go somewhere else.

00:43:27.856 --> 00:43:29.480
Because it can be
socially awkward just

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:31.396
to walk up to someone
and be like what are you

00:43:31.396 --> 00:43:33.095
passionate about?

00:43:33.095 --> 00:43:34.920
You know, like
sometimes we've got

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.470
to like ease into
it a little bit.

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:40.550
But if we just let it go
there-- one of the things

00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:43.100
I notice about the where are
you from, what do you do thing,

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:44.516
especially the
where are you from.

00:43:44.516 --> 00:43:46.940
Like, you'd be like, oh, be
like, oh, I'm from Chicago.

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.815
And then the person I
just met, they're like,

00:43:48.815 --> 00:43:50.790
oh, I have a cousin
who is from Wilmette,

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:52.160
which is outside of Chicago.

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:54.035
Oh, really, where
did she go to school?

00:43:54.035 --> 00:43:55.771
And, oh, oh, really,
she went to Loyola.

00:43:55.771 --> 00:43:57.395
Oh, I have a friend
who went to Loyola.

00:43:57.395 --> 00:43:59.330
And I'm like, where
is this going?

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:01.470
Like, we're now talking
about two people

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:05.130
that neither one of us
really know at this point.

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:08.581
Anyway, not authentic,
very, very transparent, OK.

00:44:08.581 --> 00:44:10.580
So we want to go for the
authenticity, the head,

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.230
the heart, and the
core as a blend.

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:13.670
But now one of the
reasons head is

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:17.030
important is because
it gives context.

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:19.010
Oh, where is that person from?

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:20.570
Now we can place them.

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:22.790
There's something about
having context that

00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:24.134
allows you to trust someone.

00:44:24.134 --> 00:44:26.300
Like, if I would've just
stepped up here and started

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.960
talking about stuff, and
Alison hadn't introduced me,

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:31.100
and you had no context
of like what my deal was

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:32.892
or what my background
was, you'd be

00:44:32.892 --> 00:44:34.610
thinking, why the heck is
this woman here right now?

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:36.068
And like why am I
listening to her?

00:44:36.068 --> 00:44:37.560
Like I don't understand.

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:39.080
So head is powerful
and important

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:40.942
as long as we don't
stay there forever.

00:44:40.942 --> 00:44:42.120
OK.

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:45.044
So now let's move on to
the second part, the heart.

00:44:45.044 --> 00:44:46.460
Now for this part
of the exercise,

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:49.170
I'm going to give
you two minutes.

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:50.686
The reason is--

00:44:50.686 --> 00:44:52.610
I know, it's kind of crazy.

00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:54.410
Two minutes of
feelings, everybody,

00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:57.410
that's what you get today.

00:44:57.410 --> 00:45:00.740
So the reason I make
this a little bit longer

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:04.760
is because I like to create
some time and space for you

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:08.810
to even figure this stuff
out before you start talking.

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:13.580
So many times in our culture,
we just talk way too soon.

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:15.710
We just started saying
all this crazy stuff that

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:19.070
is not true, not authentic,
maybe not even transparent,

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:22.350
just because we are
conditioned to fill the space.

00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:24.050
So in your personal
relationships,

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:26.750
in business, doesn't
matter, I encourage you all

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:29.240
to take a minute, take
a day, take a week,

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:34.530
take what you need to figure out
what is the authentic emotion.

00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:37.580
So within this exercise, I'd
love for you all to start out.

00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:41.804
We all have our hand on our
heart and start off just--

00:45:41.804 --> 00:45:42.692
[INHALES]

--taking a breath.

00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:50.600
Close your eyes if you need
to, just drop in with yourself.

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:53.429
What if we did this
like eight times a day?

00:45:53.429 --> 00:45:54.970
Wouldn't that be an
interesting life?

00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:56.803
We wouldn't be so lame
anymore because you'd

00:45:56.803 --> 00:46:01.790
actually kind of see, whoa,
I'm like a complex individual.

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:05.930
I've got range, you
know, and it's true.

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:09.530
So we need to like drop down
and sink in to even figure out

00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:10.920
what that is.

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:11.990
OK.

00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:14.700
So I'll model it for you.

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:15.840
Give me two minutes.

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.104
All right.

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:21.170

So I'm in this space
right now where

00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:27.500
I'm feeling total joy
and connection because

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:29.780
of this puppy that I adopted.

00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:32.480
I have not had a
dog for like years

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:35.120
because my pug died
a few years ago,

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:36.920
and I've always wanted
this French bulldog.

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:38.419
Like, I want a
French bulldog, but I

00:46:38.419 --> 00:46:40.060
didn't want to do
a breeder because I

00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:42.352
was like this ethical
thing around it.

00:46:42.352 --> 00:46:44.810
So I was like I want to
adopt a French bulldog,

00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:47.240
like it doesn't
happen very often.

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:48.860
And then she came
through Petfinder,

00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:50.885
which I would get obsessively.

00:46:50.885 --> 00:46:54.080
And she showed up, and she
was given up and discarded

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:58.840
by a breeder because she has
this epic underbite, like out

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:01.190
of control, like teeth
hanging out of mouth.

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:02.471
Like she's 11 pounds.

00:47:02.471 --> 00:47:04.970
And I just remember feeling in
that moment like, oh, my god,

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:06.069
that's my dog.

00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:07.610
And I just moved a
week ago, and this

00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:10.109
is terrible timing and awful,
but like something in my heart

00:47:10.109 --> 00:47:12.620
just like was exploding
for this little creature.

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:15.010
So we rescued her on Sunday.

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:18.280
And ever since then, I'm like
in total puppy craziness.

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:20.030
But it's just like
something about her,

00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:23.240
it's like reawakened
what it means to connect,

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.040
what it means to
care for people,

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:29.000
what it means to be
straightforward about what

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.610
you need.

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:32.180
Like don't eat my couch.

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:33.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:39.800
Do not crap there, you know, but
just in a loving sort of way,

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:42.000
just to show up in that way.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.220
And so I've really
been basking in that.

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:46.810
And yesterday my kids met
her for the first time,

00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:50.520
and it was just like, I'm
still kind of like riding it.

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:52.910
And it's, for me, kind
of a welcome respite,

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:55.410
just with so much that's going
on in the world right now.

00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:58.925
I actually kind of came out
of like a month of just--

00:47:58.925 --> 00:48:02.960
not dumps, per se, but
just feeling like just

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.810
the world was disconnected
from each other, you know.

00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:09.677
And it just kind of felt
dark and a little hopeless

00:48:09.677 --> 00:48:10.760
after the school shooting.

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:12.320
Ever since the school
shooting, like really

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:14.030
kind of rocked me
to my core because I

00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:16.790
used to get the calls when that
sort of thing would happen.

00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:19.040
And now I have two kids that
are in elementary school,

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:21.360
and it's real in a
whole different way.

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:24.704
And so-- out of time?

00:48:24.704 --> 00:48:26.870
So when the time ends, like,
you finish your thought

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:28.286
because otherwise
it's just abrupt

00:48:28.286 --> 00:48:30.230
and feels weird for everybody.

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:34.382
So really, in closing,
what I've been feeling into

00:48:34.382 --> 00:48:35.840
is just like the
paradox of what it

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:40.070
is to be alive, of like
holding the light and the dark

00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:42.920
in the very same moment, and
the joy and the pain in the very

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:49.550
same moment, and just trying
to become more skillful, which

00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:51.854
is allowing it all to be true.

00:48:51.854 --> 00:48:53.822
Thank you.

00:48:53.822 --> 00:48:54.806
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:59.234 --> 00:49:02.010
Good breath, the whole room
can take a breath, too,

00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:04.400
because when you're
hearing other people share,

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:07.190
it can be heavy on you as well.

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:09.190
LISA: I had a
therapist once tell me

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:12.470
that this is a self-soothing
hand motion, too,

00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:15.658
so it actually feels real nice.

00:49:15.658 --> 00:49:16.652
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:25.120
So I moved to Boulder--
well, I moved to Denver,

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:27.812
work in Boulder--

00:49:27.812 --> 00:49:31.620
May of last year is when
I technically started.

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:35.730
And pretty much from day
one, I was in a situation

00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:40.360
that wasn't good for me.

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:42.245
I think, well, it's
a complex thing,

00:49:42.245 --> 00:49:44.227
and there's many reasons,
but ultimately it

00:49:44.227 --> 00:49:46.550
wasn't a good team fit.

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:47.469
But I'm not--

00:49:47.469 --> 00:49:50.010
I'm not going to say I'm not a
quitter because there's plenty

00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:51.135
of things I've given up on.

00:49:51.135 --> 00:49:54.360
But I want to
succeed, and so I--

00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:58.950
I spent so much of
my energy and my time

00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:04.550
talking about people who
were breaking me down.

00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:07.210
So much of that of my
life is spent doing that,

00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:12.095
at home, in van pool, just
anyone that would listen,

00:50:12.095 --> 00:50:16.430
and to the point that I
just got tired of having

00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:19.170
that be my story every day.

00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:24.100
And so I put in a
good amount of work,

00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:27.990
and I found the courage to say,
this isn't my place anymore.

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:30.580
And I want to succeed,
and I think I can succeed,

00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:34.030
but it can't be on this team,
and I'm switching teams.

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:40.332
And since that-- since it all
got approved and everything

00:50:40.332 --> 00:50:42.540
settled down and I had a
few weeks left with my team,

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:47.080
and it is amazing
how when I know

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:50.800
that the consequences of
the day-to-day interactions

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:53.970
aren't going to affect me
anymore, how much freer I am

00:50:53.970 --> 00:50:56.500
and how empowered I am
to actually do my job.

00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:59.800
I've done more job
in the past month

00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:02.540
effectively and well than I
think I did in the three months

00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:05.950
prior, just because
I'm finally free.

00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:07.895
And so just then the
excitement of like, wow,

00:51:07.895 --> 00:51:10.420
what about when I'm in the
space where I feel really safe

00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:12.970
and really awesome-- the end--

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:14.320
oh, and I can finish--

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:16.452
how much more could I do there?

00:51:16.452 --> 00:51:17.940
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:26.128
LESLIE PACE: I just moved
out of my parents' house,

00:51:26.128 --> 00:51:28.540
so I feel really free.

00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:32.812
I'm really excited about it,
even, you know, it's my 661

00:51:32.812 --> 00:51:34.496
square feet, [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:34.496 --> 00:51:38.020
It's mine, and I'm
really happy about it.

00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:42.642
And I definitely just backed
into my neighbor's car also.

00:51:42.642 --> 00:51:43.594
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:49.340
I felt nervous, and I also
felt very responsible because I

00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:52.710
wrote him a note in the middle
of a snowstorm while I was

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:54.165
in my pj's.

00:51:54.165 --> 00:51:55.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:59.730
I feel very optimistic,
and my brother

00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:01.595
is graduating from
high school soon.

00:52:01.595 --> 00:52:05.880
He's about to go to college,
wants to study architecture.

00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:06.860
I'm scared.

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:11.600
He has epilepsy that is
triggered by sleep deprivation.

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:13.500
And you know, you're in college.

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.940
All you're doing is
staying up all night.

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:18.524
And I was like,
[INAUDIBLE],, you know,

00:52:18.524 --> 00:52:19.690
you can't drink any alcohol.

00:52:19.690 --> 00:52:22.189
You can't be out here staying
up late, pulling all-nighters.

00:52:22.189 --> 00:52:24.930
It's not a thing which you
can do like everybody else.

00:52:24.930 --> 00:52:30.005
He's going to be thousands of
miles away, and I'm nervous,

00:52:30.005 --> 00:52:31.636
but I'm excited.

00:52:34.296 --> 00:52:38.280
I love him a lot.

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.276
Ooh.

00:52:39.276 --> 00:52:40.272
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:41.766 --> 00:52:43.260
Um.

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:44.254
[SNIFFLING]

00:52:44.754 --> 00:52:47.570
He is my little brother.

00:52:47.570 --> 00:52:49.510
He's 6' 5".

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:50.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:51.935 --> 00:52:55.420
And he wears a men's 15 shoe.

00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:56.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:01.950
And he has started
growing dreadlocks,

00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:04.380
and I don't like them.

00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:05.352
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:06.810 --> 00:53:10.040
But he likes it, and
that is what matters.

00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:14.215
We took him to see Kendrick
Lamar for his 18th birthday.

00:53:14.215 --> 00:53:17.488
And he was so excited,
and he said, Leslie,

00:53:17.488 --> 00:53:19.928
this is the most fun
I've had all summer.

00:53:19.928 --> 00:53:24.620
And he is an old man
in a young man's body.

00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:28.542
Even when we were
younger, I would say, hey,

00:53:28.542 --> 00:53:29.500
let's go get ice cream.

00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:33.115
He'd be like, I already
have my pajamas on.

00:53:33.115 --> 00:53:34.046
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:34.546 --> 00:53:40.020
[INAUDIBLE] so I am
nervous but excited.

00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:41.499
ERIN WEED: Thank you.

00:53:41.499 --> 00:53:42.485
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:46.429 --> 00:53:59.704
PAIGE: [INAUDIBLE] Ah,
I feel lots of feelings

00:53:59.704 --> 00:54:02.410
all the time actually.

00:54:02.410 --> 00:54:04.031
I'm a pretty feeling person.

00:54:04.031 --> 00:54:05.572
It kind of sucks to
wear glasses when

00:54:05.572 --> 00:54:08.715
you're a feeling person
because they like-- the tears,

00:54:08.715 --> 00:54:10.040
like, go out.

00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:10.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:17.490
So sometimes I cry, like,
watching commercials

00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:22.714
and just when you say
something nice, I get teary,

00:54:22.714 --> 00:54:25.930
and it's a really annoying
trait that I have.

00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:28.490
But I'm kind of
learning to embrace it.

00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:32.240
I'm 31 years old, and I
feel like your thirties are

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:35.790
about kind of
embracing who you are

00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:39.372
and acknowledging and loving
yourself and who you are.

00:54:39.372 --> 00:54:42.096
I spent-- see, svroom.

00:54:42.096 --> 00:54:43.094
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:44.092 --> 00:54:46.088
This is who I am.

00:54:46.088 --> 00:54:47.086
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:49.581 --> 00:54:51.107
I'm so surprised
that I was actually

00:54:51.107 --> 00:54:52.440
able to watch "Game of Thrones."

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:54.475
I just, like, [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:54.475 --> 00:54:55.425
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:56.850 --> 00:54:59.225
I didn't like it.

00:54:59.225 --> 00:55:00.175
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:00.175 --> 00:55:06.206
But I feel like I spent a lot
of the last couple of years

00:55:06.206 --> 00:55:10.955
kind of working through
this part of who I am

00:55:10.955 --> 00:55:14.840
and that being OK,
and also co-existing

00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:18.740
with other parts of who I
am, like the smart parts

00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:23.530
and the professional parts
and the hardhearted parts,

00:55:23.530 --> 00:55:24.903
and also just growing up.

00:55:24.903 --> 00:55:27.950
I feel like I'm in a
growing up kind of phase.

00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:32.380
I recently kind of
separated from my dad.

00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:34.986
And that was a really-- don't
know why I'm sharing-- but

00:55:34.986 --> 00:55:39.390
a really hard year.

00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:46.220
But it's also really about me
and it being OK to be unique,

00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:48.240
and that you don't--

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:51.820
you don't need everyone else's
approval around you to be you

00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:59.036
and to love you for
you, and so yeah.

00:55:59.036 --> 00:56:00.494
That's good.

00:56:00.494 --> 00:56:01.466
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:02.438 --> 00:56:03.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:10.150
ERIN WEED: Before
we hop to you guys,

00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:12.790
I just want to just make a
note because like I could feel

00:56:12.790 --> 00:56:14.050
your self-consciousness in it.

00:56:14.050 --> 00:56:16.630
Like, how easy is
it to hear her?

00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:19.870
Like, it's so easy
to just be with you

00:56:19.870 --> 00:56:21.330
and the authenticity of it.

00:56:21.330 --> 00:56:23.890
And like, what if as women we
can let go of any judgment,

00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:26.245
if we show up in
that emotional way.

00:56:26.245 --> 00:56:29.060

to hear you so thank you.

go back to our partners.

difference between the head

00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:45.740
and the heart, outside of the

00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:46.634

00:56:46.634 --> 00:56:47.528

00:56:47.528 --> 00:56:48.870

OK.

00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:55.450

to respond when

00:56:55.450 --> 00:56:57.020
the other person was talking.

00:56:57.020 --> 00:56:59.072
ERIN WEED: Yeah, yeah.

00:56:59.072 --> 00:57:00.548

of think it's the opposite.

with strangers sometimes.

00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:25.950

like there's a--

00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:27.062
like you don't know
anything about me

and I don't know
anything about you,

the things I said

00:57:48.038 --> 00:57:50.940

never said out loud.

ERIN WEED: Interesting.

00:57:54.450 --> 00:57:56.860
Did anyone who tends to
be more of a head person?

00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:58.764
Because just because
we're mostly women here

00:57:58.764 --> 00:58:00.680
doesn't mean we're all
heart people, you know.

00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:02.830
There's women who are just
more head people, too.

00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:05.020
So is there anybody who
is more of a head person,

00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:08.830
you've almost noticed yourself
like analyzing the feeling,

00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:11.130
like I think that I feel this.

00:58:11.130 --> 00:58:12.240
And you can almost like--

00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:14.739
and you can usually tell when
you're doing the exercise when

00:58:14.739 --> 00:58:17.230
someone's like a head person
thinking about their feelings,

00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:20.540
when it's just like, there's
no body match-up, you know.

00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:23.660
So it can come off as
being a little incongruent.

00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:26.110
So head people have
to be careful of that

00:58:26.110 --> 00:58:29.320
so that people
don't distrust them

00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:32.710
because it's not matching
up, if you know what I mean.

00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:34.570
So heart is really important.

00:58:34.570 --> 00:58:35.981
Like, there's a
lot of connection

00:58:35.981 --> 00:58:38.230
because at the end of the
day, we're all human beings.

00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:39.910
And that's the thing
we have in common,

00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:41.680
and this is where we
can really connect.

00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:44.920
But on the flip side, just
as if we show up in our head

00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.940
all the time, and there's
a lack of connection,

00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:48.439
if we just showed
up, and we're just

00:58:48.439 --> 00:58:54.450
like bleeding all over the
floor with our feelings,

00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:56.620
98% of the time,
after a while, people

00:58:56.620 --> 00:59:00.300
are going to start avoiding
you because that's exhausting.

00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:02.259
I work with a lot
of activists that

00:59:02.259 --> 00:59:04.050
are trying to make big
change in the world.

00:59:04.050 --> 00:59:05.370
And a lot of these
activists are trying

00:59:05.370 --> 00:59:07.495
to make this change because
something bad happened.

00:59:07.495 --> 00:59:09.600
And it woke us up to something--

00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:10.710
a better way.

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:12.445
And it's just kind
of this natural thing

00:59:12.445 --> 00:59:14.070
to just go into the--
and this happened

00:59:14.070 --> 00:59:15.525
and this happened to
me and this was awful,

00:59:15.525 --> 00:59:16.650
and this person died.

00:59:16.650 --> 00:59:18.119
And you know,
like, it's all bad,

00:59:18.119 --> 00:59:20.160
like, as someone who talked
about rape and murder

00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:21.750
for 12 years, it's bad.

00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:24.000
And we need to be able to
talk about it from the head,

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.250
and we need to be able to
talk about it from the core,

00:59:26.250 --> 00:59:27.490
too, and balance it out.

00:59:27.490 --> 00:59:29.640
Otherwise, people get
emotionally exhausted,

00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:31.770
and you don't
connect then either.

00:59:31.770 --> 00:59:33.787
So everything is about balance.

00:59:33.787 --> 00:59:34.620
So that's the heart.

00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:37.050
The final piece of this-- and
then we're going to tie up--

00:59:37.050 --> 00:59:38.729
is the core.

00:59:38.729 --> 00:59:40.770
We're going to shift back
to one minute for this.

00:59:40.770 --> 00:59:42.600
You might not even
need all that time,

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:44.580
and you don't have
to use it all.

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:46.500
Speaking from the core
tends to be very short,

00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:47.490
very to the point.

00:59:47.490 --> 00:59:50.490
My daughter, I don't want
to wear shoes, very clear.

00:59:50.490 --> 00:59:54.120
It doesn't necessarily need
to make sense so let's just

00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:57.730
release ourselves from
having to for that to happen.

00:59:57.730 --> 00:59:59.820
It could just be what
you want in that moment.

00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:00.330
I want this.

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:01.030
I want that.

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:03.339
And so I find that a good
prompt when we do the core--

01:00:03.339 --> 01:00:05.380
and you might want to do
this with your partner--

01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:08.740
just start off with,
what do you want.

01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:10.240
In some ways, it
can sound abrasive.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.745
But in other ways, it can
sound totally freeing.

01:00:11.745 --> 01:00:13.945
You're like, really, I can
answer that question anyway I

01:00:13.945 --> 01:00:14.445
want to?

01:00:14.445 --> 01:00:15.480
OK, here's what I want.

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.410
You know, so have
some fun with this.

01:00:17.410 --> 01:00:18.309
Notice what comes up.

01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:20.100
I also notice, when we
speak from the core,

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:21.630
sometimes it can
seem really random.

01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:24.592
Like, I want world peace, and I
want to sleep later, you know,

01:00:24.592 --> 01:00:27.810
like, it's seemingly unrelated.

01:00:27.810 --> 01:00:30.138
But maybe if everyone
slept later, I don't know.

01:00:30.138 --> 01:00:31.134
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:32.130 --> 01:00:34.904
So just whatever, remember,
we're not rehearsing still.

01:00:34.904 --> 01:00:36.820
So just whatever wants
to come out, comes out.

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:37.980
So this time, we're just
going to hold her belly.

01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:40.530
This is kind of the place
where we manifest things.

01:00:40.530 --> 01:00:42.757
So again, take a
good deep breath.

01:00:42.757 --> 01:00:43.451
[INHALES]

01:00:43.812 --> 01:00:44.520
What do you want?

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.622
And especially, by
the way, as leaders,

01:00:46.622 --> 01:00:48.330
we need to tell people
what we want if we

01:00:48.330 --> 01:00:50.160
want to lead people somewhere.

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:52.480
Martin Luther King, Jr.,
like if he gave speeches,

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:53.855
and he didn't tell
people that he

01:00:53.855 --> 01:00:55.530
had a dream, like
do you think he

01:00:55.530 --> 01:00:57.030
would have been as effective?

01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:59.250
We wanted to get on
board with that dream.

01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:00.480
He took us somewhere.

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:02.850
So we need to do that as
leaders in our relationships

01:01:02.850 --> 01:01:04.830
and our teams and in the world.

01:01:04.830 --> 01:01:05.790
OK, I want--

01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:11.120
I want to potty train my dog.

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:11.850
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:12.350 --> 01:01:14.200
Because I think it will
make my life better.

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:18.000
I want-- in this sense,
in more the work sense,

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.370
I want people to show
up more authentically.

01:01:20.370 --> 01:01:23.111
I have the luxury of
doing this for a living,

01:01:23.111 --> 01:01:25.110
of getting people to their
most authentic selves

01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:26.318
and helping them communicate.

01:01:26.318 --> 01:01:28.316
And I see what's on
the other side of that,

01:01:28.316 --> 01:01:29.940
and it's that thing
that like you know,

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:31.500
that maybe not everybody
knows, and it's

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:32.850
so frustrating because
you want everyone

01:01:32.850 --> 01:01:35.466
to know it because life is so
much better when they do that.

01:01:35.466 --> 01:01:36.840
And so that's kind
of how I feel.

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:39.960
And so opportunities like
this are so exciting for me

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:43.980
so that hopefully you can take
this tool and run with it.

01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:47.947
I want to figure out the
violence problem in our world.

01:01:47.947 --> 01:01:49.530
And maybe even more
than the violence,

01:01:49.530 --> 01:01:52.530
like the anger and the
disconnection that's

01:01:52.530 --> 01:01:54.150
behind all of that.

01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:56.400
I want to get to
the root of things.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:59.010
And I think-- back
up here-- but I

01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:01.230
think one of the reasons
we feel so disconnected

01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:03.610
is because we're all
conditioned to be inauthentic.

01:02:03.610 --> 01:02:05.880
So I want us to show
up in a different way

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:08.600
than we maybe have been because
there's really a spectrum--

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:09.570
time?

01:02:09.570 --> 01:02:12.330
There's really a
spectrum, and I think

01:02:12.330 --> 01:02:15.120
we can choose in every moment
to show up more authentically,

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:17.520
and the world will
be better for it.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:18.030
All right.

01:02:18.030 --> 01:02:18.738
That's my minute.

01:02:20.922 --> 01:02:21.630
What do you want?

01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:23.610
LISA: What do I want?

01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:31.090
I want to utilize my body
to its greatest capacity,

01:02:31.090 --> 01:02:34.470
mostly I think
physically because I just

01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:37.140
think that each of us are
given the gift of the mobility

01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:38.100
that we have.

01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:40.960
And I want to be as fit
and as strong as possible.

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:46.320
And I want to share that gift of
body mobility with other people

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:49.281
because I think that a lot of
time it's I should work out.

01:02:49.281 --> 01:02:51.030
I have to work out,
and not like I fucking

01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:54.551
get to go move my body
until it sweats and wants

01:02:54.551 --> 01:02:55.800
to like collapse on the floor.

01:02:55.800 --> 01:03:00.130
Like that's how I feel about
it, and I want to share that.

01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:04.197
And I think it stems a lot from
I've had four knee surgeries,

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:06.860
so I know what it's like
to not have mobility,

01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:09.868
to not be able to use your body.

01:03:09.868 --> 01:03:11.700
And it's not a vanity thing.

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:14.250
It's a feeling-- I
think that I feel better

01:03:14.250 --> 01:03:17.354
about every other part of
my life when I feel strong.

01:03:17.354 --> 01:03:19.770
And I think everybody should
feel strong because everybody

01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:21.753
can feel strong.

01:03:21.753 --> 01:03:22.735
ERIN WEED: OK.

01:03:22.735 --> 01:03:24.208
LISA: [INAUDIBLE] Oh, OK.

01:03:24.208 --> 01:03:26.172
ERIN WEED: Awesome, thank you.

01:03:26.172 --> 01:03:27.154
[APPLAUSE]

01:03:30.591 --> 01:03:31.580
LESLIE PACE: All right.

01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:36.700
I want to travel the world
and speak to the masses

01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:40.840
and teach yoga everywhere
and have a big home

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.950
and feed a bunch of people.

01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:47.760
And I want to get more
degrees and read more books.

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:50.826
And I want to speak
more languages

01:03:50.826 --> 01:03:53.875
and maybe sign languages.

01:03:53.875 --> 01:03:56.630
I want to build better products.

01:03:56.630 --> 01:04:01.530
I want to eat more
mac and cheese.

01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:02.510
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:05.016
I want to be Miss Colorado USA.

01:04:05.016 --> 01:04:10.540
I want to buy a house.

01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:14.970
I want to build generational
wealth for future generations.

01:04:14.970 --> 01:04:18.460
I want to own a tea company.

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:20.955
I want to become a restaurateur.

01:04:20.955 --> 01:04:24.947
I want to get more tattoos.

01:04:24.947 --> 01:04:26.444
I want to--

01:04:32.432 --> 01:04:35.426
AUDIENCE: Saved by the timer.

01:04:35.426 --> 01:04:36.424
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:46.360
PAIGE: I want to feel
fulfilled in my career.

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:48.835
I want to be strong.

01:04:48.835 --> 01:04:53.712
I want to be able to control
the emotional part of me

01:04:53.712 --> 01:04:55.920
while still feeling it.

01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:01.150
I want to have
more time to read.

01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:02.960
I want to write a book someday.

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:05.720
I want to go on vacation.

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:10.700
I want to hike more.

01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:14.686
I want to have time.

01:05:14.686 --> 01:05:19.480
I want to spend more
time with my mom.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:26.902
I want to spend more
time with lots of people.

01:05:26.902 --> 01:05:31.566
I want to have a
sense of purpose.

01:05:31.566 --> 01:05:34.006
I want coffee.

01:05:34.006 --> 01:05:34.982
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:35.958 --> 01:05:39.862
I want to stop now.

01:05:39.862 --> 01:05:40.838
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:41.814 --> 01:05:42.790
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:44.254 --> 01:05:46.206
ERIN WEED: All right.

01:05:46.206 --> 01:05:48.870
So this is the final thing
we're doing in this session,

01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:50.340
so throw your gusto into this.

01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:52.052
Partner up, you've
got one minute.

01:05:52.052 --> 01:05:52.760
What do you want?

01:05:57.130 --> 01:06:01.132
So what did you notice about
speaking from the core?

01:06:01.132 --> 01:06:02.446
AUDIENCE: It felt powerful.

01:06:02.446 --> 01:06:04.010
ERIN WEED: Felt powerful, yeah.

01:06:06.615 --> 01:06:08.075
AUDIENCE: It felt energizing.

01:06:08.075 --> 01:06:08.950
ERIN WEED: It's what?

01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:10.195
AUDIENCE: It felt energizing.

01:06:10.195 --> 01:06:11.515
ERIN WEED: Energizing, yeah.

01:06:11.515 --> 01:06:13.390
You can feel it in the
room right now, right.

01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:15.590
It's like, woo, OK.

01:06:15.590 --> 01:06:16.420
Yeah.

01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:18.704
Speaking from the core, it
allows people to follow us.

01:06:18.704 --> 01:06:20.120
It allows people
to connect to us.

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:22.540
So as you can see from this
exercise, when we show up

01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:24.373
and speak from those
three different places,

01:06:24.373 --> 01:06:27.852
they're so distinctly different,
yet they're all distinctly you.

01:06:27.852 --> 01:06:30.310
And when you show up, and you'll
bring all of those things,

01:06:30.310 --> 01:06:33.640
people can get the most
authentic experience of you,

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:36.010
and you can feel the most
authentically expressed.

01:06:36.010 --> 01:06:37.640
So the final thing I'm
going to leave you with

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:39.265
is just a quick little
story, something

01:06:39.265 --> 01:06:41.995
that I do with these
big TED speakers, right.

01:06:41.995 --> 01:06:43.370
After we go through
this process,

01:06:43.370 --> 01:06:45.849
and we write their talk,
they're always like, OK, well,

01:06:45.849 --> 01:06:47.140
I'm going to go give this talk.

01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:49.060
Like, any other final
pieces of advice?

01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:51.450
I'm like, yes, my
piece of advice

01:06:51.450 --> 01:06:53.162
is for you to break a coconut.

01:06:53.162 --> 01:06:55.159
They're like-- that is like--

01:06:55.159 --> 01:06:56.200
what am I paying you for?

01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:57.390
Like, what's happening?

01:06:57.390 --> 01:06:59.370
And I'm like, yeah,
OK, so here's the deal.

01:06:59.370 --> 01:07:02.090
So in the Hindu
religion, they have

01:07:02.090 --> 01:07:03.850
this ceremony called
breaking a coconut,

01:07:03.850 --> 01:07:05.950
and it's something that you
do when there is something

01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:08.320
in your space that's preventing
you from being the human

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.694
that the gods
intended you to be.

01:07:09.694 --> 01:07:11.470
So it's like your
ego interfering,

01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:12.580
like either you're
playing yourself down

01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:13.375
or you're playing yourself up.

01:07:13.375 --> 01:07:15.070
It doesn't matter,
but like something's

01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:16.610
blocking in the way.

01:07:16.610 --> 01:07:19.420
And the question becomes,
what do you need to let go of?

01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:21.670
And so in the Hindu
religion, they

01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:23.560
like approach the
community-- whoever

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.660
in the community that's being
blocked by this thing, that's

01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:27.670
preventing them from being the
awesome person that they are.

01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:29.420
And they say, you need
to break a coconut.

01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:33.640
And imagine, what is that thing
that you can infuse spiritually

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:36.380
into that coconut that
you need to let go of,

01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:38.620
to get out of the way and
become the person that you

01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:41.050
were supposed to be for
the sake of the gods.

01:07:41.050 --> 01:07:43.410
And so they smash a coconut--

01:07:43.410 --> 01:07:45.430
this person does--
and releases the thing

01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:46.971
that they need to
get out of the way.

01:07:46.971 --> 01:07:49.580
Maybe it's fear of
money, fear of success,

01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:51.670
fear of being seen,
fear of failing.

01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:53.680
It's usually a
fear of some kind.

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:56.290
But smashing that coconut
and, in that process,

01:07:56.290 --> 01:07:59.230
smashing that thing that's
preventing us from showing up

01:07:59.230 --> 01:08:03.477
as our authentic self, and then
the milk splatters everywhere,

01:08:03.477 --> 01:08:04.810
and it's the most freeing thing.

01:08:04.810 --> 01:08:06.250
I actually do this with clients.

01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:08.664
Like, we actually go to Boulder
Creek and smash coconuts.

01:08:08.664 --> 01:08:10.330
And it's in front of
the police station,

01:08:10.330 --> 01:08:13.130
so I'm just waiting for the
day that they're like, just--

01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:15.330
I just don't really
know how to start this,

01:08:15.330 --> 01:08:17.080
but are you breaking
coconuts in nature?

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:17.985
I'm like, yeah.

01:08:17.985 --> 01:08:21.109
But when the milk
splatters, it's amazing.

01:08:21.109 --> 01:08:23.830
And then you pick up the
pieces, though, of the coconut,

01:08:23.830 --> 01:08:26.717
and you gently throw
them into water.

01:08:26.717 --> 01:08:28.300
In our case, we use
the Boulder Creek.

01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:30.175
And the reason that you
throw them into water

01:08:30.175 --> 01:08:32.620
is it's supposed to be
a grateful letting go.

01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:34.720
Because that thing that
came into your space

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:38.109
to prevent you from being who
you truly were, it was a gift.

01:08:38.109 --> 01:08:39.189
It protected you.

01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:41.439
At some point in your
life, it kept you safe.

01:08:41.439 --> 01:08:44.029
And now it's not needed.

01:08:44.029 --> 01:08:46.180
And so you smash the
coconut to let it go but you

01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:47.839
thank it on its way out.

01:08:47.839 --> 01:08:49.630
And so my final thing
I wanted to leave you

01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:51.410
today with is just a question.

01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:54.180
What do you need to let
go of to be that woman

01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:57.370
or to be that man that
you were meant to be?

01:08:57.370 --> 01:08:59.249
Let it go, break a
coconut if you need to.

01:08:59.249 --> 01:09:00.290
Whole Foods carries them.

01:09:00.290 --> 01:09:01.062
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:01.062 --> 01:09:02.850
Get the brown ones.

01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:04.829
Shatter it, throw the
pieces away, and thank it

01:09:04.829 --> 01:09:05.620
for protecting you.

01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:08.187
But be ready for a new
layer of self to emerge.

01:09:08.187 --> 01:09:10.270
I want to thank you all
so much for having me here

01:09:10.270 --> 01:09:11.478
on International Women's Day.

01:09:11.478 --> 01:09:13.590
It's been an absolute honor.

01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:14.540
[APPLAUSE]

01:09:19.770 --> 01:09:21.380
I hope you have an amazing day.

01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:23.819
And if anybody wanted to stay
in touch, I am local here.

01:09:23.819 --> 01:09:25.560
My office is right
in downtown Boulder.

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:28.646
My handle is @erinweed,
pretty much across the board

01:09:28.646 --> 01:09:29.729
if you're on social media.

01:09:29.729 --> 01:09:30.978
I would love to stay in touch.

01:09:30.978 --> 01:09:32.190
So thank you all so much.

01:09:32.190 --> 01:09:34.040
[APPLAUSE]
