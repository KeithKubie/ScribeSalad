00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.889
Me, myself, and I.

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.361
You may be tempted to use 
these words interchangeably

00:00:13.361 --> 00:00:15.903
because they all refer to the same thing,

00:00:15.903 --> 00:00:19.754
but in fact, each one has a specific role
in a sentence.

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:21.714
"I" is a subject pronoun,

00:00:21.714 --> 00:00:24.092
"me" is an object pronoun,

00:00:24.092 --> 00:00:28.364
and "myself" is a reflexive
or intensive pronoun.

00:00:28.364 --> 00:00:31.838
So what does that reveal about
where each word belongs?

00:00:31.838 --> 00:00:35.367
Let's start with the difference
between subject and object.

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:38.428
Imagine the subject 
as the actor in a sentence

00:00:38.428 --> 00:00:42.022
and the object as the word
that is acted upon.

00:00:42.022 --> 00:00:46.849
"I invited her but she invited me."

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:49.935
The object can also be 
the object of a preposition.

00:00:49.935 --> 00:00:54.751
"She danced around me, 
while he shimmied up to me."

00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:57.415
In some languages, like Latin and Russian,

00:00:57.415 --> 00:01:01.864
most nouns have different forms
that distinguish subjects from objects.

00:01:01.864 --> 00:01:05.836
However, in English, 
that's only true of pronouns.

00:01:05.836 --> 00:01:08.955
But so long as you know how to distinguish
subjects from objects,

00:01:08.955 --> 00:01:11.884
you can figure out what belongs where.

00:01:11.884 --> 00:01:14.547
And when you encounter 
a more complicated sentence,

00:01:14.547 --> 00:01:17.961
say one that involves 
multiple subjects or objects,

00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:21.006
and you're not sure 
whether to use "I" or "me,"

00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:24.644
just temporarily eliminate 
the other person,

00:01:24.644 --> 00:01:28.728
and once again distinguish 
subject from object.

00:01:28.728 --> 00:01:30.582
Here's another.

00:01:30.582 --> 00:01:35.917
You wouldn't say, "Me heard gossip,"
but sub in "I" and you're good to go.

00:01:35.917 --> 00:01:38.416
Then what about "myself?"

00:01:38.416 --> 00:01:42.400
This grand character is often substituted
for "me" and "I"

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.908
because it seems more impressive.

00:01:44.908 --> 00:01:48.547
"Please tell Jack or myself" 
may sound elegant,

00:01:48.547 --> 00:01:52.007
but in fact, "me" 
is the right pronoun here.

00:01:52.007 --> 00:01:54.227
So where should you use "myself"?

00:01:54.227 --> 00:01:57.121
In its function as a reflexive pronoun,

00:01:57.121 --> 00:02:00.664
"myself" only works 
if it's the object of a sentence

00:02:00.664 --> 00:02:03.506
whose subject is "I."

00:02:03.506 --> 00:02:09.840
"I consider myself the most important
pronoun at this year's party."

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.244
"Myself" can also add emphasis
as an intensive pronoun.

00:02:14.244 --> 00:02:18.227
"I, myself, have heard others agree."

00:02:18.227 --> 00:02:19.895
The sentence works without it,

00:02:19.895 --> 00:02:22.925
but that extra pronoun gives it oomph.

00:02:22.925 --> 00:02:25.211
To check if "myself" belongs 
in a sentence,

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:30.447
simply ensure that there's also an "I"
that it's reflecting or intensifying.

00:02:30.447 --> 00:02:32.623
So that's "me," "myself," and "I,"

00:02:32.623 --> 00:02:38.988
ever ready to represent 
you, yourself, and you.
