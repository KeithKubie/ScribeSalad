00:00:00.422 --> 00:00:02.880
What I want to do in this video
is a fairly straightforward

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.550
primer on perimeter and area.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.520
And I'll do perimeter
here on the left,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.390
and I'll do area
here on the right.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.723
And you're probably pretty
familiar with these concepts,

00:00:13.723 --> 00:00:16.500
but we'll revisit it
just in case you are not.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.060
Perimeter is
essentially the distance

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.632
to go around something
or if you were

00:00:20.632 --> 00:00:22.340
to put a fence around
something or if you

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.330
were to measure-- if you were to
put a tape around a figure, how

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.050
long that tape would be.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.020
So for example, let's
say I have a rectangle.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.924
And a rectangle is a figure that
has 4 sides and 4 right angles.

00:00:39.924 --> 00:00:41.340
So this is a
rectangle right here.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.830
I have 1, 2, 3, 4 right angles.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.800
And it has 4 sides,
and the opposite sides

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.050
are equal in length.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.700
So that side is going to be
equal in length to that side,

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.660
and that side is equal
in length to that side.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:01.370
And maybe I'll label the
points A, B, C, and D.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.010
And let's say we
know the following.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.000
And we know that
AB is equal to 7,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.890
and we know that
BC is equal to 5.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.500
And we want to know, what
is the perimeter of ABCD?

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.560
So let me write it down.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:25.880
The perimeter of
rectangle ABCD is just

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.370
going to be equal to the sum
of the lengths of the sides.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.490
If I were to build a fence, if
this was like a plot of land,

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.934
I would just have
to measure-- how

00:01:33.934 --> 00:01:35.350
long is this side
right over here?

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.120
Well, we already know
that's 7 in this color.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.700
So it's that side right
over there is of length 7.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.350
So it'll be 7 plus
this length over here,

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.820
which is going to be 5.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.700
They tell us that.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.280
BC is 5.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.330
Plus 5.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.900
Plus DC is going to
be the same length

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.290
is AB, which is
going to be 7 again.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.670
So plus 7.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.390
And then finally, DA a or AD,
however you want to call it,

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.290
is going to be the same length
as BC, which is 5 again.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.790
So plus 5 again.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.820
So you have 7 plus 5 is 12
plus 7 plus 5 is 12 again.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.180
So you're going to
have a perimeter of 24.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.870
And you could go the
other way around.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.910
Let's say that you
have a square, which

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.070
is a special case
of a rectangle.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.750
A square has 4 sides and 4 right
angles, and all of the sides

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.260
are equal.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.135
So let me draw a square here.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.910
My best attempt.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:44.390
So this is A, B, C, D. And
we're going to tell ourselves

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.690
that this right
here is a square.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.580
And let's say that this
square has a perimeter.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:57.310
So square has a perimeter of 36.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.680
So given that, what is the
length of each of the sides?

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.930
Well, all the sides are going
to have the same length.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.410
Let's call them x.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.670
If AB is x, then BC is x,
then DC is x, and AD is x.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.260
All of the sides are congruent.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.760
All of these segments
are congruent.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.170
They all have the same
measure, and we call that x.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.128
So if we want to figure
out the perimeter here,

00:03:17.128 --> 00:03:20.470
it'll just be x plus x
plus x plus x, or 4x.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.020
Let me write that. x
plus x plus x plus x,

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.940
which is equal to 4x, which
is going to be equal to 36.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.670
They gave us that
in the problem.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.929
And to solve this, 4
times something is 36,

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:34.720
you could solve that
probably in your head.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.490
But we could divide
both sides by 4,

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.380
and you get x is equal to 9.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.220
So this is a 9 by 9 square.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.210
This width is 9.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.890
This is 9, and then the height
right over here is also 9.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.070
So that is perimeter.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.560
Area is kind of a
measure of how much space

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.420
does this thing take
up in two dimensions?

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.380
And one way to think about area
is if I have a 1-by-1 square,

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.480
so this is a 1-by-1 square--
and when I say 1-by-1,

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.642
it means you only have
to specify two dimensions

00:04:08.642 --> 00:04:10.850
for a square or a rectangle
because the other two are

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:11.740
going to be the same.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.860
So for example, you could
call this a 5 by 7 rectangle

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.209
because that immediately
tells you, OK, this side is 5

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.310
and that side is 5.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.764
This side is 7,
and that side is 7.

00:04:20.764 --> 00:04:22.930
And for a square, you could
say it's a 1-by-1 square

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.596
because that specifies
all of the sides.

00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:26.670
You could really say,
for a square, a square

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.310
where on one side is 1,
then really all the sides

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.060
are going to be 1.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.080
So this is a 1-by-1 square.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.750
And so you can view
the area of any figure

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.660
as how many 1-by-1 squares
can you fit on that figure?

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.220
So for example, if we were going
back to this rectangle right

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.710
here, and I wanted to find out
the area of this rectangle--

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.290
and the notation
we can use for area

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.910
is put something in brackets.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:05:00.900
So the area of rectangle
ABCD is equal to the number

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.197
of 1-by-1 squares we can
fit on this rectangle.

00:05:04.197 --> 00:05:05.780
So let's try to do
that just manually.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.660
I think you already
might get a sense of how

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.430
to do it a little bit quicker.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.910
But let's put a bunch of 1-by-1.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:11.490
So let's see.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.420
We have 5 1-by-1 squares
this way and 7 this way.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.540
So I'm going to try my
best to draw it neatly.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:26.437
So that's 1, 3, 3,
4, 5, 6, and then 7.

00:05:26.437 --> 00:05:29.490
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.570
So going along one of the
sides, if we just go along

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.440
one of the sides like
this, you could put 7 just

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.500
along one side just like that.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.190
And then over here,
how many can we see?

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.740
We see that's 1 row.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.880
And that's 2 rows.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.520
Then we have 3 rows and
then 4 rows and then 5 rows.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.140
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.670
And that makes sense because
this is 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:55.930
Should add up to 5.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.120
These are 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.550
Should add up to 7.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:01.700
Yup, there's 7.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.530
So this is 5 by 7.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.230
And then you could
actually count these,

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.525
and this is kind of straight
forward multiplication.

00:06:07.525 --> 00:06:09.650
If you want to know the
total number of cubes here,

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.240
you could count it, or you can
say, well, I've got 5 rows,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.170
7 columns.

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.870
I'm going to have 35--
did I say cube-- squares.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.810
I have 5 squares in this
direction, 7 in this direction.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.130
So I'm going to have
35 total squares.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:27.062
So the area of this figure
right over here is 35.

00:06:27.062 --> 00:06:28.770
And so the general
method, you could just

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.061
say, well, I'm just going to
take one of the dimensions

00:06:31.061 --> 00:06:32.940
and multiply it by
the other dimension.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:38.140
So if I have a
rectangle, let's say

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:44.300
the rectangle is
1/2 by 1/2 by 2.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.516
Those are its dimensions.

00:06:45.516 --> 00:06:46.890
Well, you could
just multiply it.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.310
You say 1/2 times 2.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.137
The area here is going to be 1.

00:06:50.137 --> 00:06:51.970
And you might say, well,
what does 1/2 mean?

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.880
Well, it means,
in this dimension,

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:59.406
I could only fit 1/2
of a 1-by-1 square.

00:06:59.406 --> 00:07:01.280
So if I wanted to do
the whole 1-by-1 square,

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.501
it's all distorted here.

00:07:02.501 --> 00:07:03.500
It would look like that.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.200
So I'm only doing half of one.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.700
I'm doing another half
of one just like that.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.640
And so when you add this
guy and this guy together,

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.240
you are going to
get a whole one.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.649
Now what about area of a square?

00:07:15.649 --> 00:07:17.190
Well, a square is
just a special case

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.940
where the length and
the width are the same.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.690
So if I have a square--
let me draw a square here.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:31.732
And let's call that XYZ-- I
don't know, let's make this S.

00:07:31.732 --> 00:07:34.020
And let's say I wanted
to find the area

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.340
and let's say I know
one side over here is 2.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:41.465
So XS is equal to 2, and I
want to find the area of XYZS.

00:07:41.465 --> 00:07:42.840
So once again, I
use the brackets

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.701
to specify the area of this
figure, of this polygon right

00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:47.450
here, this square.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:48.840
And we know it's a square.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.680
We know all the sides are equal.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.010
Well, it's a special
case of a rectangle where

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.120
we would multiply the
length times the width.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.620
We know that they're
the same thing.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.600
If this is 2, then
this is going to be 2.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.664
So you just multiply 2 times 2.

00:08:00.664 --> 00:08:02.080
Or if you want to
think of it, you

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.920
square it, which is
where the word comes

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.100
from-- squaring something.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:10.156
So you multiply 2 times 2,
which is equal to 2 squared.

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.530
That's where the
word comes from,

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:15.915
finding the area of a
square, which is equal to 4.

00:08:15.915 --> 00:08:17.540
And you could see
that you could easily

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:23.999
fit 4 1-by-1 squares
on this 2-by-2 square.
