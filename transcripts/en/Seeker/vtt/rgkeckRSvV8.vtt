Let’s play a fun game of “Real or Dr.
Who alien.” Creatures that eat electricity?

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.940
Yeah, those are totally real.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:17.000
Hi everyone, Julian here for DNews. Some people
live to eat. I eat to live. Seriously, the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.289
idea that I have to feed this stupid body
every day until I die sounds exhausting. I

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.050
wish I could just plug into a wall, charge
overnight, and go about my day.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.920
Of course that’s not how things work. Everyone
needs food, and I should be grateful that

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.809
I get it because it’s game over if I don’t.
If you remember high school biology, it all

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.860
has to do with cellular respiration. Your
cells break down glucose from the food, runs

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.309
it through a three step process, and by the
end of it you get the energy your cells need

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.250
to do work in the form of adenosine triphosphate,
or ATP.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.270
The last step of that process, oxidative phosphorylation,
is the real moneymaker. Basically electrons

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.129
are transported down a chain and eventually
combine with oxygen. The process forces protons

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.370
across a membrane and in order to normalize
the electrochemical gradient, the protons

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.330
travel through a pump that generates tons
of ATP. That’s also why you need to breathe:

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.140
without the oxygen the electrons have nowhere
to go and you die. Side note: cyanide kills

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.080
you because it keeps oxygen and electrons
from combining and you die. So not enough

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.130
oxygen or too much cyanide and your cells
run out of energy and starve themselves and

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.290
you die. Isn’t learning fun?

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.250
Anyway some bacteria decided that the first
two steps of cellular respiration were for

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.900
chumps and cut straight to the good part.
They literally absorb electrons from the surrounding

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.960
rocks or metals and use them to create ATP.
In a sense, they’re eating electricity.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.210
And they may be more common than you think.
It’s not that there’s just one species

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.860
of electric bugs, but thus far at least two
genera have been discovered: Shewanella and

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.509
Geobacter. And they have some interesting
practical uses. By making electrons flow they

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.979
generate a current, so it’s possible they
could be used as a living fuel cell. Some

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.960
Geobacter species can also be used to help
clean up the environment. For example one

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.719
species can clean groundwater contaminated
with uranium by using the uranium ion as an

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.649
electron acceptor. This changes it from a
form that dissolves easily in water to one

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.420
that doesn’t. The uranium falls out of the
water, and all you have to do is scoop it

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.400
up. Albeit with some nice thick gloves on.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.200
These bacteria can also give us new ideas
of what life can look like, and the bare minimum

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.690
amount of energy needed to sustain it. When
we’re scouring alien worlds, maybe we’ll

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.790
put some electrodes in the ground and see
if anybody shows up for dinner.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.931
Speaking of scouring alien worlds, the internet
is full of them, and you can set up your very

00:02:29.931 --> 00:02:35.680
own. No domain extension will help you tell
your story like a DOT COM or DOT NET domain

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.470
name. And because you watch DNews, you can
get 15% off Domain Dot Com’s names and web

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.290
hosting by using the code DNews when you check
out.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.160
In the search for extraterrestrial life, bacteria
is probably your best bet because everything

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.870
down here on earth is just loaded with the
stuff…

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.220
Everything. If you want to become a germaphobe,
check out Julia’s video.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:09.450
What’s the strangest life form you’ve
heard of?

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.760
Want us to do a vid on it?
