00:00:02.803 --> 00:00:05.272
- AW, LOOK AT MY LITTLE CUBS
OF ANARCHY.

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:07.374
ARE YOU EXCITED
ABOUT YOUR NEW BIKE?

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:08.375
- YES.

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:09.877
- HERE YOU GO, BUDDY.

00:00:09.977 --> 00:00:11.512
- WHAT THE [bleep] IS THAT?

00:00:11.612 --> 00:00:13.280
I ASKED FOR A MOTORCYCLE.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.749
- MALLOY, WE BOTH KNOW
YOU'RE NOT BIG ENOUGH.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.985
BESIDES, THIS IS JUST AS COOL.

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:20.621
- I'M A BIG BOY.
I'M A <i>BIG</i> BOY.

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:22.723
- I AM NOT
GETTING ON THAT THING.

00:00:22.823 --> 00:00:25.792
- NOT WITHOUT YOUR SAFETY GEAR.

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:26.960
- I LOOK RIDICULOUS.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.328
EVERYBODY'S GONNA LAUGH AT ME.

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:30.898
- MALLOY, NO ONE'S GONNA
LAUGH AT YOU.

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:32.499
[laughter]

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:33.600
- THAT'S IT.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.902
I'M GONNA GO
SET UP THE KILL ROOM.

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:37.237
- DON'T FORGET
YOUR OUTSIDE HELMET.

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:40.107
DADDY'S GOTTA PROTECT
HIS LITTLE THERAPY PET.

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:41.108
[all gasp]

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:42.109
- YOU'RE ALIVE?

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:43.544
- YES. WHY?

00:00:43.644 --> 00:00:46.180
- OH, WHEN YOU WERE TWO HOURS
LATE, WE ASSUMED YOU WERE DEAD.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.815
- WE EVEN WROTE YOUR OBITUARY.

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:49.917
- "STEVE WILLIAMS.

00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:52.319
LIVED, DIED, FAT."

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:53.620
THAT'S IT?

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.522
WHY DIDN'T YOU LIST
ANY OF MY ACCOMPLISHMENTS?

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:56.990
- UH, WE SAID FAT.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.059
- HOW ABOUT THE FACT THAT
I'VE BEEN RANGER OF THE MONTH

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.127
FOR YEARS?

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:01.762
- STEVE, IT'S ABOUT TIME
WE TOLD YOU.

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:03.063
THAT AWARD IS MEANINGLESS.

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:06.733 line:0%
 
YOUR MEDAL IS
A SNAPPLE CAP WE PAINTED GOLD.

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:07.835
- OH, MY GOD.

00:01:07.935 --> 00:01:09.736
I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING
WITH MY LIFE.

00:01:09.837 --> 00:01:11.772
WHEN I'M DEAD,
NO ONE WILL REMEMBER ME.

00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:13.307
- NOBODY GIVES A SHIT, STEVE.

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:14.408
I'M OUT OF HERE.

00:01:14.508 --> 00:01:16.343
- DON'T FORGET
YOUR BUBBLE ARMOR.

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:17.744
- I CAN'T BREATHE!

00:01:17.845 --> 00:01:19.246
- [chuckles]
HAVE FUN, LITTLE BUDDY.

00:01:19.346 --> 00:01:20.414
STAY IN THE DRIVEWAY.

00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:20.848
[crash]
