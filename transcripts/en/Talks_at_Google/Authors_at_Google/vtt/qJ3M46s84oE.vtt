00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.390
&gt;&gt;So without further ado, please join us in
welcoming Kelly.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:12.880
Kelly: Hi, thank you so much for having me.
Um, this is my first novel, as Lindsey mentioned,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:20.189
and it is the story about Louisa May Alcott
and it's set in 1855 when, um -- long before

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.960
she became a famous writer -- so we know she's
most famous for writing Little Women. How

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.460
many of you have read or the movie or knows
the story of little women. Um it is about

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:37.190
the four March sisters Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy
and they live in Massachusetts and their father

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.609
is a chaplain and away in the civil war. So
they are at home with their mother and this

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:48.879
is a difficult time for the March family because
they um are poor and the the head of their

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.829
household is away and so they really have
to become little women, as the title says

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.800
they have to learn to take responsibility
and come together as a family to get through

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.110
this difficult time. Um, and this novel was
first published in 1868 and it made her very

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.320
famous. It became and overnight success. She
went from being a nobody to being very rich

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.720
and um, they wanted her to publish a sequel
right away, which she did. Um, and her writing

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.560
career took off from there. She was about
35 years old when she wrote Little Women,

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.950
so she had had a long road leading up to that
point of wanting to be a writer, wanting to

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.640
be, wanting fame, wanting money because she
grew up very poor. Little Women is autobiographical

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.820
in that her childhood was very much like the
March sisters and actually much more difficult

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.470
than the March sisters. Um, she sort of put
a rose-colored view on, on what their life

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.910
was like in little women. Um, so she welcomed,
originally, or initially she welcomed the

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:56.050
fame and the money that having published Little
Women brought her, but she grew to feel more

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:02.700
conflicted about it because Little Women [skips]
was a story written for young women, and it

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.640
was sort of, she called it a moral path. It
was a, you know, a moral tale, she didn't

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.700
think of it as being sophisticated writing,
she didn't think of it as being a complex

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.840
story. And she really wanted to be a novelist
who wrote for adults. So, she felt that Little

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.950
Women sort of pidgeon-holed her in her writing.
That she could not write the kind of things

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.010
that she wanted to write. She later went on
to write many hundreds of stories under a

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.930
pseudonym. There were things she wrote that
were never published during her lifetime because

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.470
they were too sensational and they were published
in the 1990s. We're still finding about stories

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.450
that we don't realize were written by her,
under different names, so there's a really

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.830
fun sort of literary detective story about
um discovering a group of stories that they

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.060
had always believed was this A.M. Barnard
and no one could figure out who A.M. Barnard

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.150
was and these two women eventually uncovered
that this was Louisa May Alcott. So, that's

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.030
a whole different story -- but she was a -- she
was a fascinating person in many ways. But,

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.790
she sort of came to feel more conflicted about
having written Little Women, and the fame

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.340
and the attention. People would come to her
house. Um, little girls, or not little girls,

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.900
young women who read Little Women loved the
character of Jo, most people always say Jo

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.000
was their most favorite because she was a
tomboy, she wanted to be a writer, she was

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.491
passionate and wanted to be independent at
a time when that wasn't an option or that

00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:30.960
wasn't what was expected for women. She's
just a heroine in American literarure. Um,

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.620
so little girls loved her and wanted to know
more about her story and they would come to

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:42.530
Louisa's house and knock on the door expecting
to meet Jo because they knew that Louisa was

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.850
based, based Jo on herself. Um, and they would
be, the look of disappointment on their face

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.990
when she would open the door, because she
was older than they expected her to be and

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.959
she couldn't stand that disappointment. So,
she eventually started to say that she was

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.290
the maid and that Louisa had gone into town
and then [laughter] they might have to try

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.180
back later, so there, it was a, it was a wonderful
thing that just happened to her, but also

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.760
it brought all kinds of things into her life
that she never would have imagined. Um, she

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.090
became very famous, like I said and she was
known, and this is, this is all the stuff

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.129
I'm telling you now is the true facts of her
biography. She is known to have burned letters

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:24.770
and journals, because she knew that when she
died that someone would go through all her

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.039
papers and want to write about her or tell,
you know she would she was a celebrity in,

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:33.879
in Massachusetts. So, um, so she burned things
that she didn't or blacked out, there were

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:37.659
sections that she blacked out of her journal
that she didn't want of things she maybe didn't

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:43.509
want people to know. So, when I was reading
about her life because I was alway a Little

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:49.970
Women fan and then I started to read about
her biography I was very intrigued by that

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.270
thought of what could have been in these letters
and journals that she would want to hide.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:02.849
And so that was some, a seed, seed in my mind.
And then um, I was thinking about what um,

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:07.860
the character of Laurie from Little Women
and I don't know how well you know the story

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.340
but Laurie is Teddy Lawrence, the boy, a lot
of people that don't know the, Little Women,

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.589
they think it's a girl. Laurie was a nickname
for Teddy Lawrence, and he lived next door.

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:22.879
He was the son of a wealthy family and became
a friend of the March sisters in the story

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:28.270
of Little Women and especially a friend of
Jo. Um, and they were, sort of, kindred spirits.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.219
They had this wonderful friendship and the
book starts when they're young and as they

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:38.670
grow older and as a reader, you begin to think
or you're allowed to think all along that

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.800
they are going to end up together because
they have this wonderful friendship and he

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:48.830
doesn't expect Jo to, you know, reign in her
passionate temperment and he loves her, the

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:54.250
way that she is, independent and he, he, they
have an equal partnership and you can imagine

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.039
them having a kind of a unconventional, truely
loving friendship kind of marriage that would

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:03.779
have been rare for that time. So you're cheering
them on the whole way. He goes away to college,

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:11.210
he comes back, he's all in a snoot because
he's realizing he's in love with her. He sits

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.110
her down and tells her, you know, it's so
obvious, it should be us, we should be together,

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:21.919
you know let's get married. And she says no.
And that is a terrible let down for a lot

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:23.729
of people when they read that book the first
time. It's your first introduction to heartbreak

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:31.539
when you [laughter] read that story. Um, because
you look at the book and you say, what? This

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:38.059
is not what I thought was going to happen
here. And um, Louisa May Alcott got, because

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:44.529
she wrote Little Women in two parts, so um,
the first part ended with this sort of cliff

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:48.569
hanger notion of yes, there's something there
that's going to develop and they wanted her

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:51.999
to write the sequel. So, she wrote the sequel,
now we, now they're published together as

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:57.759
one book, The Little Women that we know is
actual, was two separate books. But she got

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:02.340
letters, and letters and letters from fans
while she was writing the second half. Please

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.001
let Jo and Laurie end up together. Please
let them get married, um, you know, this is

00:07:07.001 --> 00:07:13.300
th most wonderful romance. But she, Louisa
did not want them to end of together because

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:19.610
Luisa May Alcott was staunchly independent
and felt a sense of responsibility writing

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:25.279
for young women readers that she wanted to
show them that that wasn't necessarily the

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:32.339
only choices that they had. And in the 1860's,
1870's, it was not easy to be an unmarried

00:07:32.339 --> 00:07:38.000
woman, and you know, you didn't have a lot
of rights in terms of, you know economic or

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.090
rights and and opportunities for work. But
she, she wanted to be an example and wanted

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.279
the story to be an example for young women.
That they could pursue other things. So she

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:53.939
chose to write the story where Jo says no.
And Jo says she wants to stay friends and

00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:58.979
it would, she would be afraid it would ruin
their friendship and eventually Jo does marry

00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:03.490
a professor who is much older than her and
it's a very passionless -- you know, they

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.870
like each other, he's alright -- but geez,
it wasn't anything like Laurie, you know.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:13.860
[laugher] It's definitely a let down as the
reader. Um, because her publisher basically

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:20.279
told her she had to have Jo marry someone;
she couldn't end the book with, with Jo just

00:08:20.279 --> 00:08:27.430
keep, keeping her independence. So, um, so
that's the other thing I was thinking about.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.370
So I was thinking about the burning of the
letters and journals and I was also thinking

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:35.449
about Laurie, because in Little Women, all
the sisters correspond to Louisa's real sisters,

00:08:35.449 --> 00:08:40.669
her mother was very much like her real mother,
not exactly, but a lot in some ways like her.

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:45.240
The father is not really there but what we
know of him in the story is a lot like Louisa

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:51.551
May Alcott's real father, but the character
of Laurie is a little mysterious. Um, Louisa

00:08:51.551 --> 00:08:55.680
said at different times that he was based
on two different young men that she met in

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:01.720
her life, a neighbor and a man she met when
she traveled in Europe. Uh, but it's never

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.660
really a satisfying explanation. So, my idea
was to think about what could be in these

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:12.240
letters and journals that she was going to
burn and what if there was a real person who

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.410
inspired the character of Laurie and then
she decided to erase him from the record.

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:24.589
So that was the basis for for this story.
Um, I guess I could read a little bit, is

00:09:24.589 --> 00:09:27.399
that good? Okay. Just take a drink. Do you
have any questions about that stuff so far?

00:09:27.399 --> 00:09:28.399
&gt;&gt;Not yet.

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:41.430
Kelly: Okay, hate to put you on the spot.
So, my story takes place in um, the summer

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:47.030
of 1855; she wrote Little Women in 1868, so
this was long before she's had any success

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:54.740
as a writer. She is living still with her
family. They lived most of their childhood

00:09:54.740 --> 00:10:02.050
in Concord, Massachesetts and Boston. Um,
but they often struggled financially because

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:08.280
Bronson, the father, was an very ineffective
provider. He was a transcendental philosopher,

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:14.540
he was a man of ideas and words and of books
and not a very, and he actually objected philophically

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:20.279
to the idea of commerce. So, he did not engage
in any acts of commerce that was left to his

00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:24.560
wife to figure out how to put food on the
table and get them a roof over their head.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:30.639
And so they were often moving around, um,
and this particular summer they lived in Walpole,

00:10:30.639 --> 00:10:35.339
New Hampshire because their, the mother had
a house that belonged to her brother-in-law,

00:10:35.339 --> 00:10:38.509
or he gave them this house for the summer.
So they were able to live there for free.

00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:43.880
So, Louisa and her older sister Anna and Lizzy
and May were the two younger sisters and the

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:52.440
mother and father go to Walpole. So they had
just arrived in the town and the house was

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.819
kind of a mess because no one's been living
in it. So there's mold everywhere and they've

00:10:54.819 --> 00:10:57.740
got to clean it out and they've got to put
curtains on the windows so Louisa and Anna

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:04.730
are walking into town to buy fabric. That's
what's happening here. And it's on page 16

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:11.180
if you want to follow along. I feel like I'm
leading a class [laughter].

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:17.680
"Louisa had been to Walpole only once before,
when she was quite young, so she tries not,

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:22.930
or she tries to notice each store front and
memorize it's contents to report back to her

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:26.779
mother. The sisters were experienced at moving.
As children they lived in several different

00:11:26.779 --> 00:11:31.680
houses, and they knew all about the work each
move made for the women. Stocking the kitchen,

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.430
dressing the windows, planting a new vegetable
garden. It helped to get the lay of the land

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:41.459
and meet the shop keepers early, especially,
Louisa thought with dread, since they would

00:11:41.459 --> 00:11:46.020
soon be testing the shop keeper's generosity
buy asking to buy things on credit. As they

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:50.279
descended the hill, they turned West on Middle
Street and then North into Washington Square,

00:11:50.279 --> 00:11:55.279
where the town's few shops were clustered.
The butcher shop occupied the southwest corner

00:11:55.279 --> 00:12:00.350
of the square. Bronson's aversion to meat
made Anna and Louisa a little skiddish about

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:05.600
the carcasses hanging in the windows and they
looked away as they passed by. The square

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.620
contained two village book stores that were
local centers of political discussion. On

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:14.319
the west side of the square, men interested
in the philosophy of the waning Whig party

00:12:14.319 --> 00:12:19.170
argued over what to do about slavery and how
modern technology, like railroads may change

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:24.459
the country. Directly opposite, on the east
side of the square, Democrats stood with their

00:12:24.459 --> 00:12:29.330
arms crossed, thumb pensively fingering their
beards as they lamented the death of the ideallic

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:34.649
farming society President Jefferson had envisioned
in their grandfather's time. And men who cared

00:12:34.649 --> 00:12:39.080
for neither politics nor books gather at the
tavern that sat between the stores to imbibe

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:44.269
and gamble until their wives prevailed upon
them to return home for supper. Abba was at

00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:49.480
least lucky on one account. And Abba is Louisa's
mother, Abigail. Bronson was a temperate man

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:54.949
and never once set foot in that place of temptation.
Louisa fought back the whelling irritation

00:12:54.949 --> 00:13:00.639
that made her jaw feel tight. Walpole seemed
to her wholly unremarkable. Over the last

00:13:00.639 --> 00:13:04.680
few years, she had felt herself growing restless,
yearning for freedom from the domestic obligations

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:10.259
that came with continuing to live at home.
Though the cares of Boston frightened her,

00:13:10.259 --> 00:13:14.570
the noise and heat of the train, the looming
shadow of steamers discharging immigrants

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:19.519
on Indian Wharf where vendors sold peppered
oyster soaked in vinegar near the overcrowded

00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:24.510
tenements. She loved th excitement and freedom
of the city. With her family she had bounced

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:28.410
between Boston and Concord over the years,
but never had the chance to live in a city

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:33.350
on her own, to have the space and time to
think and write. Since her father had announced

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:39.389
the solution to their current financial whoas,
his plan was to move the family here to Walpole,

00:13:39.389 --> 00:13:43.459
Louisa had been scheming for a way to get
back to the city as soon as possible. She

00:13:43.459 --> 00:13:48.149
had promised herself she would accompany them
to her uncle's house, help unload the trunk

00:13:48.149 --> 00:13:52.470
and be on the first train from Bellows Falls
back to Boston by the end of the week. She

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:57.999
still had most of the money left from the
$10 she earned for The Rival Prima Donna,

00:13:57.999 --> 00:14:02.850
a story she wrote under the name of Flora
Fairfield and the advance on Flower Fables,

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:07.720
her collecton on fairy tales published in
a tiny local run the previous fall. The publisher

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.829
had sent her a mere $32 for that work, though
even this small sum had astonished her at

00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:16.089
the time. She gave a portion to her father
for the good of the household and squirreled

00:14:16.089 --> 00:14:21.040
the rest away professing an oath to Anna and
her mirror that she would safeguard the money

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:25.029
for one express purpose. 'I, Louisa Alcott,
do swear,'

00:14:25.029 --> 00:14:30.120
'Do solomonly swear', Anna offered. Her hands
cradeling the green leather bible on which

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.779
Louisa rested her palm.
'Do solomonly swear to resist temptations

00:14:33.779 --> 00:14:38.990
large and small, be they in the form of particularly
bewitching bonnets, slippers...'

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:43.180
'Gloves?', Anna asked with her eyebrowes raised.
Louisa nodded, 'Gloves'.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:48.410
And Anna was quick to test her sister's conviction.
'Even if they happen to be the sort that close

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:52.819
with those tiny pearl buttons?'
'Especially if they have pearl buttons, as

00:14:52.819 --> 00:14:56.160
well as chocolates, pecans, new books, fine
pens...'

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:00.459
'And cream laid writing paper, don't forget
about that. Anna pressed her lips together

00:15:00.459 --> 00:15:04.221
to suppress a smile.
Louisa groaned and closed her eyes, 'The very

00:15:04.221 --> 00:15:09.350
thought of it tests me this moment. Yes, yes,
no fine writing paper. Now, where was I? Oh

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:14.630
yes, resist temptations large and small so
noted, in the service of my especial aim,

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:19.430
to secure for myself in the City of Boston,
a place apart and and a room in which I might

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:22.029
write my stories and sell them to the highest
bidder.'

00:15:22.029 --> 00:15:24.810
'Well done', cried Anna, and the oath was
sealed."

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:29.560
So, in this part of the story, of course,
Louisa's thinking it's going to be very simple.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:33.350
She's going to get them set up in the house.
She's going to get on the train to freedom;

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:39.279
but of course, that does not work out that
way. So, that's my shpeel, I would love to

00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:41.019
hear questions, if you have any.

00:15:41.019 --> 00:15:46.910
&gt;&gt;How did you prepare to write this? Like
what kind of research did you do, and how

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:48.300
long does that take?

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:53.370
Kelly: It was um, it I researched for about
6 months before I actually started thinking

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:58.999
about how I wanted to write it, or which story
I wanted to tell, because there was so much

00:15:58.999 --> 00:16:03.519
about her life, that was amazing and fascinating
to me. And I wanted it all to be in the novel

00:16:03.519 --> 00:16:07.059
but it wouldn't all fit in one story. So I
had to decide what I wanted to focus on, what

00:16:07.059 --> 00:16:15.740
part of her life I wanted to focus on. Um,
I thought a lot about how she is such a historical

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.221
icon to us, you know. Um, what do we really
know about her? We know she wrote Little Women,

00:16:18.221 --> 00:16:22.730
that's what most people know. Um, but she
had this whole other life, and and I wondered

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:28.430
too about what is it like to be the kind of
person who did something that, you know this

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:33.379
book has never gone out of print, thousands
and thousands and thousands of women have

00:16:33.379 --> 00:16:39.850
read this book over decades. So, what is it
about her that her do this and did she know

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:45.139
about herself, that she had this in her destiny.
Or was she just a normal person before this

00:16:45.139 --> 00:16:50.279
came into her life. So, I, that's why I decided
to set it before, so that, you know, thinking

00:16:50.279 --> 00:16:56.870
of what she, who, who the Louisa person was.
Um, but in terms of research, I read all the

00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:00.879
biographies of her, a lot of biographies of
her family. Her father, like I said was a

00:17:00.879 --> 00:17:05.140
philosopher, Ralph Waldo Emerson was their
neighbor, Nathaniel Hawthorne was their neighbor,

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.560
Thoreau was their neighbor.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.630
&gt;&gt;Oh my gosh!

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:13.830
Kelly: Uh huh. Concord, Concord was the most
important place to be in the 1850's; um, in

00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:19.411
terms of writing and thinking in American
philosophy. And she, Thoreau, I have some

00:17:19.411 --> 00:17:23.170
things about Thoreau in here, he used to take
her on nature walks in the woods, she learned

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:28.330
all about the natural world from Thoreau.
Emerson was her father's best friend, so he

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:32.560
was often at the house. He read Louisa's rough
drafts of her work and gave her feed-back

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:38.060
on her writing when she was young. Um, so
they lived in a very interesting place. Um,

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.340
so reading biographies of them, and then my
favorite part of the historical research is

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.450
um, learning about how they lived their lives
day-to-day. That is just fascinating to me.

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:49.640
How did, how they made candles. I have a scene
in here where Anna and Louisa are making candles.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:56.740
And so learning how they did that; and, you
know, what supplies you would use and where

00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:03.530
they would get them from and just the process
of that. Or, how they prepared their food,

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:07.990
what kind of you know; seasonal eating is
so popular now. Well that was what you did.

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:12.600
That's only what anyone did then, because
when there was not such thing as refrigerated

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:17.060
transport of food. Or, I mean just everything
that we take for granted. It's fascinating

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:21.340
to me to learn what life would have been like
day-to-day for them. So, they are many many

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:26.360
good books out there for learning about these
archaic things that I'm really interested

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:33.460
in. Um, a lot of reading, reading her letters
and journals was fascinating and a way to

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:37.100
understand her voice. And really think, you
know, hearing and writing her voice -- I wanted

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:44.620
it to be -- I want to understand her from,
from her own words. Um, so that was, she didn't

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:51.140
burn all the letters and journals, thank goodness,
you know, they still have a lot. She only

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.940
burned the mysterious ones. [laughter]. That
have the juicy stuff in them apparently. Um,

00:18:53.940 --> 00:19:00.570
so I guess that would be, and then um, you
know libraries are very good places for me

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.170
to, to uh talk to librarians who know so much
and can point you in the right direction toward

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:09.480
sources that you wouldn't think of. Old magazines,
old newspapers. It's a fun, you know, fun

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.680
journey. Like a treasure hunt.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:18.870
&gt;&gt;Did you do any traveling to any of these
places?

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:25.040
Kelly: A little bit. I didn't travel to the
town until after I wrote the first draft,

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:30.020
because I, I had a map, had a Google map.
[laughter] Um, of the town and I had done

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:34.400
enough research on the town to know the street
names, which had changed and so I could, you

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:41.450
know sort of have a map that was regressed
to 1855. Um and understood the layout of the

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:47.860
town and I knew which buildings were old enough
to have been there. But I didn't want to go

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:52.300
there because I knew it, well it's a modern
town now and I wanted to have the town of

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:56.440
my imagination be what was first in the page,
but then I knew I needed to go there to see

00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:00.582
it and maybe there was something I was missing.
So I did go, um it happened to be when we

00:20:00.582 --> 00:20:06.090
were traveling out to Maine for a wedding
so we drove through. And it was very interesting

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:10.510
going. I always tell the story about, um,
that house that they lived in is still there,

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:16.800
but it is an apartment complex now. And it
had, um it was just so not what I it. It is

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:21.390
still called Alcott House, but it, it has,
you know one of those really funky awnings

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:27.470
on the front, all these additions that have
come along, you know since the time. And there

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:32.110
was this big like '79 Chevy Impala parked
on the lawn it had a Lynard Skynard bumper

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:43.890
sticker. I mean [laughter] it was so not the
quaint, you know, New England house from 1855

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:47.710
that I pictured. So it was probably good that
I didn't go there before um. [laughter] But

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:51.290
it was neat to walk the same streets that
they walked and to smell what the air smells

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:55.470
like and the flowers and the bees and the
things that you wouldn't think of until you

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:57.980
really walked there. So that was, that was
really a good experience.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:06.120
&gt;&gt;Given that you had um, so much insight into
her thoughts, via the journals and things

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.260
like that, why did you choose to write in
third person as opposed to first?

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:17.940
Kelly: Well, that a good question. I think
that um, I felt that that might be going a

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:29.150
little too far in terms of making assumptions
about her voice; or [pause] presuming to know

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:36.080
her so well to speak in her voice. I think
that I was a uncomfortable enough at the idea,

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:41.250
and I still am in some ways, of writing a
story about a real person making a fictional

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:46.330
story up about a real person that I think
the third person gave me enough distance that

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:52.920
I felt, um I wasn't presuming so much about
who she was, or understanding her. And also,

00:21:52.920 --> 00:22:00.340
just from a practical point of view, structuring
the novel, I wanted to be able to um, see

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:07.650
her from the outside and be able to see other
characters from the outside that I as a narrator

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:12.050
would have a different perspective on them
then then she might, inside her own head.

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:16.440
So sometimes it can be just more of a structural
decision. But I, I definitely think that I

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:20.530
wanted enough distance from her voice in that
way. Does that make sense?

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:26.770
&gt;&gt;Yeah, and actually I sort of have a semi-related
question. Um, I know you said this was you

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:30.150
first published novel, but I imagine you've
written your own things before?

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:31.150
Kelly: Um hmm.

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:35.160
&gt;&gt;Um, if you've ever written a fully fictional
character versus that space in history, have

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:40.670
you noticed yourself behaving differently
with the character? Do you connect less with

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:41.670
her or more with her or?

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:48.850
Kelly: I think that I'm more um, it's more
freeing to write about a completely fictional

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:57.320
person, because you're not as worried about,
um, portraying them incorrectly or disrespectfully.

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:03.200
Or I mean, I admire Louisa May Alcott so immensely;
and connect with her in that, you know, I

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:10.820
just feel a sense of understanding about who
she was and how she felt about her work; and

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:14.730
what she wanted her life to be like; and her
struggle for independence and things like

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:18.570
that. I really can relate to those things.
But, at the same time, she was a real person.

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:23.280
When you create a completely fictional character,
then you can create whoever you want. And

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:27.060
so there's definitely a sense of responsibility
when you are writing anything about a real

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:31.160
person that um, and, and some people think
that you shouldn't do it at all because of

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:38.320
these, you know, issues and concerns. But,
um, so yes I have written other characters.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:43.000
I'm writing a book right now that is a completely
fictional character and in some ways it is

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:50.270
easier in that it's, you feel more free to
create her in any way that you want to. But,

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:56.790
um I loved writing about Louisa too because
I loved learning about her life and I loved

00:23:56.790 --> 00:24:01.100
sort of imagining, you know, bringing her
life, that was very fun. Getting, it was like

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.570
getting a conversation, it was like getting
to ask her all the questions that I really

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:09.150
wanted to ask her and never was able to ask
her because she's gone. But, you know writing

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:19.700
the story I felt like I was able to sort of
talk to her. [she laughs]. In a weird way.

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:20.700
&gt;&gt;Can you tell me a little bit more about
your process, you know what I mean, you researched

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.690
a lot, like how long did it take you for you
to write the whole novel and did you start

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:28.210
at the beginning and work your way all the
way to the end or.

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:29.270
Kelly: Um hmm.

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:30.785
&gt;&gt;Or did you piece it together? How, things
like that?

00:24:30.785 --> 00:24:34.990
Kelly: Um, it was very different, it's very
different now than it was when it, from the

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:40.970
first draft. Um, originally, I wanted a story
that had a contemporary plot, with flashbacks

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:48.610
to the historical times. So I had a narrator
who was in the first person. Um, who was living

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:53.550
in Boston and working as a teacher. And I
had this whole story around her life and she

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:59.370
discovered at her aunt's house this trunk
that contained letters. And that her aunt

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:04.100
would have been a decendent of Joseph, the
love interest in the story. Um, and she would,

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:10.840
over time, uncover the details of this relationship
and through the letters there would be these

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:17.020
flashback chapters of the historical. Um,
but as I was working on it, I so loved writing

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:21.490
the historical portions and so dreaded kind
of [laughter] I don't know sort of this dread.

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:24.330
I don't know I just didn't sort of like this
character very much, didn't like where the

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:27.760
story was going. It was sort of like that
friend that you just wish would stop calling

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:32.220
you, [laughter] you know, you're tired of
hanging out with her, I don't know I just,

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:39.270
I think I just liked Louisa more than I liked
her. So, I ended up just, I was so frustrated

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:42.320
with it because I'm, I was getting to this
point where I would say, okay, Monday, Wednesday,

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:47.140
Friday I have to work on the, you know contemporary
plot and on Tuesday and Thursday I can work

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:51.670
on the historical. But then I would find ways
of avoiding it and all this stuff. I finally

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:55.560
had to have a sit down with myself and just
decide, what am I going to do about this 'cause

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:59.871
it's not working. So then I just took a break
for a while. I didn't even, I didn't know

00:25:59.871 --> 00:26:03.570
if I would finish it, I was just so frustrated.
And then what I finally realized what I had

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:10.670
to do was just cut all that and restructure
the story around these few, but very lovingly

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:17.780
crafted themes that I had of the historical
time. And, um so that was 150 pages that I

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.694
had to cut and that was a hard day.

00:26:19.694 --> 00:26:20.694
&gt;&gt;Wow.

00:26:20.694 --> 00:26:22.630
Kelly: Because I felt like I had made so much
progress. I had all this, I had lots and lots

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:27.960
of pages, but it wasn't coming together as
a novel. So I cut those. I still have them,

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:32.880
but I mean they will never see the light of
day because I, you know, don't feel the love

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:39.620
for that. [laughter]. But, um, and then I
had to, you know, grow the story and develop

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:45.650
the story around what I did have. And decided
you know how, what to develop the sisters

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:52.060
more, and to make it into a novella of it's
own. So, that was a process, um, coming to

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:56.770
that decision and, you know, many many more
months after that of writing more. Additional

00:26:56.770 --> 00:27:03.040
research, because once I expanded it, it raised
a lot more questions about things. Um and

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:14.480
so I would say, from beginning to end of sending
it out for submission, it was probably a year

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.840
and a half. Um, and it was, uh, it was a kind
of an interesting time in our lives because

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:24.490
we had, my husband is a physics professor
at Loyola. But he just started that job in

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:30.650
July. And before we moved to Chicago for that
job, he in order to be competitive for the

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:36.370
path of theoretical physics in academia, you
have to do well these short-term research

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:40.700
positions. So, we had moved around a lot to
different universities. And um, we had been

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:45.010
in Rhode Island for two years, which is when
I started to get really interested in um,

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:51.910
in the Alcotts and that part of history and
then we moved to Ontario for two years. Waterloo,

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:56.820
which actually there's a Google office in
Waterloo, Ontario [laughter]. Um, but we didn't

00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:02.360
know a soul there and I was, I had been teaching
7th grade when we lived in Rhode Island, but

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:06.720
I couldn't teach there because my certificate
wasn't recognized. So I started working as

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:12.700
a nanny, which was not something I really
wanted to do, um and that was when I started

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.990
writing. So, anyway, that's a long answer
to your question. But it took a year and a

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:19.700
half and that was kind of the amount of time
that I had to allow it to take, because we

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:24.860
were there for two years, I needed something
to show for that time, I felt. And so then

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:29.480
I was able to submit it right around the time
that we were starting to prepare to leave

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.820
from there. So. Yeah.

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:43.690
&gt;&gt;And how long did it, can it take once you,
like how did you find a publisher and how

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:45.500
long did it take to actually get published?

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.500
Kelly: Um, so first you have to find an agent,
that's the first hurdle. Um, you submit to,

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:50.110
you know, you look for agents who are interested
in the same or represent the same kind of

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:55.190
works. So someone who does historical fictions
or someone who, you know, might have an interest

00:28:55.190 --> 00:29:01.270
in this kind of thing. And um, you send a
query letter. There's a whole process. You

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:05.830
send a query letter, which is just a one-page
letter that's about the story. And sort of

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:10.180
give your marketing hook, how you think it
could be you know, portrayed to a publisher.

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:11.471
And then if the agent likes it, they will
request the manuscript. So then that takes

00:29:11.471 --> 00:29:18.680
time and they read it and they decide okay,
we're going to represent you. And then, from

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:23.040
that point they are sending it to editors
at different publishers and that's a long

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:27.360
process of waiting to hear, is anyone going
to want it, it's a very tough market, yadda,

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:31.900
yadda, yadda. [laughter] So it can be a long
dissapointment, you know it can be a struggle.

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:36.910
Um, and then you finally find an editor that
is interested and then there's the whole negotiating

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:40.980
process and you know how long is it going
to take. So, that whole thing, I mean it actually

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:44.050
went pretty fast for me, a lot faster than
it does for a lot of people. I think I had

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:47.500
good timing with you know, people are really
interested in historical fiction right now

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:53.000
for some reason, it just a trend at the moment.
I mean it comes and goes, over time. Like

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.040
some people think it's because of the economy,
that people are interested in, you know, the

00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:02.030
past and the simpler time, which of course
it's never really a simpler time. [laughter]

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:07.280
But, um so, for whatever reason, I was really
lucky. So it took about, you know it took

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:10.930
a few months from when I first sent it to
May, the woman who became my agent, until

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:14.890
we had the commitment from my publisher that
they wanted to publish it. And then it takes

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:19.110
about a year to actually come out. Because
you go through a long process of editing with

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:30.920
your editor and then it has to be copy edited,
the cover design and the, and you know, all

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:39.620
that kind of stuff. So uh it was March '09
that it was sold to the publisher and April

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:42.620
this last couple of weeks that it came out.
So.

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:43.620
&gt;&gt;Oh, it's brand new!

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.160
&gt;&gt;It is brand new. [laughter] It's brand new,
yes. So, yeah.

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:49.100
&gt;&gt;Can you tell us more about your current
project?

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:54.910
Kelly: Sure, um it is another historical novel.
It's set in 1835, so a little bit earlier

00:30:54.910 --> 00:31:03.350
than this one. Um, and it starts in Buffalo,
New York. Um, it's about a woman who is in

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:10.880
a violent marriage, and she is trying to escape
from this marriage and two other women are

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:16.580
helping her. And, there are no railroads at
this time, so the only way to travel West

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:22.180
was just by steamship. So she takes a steamship
to Mackinac Island, because one of these women

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:26.610
has a house on Mackinac Island. And she's
partially based on a real person whose house

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:32.346
is now a, a bed and breakfast on Mackinac
Island, the Harbour View Inn. Um, so these

00:31:32.346 --> 00:31:38.220
women help, are helping her make this escape.
And so a lot of the book takes place on Mackinac

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:42.980
Island, which has been really fun to research.
And it's fun to talk to people from Michigan

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:46.792
about that, because everybody, well not everyone,
but a lot of people have been there or know

00:31:46.792 --> 00:31:52.600
about it. And it's kind of this gem that people
other places don't know about. And it has

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:57.280
so much interesting history, it was such an
important place during the War of 1812. It

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:03.760
was import - it was the, the center of the
fur trade. So the Jesuit missionaries were

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:09.270
there in the 1600's it's actually very, very,
very old settlement for this part of the country.

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:14.080
So, the history there, I mean you could write
50 novels about Mackinac Island, it's so interesting.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:19.590
Um, and I got to go there last summer, in
June to do a little research. And that was

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:23.070
wonderful, though it rained the entire time
I was there.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:24.070
&gt;&gt; Oh no!

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:25.070
[laughter]

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:29.540
Kelly: Yeah, it's hard to get around with
no cars. And, you know, it was raining the

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:30.703
entire time, but that's okay. If you are determined
enough you'll [laughter] get your work done.

00:32:30.703 --> 00:32:34.610
Um, but it, you know, so that's been a fun
process. And then the, the tricky thing is

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:38.910
getting time to work on that while, you know
doing all this, which is really fun to talk

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:42.750
about it. But, of course, my mind is on that
one and now, you know, I'm just kind of juggling

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:43.750
those things but, um, but it's really fun.
I mean I'm doing what I've always wanted to

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:47.990
do and it's just kind of amazing that it's
happening to me. [laughter] You know, yeah.

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.990
&gt;&gt;So let me know if you've already answered.

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:49.990
Kelly: Sure.

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:59.540
&gt;&gt; This and I'll ask you at the end so everyone
else doesn't have to hear it again. But, how

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:04.721
do you go about, like choosing your topic
and like identifying like, you know, what

00:33:04.721 --> 00:33:08.690
you want, what you want to write about. Like
you focus on historical fiction, so.

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:10.040
Kelly: Um hmm.

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:14.100
&gt;&gt;You know, how do you come about, like choosing?

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:17.280
Kelly: It's hard to choose, because there's
so many great stories to be written. And,

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:21.290
you know people say, where, how do, how do
you get your ideas. And it's like how do you

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:23.210
no get ideas? [laughter]. I can't walk down
the street without getting ideas. [laughter]

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:28.730
The main thing is, you know, is it a written,
is it a novel? Is it just a cool story, or

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:34.520
is it, could it be a novel. You know could
you make it into a novel? And um, you know,

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:41.040
reading, reading about places and, and different
time periods gives me lots of ideas. But it's

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:46.130
a good question, because it's hard to choose.
I think you find a compelling character in

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:52.760
a particular event, or um, who just captures
your attention, and you want to know more

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:58.461
about what their life might have been like.
And, in figuring out or inventing, if you

00:33:58.461 --> 00:34:03.200
can't find the answer, what their life was
like. That's sort of how it comes, becomes

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.590
a story. And they sort of, you know you hear
them talking in your head and you think about

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:12.510
them a lot. And umm but there have been leads
that have turned out to not be. You know,

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:16.879
there are things I sort of pursued and really
took a lot of notes and thought about it a

00:34:16.879 --> 00:34:21.360
lot but ultimately it just didn't materialize
for whatever reason. I got really interested

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:28.020
originally when I was writing about Mackinac
in John Astor. John Jacob Astor the fur trade

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:32.910
magnet who immigrated from Germany and owned
the American Fur Company, which was based

00:34:32.910 --> 00:34:39.570
in Mackinac Island. And he was the first American
millionaire and, um, I thought, well there,

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:43.120
there's a story. But I think, maybe because
it was a man, I think I really love writing

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:46.850
about female characters and that I started
wanting to write about his wife or his daughter,

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:50.000
and I realized, okay, he's not doing it for
me. [laughter] You know, he's in the story

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.669
a little bit, but you know he's not the center
of the story anymore. But um, yeah, so I just,

00:34:54.669 --> 00:34:58.600
you know I love the reading and choosing the
part and then, you have to choose and then

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.600
you have to commit. And then you can't read
other stuff. I have all these other things

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:06.610
that I want to read about, and I don't let
myself read because I know I'm going to get

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:11.890
sidetracked and want to think about that and
so. There's a part there's like the honeymoon

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:16.810
period, where you love your story so much,
and you love working on it and then it starts

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:20.410
to get, you know like a little more complicated
and bogged down, and you get to the hard part

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:23.600
where you don't know what your going to do
with the story and you get to a point where

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:25.560
you want to chuck it then you fall in love
with a new story. [laughter]. And then you

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:32.771
want to be with that story all the time. So
um, I think that you, you have to be committed,

00:35:32.771 --> 00:35:36.190
just like you're committed to your partner.
You know, I'm not going to be turned away

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:38.670
by this eye-candy over here, I'm going to
pay attention to you [laughter] because I'm

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:43.480
committed to you and see it through to the
end, and you know, that's where the discipline

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:44.500
part comes in, I think.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:51.125
&gt;&gt;Do you have like a group of people that
you share, you bounce your ideas off of like?

00:35:51.125 --> 00:35:55.110
Kelly: I do. I have a couple of friends who
are writers and um, we do. Although it's kind

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:59.910
of interesting, I don't like to let people
read things until, I'm very perfectionistic,

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:04.230
so until I feel like they're really, really
ready to be shown. But, we do definitely bounce

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:10.270
ideas off each other. I have a friend who
is really smart about, you know, what's a

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:12.980
dud and what's a, what's compelling, you know
or what's a dud idea. And, and we're, we're

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:19.960
honest with each other. You have to have that
honesty, otherwise it's not helpful, you know,

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:23.515
kind of advice. If everything is so wonderful
that you tell her, then you know that she's

00:36:23.515 --> 00:36:27.010
not telling you the truth. Uh, but um, yeah
I think you have to have that because it's

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:30.490
a very solitary job, most of the time, so
it's good to have other people that you can

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:42.470
talk to and who understand, and who are weird
like in the same way that you're weird. [laughter].

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:43.470
So.

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:44.470
&gt;&gt;You mentioned you have had, when you were
starting to write, you had like Monday, Wednesday,

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:47.600
Fridays dedicated to that one part. Did you
dedicate, like a certain amount of time per

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:54.350
day or were you like, I want to get through
so many pages?

00:36:54.350 --> 00:37:00.590
Kelly: Yeah, well I have a word count goal
every day. Um, but I try, if I'm doing well

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:05.610
and I make my word count early, I try to still
sit there and keep working as long as I can.

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:10.070
Um, I write in the mornings. And I really
do try to write every day, because I, I think

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:14.560
I have that fear that if I stop for too long,
like this last couple of weeks has been really

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:18.120
creepy and I haven't been as good about my
routine. And there is that fear that it's

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:21.350
just going to go away and you'll, you won't
be able to come back to it. You won't be able

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:27.020
to you know, pick up the thread, probably
paranoia or not a real fear, you know not

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:31.670
a legitimate fear. But it's good to be afraid
of that because it motivates you to keep working.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:35.000
And you do, you know you do have to be committed
to it. It's like any other job, you know you

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:41.250
just have to keep, keep working and keep going
with it, and have managable goals, too. I

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:45.300
mean having that word count, read it I'm thinking
I'm going to write my novel today, you know

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:48.690
that's too overwhelming. That's like trying
to run a marathon you know you have to just

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:53.430
go from one, one water station to the next
water station. [laughter].

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:55.350
&gt;&gt;What's you're word count?

00:37:55.350 --> 00:38:00.650
Kelly: Um, 500 to 1,000. 500 when I'm just
having a rough day or I'm working on a difficult

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:05.090
part that I think is going to take a long
time. And, that doesn't sound like a lot,

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:09.810
but some days it's really hard to write 500
words. Some days it comes very easily, some

00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:14.990
days 1,000, 2,000 comes very easily. Um, it
just depends on what part of the story you're

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:18.880
working on. And I, and then I do find time
to um you know, sort of outlining as I go,

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:24.020
or like how am I going to approach that next
chapter or, right now with my new one I'm

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:29.700
sort of working on resequencing chapters so
thinking about, okay, if I move this here,

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:37.310
then, I have to go back and change this part
because then it's not going to make sense

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:38.570
now. It's kind of like a house of cards, if
you move one thing, you know everything else

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:39.570
is dependent on that. So some of the time
is sort of spent on that macro-level stuff,

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:46.280
but, the actual writing yeah, 500 to 1,000
words a day. And you can write a novel in

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:52.170
you know, 3 months if you really wrote a thousand
words a day. But, then you would, every word

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:57.090
would have to be perfect from the beginning.
[laughter] So that doesn't count re-writing

00:38:57.090 --> 00:39:02.680
and your revising and those types of things.
That's why it takes longer than that. So.

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.680
Um Hmm?

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:10.470
&gt;&gt;Do you have any, um authors that really
stuck out to you as a kid, or growing up that

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:13.480
has inspired you to really pursue this?

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:19.160
Kelly: Um hmm. Um, I love Ethan Canin, one
of my favorite. I can remember reading he

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:22.830
has this book called Emperor of the Air, a
short story collection. And I can remember

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:27.881
reading that in the library when I was probably
about 14 or 13, something like that. And it

00:39:27.881 --> 00:39:34.630
was an adult book, but um thinking whoa, this
is different from anything I've ever read

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:38.320
in school and this guys is still alive and
I'm thinking wow, this is really a job that

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:44.340
people do and just being absolutely blown
away by him. He is and incredible writer.

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:50.090
Um, Lori Coleman is another writer that I
really love. She writes a, well she passed

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:55.176
away, but she did write many a few, you know
a handful of novels about young women and

00:39:55.176 --> 00:39:56.176
you know I love women's stories, that's what
is compelling to me. Um, Marilyn Robinson.

00:39:56.176 --> 00:40:05.150
[pause] [sigh] Um Alice Monroe, I really love
Alice Monroe, she has the most fabulous short

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:15.850
stories, so I just love to read so much. You
know? And I've always loved to read, and that's

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:26.630
what made me want to be a writer. Loving to
read and thinking, maybe I can do that too.

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:27.630
You know.

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:28.630
&gt;&gt;How, um, how have you noticed, I mean you've
probably been writing for a long time. How

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:32.580
have you notice that your process has changed?
Have you become more organized or concrete

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:34.530
or, you mentioned outlining.

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:42.290
Kelly: Um hmm. I think that um, I never really
thought it was a real thing that you could

00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:46.740
do. I mean I always wanted to write. I wrote
all through school. I'd write a million reams

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:51.040
of bad poetry all through junior high [laughter]
and all that kind of stuff. But then when

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:54.470
I finished college I felt like I had to get
a a grown up job, that that wasn't a grown

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:59.520
up job, that you couldn't really pursue that.
Or it wasn't practical, so you know I had

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:03.670
all these grown up jobs that I hated. And
then, um when I decided I was going to try

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:07.960
to write a novel, I thought well, if I'm going
to do it, then I'm really going to do it as

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:14.369
a professional, you know in a professional
way. In that I would commit to finishing something

00:41:14.369 --> 00:41:19.090
and um, writing something that I thought other
people would actually want to read. You know

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:23.640
thinking about the audience is a big step
forward from writing terrible poetry all through

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:28.010
junior high. Please God let no one read it.
If I'm going to burn anything it should be

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:33.270
that. [Laugher] If I get hit by a bus after
this meeting I won't have anyone read it.

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:39.480
But um, I think that um, so thinking about
it as a real job. Then it was like okay, if

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:44.521
you're going to try this, then let's do it
for real. And committing to a schedule and

00:41:44.521 --> 00:41:47.880
then you know, finishing. Because a lot of
people will start things and then not finish

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:51.190
them. And then that's such a shame because
you put all this work and effort into it,

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:53.460
but it, you don't give yourself a fair shot
if you don't finish it. And you can't submit

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:57.800
to an agent if it's not finished. So, um,
I was going to finish it, no matter how bad

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:04.050
it was, I was going to finish it. And, I was
going to write every day and just really give

00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:08.510
it a fair shot. So I think my process has
changed in that I learned to think of it as

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:14.840
a job. And um, to take responsibility for
it that way, and not look at it like a hobby.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:19.760
I wanted to elevate it from hobby to job.
To a profession. And um, and then in terms

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:23.400
of, I do outline. I, you know, when you take
writing -I don't know how many of you took

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:27.690
writing classes in college- but outlining
and stuff is like oh, real writers don't outline

00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:33.110
because they are just, God's word is coming
directly through them. You know the inspiration,

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:37.060
you know the outlining is for amateurs or
something, but actually most writers I know

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:43.270
do outline at least, you know, very generally.
It might not be very specific. It might not

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:47.440
be in Chapter One this happens, but they have
an idea when they, they have a destination.

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:52.500
I mean they have an idea they set out and
I think too, you know, lots of notes and part

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:55.700
of the historical stuff is helpful to me to
just all of the details. It's sort of like,

00:42:55.700 --> 00:43:01.380
um you know a framework or something that
I can rely on when I'm facing that blank page

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:05.600
to think about, you know what's going to come
next in the story. It's good to have a little

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:10.360
bit of an idea of where you're headed. Some
people though like the process of just, not

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:15.720
knowing at all and, and going through it with
their eyes open and just ready to seize on

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:19.760
just whatever comes along and I think that
can work for some people too, but it might

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:24.340
take a lot longer to finish because you may
go down a lot of roads that won't come to

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:28.110
where you want to end up, and so then you
might have to circle back and loose a lot

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:31.869
of material, but some people enjoy that, you
know. So I think that everyone has to figure

00:43:31.869 --> 00:43:37.110
out for themselves what they think is the
best way to do it for themselves. But, for

00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:42.430
me, I do keep lists and outlines and I kind
of know how it's going to end, but the middle

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:47.720
is what, the part that I still have to figure
out as I go. But the, I kind of know where

00:43:47.720 --> 00:44:00.830
they're all going to end up. And sometimes
I change it as I go, but.

00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:01.830
[pause]

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:02.830
&gt;&gt;You have a question?

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:05.920
&gt;&gt;I do. [laughter] [inaudible]. Um, I was
wondering, in terms of, I mean I've read books

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:11.260
and literally been like bawling in my room,
you know. So when you write a book, and you

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:15.130
create these characters, and you like march
them into these situations, are, do you feel

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:19.340
like you're more connected to them because
you did it, or less connected.

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:20.340
&gt;&gt;Kelly, Um hmm, yes.

00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:22.720
&gt;&gt;Because I imagine a director of a movie
doesn't thinks a scary movie is scary as their

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:23.720
filming it. You know, so.

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:29.160
Kelly: That's a really good question. That's
a really good question. I think um, when you're

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:32.740
working on you know, the technical aspects
of it, like getting a scene just right or

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:37.390
getting the word choice just right, you're
kind of in it in that way and so it's maybe

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:40.760
like a director, where you're not, you're
not thinking of them as real people. But when

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:44.420
you're working on the story and you realize
what's going to happen to one of them or you

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:48.600
what you have to do because it's like the
only thing that makes sense or it's the come

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:52.360
uppance that they need to get or whatever.
That is hard, I mean there are definitely

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:58.410
times where I've sat there and cried, realizing,
oh, this is going to be so sad. [laughter]

00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:05.580
You know, because they are like real people
to you. And um, or to me anyway. But the one

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:10.350
I'm working on now has a lot of, um well this
one too was sad, because I knew how it had

00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:14.280
to end. I won't tell you, because that would
be. I mean it's sort of, you sort of know

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:18.365
because we know about Louisa May Alcott. That
she was not married in her life, so, you know

00:45:18.365 --> 00:45:22.550
I knew I couldn't depart from history completely
and say she marries this guy and they lived

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:26.340
happily ever after. And it's a totally different
ending than the real historical record. We

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:33.060
couldn't do that. So, um, so that was hard
in a way to sort of make it fit, um with the

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:36.770
historical record. But the one I'm working
on now too, like I said is a woman who'd been

00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:40.750
in a violent marriage, so she has to go through
some pretty awful stuff and writing that is

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:46.140
hard. Um, even though it's in the service
of the story and I'm going to save her from

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:49.240
that, I'm going to get her out of that situation,
but writing that stuff is definitely emotional.

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:54.990
Yeah. It's like you have all these multiple
personalities and you have to carry them around

00:45:54.990 --> 00:46:00.350
with you every where you go. It's a weird
life. [laughter]. It's a very weird life.

00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:01.440
So, yeah.

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:02.440
[pause]

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:11.850
&gt;&gt;How, um like how tied to the history do
you feel like you have to be when you're writing?

00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:16.000
Kelly: That's hard, um, that's a good question
too. And being, um when you write about a

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.160
real person. Basically, what I did was I chose
a summer. 1855 is a summer we don't know that

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:24.670
much about what they did, so I purposely chose
that, because I knew that would give me the

00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:28.850
space to create this. But I knew, we know
what happens, you know in the spring and we

00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:32.600
know what happened in the fall. So I knew
it was, you know, start with that and I could

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:37.340
create in between and then I would have to
join back up. It was kind of fun, it kind

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:42.880
of gave me just like you know, Robert Frost
has that saying, um free verse poetry is like

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:48.380
playing tennis without a net. You know if
you don't have a, a structure to your poem

00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:53.100
or your story then, anything goes, and how
hard is that? You know and, and that's a,

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:56.369
well, I don't really agree with that because
there's other things that are hard about that.

00:46:56.369 --> 00:47:01.090
But this gave me a structure that, you know,
I knew how it had to start, and how it had

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:07.480
to end, and the fun part was, how to get them
to that point. Um, but in terms of I do want

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:14.119
to be accurate in the way that I portray the
carriages and the clothes and the way that

00:47:14.119 --> 00:47:16.500
they looked. I don't want to say that they
got on a train in this town if there wasn't

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:22.150
a train in that town yet. So, doing that kind
of research was, you know, hard, at times

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:26.600
to track down a little fact that you'd have
to go through ten different books to try to

00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:29.710
find this one little fact and it would end
up being one sentence in the story, but it

00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:34.859
was for my own satisfaction that I knew that
it was correct. But then there comes a point

00:47:34.859 --> 00:47:40.140
where you can't find the answer and then you
just have to guess what it would be. Yeah,

00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:41.140
and so.

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:44.520
&gt;&gt;Okay? Well, thank you so much for being
here.

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:50.950
Kelly: Thank you so much you asked such good
questions. It was wonderful, I love it. I'm

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:51.950
so happy. [laughter].

00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:56.460
&gt;&gt;Well thank you for spending your time with
us and um feel free to take a book as you

00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:57.460
leave.

00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:58.730
&gt;&gt;Thank you.

00:47:58.730 --> 00:48:02.500
Kelly: Thank you very much.
