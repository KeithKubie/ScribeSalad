00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.280
- [Instructor] When you hear
constant of proportionality,

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.700
it can seem a little bit
intimidating at first.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.300
It seems very technical.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.720
But as we'll see, it's a
fairly intuitive concept,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.140
and we'll do several
examples and hopefully

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.590
you'll get a lot more comfortable with it.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.350
So let's say we're trying to
make some type of baked goods,

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.372
maybe it's some type of muffin,

00:00:20.372 --> 00:00:24.110
and we know that depending
on how many muffins

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.350
we're trying to make,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.290
that for a given number of eggs,

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.800
we always want twice as many cups of milk.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.560
So we could say cups of milk,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.490
cups of milk, that's going to be equal to

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.490
two times the number of eggs.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.530
So what do you think the constant

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.210
of proportionality is here,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.823
sometimes known as the
proportionality constant?

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.010
Well yes, it is going to be two.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.980
This is a proportional relationship

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.450
between the cups of milk
and the number of eggs.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.417
The cups of milk are always
going to be two times

00:01:02.417 --> 00:01:03.710
the number of eggs.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.850
Give me the number of eggs,
I'm going to multiply it

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.520
by the constant of proportionality
to get the cups of milk.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.470
And we can see how this is
a proportional relationship

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.480
a little bit clearer if we set up a table.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.940
So if we say number of eggs

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.540
and if we say cups of milk

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.203
and make a table here,

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.110
well if you have one egg,
how many cups of milk

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.100
are you gonna have?

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.300
Well this right over here
would be one times two,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.220
well you're gonna have two cups of milk.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.970
If you had three eggs, well
you're just gonna multiply

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.780
that by two to get your cups of milk,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.970
so you're gonna have six cups of milk.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.570
If you had 1,000,000 eggs, so
we have a very big party here,

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.350
maybe we're some sort of
industrial muffin producer,

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.640
well how many cups of milk?

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.300
Well you put 1,000,000 in right over here,

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.640
multiply it by two, you
get your cups of milk.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.330
You're going to need
2,000,000 cups of milk.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.410
And you can see that this is
a proportional relationship.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.450
To go from number of eggs to cups of milk,

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.220
we indeed multiplied by two every time.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.680
That came straight from this equation.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.300
And you could also see,
look whenever you multiply

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.670
your number of eggs by a certain amount,

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.080
you're multiplying your cups
of milk by the same amount.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.380
If I multiply my eggs by 1,000,000,

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.930
I'm multiplying my cups
of milk by 1,000,000.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.520
So this is clearly a
proportional relationship.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.820
Let's get a little bit
more practice identifying

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.210
the constant of proportionality.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.580
So let's say I'll make it
a little bit more abstract,

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.110
let's say I have some variable a

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.110
and it is equal to five
times some variable b.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.680
What is the constant of
proportionality here?

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.610
Pause this video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.160
Yes, it is five.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.430
Give me a b, I'm gonna
multiply it by five,

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.450
and I can figure out what a needs to be.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.220
Let's do another example.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.969
If I said that y is equal to

00:02:55.969 --> 00:03:00.969
pi times x, what is the constant
of proportionality here?

00:03:02.006 --> 00:03:05.470
Well you give me an x, I'm gonna
multiply it times a number,

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.070
the number here is pi, to give you y.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.010
So our constant of
proportionality here is pi.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.170
Let's do one more.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.730
If I were to say

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.730
that y is equal to 1/2 times x,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.830
what is the constant of proportionality?

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:23.810
Pause this video.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.360
Think about it.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.440
Well once again, this is
just going to be the number

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.920
that we're multiplying
by x to figure out y.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.070
So it is going to be 1/2.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.790
In general, you might sometimes
see it written like this.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.920
y is equal to k times x,

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.770
where k would be some
constant that would be

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.530
our constant of proportionality.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.300
You see 1/2 is equal to k here,

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.950
pi is equal to k right over there.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.323
So hopefully that helps.
