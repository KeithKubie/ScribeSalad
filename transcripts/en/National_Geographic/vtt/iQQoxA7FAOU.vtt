00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:29.262
( music plays )

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.932
( guitar music )

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:35.568
Peter: The times we live
in today are radically different

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:38.137
from those of
the young Ansel Adams.

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:41.741
Does it still hold true
that art and nature

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:43.676
can be inspirational?

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:46.445
I believe there will
always be the human need

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:49.615
for affirmation and
inspiration of the kind

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:54.153
immortalized by Adams
in his photographs.

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:56.823
Our spirits, our own
inner beauty,

00:00:56.823 --> 00:01:00.459
spring from the same source
as these rocks, trees,

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:03.063
and reflecting waters.

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:07.901
( audience applause )

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:13.839 line:0%
Tonight we're going
to talk about a place,

00:01:13.839 --> 00:01:17.510
sort of the different
components, about this place.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.814
The first is the actual,
physical geography of it.

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:24.116
It was designated one of
the first wilderness areas

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:26.286
when the Wilderness
Act was passed.

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:29.455
Most of this wilderness is
in the higher elevation,

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:31.524
what they call the High Sierra.

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:33.827
The second part I
wanted to talk about

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:36.129
was the early work
of Ansel Adams

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:39.031
that's associated with
this particular area.

00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:42.735
This was where Ansel Adams
developed his love of nature,

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:45.471
was an employee
with the Sierra Club,

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:49.675
and, kind of, where he mastered
his craft of photography.

00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:51.811
The third part, I
wanted to try and show

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:53.713
some of my work.

00:01:53.713 --> 00:01:56.349
How he influenced me.

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:59.786
This was a picture
that I took in 1977.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:03.289
I had read a lot of the
Ansel Adams basic manuals

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.891
and sort of learned a
lot about photography

00:02:05.891 --> 00:02:07.927
and the love of
landscape photography

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:10.797
from reading those
Ansel Adams books.

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:14.100
Then the fourth part was
of this, the new work

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.203
that I've done, this
landscape series.

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:18.938
This picture I just took.

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:21.340
We're sort of in a helicopter
hovering over June Lake

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.610
and looking back and up

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.611
the snowy part in
the back there,

00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:28.481
is the Ansel Adams Wilderness.

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:30.950
I just had a few of
the color pictures.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.886
This is the most remote
area in the North fork

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:36.355
of the San Joaquin River.

00:02:36.355 --> 00:02:39.425
The year that I was there,
it had almost 50 feet of snow.

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:41.160
The mountain in the
foreground there,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.395
is Mount Ansel Adams.

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:45.231
There's actually, also,
a mountain named after him.

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:48.634
What's unique about a lot of
the Ansel Adams Wilderness,

00:02:48.634 --> 00:02:50.502
it's metamorphic rock.

00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:53.172
There's this one
little area that's not

00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:56.675
the typical granite that you
find in a lot of the Sierras.

00:02:56.675 --> 00:03:01.914
This amazing water, the very
clean crystal clear blue water.

00:03:01.914 --> 00:03:04.183
Dana Lake.

00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:07.186
The storms that come
from the Pacific

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:09.221
and then they hit the mountains

00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:11.791
and form these
afternoon thunderstorms.

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:16.228
Of course the water
is the main theme.

00:03:16.228 --> 00:03:17.730
This is Rainbow Falls.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.231
And the forest.

00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:22.635
This is one area that is aspens.

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:25.505
Also a lot of evergreens.

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:29.642
I wanted to give a
little bit of the history

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:33.613
of how Ansel Adams got
involved with this area.

00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:37.550
This is a picture with
his father on the left

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.920
and his mother and Ansel
when he was 14 years old,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.388
and his Aunt.

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:44.890
This is his first
trip to Yosemite.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.593
In his autobiography,
Ansel Adams said,

00:03:47.593 --> 00:03:49.996
if he was a kid today
he would be described

00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:52.831
as a ADD child.

00:03:52.831 --> 00:03:55.968
Whatever it was, he
didn't do well in school

00:03:55.968 --> 00:04:00.706
and his father took him
out of school in the 8th grade

00:04:00.706 --> 00:04:04.276
and gave him
some private tutoring

00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:06.579
and bought him a
piano and he gave him

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.715
some piano lessons and
he sort of took to that.

00:04:09.715 --> 00:04:13.619
But he also gave
him a Brownie camera

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:17.323
and went to Yosemite.

00:04:17.323 --> 00:04:21.026
He kind of fell in
love with the place

00:04:21.026 --> 00:04:23.028
and by the time he
was about 20 years old

00:04:23.028 --> 00:04:26.131
he had gotten this
job as a caretaker

00:04:26.131 --> 00:04:28.534
of the LeConte Memorial,
which is sort of

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:30.837
the stone house that was
sort of the club house

00:04:30.837 --> 00:04:33.372
of the Sierra Club
in Yosemite Valley.

00:04:33.372 --> 00:04:34.606
It's still there.

00:04:34.606 --> 00:04:38.143
He also started going on trips.

00:04:38.143 --> 00:04:42.081
He bought his own burro
to carry his camera equipment

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:45.084
and that's kind of the way
they did it back then.

00:04:45.084 --> 00:04:47.986
He was one of the
early rock climbers.

00:04:47.986 --> 00:04:50.122
The man on the left is
David Brower,

00:04:50.122 --> 00:04:53.226
who was the long time
head of the Sierra Club.

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:55.661
Back then they wore
Keds tennis shoes

00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:59.365
and just tied a rope
together and they said,

00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:01.400
if one person fell all it
meant is that

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.768
both of them would die.

00:05:02.768 --> 00:05:03.869
( audience laughter )

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:06.706
There was no
security or anything.

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:08.975
It was pretty precarious.
The ties...

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.210
But this was like 1930's.

00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:18.317
His job was to sort of
be the logistics person

00:05:18.317 --> 00:05:22.154
for these summer High Sierra
trips, they called them then.

00:05:22.154 --> 00:05:26.558
It was primarily well-to-do
business men from San Francisco

00:05:26.558 --> 00:05:28.861
who really liked the Sierras

00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:31.097
and they would
take a whole month off

00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:36.269
and they would come and
basically camp out in
the High Sierras.

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:40.172
Amazingly, Adams would
take care of everybody

00:05:40.172 --> 00:05:41.640
but he would get up
early in the morning

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.608
and take pictures.

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:44.643
So a lot of the pictures
that I'll show you

00:05:44.643 --> 00:05:48.114
were taken, actually,
during these 1 month trips.

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:52.552
So, he came of age in
an area of pictorialism.

00:05:52.552 --> 00:05:55.187
This picture was one
of his very first.

00:05:55.187 --> 00:05:57.823
It looks kind of
strangely modern, now.

00:05:57.823 --> 00:06:00.693
Sort of the selective focus.

00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:06.065
Pictorialism was seen
as sort of

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:09.068
a imitation of painting
and that's eventually

00:06:09.068 --> 00:06:12.037
what people like Adams
sort of rebelled against.

00:06:12.037 --> 00:06:14.507
We actually know now
that, even before that,

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:16.709
it was the painters
who sort of copied

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:19.745
the camera obscura, which is
a form of photography.

00:06:19.745 --> 00:06:22.180
That's sort of what
really happened.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.150
In this era, they used
a lens that induced

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.152
these spherical aberrations
and made sort of

00:06:27.152 --> 00:06:30.823
a soft focus and was
seen as sort of imitation

00:06:30.823 --> 00:06:32.558
of painting.

00:06:32.558 --> 00:06:35.328
He soon switched, and
this is one of his first

00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:37.796
kind of straight pictures.

00:06:37.796 --> 00:06:41.000
During this time they
used glass plates

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.001
and the emulsions
were only sensitive

00:06:43.001 --> 00:06:45.904
to blue light so all the skies

00:06:45.904 --> 00:06:48.107
would turn
this sort of white color.

00:06:48.107 --> 00:06:51.143
It kind of gave
atmospheric effect.

00:06:51.143 --> 00:06:55.481
In 1923 they switched
to the emulsions

00:06:55.481 --> 00:06:58.350
where you could actually
photograph by moonlight.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.419
Longer exposures.

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:02.688
Then the big advance
was you could actually

00:07:02.688 --> 00:07:06.458
photograph clouds, which
was real important part

00:07:06.458 --> 00:07:09.228
of the Sierras, these
afternoon clouds

00:07:09.228 --> 00:07:11.997
that build up in
the summer time.

00:07:11.997 --> 00:07:15.101
Also, it seemed to me
in reading about it,

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:17.169
there was this big change,

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:20.105
sort of in his
intellectual thinking.

00:07:20.105 --> 00:07:23.542
He went from sort of
being the school brat

00:07:23.542 --> 00:07:25.844
to writing things like this.

00:07:25.844 --> 00:07:30.215
This is some of his
words from 1923.

00:07:30.215 --> 00:07:32.818
Said, "I was climbing
the long ridge

00:07:32.818 --> 00:07:34.853
west of Mount Clark.

00:07:34.853 --> 00:07:36.389
I was suddenly arrested

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:38.458
in the long crunching path

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:42.695
by an exceedingly pointed
awareness of the light.

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:45.798
I saw more clearly
than I've ever seen

00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:47.700
before or since,

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.037
the minute detail
of the grasses.

00:07:51.037 --> 00:07:54.106
The small flotsam
of the forest.

00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:58.511
The motion of the high clouds
streaming above the peaks.

00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:02.414
I dreamed, that for a moment,
time stood quietly

00:08:02.414 --> 00:08:04.516
and the vision
became but a shadow

00:08:04.516 --> 00:08:07.686
of an infinitely greater world."

00:08:07.686 --> 00:08:11.190
The other thing that I thought
was sort of interesting

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.659
was he had a belief
that dead trees

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:16.061
were more expressive
than live ones.

00:08:16.061 --> 00:08:18.564
So he took quite a few
pictures of dead trees.

00:08:18.564 --> 00:08:20.700
This is kind of a
hostile environment

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.801
when you get into
high elevations.

00:08:22.801 --> 00:08:25.071
This is a foxtail pine,
may have been dead

00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:26.806
for 100 years or so.

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:28.407
It just stays there.

00:08:28.407 --> 00:08:34.079
He also embraced not only
a rejection of pictorialism,

00:08:34.079 --> 00:08:37.249
but this embrace of modernism.

00:08:37.249 --> 00:08:39.852
Alfred Stieglitz had
a saying that said,

00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:43.088
"Art should be the
affirmation of life."

00:08:43.088 --> 00:08:46.225
Throughout his whole career
he always hung to that,

00:08:46.225 --> 00:08:48.260
that it should be affirming.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.697
He also had a belief,
he called it extracts.

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:53.231
He didn't like when somebody

00:08:53.231 --> 00:08:55.600
called this picture abstract.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.203
He thought that the
role of the photographer

00:08:58.203 --> 00:09:01.273
was to extract a part of nature.

00:09:01.273 --> 00:09:04.644
He called it, to make
form from shapes.

00:09:04.644 --> 00:09:06.745
He thought all nature was
just shapes and it was

00:09:06.745 --> 00:09:08.214
up to the artist to
make form out of it

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:10.349
and to extract.

00:09:10.349 --> 00:09:15.153
This was sort of a
radical view for the time.

00:09:15.153 --> 00:09:16.856
If you think of a picture
like this,

00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:19.524
compare it to the 19th century
photographers

00:09:19.524 --> 00:09:21.226
who were survey photographers.

00:09:21.226 --> 00:09:25.097
Would go out and their
job was mainly to go out West,

00:09:25.097 --> 00:09:28.734
survey, take these pictures,
and come back East

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:31.269
and show people
what was out there.

00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:33.772
Adams really thought
that you should sort of

00:09:33.772 --> 00:09:36.241
project your emotional state,

00:09:36.241 --> 00:09:40.679
feelings toward the environment
or toward the landscape.

00:09:40.679 --> 00:09:43.748
There's a little bit of a
story behind this picture.

00:09:43.748 --> 00:09:46.919
It's called the Michael Minaret

00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:50.289
and one of those well-to-do,
early Sierra Club members

00:09:50.289 --> 00:09:51.890
was named Walter Star.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.760
He had a son
who was a avid climber

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.229
and he liked to climb solo.

00:09:57.229 --> 00:09:59.632
Unfortunately he fell
to his death

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:03.969
on this Michael Minaret and
so he asked Ansel Adams

00:10:03.969 --> 00:10:07.340
if he would put together a
book of his best pictures

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.477
of the John Muir Trail
because his son, his dream

00:10:11.477 --> 00:10:14.213
was to write a guide book
of the John Muir Trail,

00:10:14.213 --> 00:10:15.681
which stills exists.

00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:19.084
It's called the Star's
Guide to John Muir Trail.

00:10:19.084 --> 00:10:23.322
That was what made this
book happen in 1938.

00:10:23.322 --> 00:10:24.890
It's really the only book

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.325
that's totally written
by Ansel Adams

00:10:27.325 --> 00:10:29.929
and has 50 of his photographs.

00:10:29.929 --> 00:10:32.264
The book was sold
for $15 at the time,

00:10:32.264 --> 00:10:35.568
which is quite a bit, and
there was only 500 copies.

00:10:35.568 --> 00:10:37.303
This whole early work was

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:40.272
from the period of
around 1920 to 1938.

00:10:40.272 --> 00:10:44.776
And then after that
World War II came about

00:10:44.776 --> 00:10:47.246
and Ansel
Adams had this idea

00:10:47.246 --> 00:10:49.615
that he would try
and do pictures

00:10:49.615 --> 00:10:54.286
of all the beautiful places
in America

00:10:54.286 --> 00:10:57.523
to make people feel patriotic
about their country.

00:10:57.523 --> 00:10:59.791
He got commissioned.

00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:01.993
It was called The Mural Project.

00:11:01.993 --> 00:11:04.263
He bought this car,
which he called Helios

00:11:04.263 --> 00:11:05.798
and he...instead of...

00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:09.067
He turned in the burro
for the car

00:11:09.067 --> 00:11:12.404
and got the large format
8x10 camera

00:11:12.404 --> 00:11:15.707
and did a lot of the pictures
that he's really famous for.

00:11:15.707 --> 00:11:18.443
In some ways they're
a grander scope, I think,

00:11:18.443 --> 00:11:19.978
than the earlier work.

00:11:19.978 --> 00:11:22.915
He also got a
Guggenheim fellowship

00:11:22.915 --> 00:11:26.052
to photograph the
National Parks.

00:11:26.052 --> 00:11:28.454
Mount McKinley.

00:11:28.454 --> 00:11:30.489
Probably one of his more
famous,

00:11:30.489 --> 00:11:34.226
Clearing Winter Storm
in Yosemite.

00:11:34.226 --> 00:11:36.629
So, I'll kind of move
to the third part

00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:38.130
to show you some
of my early work.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:41.500
This was a picture
that I took in 1975.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.671
I took a photo class when I was
a senior in high school

00:11:45.671 --> 00:11:47.506
and I had a really good

00:11:47.506 --> 00:11:49.842
photography teacher
and we actually went

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:52.578
on a field trip up to
Yosemite and this was,

00:11:52.578 --> 00:11:55.581
really, one of my
first pictures.

00:11:55.581 --> 00:11:56.749
It was taken ...

00:11:56.749 --> 00:12:00.952
I had bought a 4 by 5
camera with black and white.

00:12:00.952 --> 00:12:03.222
I went to Death Valley
because that was

00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:06.558
another one of Ansel Adams'
favorite hang outs.

00:12:06.558 --> 00:12:09.461
This one's sort of a
detail that I tried.

00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:12.364
I look at these pictures,
they're not anything

00:12:12.364 --> 00:12:15.400
that I've sold or
think are my best work,

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.303
but it really makes
me feel that this was

00:12:17.303 --> 00:12:20.839
the type of work that
I was originally drawn to.

00:12:20.839 --> 00:12:24.943
The landscape of the Western US.

00:12:24.943 --> 00:12:28.447
So what I did, sort of naively,

00:12:28.447 --> 00:12:31.583
I was just a first year
in college and I'd only been

00:12:31.583 --> 00:12:33.953
photographing for a year or two.

00:12:33.953 --> 00:12:37.055
I wrote to Ansel Adams
and asked if I could come

00:12:37.055 --> 00:12:39.558
show him my portfolio
up in Carmel.

00:12:39.558 --> 00:12:40.993
( audience laughter )

00:12:40.993 --> 00:12:43.095
To my surprise, he
wrote a letter back.

00:12:43.095 --> 00:12:47.165
Which, I learned that he wrote
over 100,000 letters in his life

00:12:47.165 --> 00:12:48.934
and he had a philosophy

00:12:48.934 --> 00:12:51.737
that he always answered
every letter and that

00:12:51.737 --> 00:12:55.473
anybody that wanted to come
see him could come at 5:00.

00:12:55.473 --> 00:12:57.342
He had a cocktail
hour at that time.

00:12:57.342 --> 00:12:59.578
( audience laughter )

00:12:59.578 --> 00:13:03.382
As long as he had his
drink he would talk to you.

00:13:03.382 --> 00:13:08.320
So I actually went there
and he signed my book.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.191
This was in 1977.

00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:15.794
One thing that I remember
from it succinctly

00:13:15.794 --> 00:13:18.097
was when he looked
at this picture

00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:21.734
he said that he
thought that I should
crop it differently

00:13:21.734 --> 00:13:24.669
and said that it's
real important along the edges

00:13:24.669 --> 00:13:27.205
to always have the clean edges.

00:13:27.205 --> 00:13:29.141
He said to kind of go like that.

00:13:29.141 --> 00:13:31.643
It's a very small
difference but if you look,

00:13:31.643 --> 00:13:35.380
it sort of makes it a little
cleaner along the edges.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.983
I think that's sort
of the modernism eye

00:13:37.983 --> 00:13:40.686
that he had through
all his work.

00:13:40.686 --> 00:13:44.156
Any young photographer,
you really can't go wrong

00:13:44.156 --> 00:13:45.357
learning that.

00:13:45.357 --> 00:13:47.192
It's kind of like
learning classical music

00:13:47.192 --> 00:13:50.529
or something, it's timeless.

00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:54.299
His work sort of stands
because of the way

00:13:54.299 --> 00:13:58.704
he did his compositions.

00:13:58.704 --> 00:14:03.175
What happened after that was
I went to journalism school

00:14:03.175 --> 00:14:05.945
at University of
Missouri and was selected

00:14:05.945 --> 00:14:10.582
as a summer intern and
started doing some stories

00:14:10.582 --> 00:14:12.217
for the Geographic.

00:14:12.217 --> 00:14:14.186
This was one of the first ones.

00:14:14.186 --> 00:14:17.189
It was on the California
Desert Protection Act.

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:19.792
I felt like this was
back, sort of, in the old

00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:22.227
stomping grounds of
California desert.

00:14:22.227 --> 00:14:24.363
I've trained as
a photojournalist

00:14:24.363 --> 00:14:27.532
but I've used landscape
photography a lot of stories

00:14:27.532 --> 00:14:29.834
and this is in Grand Canyon.

00:14:29.834 --> 00:14:32.437
There's not too many
journalists who's going

00:14:32.437 --> 00:14:34.873
to have a background in
landscape photography.

00:14:34.873 --> 00:14:38.343
This is a story
about Wilderness Act,

00:14:38.343 --> 00:14:40.379
the wilderness system.

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:45.984
This is up in Alaska, up in
the Tracy Arm Wilderness.

00:14:45.984 --> 00:14:48.954
This is way up in Devon Islands.

00:14:48.954 --> 00:14:50.255
Some of these people
will go up there

00:14:50.255 --> 00:14:53.558
to study about going to Mars.

00:14:53.558 --> 00:14:56.061
High elevation impact crater.

00:14:56.061 --> 00:14:59.865
One of my favorite places
down in Torres del Paine,

00:14:59.865 --> 00:15:03.368
National Park in Patagonia.

00:15:03.368 --> 00:15:06.438
Way down in Tierra Del Fuego.

00:15:06.438 --> 00:15:08.907
This was a story about
the anniversary of

00:15:08.907 --> 00:15:11.877
Darwin's expedition
on the Beagle.

00:15:11.877 --> 00:15:14.880
Darwin went to this Pia Bay.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.483
We did a story about
the 40th anniversary

00:15:18.483 --> 00:15:20.919
of the National Trail System.

00:15:20.919 --> 00:15:23.488
This was Ozark Highland Trail.

00:15:23.488 --> 00:15:27.359
And Fraser Island Australia.

00:15:27.359 --> 00:15:28.794
Finland.

00:15:28.794 --> 00:15:30.696
The Oulanka National Park.

00:15:30.696 --> 00:15:32.497
This is a moonlight,
that they call

00:15:32.497 --> 00:15:34.466
the candlelight spruce.

00:15:34.466 --> 00:15:37.669
This was actually for a
story on the carbon cycle.

00:15:37.669 --> 00:15:42.140
How the carbon and the calcium
carbonate in the shells.

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:45.544
These pictures sort of all had

00:15:45.544 --> 00:15:47.245
a journalistic side to them.

00:15:47.245 --> 00:15:50.615
This was a story about
the climate change.

00:15:50.615 --> 00:15:51.750
This was in Switzerland,

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:55.587
sort of the melting glacier
and the bathtub ring.

00:15:55.587 --> 00:15:58.357
The drying Lake Powell.

00:15:58.357 --> 00:16:02.027
Again, you can see the
bathtub ring in the desert.

00:16:02.027 --> 00:16:05.197
Called this Viking
weather because Greenland

00:16:05.197 --> 00:16:06.865
was getting warmer
and that was why

00:16:06.865 --> 00:16:08.901
the Vikings had to leave.

00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:10.836
Then it got colder.

00:16:10.836 --> 00:16:14.105
I've also used it on some
environmental stories.

00:16:14.105 --> 00:16:15.541
Story about hard rock mining.

00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:18.076
This was a superfund site.

00:16:18.076 --> 00:16:21.579
Water pollution in China.

00:16:21.579 --> 00:16:27.218
Even in a Home Depot
parking lot in Baltimore.

00:16:27.218 --> 00:16:28.720
This was, we were talking about

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.822
the nonpoint source
water pollution

00:16:30.822 --> 00:16:34.225
that runs off the parking lot
into the Chesapeake Bay.

00:16:34.225 --> 00:16:37.595
These are depleted
uranium canisters,

00:16:37.595 --> 00:16:40.766
the nuclear waste from Paducah.

00:16:40.766 --> 00:16:43.068
The oil sands.

00:16:43.068 --> 00:16:46.938
The scraping of
the Boreal forest for the oil.

00:16:46.938 --> 00:16:49.107
This is for the drought.

00:16:49.107 --> 00:16:51.409
Sort of a landscape of a marina

00:16:51.409 --> 00:16:54.145
where there's no boats
or no water.

00:16:54.145 --> 00:16:57.282
And the Yoho National Park.

00:16:57.282 --> 00:16:59.952
Just the other side of
the Rockies from Banff

00:16:59.952 --> 00:17:01.954
and Lake Louise.

00:17:01.954 --> 00:17:06.591
It's really a great park
in the Canadian Rockies.

00:17:06.591 --> 00:17:10.729
Okay so now we get sort
of to the last part.

00:17:10.729 --> 00:17:12.830
I'll just try to
explain a little bit

00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:14.900
of some of the creative process

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.703
about this story
that I went through.

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:20.205
This was the lead
picture that was

00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:22.674
in the Geographic article.

00:17:22.674 --> 00:17:24.709
I went through kind
of a lot of thought

00:17:24.709 --> 00:17:26.711
about how to do this.

00:17:26.711 --> 00:17:30.115
How to sort of do a
tribute and sort of show

00:17:30.115 --> 00:17:32.484
that I had really been
inspired by Ansel Adams

00:17:32.484 --> 00:17:35.420
but not, sort of,
copy it or not do what

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:39.691
sometimes is called "stand in
the same tripod holes as Ansel,"

00:17:39.691 --> 00:17:40.926
and stuff like that.

00:17:40.926 --> 00:17:43.528
(audience laughter)

00:17:43.528 --> 00:17:45.430
So the first thing I had
to decide was whether

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:47.398
to do it in black
and white or color.

00:17:47.398 --> 00:17:50.669
If you shoot in digital
you have a raw file

00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:52.704
and you can make it color

00:17:52.704 --> 00:17:54.172
or black and white.

00:17:54.172 --> 00:17:55.740
I really liked the way
the black and white,

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.943
the granite just seemed
to really come out

00:17:57.943 --> 00:18:02.046
much more forceful
and the sculptural qualities...

00:18:02.046 --> 00:18:05.116
To me it really was
the right way to do it.

00:18:05.116 --> 00:18:07.652
Then I still had to
kind of figure out.

00:18:07.652 --> 00:18:09.588
I didn't want to do it
exactly like Ansel Adams

00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:13.325
had shot 75 years ago.

00:18:13.325 --> 00:18:15.193
I just kind of came
up with this idea

00:18:15.193 --> 00:18:17.662
of sort of referencing
some of his pictures

00:18:17.662 --> 00:18:19.998
for people who were
real fans of his work.

00:18:19.998 --> 00:18:22.433
They could look at
it and sort of see

00:18:22.433 --> 00:18:24.302
that there was a
connection but also see

00:18:24.302 --> 00:18:27.840
that it was a little more
up to date version of it.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.475
The other thing I did
was, a lot of nature books

00:18:30.475 --> 00:18:33.078
are divided by the seasons.

00:18:33.078 --> 00:18:36.080
We decided to just do it
by the type of scenery

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.350
that you would see
if you went there.

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:40.952
Just so you'd sort of
focus on, instead of just

00:18:40.952 --> 00:18:44.455
the summer time or a
vacation, it would be like

00:18:44.455 --> 00:18:47.359
you're looking at certain
peaks or lakes and things.

00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:49.761
These are just kind of
the peaks and the lakes.

00:18:49.761 --> 00:18:51.563
This again, that's
the black and white.

00:18:51.563 --> 00:18:52.730
The Ansel Adams.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:56.268
Mount Ansel Adams.

00:18:56.268 --> 00:18:58.537
This is called Cabin Lake.

00:18:58.537 --> 00:19:00.204
This was another
one of those that,

00:19:00.204 --> 00:19:01.640
when you looked at it in color,

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.042
it was actually
taken before sunrise

00:19:04.042 --> 00:19:05.911
and it was actually
sort of flat.

00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:07.913
But when they're all the
same tone in black and white

00:19:07.913 --> 00:19:10.682
it brings out the granite.

00:19:10.682 --> 00:19:13.051
I was surprised.

00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:15.153
You can actually see
little white caps.

00:19:15.153 --> 00:19:16.989
This was up about 10,000 feet

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:20.125
so about a 30 mile
an hour wind.

00:19:20.125 --> 00:19:23.895
There's also what's called
the Sierra High Trail,

00:19:23.895 --> 00:19:26.598
it sort of follows
the John Muir Trail.

00:19:26.598 --> 00:19:29.500
It's just this 211 mile
trail through the Sierras.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.270
Someone came up with
an idea to sort of go

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:36.074
that same route but
not have any trail.

00:19:36.074 --> 00:19:40.078
So this is the part
that's called Nancy Pass

00:19:40.078 --> 00:19:43.314
and actually, with your
pack and everything,

00:19:43.314 --> 00:19:45.683
it's sort of a scramble
to get up there.

00:19:45.683 --> 00:19:49.821
But it had a nice
view of the minarets.

00:19:49.821 --> 00:19:52.924
Another thing that Ansel
Adams had, this philosophy

00:19:52.924 --> 00:19:55.960
that climbing to the top
of the mountain

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.396
you don't get the best view.

00:19:58.396 --> 00:19:59.664
And the very bottom
of the mountain

00:19:59.664 --> 00:20:01.099
you don't get the best view.

00:20:01.099 --> 00:20:02.668
You sort of get the
best view partway up.

00:20:02.668 --> 00:20:05.971
This was sort of
about a third way.

00:20:05.971 --> 00:20:09.941
Some of the meadows.

00:20:09.941 --> 00:20:12.243
These are trees that
have been pushed over

00:20:12.243 --> 00:20:14.779
by the heavy snow

00:20:14.779 --> 00:20:18.516
in a lot of avalanches
that take place.

00:20:18.516 --> 00:20:21.719
This was sort of an idea
I had of referencing

00:20:21.719 --> 00:20:23.888
back to some of Adams' work.

00:20:23.888 --> 00:20:26.691
He took pictures of
similar subject matter.

00:20:26.691 --> 00:20:28.860
This was in the water.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.695
Wilderness area is
very important

00:20:30.695 --> 00:20:34.532
for the state of California
because the watershed,

00:20:34.532 --> 00:20:38.970
one side comes
all the way down and ends up

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:41.740
being the drinking water
for Los Angeles

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:45.577
and the other side, this
is the San Joaquin River,

00:20:45.577 --> 00:20:48.046
this flows down into
the central valley

00:20:48.046 --> 00:20:52.550
and this is the water
that's used for the irrigation.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:55.153
This water ends up,
60% of it,

00:20:55.153 --> 00:20:58.957
ends up watering lawns
in Los Angeles.

00:20:58.957 --> 00:21:01.092
There's one area on
the East side

00:21:01.092 --> 00:21:03.027
and it actually started snowing.

00:21:03.027 --> 00:21:05.363
I went there for the fall colors

00:21:05.363 --> 00:21:08.366
and the fall colors
weren't even out yet.

00:21:08.366 --> 00:21:10.669
So I ended up coming
back a little bit later.

00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:12.336
This was a Sierra juniper.

00:21:12.336 --> 00:21:14.672
The largest trees
in the wilderness.

00:21:14.672 --> 00:21:16.808
This was shot by moonlight.

00:21:16.808 --> 00:21:17.975
It's the kind of picture

00:21:17.975 --> 00:21:20.778
that was really only possible
with a digital sensor.

00:21:20.778 --> 00:21:22.847
That's why I really
thought that digital

00:21:22.847 --> 00:21:26.651
was the best way to
do a story like this.

00:21:26.651 --> 00:21:29.654
Because I think if Ansel
Adams were alive now,

00:21:29.654 --> 00:21:32.724
he would be using
the latest technology.

00:21:32.724 --> 00:21:35.160
I actually always
thought of fall colors

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.130
as color photographs
but I really, more and more,

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.932
like the way they photograph
in black and white.

00:21:40.932 --> 00:21:44.503
The right side is sort
of between the orange
and the yellow

00:21:44.503 --> 00:21:47.973
you get just a slight
delineation in the print.

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:51.943
This is the creek that comes out
of Parker Lake.

00:21:51.943 --> 00:21:54.045
And I did go there
in the winter.

00:21:54.045 --> 00:21:56.681
This was actually when
I went on the fall trip.

00:21:56.681 --> 00:21:59.617
It started sleeting on
those same aspen trees.

00:21:59.617 --> 00:22:02.687
I think we were
probably the only people

00:22:02.687 --> 00:22:06.457
in the wilderness in
this time in February.

00:22:06.457 --> 00:22:09.327
We had to do what's called this

00:22:09.327 --> 00:22:12.630
all terrain skiing
which is sort of a hybrid

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:16.768
of cross country
and downhill skiing.

00:22:16.768 --> 00:22:19.503
I timed it to go
in during a storm,

00:22:19.503 --> 00:22:22.140
which turned out to be
good for photographs

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:25.544
but sort of difficult
to move around.

00:22:25.544 --> 00:22:27.545
So we saw this.

00:22:27.545 --> 00:22:30.081
This is what they call
a Sierra wave cloud.

00:22:30.081 --> 00:22:32.350
And this kind of means, "Uh oh."

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:35.386
When you see, it's
about a 50 mile an hour wind

00:22:35.386 --> 00:22:38.190
up on this Mount Lyell there.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:41.159
I could just barely stand
up, taking this picture,

00:22:41.159 --> 00:22:43.127
holding the tripod down.

00:22:43.127 --> 00:22:45.663
Then it got even worse.

00:22:45.663 --> 00:22:47.899
And then it got even
worse than that.

00:22:47.899 --> 00:22:49.300
( audience laughter )

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.536
This was about 70 mile an
hour winds and we ended up

00:22:51.536 --> 00:22:54.205
having to dig a snow cave,
which is something

00:22:54.205 --> 00:22:56.507
I had never done
and I was glad I had

00:22:56.507 --> 00:22:59.611
the people with me that
knew how to do that.

00:22:59.611 --> 00:23:02.647
We stayed in there for
2 nights and I actually

00:23:02.647 --> 00:23:05.650
just climbed out long enough
to take this picture.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.453
It was about 50 feet
away from the opening

00:23:08.453 --> 00:23:11.256
of the snow cave and
that's about all we could go

00:23:11.256 --> 00:23:14.392
it was really like
a whiteout conditions.

00:23:14.392 --> 00:23:16.394
I wanted to see what
it looked like after,

00:23:16.394 --> 00:23:19.630
so when we got back
out they hired a plane

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:23.001
and took some
pictures from the air.

00:23:23.001 --> 00:23:25.102
So, I wrote an afterwards
so I just wanted

00:23:25.102 --> 00:23:28.940
to read a little bit about that.

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:31.709
"The times we live in today
are radically different

00:23:31.709 --> 00:23:34.278
from those of the young
Ansel Adams,

00:23:34.278 --> 00:23:37.382
who photographed
the Sierra Wilderness.

00:23:37.382 --> 00:23:40.418
Times were hard
in the 1920's and 1930's.

00:23:40.418 --> 00:23:43.554
But Americans believed that
things would get better

00:23:43.554 --> 00:23:45.723
and progress would come.

00:23:45.723 --> 00:23:47.592
Technology was seen as a way

00:23:47.592 --> 00:23:51.029
to make life more comfortable
and exciting.

00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:52.930
Artists devoted to modernism

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:56.501
focused on form
as the ultimate expression.

00:23:56.501 --> 00:23:59.170
Alfred Stieglitz summed
it up by saying that,

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:02.440
'Art should be
the affirmation of life.'

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.809
Adams agreed
and he also believed

00:24:04.809 --> 00:24:08.846
that man could live
in harmony with nature.

00:24:08.846 --> 00:24:10.882
So what are we
to make of Ansel Adams

00:24:10.882 --> 00:24:13.418
in our era of cynicism?

00:24:13.418 --> 00:24:14.985
Does it still hold true

00:24:14.985 --> 00:24:18.756
that art and nature
can be inspirational?

00:24:18.756 --> 00:24:21.459
I believe there will
always be the human need

00:24:21.459 --> 00:24:24.830
for affirmation and inspiration
of the kind

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:29.234
immortalized by Adams
in his Sierra photographs.

00:24:29.234 --> 00:24:32.070
Our spirits,
our own inner beauty,

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:35.506
spring from the same source
as these rocks, trees,

00:24:35.506 --> 00:24:38.009
and reflecting waters.

00:24:38.009 --> 00:24:40.744
It has not even been a century
since Ansel Adams

00:24:40.744 --> 00:24:43.447
carried his camera on a burro

00:24:43.447 --> 00:24:47.251
along the trails of
the Sierra High Country.

00:24:47.251 --> 00:24:48.853
In the world of nature,

00:24:48.853 --> 00:24:50.822
that was only yesterday."

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:53.591
Thank you.

00:24:53.591 --> 00:24:56.561
( audience applause )

00:24:56.561 --> 00:25:13.845
( music )
