DON DODGE: Hi.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.910
I'm Don Dodge, and this is
"Google Root Access," the show

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.030
for startups.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.170
Today, we're going to talk about
social design patterns

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.510
and how you can build your
application to elicit the kind

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.380
of emotional response that
you're looking for.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.970
I have a special guest,
Nazmul Idris.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.240
Nazmul is a developer advocate
for Google and focused on

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.250
Android, and specifically,
user experience.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.170
Welcome, Naz.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.880
NAZMUL IDRIS: Thank you.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.610
DON DODGE: So last time, we
talked a little bit about user

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.770
experience and design, and we
touched briefly on social

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.430
design experiences
and patterns.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.840
So let's go a little deeper
on that today.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.720
So what do you mean by social
design patterns, and

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.750
how does that work?

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.980
NAZMUL IDRIS: So as applications
evolve over time,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.390
and the expectations
that users have of

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.610
applications change--

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.750
like, if you consider there's
hundreds and hundreds of

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.890
thousands of applications
in the app stores today.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.250
In order to deliver a more
compelling experience, it's

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.580
important not just to deliver a
set of features but also to

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.870
use your portable identity to
make the user feel at home in

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.130
your application.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.480
Not only that, but also use
the information in your

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.130
Circles to actually make them
feel like they're not alone in

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.200
your application.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.190
So those two things are, in my
opinion, as time progresses,

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.000
going to be a requirement for
most applications to have.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.010
So for example, let's say I've
downloaded this awesome game.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.070
And it's a multiplayer game.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.830
I could play it by myself,
which is interesting.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.630
But if it's multiplayer, and
I'm signed in, and you're

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.540
signed, and we're in each
other's Circles, then it might

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.870
say, hey, would you like
to play a game of

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:41.910
whatever with Don?

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:42.840
It's like, yeah, sure.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.240
So those are the kind of
engagements that would not

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.950
happen without taking into
account the social connections

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.760
that people have.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.910
So there's a couple barriers
to entry, typically.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.460
And that is that, when an
application is asking someone

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.670
for something as precious as
their identity, people tend to

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.720
be skeptical.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.570
So it's really important for
applications or application

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.720
developers to tell the user,
first of all, why they need to

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.200
sign in and what benefits it
will unlock, and also do it at

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.770
the right time.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.630
Like once they've gotten in-- in
this example of the game, I

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.640
need to play the game by myself
for a little bit to see

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.910
that even like it and if I
want to engage further.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.300
Then it should tell me, hey,
if you sign in, you

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.650
could play with Don.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.630
Well, actually, it wouldn't
know that you are in there

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.390
unless I sign in.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.140
But it could say something
like, if you sign in, you

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.050
could play with your friends.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.525
And if I sign in, it's like,
hey, would you like

00:02:31.525 --> 00:02:32.550
to play with Don?

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.780
That is a much better flow,
if you will, for that

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.740
application.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.530
DON DODGE: So you mentioned
the creepy factor once.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.930
So people who have social
applications generally believe

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.780
that, OK, I'm going to interact
with friends.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.620
But you mentioned the creepy
factor where the app knows

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.230
things about you before you
really get into it.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.550
So how do you navigate that line
between being progressive

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.310
disclosure and the
creepy factor?

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.620
NAZMUL IDRIS: So all good
intentions can be perceived

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.910
negatively if they're not framed
in the correct context.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.260
And so something that is an
amazing feature, which is a

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.010
very deep integration with
something, the user can

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.020
perceive it to be creepy.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.470
And so it's really
important to--

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.120
the progressive disclosure
is key.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.360
You want the user to become
familiar with

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.660
the application gradually.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.000
And as they become more
and more familiar,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.040
start unlocking features.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.050
So if you had done this upfront,
if you condense that

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.560
timeline, and let's say that
you launch the application

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.590
that says, sign in
with all your

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.520
social identity providers.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.350
Your reaction is going to be,
wow, why are you trying to

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.850
steal all my information?

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.320
But if you do it slowly and
say, hey, here's the

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.760
application.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.655
Here's your first experience.

00:03:46.655 --> 00:03:47.490
It's great.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.210
If you want to do
more, sign in.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.990
Just sign in with Facebook.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.410
OK, fine.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.780
I sign in with Facebook.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.475
I'm actually enjoying the
application, and it says, hey,

00:03:55.475 --> 00:03:57.970
if you would like to bring in
friends from other social

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.350
networks, feel free to do so.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.400
And then you're like, OK, I'll
link it to my Google+ account.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.890
I'll link it to whatever
other--

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.880
like I can link it to my GitHub
account, my LinkedIn

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.570
account, my Twitter account.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.330
And then if that starts
unlocking really, really cool,

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.520
amazing experiences for
this application--

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.100
because now the number of people
I can interact with has

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.450
now increased, which is adding
value to me and how I

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.579
experience this thing--

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:21.610
it's no longer creepy.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.100
It's actually a value add.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.300
DON DODGE: So when you say
progressive disclosure, you

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.470
mean that in terms of if you
have lots of features,

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.570
disclose the easy ones first and
get them engaged and get

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.260
an experience going before
you get into the

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.470
deep and complex features.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.740
But you also mean, in the social
context, when you ask

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.660
for the account creation and
what information you ask for--

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.260
so progressively do that.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.240
Not all up front.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.060
NAZMUL IDRIS: Exactly.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.120
Because if you do it
all up front--

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.900
because as humans, we all have
emotional reactions to things.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.580
We're just a bag of sensors,
and how information is

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.730
collected by those sensors is
how we perceive things.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.620
So even if you're doing the same
number of things over a

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.420
period of time, the
timing matters.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.960
And it's not just with
applications.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.210
It matters with just about
any human interaction.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.070
If you consider, like, dating.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.950
If you do the wrong things at
the wrong times, the outcomes

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:20.660
will be very different.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.750
Even though if you look at it
over a period of time, it's

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.500
like, hey, I have, like, 10
actions I've done, and the

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.940
outcome was good.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.840
But the timing in which and the
sequence in which you did

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.910
them was critical.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.530
And so application developers
really need to think about the

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:40.030
human element that is half
of the context of the

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.490
interaction.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.250
So the human element is
interacting with the software,

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.510
or the digital stuff.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.160
And so the digital stuff has
to understand how the human

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.450
element is going to react in
order to deliver a good

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:54.510
experience versus a bad one.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.570
So the number of features
might be the same.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.640
The outcomes might be the
same, ultimately.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.880
But how I perceive it determines
greatly what the

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.465
outcome is.

00:06:04.465 --> 00:06:07.620
DON DODGE: Is it possible to
know the sequence in advance?

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.810
Is it possible to model
all of this out

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.230
before you start building?

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.720
Or do you need user experience,
like baby users,

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.710
to figure it out?

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.020
NAZMUL IDRIS: I think that you
can make certain guesses,

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.950
because we've talked about use
cases and personas and so on.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:20.760
But those are guesses.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.000
I mean, they are models
of things.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.480
You could create prototypes.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.880
Once you create the prototypes,
you have to get it

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.680
in front of users and
get them to test it.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.830
There's no substitute
for user testing.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.670
And then prototyping
is critical.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.200
So you roll out a prototype.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.410
You do some user testing
very rapidly.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.890
You get your feedback, and
then you iterate that.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.840
If you do not adopt that lean
model, it's very, very

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.980
difficult to take into account
the human element, because the

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.800
human element is, by its very
nature, complicated.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.990
DON DODGE: So the key points--

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:54.530
progressive disclosure, getting
features out there in

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.040
progress, and user experience
design.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.150
Try to do as much of that
up front as possible.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.540
NAZMUL IDRIS: Exactly.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.810
And user testing.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:02.380
DON DODGE: Excellent.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.720
Well, thank you very much.
