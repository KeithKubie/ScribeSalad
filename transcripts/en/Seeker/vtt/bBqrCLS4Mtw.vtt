00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.260
I’m the one they call Doctor Feelgood.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.270
I’m gonna make you feel alright.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.359
By teaching you how to swallow pills.

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:15.129
If you’re anything like my lovely and beautiful
and talented wife, you probably have a very

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.590
hard time putting medication into your body
because it’s borderline physically unbearable

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.100
for you to swallow pills.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.320
It’s seriously a 5 minute journey of frustration
and sadness even when my wife is ingesting

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.200
something as tiny as a tylenol.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.250
And she’s not alone.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.680
Studies suggest 1 in 3 people experience difficulty
when tasked with swallowing oral medications

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.630
in pill and capsule form, which ultimately
leads to many people skipping out on vital

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.580
doses of prescription medication because they
simply don’t want to expose themselves to

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.250
the literal pain of popping pills.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.500
That’s not good and that’s why researchers
from the University of Heidelberg, in Germany,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.910
rounded up 143 patients and subjected them
to some pill swallowing tests.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.590
They had them gulping down all sorts of shapes
and sizes and they did so to try and identify

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.260
the best methods for getting the good stuff
down the gullet.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.879
And they found that there is a best way to
swallow capsules and a different best way

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.500
to swallow tablets.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.340
And each method directly correlates with the
density of the pills compared to water.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.620
So, let’s say you’re rocking some pretty
gnarly allergies and you need to down an anti-histamine

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.620
capsule.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.710
With capsules, the research team discovered
that the “lean-forward” technique is the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.970
most efficient and is 88% more effective than
old-school methods.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.180
Allow me to demonstrate.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.729
You’ll need your drugs, I’m using a tic
tac, and 20ml of water, which is somewheres

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.070
around a tablespoon.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.120
You simply place the capsule on your tongue,
take a sip of water, don’t swallow yet,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.170
first, you lean forward by tilting your chin
toward your chest, and then swallow.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:51.160
(Do it) Yum.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.510
Because the density of a capsule tends to
be lower than water, your head position keeps

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.979
the little bugger from swimming around in
your mouth before it’s journey down to tum

00:01:58.979 --> 00:01:59.979
tum town.

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.409
Tablets tend to be more dense than water so
a different technique is required to basically

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.110
help shoot the dang things down your throat.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.810
It’s called the pop-bottle method.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.529
So lets say you get your daily vitamins like
the rest of us and you’re tasked with swallowing

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:13.090
a horse pill every single day.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.040
You simply find a flexible pop-bottle like
container, fill it with water, pop the horse

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.409
pill into your mouth, and then tightly wrap
your lips around the opening of your bottle

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:25.060
like you’re giving it the good loving, and
then without letting air seep into the bottle,

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.590
maintain firm lip-to-bottle contact and use
a sucking motion to flush the tablet into

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.580
your body.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:42.499
(Do it) If you’re doing it right, you should
feel the bottle slightly collapse into itself.

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:46.840
Now, both these methods were tested against
simply taking a sip of water and swallowing,

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.420
something that most people do I assume, and
the patients pill-swallow rate greatly increased

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.829
when utilizing the pop-bottle and lean forward
techniques.

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.129
So, if you’re one of the 1 in 3 plagued
with an inability to swallow pills, give these

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.389
methods a shot.

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.280
They just might cure what ails you.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.090
I’m Dr. Joe Bereta and I just insulted all
the doctors of the world by calling myself

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.090
a doctor.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.090
I’m sorry.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.530
