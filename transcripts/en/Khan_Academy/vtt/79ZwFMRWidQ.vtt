00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:08.285
Problem number 15, and we
have two triangles.

00:00:08.285 --> 00:00:13.350
So let's see, we have one
triangle here, one

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.600
triangle like this.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.490
We have another triangle that
looks fairly similar.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.760
I don't know if they actually
are similar.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.350
I haven't read the
problem yet.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.390
At least in the drawing, they've
drawn them to look

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.710
fairly similar.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.360
Then they tell us that
this is triangle ABC.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.830
This is triangle DEF.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.400
We know that this is 8.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.390
This is 5.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.780
This is x degrees.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.720
This is also x degrees.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.860
This is 5.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.000
Then they tell us that this
is y degrees, and

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.020
that this is y degrees.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.860
Now let's read the problem.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:11.680
If y is equal to 60 in triangle
DEF above, how much

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.310
greater is the perimeter of ABC
than the perimeter of DEF?

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:29.370
So y is equal to 60, right?

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.770
So what is this angle up here?

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.060
Well if we know that these two
are the base angles-- well

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.240
actually, we know 60, 60.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.770
So what's this top angle
going to be?

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.320
Well this is an equilateral
triangle, right?

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.250
This also has to
be equal to 60.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.010
My brain's malfunctioning.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.490
So if all the angles are the
same, then all the sides are

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.890
the same as well, right?

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.700
It's 5 and 5.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.235
That's an equilateral
triangle.

00:01:55.235 --> 00:02:00.650
Then the perimeter is 5
plus 5 plus 5, is 15.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.550
This problem, we don't know the
x angles, but we know that

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.180
they're equal.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.770
So if these two base angles
are equal-- we know from

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.669
geometry class that,
of course-- the

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:11.700
sides are also equal.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.380
So if this side is 8,
this side is also 8.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.520
So the perimeter here is what?

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.220
8 plus 8 is 16 plus 5 is 21.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.190
They want to know how much
greater is the perimeter of

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.770
this triangle than
this triangle?

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.230
So 21 minus 15 is 6.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.100
That is choice C.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.900
Next problem.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.360
Right?

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.610
Yeah, choice C.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.330
Problem number 16, if x and y
are positive, consecutive, odd

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:55.630
integers where y is greater than
x, which of the following

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:03.200
is equal to y squared
minus x squared?

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.510
So x and y are positive,
consecutive, odd integers, and

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.690
y is greater than x.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.480
So that means that y is
equal to x plus what?

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.020
It's equal to x plus 2.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.800
If they were consecutive just
integers, then y would be

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.910
equal to x plus 1.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.340
It would be 1 more than x.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.010
But since we know that they're
both odd, and y is the next

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.640
larger odd number-- the
difference between any two odd

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.220
numbers is 2-- so y is going
to be 2 more than x.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.540
If x is 5, then y is 7.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.600
Consecutive, odd integers,
if x is 3, y is 5.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.280
y is 2 more than x.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.790
So we know y is equal
to x plus 2.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.240
So they want us to kind of
rewrite this expression.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.370
Well we know from algebra class
we can factor this as y

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:58.810
plus x times y minus x, right?

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.970
Then what is y plus x?

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.030
Actually, we don't even
have to do this.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.440
We don't even have
to factor it.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.620
We know what y is
equal to, right?

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.660
y is equal to x plus 2.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.410
So that is equal to x plus 2
squared minus x squared.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.000
This is equal to-- we just
multiply it out-- x squared

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.110
plus 4x plus 4.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.170
That's this term.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.150
Now we minus x squared.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.350
So this cancels out with this,
and we're left with 4x plus 4,

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.810
which is choice E.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.740
Whenever I see something like
this, my first temptation is

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.610
to factor it out.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.010
You could have done it, and
then you could have

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.770
substituted it back in.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.700
But you didn't even
have to do that.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.200
Image: clear image,
invert colors.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.220
It's actually 6:30 in the
morning after Thanksgiving.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.870
You've got to appreciate
my discipline.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.660
All right, problem number 17.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.110
My wife's actually a medical
resident and she had to work

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.760
36 hours yesterday.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.170
Then she came home, essentially
passed out, missed

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.730
Thanksgiving, everything,
and then she just

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:06.500
went to work again.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.710
She has like a 12-hour
shift, it's crazy.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.690
She only has a year left and
I look forward to that.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.460
But there might be fewer
math videos once I

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.550
have my wife back.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.050
But anyway, back to Math.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.210
Problem number 17, in the xy
plane, line l passes through

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.440
the origin and is perpendicular
to the line.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:33.895
So l is perpendicular to the
line 4x plus y is equal to k,

00:05:33.895 --> 00:05:41.190
and l passes through the origin,
through 0, 0-- that's

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.340
the origin-- where
k is a constant.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:53.220
If the two lines intersect at
the point t, t plus 1, what is

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.720
the value of t?

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.920
So first of all, we
know this line is

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.120
perpendicular to this line.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.390
So what does perpendicular
tell us?

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:09.240
Perpendicular says whatever the
slope was of this line,

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.680
the slope of this line would
be the negative inverse.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.360
So let's figure out what the
slope of this line is.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.730
So we know that 4x plus
y is equal to k.

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.540
So y is equal to minus
4x plus k.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:31.160
Now this is kind of familiar,
y equals mx plus b format.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.150
So the slope of this
line is minus 4.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:38.360
The slope equals minus 4.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.730
So the slope of this
line is minus 4.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.170
So what is the slope of l?

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.870
Well l is perpendicular
to this line.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.270
So we know that l is going to
have the negative inverse of

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.130
this slope.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.330
So the negative inverse of minus
4 is-- well it'll become

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:01.840
positive, and you take
the inverse.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.520
The slope of l is 1/4.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.710
We also know that l goes
through the origin.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:11.450
So its y-intercept is 0.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.630
So we know the equation of l.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:21.030
We know that the equation of
l is y is equal to 1/4 x.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.930
We know there's no plus b,
because it goes through 0, 0.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.700
If you didn't believe me, you
can put 0, 0 in here and then

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.160
solve for b.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.960
You'll get 0 equals 0 plus b.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.180
So b is 0.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.500
But anyway, so this is l.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.070
We've solved for the
equation for l.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:41.710
Now they tell us that
we intersect--

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:42.490
where was the problem?

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:44.030
I lost track of the page--
we intersect at the

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.580
point t, t plus 1.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.490
They want to figure
out what t is.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:49.720
So when x is t, y is t plus 1.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.890
So let's see, so y is
t plus 1, so t plus

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:58.920
1 is equal to 1/4.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.170
Then, x is t.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.840
I just substituted t and
t plus 1 for x and y.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.240
Now we just solve.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.390
Let's see, if we subtract 1/4
t from both sides-- let me

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.750
finish this problem up
here-- we subtract

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.730
1/4 t from both sides.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:24.290
We get 3/4 t plus
1 is equal to 0.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.330
I just subtracted 1/4
t from this 1t.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.070
So you get 3/4 t.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.130
Subtract 1 from both sides,
you get 3/4 t is

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:33.850
equal to minus 1.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:38.650
Then you just multiply both
sides times the inverse, 4/3.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.929
So t-- this cancels out,
of course-- t is

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:44.870
equal to minus 4/3.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.620
What is my choice there?

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:47.450
Oh, there I go.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.200
Choice number A.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:49.540
I got scared.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.240
I looked at the wrong problem,
I didn't see my choice.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.630
I thought maybe I
did it wrong.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.120
Choice number A.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.490
And I will do problem 18
in the next video.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.130
I'll see you soon.
