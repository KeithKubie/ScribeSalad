00:00:00.464 --> 00:00:01.880
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.280
think about how the
opportunity cost can change

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.946
as we move from
scenario to scenario.

00:00:07.946 --> 00:00:10.070
And this is going to be
particular to this example,

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.528
but it's a phenomenon
that you will

00:00:11.528 --> 00:00:14.230
see in many economic scenarios.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.030
So let's say we're
starting off in Scenario F.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.210
We are vegetarians.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.230
We are only getting berries.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.620
We are not spending any
time going after rabbits.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.450
But now we're starting to,
I guess, crave protein.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.210
And we say, well, what is
going to be the opportunity

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.920
cost if I go for
that extra rabbit?

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.740
If I go for that extra rabbit,
then what's going to happen?

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.850
Well, I'm going to have to stay
on my production possibilities

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.790
frontier.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.680
And so I'm going to
move to Scenario E.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.200
So if I go after that
one extra rabbit,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.990
I'm going to give up 20 berries.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.959
So my opportunity
cost in Scenario F,

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:52.500
sitting in Scenario
F, of going after

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.430
that 1 rabbit is 20 berries.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.990
Now let's keep going.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.060
What happens if
I'm in Scenario E?

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.020
I'm already, on
average, eating 1 rabbit

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.610
or finding 1 rabbit a day.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.620
And I want to go
to 2 rabbits a day.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.930
What am I going to give up?

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.680
Let me do that in
that same color.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.430
What will I give up?

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.540
Well, now I am going
to give up 40 berries.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.210
This is interesting.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.470
Now let's say
we're in Scenario D

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.970
and we want even more rabbits.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.660
We're really starting to
become carnivores now.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.290
What am I going to give up?

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.730
Well, I'm going to
give up 60 berries.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.580
If I'm able to get 3 rabbits,
every day, on average then

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.750
I'm only going to get 180
berries now instead of 240.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.310
And let's just keep going.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.270
So if I want yet another
rabbit every day,

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.060
then I'm going to have
to give up 80 berries.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.760
And then finally, just to
feel some sense of completion,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.950
if I become a complete
carnivore and if I

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.840
want to get on average,
5 rabbits a day,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.240
I'm going to have to give
up another 100 berries

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.260
and go to not having
any berries at all.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.300
And so you might see
something interesting.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.400
The more squirrels--
sorry, not squirrels

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.770
although I guess they're
similar-- the more rabbits

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.690
that I'm going
after, every time I

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.550
try to go after another
incremental rabbit I'm

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.790
giving up more and more berries.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.640
My opportunity
cost is increasing.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.330
And so this phenomenon,
it's not always the case

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.770
but it's the case in this
example, increasing opportunity

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:21.270
cost.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.190
Increasing
opportunity cost as we

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.300
increase the number of
rabbits we're going after.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.716
And you could do
it the other way.

00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:32.882
You could say, OK,
as we increase--

00:02:32.882 --> 00:02:34.590
especially if you did
it on a unit basis,

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.290
if you said every incremental
berry or every incremental 100

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.870
berries we're going after,
but the numbers aren't as easy

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.244
right over here--
you'll actually

00:02:42.244 --> 00:02:44.070
see something going
the other way.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.850
But the question, an interesting
question is, OK, Sal.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.530
You set up the numbers like
this earlier two videos ago.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.220
But why would this make sense?

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.780
Why is this idea of
increasing opportunity

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.840
cost showing up in a lot
of different economic,

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.860
and you can call this
an economic model.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.420
We have simplified our economic
reality, the choices that we

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.410
have to make, down
to two variables

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.380
the number of rabbits
we have to go after

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.580
or the number of berries.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.030
But why does this show
up in economic models?

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.910
And just to be clear, it does
not show up in all of them.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.420
But to think about our
example, as a hunter gatherer,

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.550
we started here in
Scenario F. In Scenario F,

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.870
we've decided to not
pursue any rabbits.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.280
Even the slower,
not so quick witted

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.560
rabbit who maybe likes to hang
out with you, next to you,

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.480
and it likes to play with your
spears or your bow and arrow--

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.660
you are not even going
after that rabbit.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.050
Instead you are choosing
to spend all of your time

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.294
on the berries.

00:03:41.294 --> 00:03:42.960
And not only are you
getting, literally,

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.170
the low hanging fruit,
the easy berries,

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.352
you're getting the
berries that are further

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:49.810
up the bush, the berries that
you have to get cut by thorns

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.470
to get, the berries that you
have to climb trees to get.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.470
So you're getting even
hard to get berries

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.900
and you're not going after
even easy to get rabbits.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.400
But now all of a
sudden if you say,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.858
well, you know, that rabbit
who's been hanging out with me,

00:04:01.858 --> 00:04:03.690
he's been kind of asking for it.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.280
And so that was
very easy to get.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.840
It didn't take much
time on a given day

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.870
to get those really easy rabbits
who like to hang out with you.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.770
You're not give a lot
in terms of berries.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.350
One, it didn't take you much
time to get those, literally,

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.832
those slow and maybe less
quick witted rabbits.

00:04:21.832 --> 00:04:23.540
And you're giving up,
in that same amount

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.540
of time, the very
hard to get berries.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.970
So you're only going to
give up about 20 of them.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.030
Now if you want to
2 rabbits a day,

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.810
not only are you going to get
the slowest of the rabbits,

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.393
the ones that aren't
afraid of humans,

00:04:36.393 --> 00:04:38.900
now you're going to have go get
the slightly faster rabbit--

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.060
the slightly faster rabbit, who
wants to die a little bit less

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.870
and is maybe a
little bit sharper.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.430
And you're now not
giving up the berries

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.047
that are way up in the tree and
that are protected by thorns.

00:04:50.047 --> 00:04:52.380
You're giving up berries that
are closer down the trees.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.296
So this is going to take
you a little bit more

00:04:54.296 --> 00:04:55.930
time to do than this
right over here.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.596
And in that little
bit more time, you're

00:04:57.596 --> 00:05:00.392
also giving up berries
that were easier to get.

00:05:00.392 --> 00:05:02.600
And so this phenomenon is
going to happen all the way

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.390
until in this scenario we're
trying to get 5 rabbits a day.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.260
You are literally going after
the quickest and the smartest

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.960
rabbits.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.400
But you insist on going for
them and in your pursuit

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.807
of these quick, fast rabbits
you're even ignoring berries.

00:05:14.807 --> 00:05:16.640
You're literally, like,
stepping on berries.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.973
You're not eating the berries
that are right next to you

00:05:18.973 --> 00:05:21.892
because you're so obsessed
with eating rabbits.

00:05:21.892 --> 00:05:23.350
So hopefully that
gives you a sense

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.360
of why increasing opportunity
cost does show up.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.500
And when you graphically show
it in terms of a production

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.450
possibilities frontier, it shows
up in this bow-shaped curve.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.140
And you can see it, because
as we go from this point

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.630
to this point, you see
that as we increase one

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.380
the slope, the negative
slope, is increasing.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.380
Or another way to think
about, in Scenario F,

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.247
the slope is roughly like this.

00:05:48.247 --> 00:05:50.330
And I encourage you to
review the algebra playlist

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.180
if the idea of slope
is confusing to you.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.984
But at F, the
slope is like that.

00:05:56.984 --> 00:05:59.400
I'm drawing the slope of the
tangent line right over here.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.070
At E it gets even steeper.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:07.040
You're giving up even more of
the berries per unit rabbit.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.751
And now in D you're
giving up even more.

00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:10.250
And then you're
giving up even more.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.030
And so whenever you
see a bow-shaped curve

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.820
like this, so a curve that
literally looks like this,

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.630
this shows that you have
increasing opportunity costs.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.651
As you increase
more and more units,

00:06:20.651 --> 00:06:22.150
you're going to
have to give up more

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.672
and more of the alternative.
