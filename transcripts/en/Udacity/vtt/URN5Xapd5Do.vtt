00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.230
So when you're looking for a web API,
it's a lot like looking for

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.780
any other framework that you
might bring into your code.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.677
You want to see if it's well supported,
when was it last updated.

00:00:08.677 --> 00:00:12.131
If it's a GitHub project,
you can see when the last commit was.

00:00:12.131 --> 00:00:15.904
If there's people that are making pull
requests, if it's actively used by other

00:00:15.904 --> 00:00:19.347
developers, all these things would be
great signs that this API outside of

00:00:19.347 --> 00:00:21.496
what it's functionally
doing is a good call.

00:00:21.496 --> 00:00:25.258
And then you want to make sure of course
that it can do what you need it to do.

00:00:25.258 --> 00:00:28.519
And testing around with it, playing
with it, you could play with a couple

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.009
different options and find one that
works, and that's how I choose web APIs.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.140
That's the same way that
I choose frameworks.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.250
&gt;&gt; So for finding and

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.440
vetting libraries, I tend to
first go to the Apple libraries.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.860
They tend to be much
better documented and

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.100
more highly optimized for the hardware
that you're working on in iOS.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.894
One of the libraries that
I first investigated for

00:00:53.894 --> 00:00:58.433
a video player app was
the MPMoviePlayerController,

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:04.665
which is a simple implementation of
a view controller for playing a video.

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:07.718
It's very quick and
easy to get up and running, but

00:01:07.718 --> 00:01:11.180
it doesn't really provide anything else.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.346
I wanted more features that I could add.

00:01:14.346 --> 00:01:15.909
I wanted a new interface.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.680
I wanted to be able to play
with the video even more.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.199
So I looked even further, and
Apple provides the AVFoundation library,

00:01:26.199 --> 00:01:31.540
which allows audio, video,
audio-synthesizing, video effects,

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.810
all these different tools that
MPMoviePlayerControllers don't provide.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.220
And they allow you to create

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.030
a much more rich user experience for
the people using your app.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.370
I used this on an app at
a previous company, and

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.900
it allowed us to create this user
interface that was unique to our app,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.600
that you can't find anywhere else.
