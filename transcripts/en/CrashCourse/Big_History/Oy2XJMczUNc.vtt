Hi, I'm John Green, welcome to Crash Course
Big History. Today, we're gonna be talking

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:09.080
about the spread of human foragers across
the world and the start of the agrarian era.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.780
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Didn't we study all
that agrarian stuff in World History, because

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.050
I'm a very busy person, I don't wanna do it
again.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.880
Yeah, a couple things, Me From the Past, first
off, playing Zelda alone in your basement

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.029
does not constitute being busy. Also, in Crash
Course World History, we zoomed through a

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.269
lot of this stuff, because we wanted to get
to, like, the real history-ish parts of history,

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.220
you know, the parts with the funny hats and
the Mongols. [Mongoltage]

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.820
But if it weren't for agriculture and the
surpluses that came with it, we never would

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.540
have had funny hats. That's why we study Big
History.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:47.880
[Theme Music]

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.160
So as mentioned last week, humans anatomically
similar to us have been around for about 200

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.990
or 250 thousand years. Like, here's a picture
of one of the oldest known fossil remains

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:04.499
of our species from Ethiopia, dated to approximately
195,000 years ago. For the vast, vast majority

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:10.979
of our existence, homo sapiens were hunter-gatherers,
like farming, civilization, modernity, all

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.149
of that happened in the last 10-15,000 years.
And you'll remember that the eruption of Mount

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:22.479
Toba about 74,000 years ago reduced the human
population to a few thousand, and that scrappy

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.909
group of survivors held on, and for the next
60,000 years, human populations migrated over

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.259
the world, separating into their own little
petri dishes. And that was interesting, because

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.210
the human experiment could proceed in isolation
in several different zones in the world: the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.939
Afro-Eurasian, the Americas, Australasia,
and the Pacific. And this was really useful,

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.149
because it allowed each of those world zones
to develop their own distinct brand of football,

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.799
which makes for such a beautiful game today,
apparently there was no football back then.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.959
Really? What did they do all day?

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.880
Apparently they were hunting and gathering.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.480
Okay, so by 11,000 years ago, the human population
had recovered from the Mount Toba disaster

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.509
and grown to about 6 to 8 million people.
Now, because foraging requires humans to constantly

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.280
move on to new ecosystems to find food while
the old ones regrow and replenish themselves,

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.180
6 to 8 million is about the largest population of foragers
that the entire surface of the earth could support.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.640
Now you may remember in the very first episode
of Crash Course World History we talked about

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.959
the mystery of why humans developed agriculture
even though foraging is easier. One theory

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.260
involves so-called Gardens of Eden, where
the warming climate of the earth created some

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.260
lush ecosystems with enough food for foragers to
quit migrating and settle down for several generations.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.260
The Natufians of what later became the
Fertile Crescent in the middle east hunted

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.640
gazelles and fished and harvested wild grains,
but they weren't really farmers. But then

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.840
after a few generations of vigorous population
growth, food started to grow scarce in these

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.430
Gardens of Eden. Given their new relatively sedentary
lifestyle, those humans may have forgotten

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.140
how to forage effectively. Also, surrounding
areas may have been already overpopulated

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.250
with other foragers. So humans had to choose
between starving to death and getting more

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.380
out of the land that they were currently on --
a choice that historically we make by trying not to die.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.700
These humans already had a deep knowledge
of plants and animals, and if you've got

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.760
organisms nearby that might be useful to domesticate
like wheat or goats or wild pigs - bingo, agriculture!

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.180
Now of course there are also many other theories
about why agriculture emerged around the world

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.629
but regardless, agriculture represents a massive
shift in human activity. Hunter-gatherers

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:33.000
adapted themselves to the resources provided
by the environment, right? But agriculturalists

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.600
increasingly adapted the environment to suit their
needs. Forcing the environment to adapt to humans

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.879
became an increasingly big deal until, you know,
like today when it is arguably the biggest deal of all.

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.359
Now, all that being said, the advent of agriculture
didn't, like, immediately lead to wars and

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:57.030
cities and kings and funny hats. In fact another
5000 years would pass before the first states

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.840
emerged. So for the first half of the agrarian
era, humans lived in a world of villages with

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.220
transient herders and foragers in the gaps
between.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.719
Giving up foraging and settling down did have
some downsides in the form of backbreaking

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:14.530
labor and diseases moving easily among denser
and more numerous populations, but farming

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.840
allowed humans to support a much larger number
of people within a much smaller land area

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.419
than foraging. This was very good for collective
learning, which relies on both the number

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.060
of potential innovators and the close connectivity
between them. The world population had grown

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.860
from roughly 6 million people at the beginning
of agriculture to 50 million by the emergence

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:39.060
of states 5000 years ago - roughly 5000 times
the size of the population that survived the

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.819
Mount Toba disaster 70,000 years prior.

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:46.240
And because early farmers didn't really understand
or have the technology to solve the problem

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.830
of pooping near the drinking water, another
upside was that we invented alcohol which

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.650
was safer to drink instead. So the next time
you see a person looking fancy with a glass

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.169
of champagne, just remember, it's a tradition
that started from there being too much poop

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.009
in the water, and ever since has fueled millions
of bad decisions.

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:07.490
States did eventually appear but not all states
emerged at once, any more than all agriculture

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.419
emerged at once. Agriculture first emerged
in the Fertile Crescent in Egypt around 11,000

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:17.090
years ago and then in east Asia and Papua
New Guinea around 9,000 years ago. Agriculture

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.889
emerged in west Africa and the Americas around
5,000 years ago, though estimates definitely

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:27.150
vary for the Americas. Accordingly, the first
states to arise were in the middle east where

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.569
agriculture first emerged, followed shortly
by the Chinese and Indus Valley Civilizations.

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:35.830
Papua New Guinea may have invented agriculture
around the same time but they never developed

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.550
enough agricultural surplus to support states.
So yeah, in every world zone the invention

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.180
of agriculture was a precursor for the rise
of states.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.050
The key to having a state is agrarian surplus.
If you produce enough food, you can have a

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.520
class of people who don't need to farm. They
can then fulfill other duties in this increasingly

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.740
numerous and complex society whether they
be leaders or judges who settle disputes,

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.600
bureaucrats who deal with administration,
and infrastructure doctors who heal the sick,

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:08.180
priests who make sacrifices to vengeful gods
or soldiers who provide security or at least

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.500
extract a portion of the agricultural surplus
for the leadership through some kind of taxation.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.910
And with more people filling new jobs and
generating new ideas about them, this is also

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:23.500
good news for collective learning. Diversification
of labor is also the first step of early states

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.879
toward hierarchies and classes - aristocrats
and popular and despotic kings and pharaohs

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:33.430
and sultans, shahs and emperors. It also
meant the first divisions into unequal, unfair,

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.660
and undemocratic hierarchies dividing man from man,
man from woman, and the high from the low.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.020
All of this brings us back to the Hobbes verses
Rousseau debate. Hobbes viewed life without

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:48.090
state control as nasty, brutish, and short,
while Rousseau viewed humanity as largely

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:53.129
egalitarian before claims to land and wealth
and property corrupted them. Now certainly

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:57.909
the idea of an Age of Innocence or a Golden
Age has been popular with many philosophers

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:01.970
and political idealists throughout history.
I mean, if humanity had once been perfect

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.740
and was simply corrupted by societal structures
or political systems, then it would take only

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:12.099
a few tweaks or reforms to get us back to
perfection. Unfortunately, it now seems clear

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:18.180
that a lot of humanity's evils are created
simply by the bad wiring of our evolutionary

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:23.580
biology, and the solution to that problem
is somewhat complicated. It's very difficult

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.050
for me to imagine a world in which humans
will say, "You know what? If the Earth can

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:32.050
only support 6-8 million foragers, then there
should only be 6-8 million of us." So where

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:38.199
you stand on this Hobbes v. Rousseau question
affects your view of the entire 250,000 years

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:44.479
of human history, and also your view about
much of human morality, character, and potential.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.259
Another Big History take on agriculture is
this: Consider the sun. We are made up of

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:53.840
the leftovers of its formation and the debris
of stars that came before it, but its role

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.400
in our history doesn't stop there. Fusion
reactions happen in the sun's core. This generates

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.319
energy, which is released into space and takes
approximately eight minutes to get to us.

00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:07.289
Here on Earth, plants capture that energy
and store it via photosynthesis. Agriculture

00:08:07.289 --> 00:08:13.199
lets one species, us, harness more of that
energy, we either eat it or we use it to feed

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:18.499
animals that we eat, or we use it to feed animals
like horses and oxen that pull carts and carry burdens,

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:23.640
providing 500-750 watts of power, about 10
times more than what a human being could do.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.639
So essentially, agriculture is the act of
harnessing more energy from the sun, way more

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:32.319
than we could as foragers. All of this leads
to an interesting perspective: human history

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.040
has frequently been viewed as too chaotic
or complex to allow us to find an underlying

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:40.729
trend, a bottom line or overarching theme.
And this to some people makes conventional

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:46.549
history differ greatly from the natural sciences.
However, given what we know of energy and

00:08:46.549 --> 00:08:51.200
complexity, consider the following: If we
want to prevent our bodily complexity, as

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.510
well as the complexity that we have created,
from descending into chaos, we must keep harvesting

00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:01.420
matter and energy flows on a regular basis.
This is the bottom line of human history.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:05.580
I will therefore argue that during most, if
not all, of human history, the quest for sufficient

00:09:05.589 --> 00:09:09.729
matter and energy to survive and reproduce
has been the overriding theme.

00:09:09.729 --> 00:09:12.960
That doesn't mean that the bottom line is
all there is to human history. You've got

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:17.050
political history and the history of warfare
and gender history, class history, art history,

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:22.019
environmental history, oral traditions, creation
myths, and much, much more, but none of those

00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:27.160
would matter if we were all dead. If you don't
eat, if you don't drink, you die. Much of

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.769
the collective learning, invention, shifts
in social structure, have been geared toward

00:09:31.769 --> 00:09:36.540
coping with the problem of energy flows as
the population continued to expand by leaps

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:42.839
and bounds, from a tiny 10,000 people 74,000
years ago to over 7 billion people today.

00:09:42.839 --> 00:09:47.180
So the beautiful thing about being able to
remember and accumulate the ideas of your

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:52.839
ancestors is that some of their ideas are
great for agriculture, also other things,

00:09:52.839 --> 00:09:57.440
but mostly food. Whether it's new forms of
irrigation invented in ancient Mesopotamia

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:03.209
or the four-crop rotation that gradually proliferated
across Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries,

00:10:03.209 --> 00:10:07.410
these innovations increased the number of
potential innovators who could exist in a

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.190
social order without starving.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:13.190
And there were also great innovative leaps
in connectivity. For instance, the invention

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:17.899
of writing in ancient states about 5,000 years
ago. Like, starting from a bureaucratic form

00:10:17.899 --> 00:10:22.940
of accounting, mostly to count livestock,
to an art, largely enjoyed by the elite, writing

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:28.120
gradually communicated more abstract and complex
ideas. And those ideas became available to

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:32.510
more and more people as more people could
read, until eventually writing became so popular

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:36.700
that these days, everyone writes books, even
some of your Crash Course Big History hosts.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:41.080
We also liked writing because it made it less
likely that things we'd learned would be forgotten,

00:10:41.089 --> 00:10:46.269
like when people started to write down what
they knew, that knowledge became set in stone.

00:10:46.269 --> 00:10:50.300
Sometimes literally! And then with the invention
of printing in China and later Korea and the

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:55.060
printing press in Europe, more writing could
be produced and circulated more quickly, and

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:59.790
often more cheaply than books copied out by
hand. All of this turned into a beneficial

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:04.810
feedback cycle, potential innovators raise
the carrying capacity of the population, more

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:09.540
people go on to produce more ideas, which
raises the carrying capacity of the population,

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:14.579
which in turn produces more potential innovators.
And we can do it all without anything bad

00:11:14.579 --> 00:11:18.099
happening to the environment. What's that?
Oh. Oh my.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:22.940
So, throughout the agrarian period, collective
learning continued to raise the carrying capacity

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:28.430
of the world. Populations grew from 6 million
10,000 years ago to 50 million by the dawn

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:34.580
of states to 120 million by 1000 BCE in the
midst of classical civilizations. By the end

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:40.780
of the agrarian era, in the beginning of the industrial
revolution, 954 million people lived on the Earth.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:45.320
But while collective learning gradually raised
the carrying capacity in the agrarian era,

00:11:45.329 --> 00:11:50.649
it did not keep pace with population growth,
and this is a significant problem with humanity.

00:11:50.649 --> 00:11:55.280
Just like any other animals in nature, we
breed until we strain the resources of our

00:11:55.289 --> 00:11:59.980
environment, so we are prone toward unsustainable
levels of overpopulation. So every two or

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:04.380
three centuries, humans would hit the carrying
capacity and then the population would recoil,

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:10.500
resulting in famine, disease, periods of in-fighting
and population decline, in every agrarian

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:15.500
civilization, from civil wars between Caesar
and Pompey, the English War of the Roses,

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:20.230
to the revolt of the Janissaries in the Ottoman
Empire, and similar events all across the

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:26.530
world, the cycles of prosperity, strain, crisis,
and civil in-fighting repeated themselves.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.400
And I do worry a little bit that when we talk
about traditional history, we don't do it

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.380
enough in the context of carrying capacity.
We are, after all, organisms, and we behave

00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:39.029
a lot like other animals on this planet. We
want there to be more of us, and we want more

00:12:39.029 --> 00:12:41.320
resources for that more of us to enjoy.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:47.410
So that broad, Big History take on the agrarian
era takes us to the Age of Exploration. Explorers,

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:52.360
including Christopher Columbus, but also many
others, united the previously isolated world

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:57.260
zones of Afro-Eurasia, the Americas, Australasia,
and the Pacific. Eventually, this combination

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:02.350
of world zones into one unified global network,
although not that unified, would produce an

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:08.170
even more astounding rise in complexity: the Modern
Revolution -- we'll talk about that next time.
