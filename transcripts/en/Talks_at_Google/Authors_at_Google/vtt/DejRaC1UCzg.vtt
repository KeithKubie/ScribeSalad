[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.143 --> 00:00:10.143
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.001
JILLY GAGNON: All right.

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:17.500
So yeah.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.800
Not the most technologically
advanced persons.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.380
When I manage to mess up
the four-button clicker,

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.190
you've been warned.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.982
So I'm Jilly.

00:00:24.982 --> 00:00:26.190
MIKE MACDONALD: And I'm Mike.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.765
JILLY GAGNON: And this is
"Choose Your Own Misery:

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:28.890
The Google Talk."

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.780
We like colons.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.509
They make things seem
much more official.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.870
So one of the things
we sort of thought

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.670
we would talk about
today-- writing a book,

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.085
it's sort of a solo
situation most of the time.

00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:42.460
And one of the things that's
kind of interesting about us

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.290
is that writing as a team.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.990
Not very many people do that.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.905
And we've been writing comedy
as a team for like, four years?

00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:51.780
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.940
I think it has been that long.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.821
I got my start off at "The
Onion," America's funnest news

00:00:56.821 --> 00:00:57.320
source.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.070
I was an editorial intern.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.290
And I wrote for
them for a few years

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.410
before I decided
that I want to write

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.150
my own try at doing this,
but doing a Canadian version.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.969
I'm in fact from
Toronto, Canada.

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:09.010
JILLY GAGNON: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.072
MIKE MACDONALD:
You're from Toronto?

00:01:10.072 --> 00:01:10.947
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:10.947 --> 00:01:12.910
MIKE MACDONALD: OK, cool.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.850
So what I did was the
first thing I had to do

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.960
is incorporate a company, and
then recruit some writers.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.690
I found Jilly's
work on a website

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.080
called "McSweeney's
Internet Tendencies."

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.860
And she wrote some
extremely funny stuff.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.250
So I reached out to her
with an email, and I said,

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.580
would you like to write for us?

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.550
And luckily, she obliged.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.300
JILLY GAGNON: Yes.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.630
I saw he sent an email.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.174
I was about to get on a plane
and it was the magic words

00:01:35.174 --> 00:01:35.840
at the very end.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.000
This was 2011.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.489
It was back in my writing
for exposure days.

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:41.530
And it was the magic words,
"we pay our writers."

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.529
And I was like, I don't
know who this person is.

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:45.750
I don't know what
satire news is.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.640
Never heard of you.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.590
But I'm so there.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.440
So I signed on.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.590
And we started doing
a satire news site.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.030
And perhaps because I have
particularly apparent OCD,

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.550
I was one of the early
enthusiastic contributors

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.626
to the website.

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:06.500
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.210
We had a lot of
great writers that

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.752
have sort of written for various
platforms in various magazines.

00:02:11.752 --> 00:02:13.960
We had thought back in the
day that we could actually

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.380
make a go out of it with
just ad impressions alone.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.150
I think the CPM saw
the clicks per 1,000

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.737
were somewhere near
$10 or whatever.

00:02:21.737 --> 00:02:22.570
And I thought that--

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.330
JILLY GAGNON: We
were gonna be rich.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.950
MIKE MACDONALD: That would
be a great source of revenue

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.340
for this media empire.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.150
Unfortunately,
some people sort of

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.232
fell off as other jobs took
part and other projects came up.

00:02:31.232 --> 00:02:32.815
But Jilly and I
really plowed through.

00:02:32.815 --> 00:02:33.729
JILLY GAGNON: Yep.

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:34.770
MIKE MACDONALD: And yeah.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.690
We were-- here are
some articles actually

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.129
that Jilly wrote for "The Smew."

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:38.920
JILLY GAGNON: Yeah.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.586
So you have to remember
it was a simpler

00:02:40.586 --> 00:02:42.880
time when our Donald Trump
was named Michele Bachmann.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.480
And you know, it was
our best efforts here.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.852
Also, Alan Thicke, anybody
who disagrees with me

00:02:49.852 --> 00:02:51.310
that he is Canada's
best celebrity,

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.540
we're going to have to
throw down, because he is

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.066
an absolute favorite of mine.

00:02:55.066 --> 00:02:56.940
And we did a whole series
of articles-- well,

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.106
I did a whole series of
articles-- and browbeat Mike

00:02:59.106 --> 00:03:01.620
into letting me run
them, which where

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.580
an increasing obsession
with Alan Thicke.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.920
I believe we sort of
ended that series on her

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.370
in the bushes outside the home.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.970
The cops.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:08.760
You know.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.830
Every week she would
write about Alan.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:11.050
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.230
We were having a
party up in Toronto.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.360
And we actually reached
out to Alan Thicke's people

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.030
in the hopes that he'd come
and grace us with a few words.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.002
Unfortunately, we
couldn't make that happen.

00:03:19.002 --> 00:03:20.460
JILLY GAGNON: We
couldn't swing it.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.740
But you can swing Alan Thicke.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.250
This is a really fun takeaway.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.480
You can hire Alan Thicke to just
hang out with you for a fee.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.290
A reasonably affordable
fee, all things considered.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.410
I mean, "Growing
Pains" was legit.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.920
So.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.150
MIKE MACDONALD: So as the
editor of this publication,

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.150
I would often get 10 to
15 different headlines.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.300
Here's some finished
headlines that we did publish.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.549
And I would sift through them.

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.330
And I would look
for what I would

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.090
think would be sort of the
funniest joke that could

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.640
be fleshed out into an article.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.710
Oftentimes one of the
writers were Americans,

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.210
so we'd have to sort of just
switch up a few pronouns

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.000
or what have you to make it
a lot more Canadian-centric.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.020
JILLY GAGNON: A lot more "yous."

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.800
MIKE MACDONALD: I think Julie
got a pretty good education

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.683
in Canadian politics by the
time that we were finished.

00:04:00.683 --> 00:04:01.960
JILLY GAGNON: And
Canadian spelling,

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.834
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah.

00:04:02.834 --> 00:04:05.675
And putting the "you" in color
and stuff like that, of course.

00:04:05.675 --> 00:04:08.807
But we wanted to hit on politics
of some evergreen ideas,

00:04:08.807 --> 00:04:10.890
as you can see with
"Scientists Weaponize Maternal

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:11.980
Disappointment."

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.129
And then we had a bunch
of op eds as well.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.920
JILLY GAGNON: But sort
of one of the things

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.519
was really interesting that
you learn really quickly

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.839
doing comedy I would say more
than any kind of writing,

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:23.870
it's a cliche to say that
you face a lot of rejection

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.461
when you write.

00:04:25.461 --> 00:04:27.710
Obviously, you face a lot
of rejection when you write.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.130
But when you write
comedy, there is--

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.130
like, no one wants to see
how a hot dog is made.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.796
But if you could see
the kinds of things

00:04:33.796 --> 00:04:37.060
that we reject for "The Smew,"
they're out of those 10 or 15

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.000
headlines that I would
send in every week,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.390
the other 20 writers would
be sending in every week,

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.550
each writer might
get one or two.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.190
And that's us.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.080
We weren't "The Onion."

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.710
They might have 100 headlines.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.020
And they would pick one
that they actually write up.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.260
So we sort of learned early
on as a team doing "The Smew"

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.760
that one of the
things that you have

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.350
to be willing to do in comedy
is let go and have your ego not

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.520
be so tied up in every
single joke you make,

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.140
because almost
certainly it is not

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.400
as funny as you think it is.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.460
It is rarely as funny
as you think it is.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.120
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah, exactly.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.619
I think we've all
sort of worshipped

00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:11.220
at the altar of "is this funny."

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.554
And if it's funny, we'll run it.

00:05:12.554 --> 00:05:15.011
And if it's not, then we just
put our ego aside and move on

00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:16.140
to sort of the next joke.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.390
JILLY GAGNON: So
working on "The Smew,"

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.320
it quickly became clear that
myself and one other writer

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.130
were more enthusiastic about
the "you got paid for your work"

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.430
experience than others.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.650
And over the first couple
of months it was just that.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.480
But at some point,
Mike reached out

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.440
and he said, would you
be interested in doing

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.640
other things as well?

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.720
You're enthusiastic.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.720
You're writing good articles.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.140
He and his co-founder,
Paul Metcalfe,

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.390
said, would you guys want
to write something else?

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.240
So we did.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.260
Myself and Paul Houseman, who
this book is dedicated to-- you

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
should ask him about the
frog in a blender joke.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.040
It's terrible.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.250
It's never been funny-- we
started writing other things

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.586
in addition to "The Smew."

00:05:59.586 --> 00:06:01.210
So that was going on
in the background.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.100
But we started--

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.450
These are some really
charming photos of me

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.460
in some of the sketches
we wrote as the only girl

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.461
in this group of
comedy writers, I

00:06:11.461 --> 00:06:12.960
got to sort of sub
in whenever there

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.430
was a female-- I don't
even know what I'm

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.638
doing in the right-hand side.

00:06:15.638 --> 00:06:17.520
I don't know why
I'm wearing that.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.600
But we had lighting.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.160
So it seemed really official.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.490
MIKE MACDONALD: Exactly.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:21.520
JILLY GAGNON: I
felt really special.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.394
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah.

00:06:22.394 --> 00:06:25.060
We started off with sort of
like a vignette of short videos

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.371
that we put up on the website.

00:06:26.371 --> 00:06:27.120
And the idea was--

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.050
JILLY GAGNON: Not telling
you where those live.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.299
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah, exactly.

00:06:29.299 --> 00:06:31.650
The idea was to make each
video around 30 seconds.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.270
You know, conceive of an
idea, execute it on film,

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.755
and put it up on the website.

00:06:35.755 --> 00:06:36.880
And there was a lot of fun.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.588
And then I guess from
there we progressed

00:06:38.588 --> 00:06:40.690
into writing scripts.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.150
I had a connection with
the Canadian Broadcasting

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.490
Corporation wherein I
could pitch some ideas.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.440
So we started to just
toss around ideas,

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.439
some from our own, some just
very funny premises for shows.

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:55.230
JILLY GAGNON: Yeah.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.810
MIKE MACDONALD: What
was the first thing

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:56.689
that we came up with?

00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:58.230
JILLY GAGNON: I
think the first thing

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.960
we came up with it was called
"Walbridge Preparatory."

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.850
I think this one was mine.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.530
Which was, it was somewhere
between the children

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:14.020
in "The Shining" and
some deserted island,

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.500
but a prep school.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.220
It was weird.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.549
It was a very strange idea
that I thought was comic gold.

00:07:19.549 --> 00:07:21.090
Like, everyone was
going to get this.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.780
These weirdo children in
their weirdo prep school.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.530
And you know, they're
kind of murderous.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:30.010
And understandably, Mike
went in with that one.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.210
And they said, this
isn't very broad.

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.362
This is a little specific.

00:07:35.362 --> 00:07:37.570
Probably you're not going
to get much of an audience.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.280
So we tried to get more broad.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.050
And I think the closest we got
was probably "Victory Cafe."

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:43.924
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah.

00:07:43.924 --> 00:07:46.420
That was a cafe wherein
a few people had

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.696
gone to in the afternoon, and
a zombie apocalypse broke out.

00:07:49.696 --> 00:07:50.820
JILLY GAGNON: Like it does.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:51.090
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.730
The only refuge within
the city was in this cafe.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:56.010
But of course, they wanted
to resume normal cafe life.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.180
So they'd often
leave the cafe to go

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.280
outside looking
for coffee beans,

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.630
come back, and then make
their mochas, what have you.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.255
JILLY GAGNON: Like,
why live in a world

00:08:04.255 --> 00:08:06.310
without a really awesome latte.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.260
I think that was the tag
line we came up with.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.390
So their bunker was
this cafe that they

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.750
had to defend against
all zombies at all costs.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.650
Also, unsurprisingly,
not broad enough.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:17.460
Not broad enough comedy there.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:22.860
So eventually, people sort
of got a little worn out.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.750
We wrote like four or
five different pilots.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.375
We tried to come up
with these scripts.

00:08:26.375 --> 00:08:27.950
We tried to come
up with sketches.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.060
I would go up to Toronto.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.226
Paul would go up to Toronto.

00:08:30.226 --> 00:08:31.680
We'd try to film them.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.480
But people have real lives.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.840
And working sort
of for free is--

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.840
it's hard to keep the
enthusiasm up on that when

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.360
you keep getting told "no."

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.590
So it sort of tapered
off eventually.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:46.780
And it winnowed down, I would
say, to Mike and myself.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:51.250
We sort of-- maybe we were just
completely stubborn or stupid.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.210
But we said we will
continue to do this.

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:58.545
But we did give up first
and get some office jobs.

00:08:58.545 --> 00:08:59.420
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.880
One of the benefits
of "The Smew"

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.110
was that it did get me a job at
the sort of largest newspaper

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.700
chain in Canada
called Post Media.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.700
Where I got to write a lot
of humor and a lot of comedy

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.290
as a columnist.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:12.664
You can see there working away.

00:09:12.664 --> 00:09:14.080
I don't know what
I'm doing there.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.090
Maybe writing about a soccer
game or what have you.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:16.321
JILLY GAGNON: Yeah.

00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:18.279
Watching soccer basically
is what you're doing.

00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:20.100
MIKE MACDONALD:
But after writing

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:24.030
within these sort of confines
for a large audience at Post

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.780
Media, wherein you couldn't
really say everything

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.080
that you wanted to say,
often I would come home

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.010
and I'd jump on Skype.

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:32.410
And I would then talk with
Jilly about the next idea

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:33.880
that we wanted to work on.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.756
So we were continuing
to work on scripts.

00:09:36.756 --> 00:09:38.130
Lots of times we
were writing you

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:39.770
know, op eds for
zanier publications,

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.370
and just editing
it back and forth.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:42.080
JILLY GAGNON: Contributing
jokes to "The Onion."

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:42.370
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:43.750
Writing for "The Onion" as well.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.375
JILLY GAGNON: So we
were in this habit.

00:09:45.375 --> 00:09:48.080
We would get together at
least a few times a week

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.529
on Skype, because Mike
is based in Toronto.

00:09:50.529 --> 00:09:51.570
I'm based here in Boston.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.140
So everything was done
over the internet.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.190
We met over the internet.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:57.470
The internet is for
real friendships.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.740
And once we had taken
these office jobs,

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.780
one of the themes
that quickly emerged

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.110
was how ill-suited we were
for these office jobs,

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.827
and how unhappy we were in this.

00:10:08.827 --> 00:10:10.410
Not because that
office jobs were bad.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:11.340
They were fine.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.410
They were decent jobs.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.254
But we weren't doing what
was making us passionate.

00:10:15.254 --> 00:10:16.670
We weren't going
to work every day

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:17.890
and writing comedy
for eight hours.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.680
We were going and doing somebody
else's work and somebody else's

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.480
passion.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.840
And it was draining.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.570
And we are misanthropic people.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.940
And it made us want to write
something that was totally

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.180
our own, and perhaps
influenced what

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.955
was Mike's idea at the time.

00:10:33.955 --> 00:10:35.830
We would throw each
other ideas all the time.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:37.270
And Mike came in with a few.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:38.290
I came in with a few.

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:41.030
And the one that stood
out was this idea

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.330
of "Choose Your Own Misery:
The Office Adventure."

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.640
Which you can sort of
explain your initial--

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:46.515
MIKE MACDONALD: Sure.

00:10:46.515 --> 00:10:48.510
I think we were
on Skype chatting.

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:49.709
I had three ideas.

00:10:49.709 --> 00:10:51.250
And the first two
were just terrible.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.410
And Jilly was like, eh.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.850
There's no way we're touching
either of these ideas.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.030
And then the third
idea I had was

00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:00.510
a book about a guy trying to get
through one day in an office.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:03.680
But whatever choice he takes,
whatever route he goes down,

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.140
he either gets rerouted
back to the beginning,

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.056
much in the same way you do in
real life, or you get fired.

00:11:09.056 --> 00:11:10.680
Or you get worker's
comp, or something.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.570
You can't win.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:12.754
You can't win the day.

00:11:12.754 --> 00:11:13.420
And then Jilly--

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.320
JILLY GAGNON: We thought
we were really happy.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.750
You know, like
this moment, right?

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:16.140
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:16.420
Yeah.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.250
Jilly jumped on it.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:18.740
And she's like, oh,
that's a great idea.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.073
We should totally write this up.

00:11:20.073 --> 00:11:21.917
I wasn't terribly
certain about the idea.

00:11:21.917 --> 00:11:22.750
So I gave it to her.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.360
I said, you run with this idea.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.290
If you like it,
you should do it.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:27.490
Which she did coax me into.

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:28.170
JILLY GAGNON: He's
like, it's probably

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:29.370
not-- it's probably nothing.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:30.174
So you take it.

00:11:30.174 --> 00:11:32.340
Sort of like when you're a
kid in elementary school.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.798
And you're like,
this tastes gross.

00:11:33.798 --> 00:11:35.420
You try it.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.810
That was how the book started.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:37.210
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah.

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:38.720
JILLY GAGNON: This tastes gross.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.261
MIKE MACDONALD: So I guess when
we got started with the book,

00:11:41.261 --> 00:11:43.950
I got a very interesting job
offer to go to East Africa

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.370
to work for a company called
Journals for Human Rights.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:49.019
So it was based in Dar
Es Salaam, Tanzania.

00:11:49.019 --> 00:11:50.310
We continued to write the book.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:51.580
But of course, there
was more challenges

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:52.850
that were in the way.

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:54.960
One of them being
just internet access.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.010
I'd have to go to the shop and
get an internet stick and stick

00:11:59.010 --> 00:11:59.640
it in.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.530
And I'd be sending
Jilly all these emails.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:02.680
And it would take
two or three minutes

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.990
to load up a single page.

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:05.365
JILLY GAGNON: Like
AOL circa '96.

00:12:05.365 --> 00:12:06.365
MIKE MACDONALD: Exactly.

00:12:06.365 --> 00:12:07.320
Early days of AOL.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.200
And I would say, is
this a funny idea?

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.856
Should this character take this
choice or take that choice?

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:13.980
Jilly would respond back,
how about neither choice?

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.480
What about this?

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.605
JILLY GAGNON: So we would
have these e-mail chains.

00:12:17.605 --> 00:12:19.130
And the delay on
the e-mails could

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:20.950
be several minutes at a time.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.830
It was like living in a horrible
world from 10 years ago.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:28.092
And the vast majority of
the e-mails are like, nah.

00:12:28.092 --> 00:12:28.800
That's not funny.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.300
Nope.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.169
That's not good.

00:12:30.169 --> 00:12:31.210
Oh, that is pretty funny.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:31.751
But like, no.

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:33.210
We're not doing it anyway.

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.890
So I would say while
Mike was in Tanzania,

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:38.150
the progress was fairly slow.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.667
And then luckily he came back.

00:12:39.667 --> 00:12:41.000
And we could do things on Skype.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.833
And things could move
a little more quickly.

00:12:42.833 --> 00:12:46.410
But we threw up here one of
the most difficult things

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:47.910
was the organizing of this.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:48.784
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah.

00:12:48.784 --> 00:12:51.280
Before I got back to
Canada, in Tanzania,

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.910
we didn't have a
singular document

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:54.720
to store all this
information that you're

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.190
looking at right now.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.100
So what I did was I
had Post-it notes.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.992
And I would be posting
everything in my bedroom.

00:13:00.992 --> 00:13:03.450
But the humidity is such that
they wouldn't actually stick.

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:05.630
So everything would
always fall to the ground.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.030
So my roommates would
come in and they'd

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.860
see me frantically trying
to stick everything

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.230
back up to the wall, being
like, oh, it doesn't fit here.

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.700
It looked like a scene out of
"A Beautiful Mind," or something

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:13.540
like that.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.192
But sure enough, Jilly
came up with this solution.

00:13:16.192 --> 00:13:17.690
A piece of software
called Gliffy.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.690
I'm not sure if you guys
are familiar with them.

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:21.670
I think it's used
primarily by engineers.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.159
But we started to plot
everything down here.

00:13:24.159 --> 00:13:24.950
JILLY GAGNON: Yeah.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:26.050
I mean, basically
what had happened

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:27.758
is we had been doing
this back and forth.

00:13:27.758 --> 00:13:31.120
And so choose your
adventure books,

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.300
you have different choices.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.420
And for us, we would try to
go down different threads

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:36.040
one at a time.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.170
This is where you start.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.122
And we will say, we
went to the right.

00:13:39.122 --> 00:13:40.830
So we're going to keep
going to the right

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.070
until we get to the
end of this storyline.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.160
But it quickly became
really difficult to know

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.210
where we still had
like, open ends, where

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.480
we needed to go next.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.574
You can see it's kind
of a complicated system

00:13:51.574 --> 00:13:52.490
that we ended up with.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.448
We wanted things to route
back into each other.

00:13:54.448 --> 00:13:56.500
We wanted things
to-- there was just

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.750
all kind of things we were
hoping to do with this book

00:13:58.750 --> 00:13:59.850
organizationally.

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.890
And it was not possible
to keep doing this

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.440
by emails and a document.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.450
We were like, I
think this goes here.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:08.310
So I searched for free
flow chart software.

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.247
And magically, one existed.

00:14:10.247 --> 00:14:11.330
And it worked really well.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.780
So this is probably the
ugliest-- it's probably

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.100
making engineers cringe.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.430
It's just like boxes
and like blinds.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:19.877
But it worked really well for us
to help organize our thoughts.

00:14:19.877 --> 00:14:22.210
MIKE MACDONALD: If you just
look at the chart right now,

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:25.470
actually, the boxes kind of do
tell a story within themselves.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:27.890
If you look at
all the red boxes,

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:31.070
those are boxes where in
the book you get fired,

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.361
or you're on worker's
comp or what have you.

00:14:33.361 --> 00:14:34.860
JILLY GAGNON: Then,
your story ends.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:35.230
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:35.930
Exactly.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:38.330
And then if you look
at the green boxes,

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.740
that's where you get rerouted
back to the beginning,

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.010
and you have to start again.

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.810
That's sort of Groundhog
Day, if you will.

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.280
This, of course, provided
a lot of headaches

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.150
in that consistency and
continuity were paramount

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.770
to this project, because if
you have something that happens

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.690
at the very top, you have to
make sure that you incorporate

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:58.160
that detail into
the very bottom,

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.420
regardless of all the other
previous choices you made.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.810
Well, that's difficult. That
also proved very interesting

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.140
for writing jokes,
because we could also

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.300
incorporate a lot of meta-jokes
into the book by saying

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:10.967
basically regardless
of what you choose,

00:15:10.967 --> 00:15:12.591
you're going to end
up in the same spot

00:15:12.591 --> 00:15:13.710
at the end of the day.

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:14.010
JILLY GAGNON: Yeah.

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:15.510
And the other
interesting thing is

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:17.260
in a choose your
own adventure book,

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.210
I might always start by
going left or whatever.

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:22.460
So I think I've introduced
a character here.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.220
Great.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:24.427
We've all met Debbie.

00:15:24.427 --> 00:15:25.760
You know, everyone knows Debbie.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.525
We can move on.

00:15:26.525 --> 00:15:27.150
Well, not true.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:29.570
Not everybody chooses the way
I choose, believe it or not.

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:31.660
I'm always shocked by that fact.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.200
But it's the truth.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.640
So you have to find ways
to reintroduce scenarios

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.917
that doesn't seem
redundant, but does give you

00:15:39.917 --> 00:15:42.500
enough information to grab onto,
because it's the same office,

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.458
no matter where you go.

00:15:43.458 --> 00:15:44.530
It's the same coworkers.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:46.220
It's the same meetings.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.690
You know, all of that
stuff has to stay fixed.

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.489
Those are sort of
like Whovian things.

00:15:50.489 --> 00:15:51.780
Those are fixed points in time.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:55.050
And everything else we
can fudge around it.

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:55.550
So yeah.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.341
We thought one of the
things that we really

00:15:57.341 --> 00:16:00.090
enjoyed was the meta-joke of the
routing back to the beginning.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:02.469
If you have had any-- I don't
know why you would have had

00:16:02.469 --> 00:16:04.010
time in the last
five minutes to read

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:07.830
the first pages of our book--
but you start out hung over.

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:09.590
So at the end, we get you drunk.

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:10.670
And then it starts again.

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:12.490
Like, that is one of the
things that we think is--

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:13.090
MIKE MACDONALD: Exactly.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:13.460
JILLY GAGNON: I don't know.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.043
Probably we think it's funny.

00:16:15.043 --> 00:16:16.417
MIKE MACDONALD:
It made us laugh.

00:16:16.417 --> 00:16:16.917
Yeah.

00:16:16.917 --> 00:16:17.700
Definitely.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.620
JILLY GAGNON: So
that's all a long way

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.760
to say that we finally came up
with a behemoth that we could

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.420
call our own, and went
through the sort of-- I mean,

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.050
it's not particularly
interesting.

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:31.450
Standard process of finding
someone to put this book out

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:32.590
into the world.

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.298
And then as quickly
as we possibly could,

00:16:34.298 --> 00:16:36.490
we quite our jobs.

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:37.504
You know, why not?

00:16:37.504 --> 00:16:38.420
MIKE MACDONALD: Right.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.470
So we could focus on
hopefully doing a few more

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:41.179
of these books.

00:16:41.179 --> 00:16:41.970
JILLY GAGNON: Yeah.

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:42.840
There are a couple more coming.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.090
MIKE MACDONALD: So that is it.

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:46.962
So the book is out-- I
guess the next slide-- Yeah.

00:16:46.962 --> 00:16:47.920
JILLY GAGNON: You know.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:48.780
That's it.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.054
We know that the book exists.

00:16:50.054 --> 00:16:51.470
MIKE MACDONALD:
The rest is gravy.

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:52.511
JILLY GAGNON: You pumped?

00:16:52.511 --> 00:16:53.960
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.790
JILLY GAGNON: We did as
well as in this photo.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:57.414
So yeah.

00:16:57.414 --> 00:17:00.080
At this point, we wanted to give
you a little taste of the book.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.900
We wanted to do a short reading.

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:05.380
And I'm not sure-- I'm assuming
most people have heard of

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.380
or encountered a choose
your own adventure book.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:10.004
But if you have not, the concept
of a choose your own adventure

00:17:10.004 --> 00:17:13.339
book is essentially
like a non-linear book.

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:14.619
Even "Cloud Atlas."

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:17.430
Even crazy, everything is
happening at different times.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.970
You turn from page 9
to 10, and then to 11.

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:21.510
And you read forward.

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:25.568
In a choose your own adventure
book, you read a chapter.

00:17:25.568 --> 00:17:26.359
We call them nodes.

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:29.280
They're almost more like
moments than full chapters.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.060
And at the end of
that moment, you're

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.470
presented with two choices.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:36.950
And whichever thing you choose
is where you will go next.

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:39.169
Foregoing this other
mysterious option.

00:17:39.169 --> 00:17:40.710
Or if you're like
me, you would cheat

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:43.090
and you would try to find out
all the options beforehand.

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:44.950
But much like life,
what you choose

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:47.110
affects the rest
of your experience.

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.802
So.

00:17:47.802 --> 00:17:48.150
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah.

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.024
With that being said,
with all these choices,

00:17:50.024 --> 00:17:52.300
we're going to have to
put things to a vote

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.510
here for this
interactive reading.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.130
So just for a little
warm up, can I

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:59.320
hear you guys clap and
sort of hoot and holler?

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.110
JILLY GAGNON: Yay!

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:01.026
MIKE MACDONALD: Great.

00:18:01.026 --> 00:18:02.340
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.942
So if I read out a choice,
and that's the choice

00:18:04.942 --> 00:18:07.150
you want, if you could just
clap and hoot and holler.

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:09.240
And we'll sort of just
base it upon sound.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.480
JILLY GAGNON: But Mike
will read both choices.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.540
So you know what options
you actually have.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:13.542
MIKE MACDONALD: Exactly.

00:18:13.542 --> 00:18:16.000
So I'm going to take you to
the very beginning of the book.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.495
And I'm sort of just going to
synthesize the very first node.

00:18:19.495 --> 00:18:21.620
JILLY GAGNON: We want to
warm you up on the voting.

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:22.620
MIKE MACDONALD: Exactly.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.290
So you wake up.

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:26.040
You're hung over.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.290
Stage 5 hangover.

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:28.540
You're feeling quite terrible.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.610
You think you're
in a pool of what

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.620
hopefully is your own urine.

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.210
You hear the alarm
clock blaring.

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:36.010
You have to get up.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:37.429
It's time to go to work.

00:18:37.429 --> 00:18:38.720
So you've got two options here.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.800
The first option is you
can hit the alarm clock

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.190
and get a little more sleep.

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:46.410
Or the second option is,
you can just call in sick.

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:48.280
So if you want to
hit the alarm clock,

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.405
can you give a little clap?

00:18:49.405 --> 00:18:50.738
JILLY GAGNON: The snooze button.

00:18:50.738 --> 00:18:51.360
[CLAPPING]

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.840
MIKE MACDONALD: Great.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.700
And if you want to
call in sick, clap.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.440
[LOUDER CLAPPING]

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.440
JILLY GAGNON: All right.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.360
So we're calling in sick--

00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:58.990
MIKE MACDONALD: We're
calling in sick.

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:01.000
JILLY GAGNON: What I
think is happening.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.250
So.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.526
"In fact, going into work at
all today is not an option.

00:19:05.526 --> 00:19:07.400
You fumble on your
nightstand for your phone.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.220
No one should be in the
office for at least two hours.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.410
You know it's a cop out.

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:13.480
And it'll probably make your
manager ask questions tomorrow.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.400
But right now, the idea
of actually speaking

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.608
to a real person is impossible
to wrap your shattered

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:26.840
You try to breathe
through your mouth.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.590
Any chance I can get
a loaner for the day,

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:30.410
you ask the nearest IT guy.

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:31.630
It's slim pickings.

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:32.720
We've got a Samsung.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.300
But it doesn't
have Office on it,

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.750
he replies, never
taking his eyes

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:37.920
off the fanfic
site he's reading.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.520
I kind of need Office.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:43.090
I mean, doesn't every PC
ever made have Office?

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:44.210
No.

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:45.720
I also have a MacBook Air.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.720
But a few of the keys
don't work, he says.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.840
Which ones?

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:54.200
The E, Enter, numbers,
and the space bar.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.180
All right.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.200
Taking the Samsung.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.730
The IT guy-- is it Brian?

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:00.070
Andy?

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:02.300
You should really know
his name by now-- reaches

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:03.290
for the Samsung.

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:04.480
Be careful not to unplug it.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.680
It will instantly shut
off the power if the power

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.200
supply cuts out, he says.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.330
There's nothing to say to
that, so you walk away.

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:13.080
You see your boss
walking down the hallway

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.560
in the opposite direction.

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.830
Looking forward to
that big presentation,

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:19.350
he says, as he passes you.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:22.324
Get your hopes up, you
say with a forced laugh.

00:26:22.324 --> 00:26:23.740
Hopefully it was
convincing enough

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.210
to mask your anxiety
and fear, seeing

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:28.859
as the presentation isn't
finished or even started."

00:26:28.859 --> 00:26:29.650
MIKE MACDONALD: OK.

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:30.940
And I guess we'll leave
it there on a cliffhanger.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:31.010
JILLY GAGNON: Yeah.

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:32.110
Oh!

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:34.770
You can only find out in
the actual office adventure

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:37.279
what might happen next.

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:39.070
MIKE MACDONALD: So I
think that's the talk.

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:39.124
JILLY GAGNON: Yeah.

00:26:39.124 --> 00:26:41.430
And if people have-- this
is the question hour now.

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:43.450
So please, ask us anything.

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:44.664
Or just something.

00:26:44.664 --> 00:26:45.455
It can be personal.

00:26:45.455 --> 00:26:49.955
It can be about Mike's
renditions of "Oh Canada."

00:26:49.955 --> 00:26:52.080
AUDIENCE: Thanks so much
for talking, and the book.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:52.950
I'm really excited to read it.

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:53.866
JILLY GAGNON: Awesome!

00:26:53.866 --> 00:26:55.260
Thank you so much for listening.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.260
AUDIENCE: I have a kind
of a logistical question

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:58.600
about the creation of the book.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:04.950
How did you decide where to
put the different sections?

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:06.900
Like where it says,
jump to page 6.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:09.440
How did you decide to
put page 6 and not page

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.080
halfway through the book?

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.371
JILLY GAGNON: Well, that's
actually-- it's interesting.

00:27:13.371 --> 00:27:17.109
So when we started,
we had that document.

00:27:17.109 --> 00:27:18.900
And we were writing
them as separate nodes.

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.350
Everything we would
label on the flow chart.

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:24.900
So 1A, 2AB, 3ABCD, etc.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.580
Going down.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:28.870
And when we wrote it up,
we put those in order

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:32.494
and linked like a Word doc
hyperlink to go through it.

00:27:32.494 --> 00:27:33.910
And then we gave
it to our printer

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:34.993
instead of our publishers.

00:27:34.993 --> 00:27:38.760
And they magically made
that into real pages.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:42.900
So the short answer to that
question is, I don't know.

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:47.300
We just put them in order,
and then hoped for the best.

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.979
They probably futzed
with it a little bit.

00:27:49.979 --> 00:27:52.520
But the thing that happens with
those-- and you see it really

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.460
quickly once you start
going through them--

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:55.960
at the beginning
of the adventures,

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.510
they're all page 2 or 3, page
4 or 5, or the next options.

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:01.760
And then it starts
skipping quite a lot,

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.770
because there's just too
many other things in between

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:06.050
that you haven't chosen.

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:08.760
So it feels like a
mysterious experience,

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.972
hopefully, where you
don't know what's coming.

00:28:10.972 --> 00:28:12.680
And I would encourage
you to occasionally

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.330
flip through the
book with no goal

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:17.210
whatsoever and see
what you can find.

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:18.370
Thank you.

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:22.330
AUDIENCE: So how do you
proofread a thing like this?

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:25.850
MIKE MACDONALD: So what we do
is we collaborate on the ideas.

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:28.716
And then we will go
our separate ways.

00:28:28.716 --> 00:28:30.090
You know, I'll
write up my parts.

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:31.940
Jilly will write up her parts.

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:34.310
Then we'll meet again via Skype.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:36.310
And we'll go over
each line, basically.

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:37.590
And we'll go over it.

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:38.280
Is this funny?

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.410
Is this pushing
the action forward?

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:43.379
So just like a line
by line edit, I guess.

00:28:43.379 --> 00:28:45.170
JILLY GAGNON: But then
beyond that, once we

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:48.990
have the book in hand, and
you have it mostly set up,

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:51.720
it is extremely involved.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:55.010
And we had to create multiple
versions of that chart

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:57.510
that we went through and
just changed everything

00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:59.840
to blacked out everyone
that we've gone through.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.650
So you have to start the
beginning every time,

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:04.270
and go through the entire way.

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:05.240
And then have to start
from the beginning

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.610
again, and go through, and
at the very last moment

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:09.920
turn right instead of left.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.220
It is a long,
long, long process.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:13.620
You inevitably miss things.

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:16.974
Our editor, Laura Duane
was phenomenal on that.

00:29:16.974 --> 00:29:18.390
She went through
and she's like, I

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:20.250
don't think you introduced
Debbie in this thread.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:20.990
We're like, nope.

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:22.100
We didn't.

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:23.790
And she caught a
lot of that for us.

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:25.415
But this will be like
a fun Easter egg,

00:29:25.415 --> 00:29:28.060
like, find the mistakes, because
they're almost certainly still

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:28.780
in there.

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:33.860
It is really hard to make
sure that every single way you

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:37.920
do it, everything has been
introduced specifically

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:40.800
in that thread,
because someone will

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.780
go down that thread
very first and find out

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:44.600
that we didn't do it right.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:45.819
So it was very, very long.

00:29:45.819 --> 00:29:47.610
I used to proofread
professionally, though.

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:49.730
So I've got that good OCDI.

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:51.022
Hopefully we caught most of it.

00:29:51.022 --> 00:29:53.146
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if you could say anything

00:29:53.146 --> 00:29:55.490
about writing as a
comedy partnership,

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:57.900
like any sort of ground
rules or secret to success,

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:01.075
or differences in
your sense of humor.

00:30:01.075 --> 00:30:01.950
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:04.740
Well, I think as I mentioned
before, you sort of don't

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.340
want to be precious
about your ideas.

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:08.977
You should be willing to just
discard an idea whenever.

00:30:08.977 --> 00:30:11.310
I think the goal has always
been to create the strongest

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:12.184
piece of content.

00:30:12.184 --> 00:30:13.600
So whether it be
writing headlines

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.827
for "The Smew" or "The Onion,"
or writing these videos,

00:30:16.827 --> 00:30:19.160
we always just say, you know,
is this the funniest thing

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.450
that we can come up with?

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:21.845
If not, give me an alternative.

00:30:21.845 --> 00:30:22.636
JILLY GAGNON: Yeah.

00:30:22.636 --> 00:30:24.470
I think the very
first rule is that you

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:26.760
have to be willing to abandon
most of your own ideas.

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.760
Like, you have to assume
that your ideas are not

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.900
going to be the best that
anybody comes up with.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.730
And you can't get
worked up about that.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:35.720
It can't be personal.

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:36.750
Which is hard.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.580
It was a little bit easier
to start with four people,

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:41.251
because out of four,
the chances are

00:30:41.251 --> 00:30:43.000
good that yours isn't
everybody's favorite

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:43.587
every time.

00:30:43.587 --> 00:30:44.920
But it doesn't feel as personal.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.544
So by the time it
was just Mike and me,

00:30:46.544 --> 00:30:49.650
we were really used to the
idea of me saying, like,

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:51.170
that's not funny.

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:53.260
And vice versa.

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:53.760
But yeah.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.500
Generally what you
try to do-- we'll

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:58.010
will fight for ideas
that we want to keep,

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:00.950
and say, let me explain why
it is in fact really funny.

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:04.527
But if it's not
working, like Mike said,

00:31:04.527 --> 00:31:06.360
the very first thing
you sort of say is, OK.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:06.970
That's fine.

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:07.594
It's not funny.

00:31:07.594 --> 00:31:08.580
It's not working.

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:09.910
What do you suggest instead?

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:12.285
And you just have to keep
throwing ideas against the wall

00:31:12.285 --> 00:31:14.150
until something sounds
right to both of you.

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:15.710
And then maybe someone else
will tell you it's not funny.

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:18.022
And you have to can
it again start over.

00:31:18.022 --> 00:31:20.480
MIKE MACDONALD: It helps a lot
in that we read our work out

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.650
to one another as
we edit and rewrite.

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:25.506
Because you can see on a
person's face via Skype,

00:31:25.506 --> 00:31:27.880
or you'll get a laugh as to
whether or not this is funny.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.915
When you're writing stuff
by yourself in a room,

00:31:30.915 --> 00:31:32.040
you might think it's funny.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.941
But if you don't have anybody
to bounce the ideas off,

00:31:34.941 --> 00:31:36.190
you're a little bit uncertain.

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:40.570
I think broadly speaking, I
like my comedy sort of dry.

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:41.320
JILLY GAGNON: Yep.

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:42.700
MIKE MACDONALD: And Jilly
sort of likes her comedy

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.240
maybe a little more zany.

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:46.460
And we often meet in the middle.

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:47.600
So she's got this X voice.

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.039
I've got this Y voice.

00:31:49.039 --> 00:31:51.580
And when we put it together,
you create this sort of Z voice.

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:52.329
JILLY GAGNON: Zed.

00:31:52.329 --> 00:31:53.030
Oh my gosh.

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:54.240
You're so Canadian.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:54.940
Yeah.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.320
We hear it as zed voice.

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.000
But yeah.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.370
Reading out I think is
the other secret trick.

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:04.260
They tell all
authors to do that.

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:05.530
And that you feel ridiculous.

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:07.613
And you don't read your
work in front of a mirror.

00:32:07.613 --> 00:32:10.370
But it's amazing what you hear
that you wouldn't feel when

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:11.739
you're reading it in your head.

00:32:11.739 --> 00:32:13.780
And the rhythm of comedy
makes a huge difference.

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:17.910
A joke can land or fail just
based on like, one extra word.

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:19.380
And when you're
reading it out, you

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:22.140
can suddenly hear like, oh,
I went on way too long here.

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:23.510
Like, gone.

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:25.690
So I hope that
answered your question.

00:32:28.084 --> 00:32:28.750
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:31.470
I have a son in college,
a freshman in college

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:36.210
who has been writing to
their satirical paper.

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:37.910
So I was wondering,
how do you land

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:40.050
an internship at
"The Onion," and what

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:41.660
that experience was like.

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.380
MIKE MACDONALD: Sure.

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:45.000
JILLY GAGNON: I wouldn't know.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.750
MIKE MACDONALD: I
did a Master's degree

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:48.375
over at the London
School of Economics.

00:32:48.375 --> 00:32:50.200
And I chose to write
my dissertation

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.420
on the political relevance
of satirical news.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:56.390
So in doing that process,
I contacted people who

00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:58.450
at Colbert, Jon Stewart.

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:00.650
This hour has 22 minutes,
for the [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:01.392
in the audience.

00:33:01.392 --> 00:33:02.350
As well as "The Onion."

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:05.256
And "The Onion" were
enthused with the project.

00:33:05.256 --> 00:33:07.380
Once I got my research and
done all the interviews,

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.402
I went back to them.

00:33:08.402 --> 00:33:09.860
And I said, you
know, I'm not sure.

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:10.859
But I've got some jokes.

00:33:10.859 --> 00:33:12.280
Would you be willing
to read them?

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.480
And that sort of progressed
into a conversation

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:18.000
about doing an internship
in New York, which was

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.490
six months at the time, unpaid.

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:21.820
I jumped on it.

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:23.640
I thought that it
was a great offer.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:26.010
And then I suppose
toward the end of that,

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:27.180
they had a bunch of interns.

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:30.120
There's a sort of competition
for a few writing slots.

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.240
And you submit jokes.

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:35.240
Each week, I think, you submit
something like 15 jokes.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.500
And from there they'll
pick one or two people.

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.490
And I was fortunate enough to
get a contributing position,

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:41.640
which I had for two years.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:42.810
And then they let me go.

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:45.014
And then they rehired me again.

00:33:45.014 --> 00:33:46.680
And I brought Jilly
on board, of course.

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.580
But I would say, just reach out.

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:51.620
If you want to talk to somebody
about the potential of getting

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:54.190
a job, I think interviewing
that person beforehand

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:55.440
is a great way to go about it.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.680
JILLY GAGNON: It's
like a sneak attack.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.310
MIKE MACDONALD: Exactly.

00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:58.570
JILLY GAGNON: Interview
them about what they do.

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:00.570
Although the other thing
that is probably useful

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:04.454
if your son-- you said
your son-- is a freshman,

00:34:04.454 --> 00:34:06.370
keep doing it for a
couple years before you're

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:08.911
going after that slot, because
he's gonna get so much better.

00:34:08.911 --> 00:34:11.540
Your jokes are going to get so
much better the more you do.

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:15.010
And they might not
think you're ready now.

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:17.870
But two years from now, when
you've done this for that

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:20.620
much longer, and you've had
these conversations we have

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:22.570
with each other about
this wasn't working

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:24.909
and this is why, what
you submit to them

00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:26.590
is going to be so much stronger.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:28.449
And you will have
probably a better

00:34:28.449 --> 00:34:30.239
shot of getting your
foot in the door.

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:31.110
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah, of course.

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:32.810
JILLY GAGNON: But
like, try everything.

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:34.960
Go to the internet
for random websites.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:35.605
Do everything.

00:34:35.605 --> 00:34:36.730
And then you'll get better.

00:34:39.006 --> 00:34:39.922
MIKE MACDONALD: Great.

00:34:39.922 --> 00:34:40.421
Perfect.

00:34:40.421 --> 00:34:43.580
AUDIENCE: So first, thanks
for talking to us today.

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:45.389
It seems you've
chosen to continue

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:48.250
to work in the choose
your own adventure form.

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:52.674
I'm actually curious why you
decided to do more of it.

00:34:52.674 --> 00:34:55.090
It's not that it's bad, it's
just that it could have been,

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:56.460
that was a great, funny idea.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:57.790
Now let's do something else.

00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:59.740
JILLY GAGNON: Well, we are
in a very fortunate position,

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:00.240
actually.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.777
We wrote this book.

00:35:01.777 --> 00:35:02.610
And we had the idea.

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:04.160
And we had it all done up.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.990
And when our agent told
us that she had sold it,

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:10.130
she said, and they
want a three-book deal.

00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:12.610
And that is manna from heaven.

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:15.470
So we said, that's awesome.

00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:17.810
And we always had tons of ideas.

00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:19.200
We always saw that
there could be

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.900
a ton of-- there's a lot of
misery that you can hit on.

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:26.450
The holidays for us was
such an obvious next choice.

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:28.270
So when they said
that, we said, perfect.

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:30.690
We know what we will do next.

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:32.920
And we were hoping--
still are hoping--

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.277
that that will help us get
a little bit established

00:35:35.277 --> 00:35:36.860
so that the next
time we do a project,

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.027
people have heard of us,
and they're excited for it.

00:35:39.027 --> 00:35:40.276
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah, exactly.

00:35:40.276 --> 00:35:42.500
I think we always thought
from early days, OK,

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.004
we could transpose this
format onto another subject.

00:35:45.004 --> 00:35:46.420
There's a ton of
fodder out there.

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:47.961
We thought of Choose
Your Own Misery:

00:35:47.961 --> 00:35:50.310
The Maternity Leave,
Choose Your Own Misery:

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:53.080
The Online Dating Adventure.

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:55.500
And so the idea is that
we can sort of put this on

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.322
are almost endless.

00:35:56.322 --> 00:35:58.522
JILLY GAGNON: Yeah.

00:35:58.522 --> 00:35:59.980
Now we've figured
out how to do it.

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:01.935
And we'll have one
more crack at it.

00:36:01.935 --> 00:36:03.560
We've already written
the holiday book.

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.362
So hopefully we'll
get better and better.

00:36:05.362 --> 00:36:05.903
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:05.903 --> 00:36:06.740
Well, good luck.

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:08.160
MIKE MACDONALD:
Thank you so much.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.160
AUDIENCE: I was just
wondering if you guys could

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.991
talk a little bit more
about-- you mentioned

00:36:12.991 --> 00:36:14.240
that you work together, right?

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.310
Most of this is
over the internet.

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:16.226
MIKE MACDONALD: Right.

00:36:16.226 --> 00:36:19.320
AUDIENCE: So just how you think
that both benefited or made

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.950
it more difficult to write,
and kind of your experience

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:25.010
with the digital relationship.

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:27.010
JILLY GAGNON: A completely
digital relationship.

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:28.490
It's so funny,
because Mike and I,

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:30.720
this is probably
like the fourth time

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.150
we've hung out in
person, fifth time.

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:35.570
Like, everything was
done over the internet.

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:37.530
One thing I would
say, I think having

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:39.810
most of our conversations
through Skype

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:43.997
as opposed to in person, it
is a little bit of a barrier.

00:36:43.997 --> 00:36:45.580
So when you talk
about like that being

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.420
able to give up
your ego with jokes

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:50.220
and give up your
work really easily,

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.750
I think maybe it's not
something I would consciously

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:54.340
have said before.

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:56.222
But maybe that made
it a bit easier

00:36:56.222 --> 00:36:58.680
to let go of stuff, because
you're still in your own space.

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.310
Your space is still yours.

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:03.780
And there's that little bit
of a barrier between you

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:06.250
that makes it slightly
less difficult to say, OK.

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:06.750
Fine.

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:07.333
We'll move on.

00:37:07.333 --> 00:37:08.580
We'll do the next thing.

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:09.455
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah.

00:37:09.455 --> 00:37:12.617
When we started writing scripts,
there's a few more people

00:37:12.617 --> 00:37:13.700
that were writing with us.

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.647
And we actually used Google
Hangouts for the most part.

00:37:16.647 --> 00:37:17.730
And that was always great.

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:18.020
JILLY GAGNON: Thank you.

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:19.290
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah, exactly.

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:20.340
JILLY GAGNON: You
guys, seriously,

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.370
like, we kind of exist
because of Google.

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:23.005
So, thanks.

00:37:23.005 --> 00:37:23.880
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.695
The idea that you can sort
of teleconference with four

00:37:26.695 --> 00:37:27.320
or five people.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.820
And whoever is sort of talking
the loudest would be the most

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:33.050
prominent in the screen
was such a great idea

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:34.640
for this collaborative process.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.598
JILLY GAGNON: And it got
us all to talk louder,

00:37:36.598 --> 00:37:37.870
which was fantastic too.

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:38.510
MIKE MACDONALD: But yeah.

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.720
No.

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.520
I agree with Jilly.

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:45.220
It does sort of create this
barrier that you can pause.

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:46.470
And you can do your own thing.

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:48.320
You can make a cup of
coffee without having

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.100
to worry about entertaining
the person in the room,

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.434
and then jump back on the
call and get through it again.

00:37:52.434 --> 00:37:53.224
JILLY GAGNON: Yeah.

00:37:53.224 --> 00:37:54.490
Or you can duck out and weep.

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:55.948
And then you're
like, no, I'm cool.

00:37:55.948 --> 00:37:57.120
Let's keep moving.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.876
It's normal stuff like that.

00:38:00.876 --> 00:38:04.140
AUDIENCE: Did you ever have a
situation where you're alone.

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:06.730
You're doing your
thing, getting ready.

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:08.850
And you just, this is so
funny, you're laughing,

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:09.590
you can't stop.

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:11.310
You know, water's coming out
your nose, the whole thing.

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:11.929
You know.

00:38:11.929 --> 00:38:13.720
And then you share it
with your next Skype.

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:14.630
And they're like, no.

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:15.704
That's not funny.

00:38:15.704 --> 00:38:17.370
How do you deal with
that kind of thing?

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:18.690
You know it's really funny.

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:19.510
JILLY GAGNON: Duck out of frame.

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:20.057
You weep.

00:38:20.057 --> 00:38:22.882
And then-- And yes, absolutely.

00:38:22.882 --> 00:38:25.090
I think we probably both
had stuff where you're like,

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:27.140
this is so it.

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:28.840
This is the thing
that is going to make

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.400
every joke come together.

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.910
And the other person is
like, I'm not feeling that.

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:34.910
Like, I don't see where
you're going with this.

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:35.340
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah.

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:37.250
I think we've been working
together long enough that we

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:38.250
really trust each other.

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:40.241
And if Jilly finds
something really funny,

00:38:40.241 --> 00:38:41.990
I'll trust that the
joke is funny as well.

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:44.710
Maybe I'll try to add or
augment it here or there so

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:46.820
that we can sort of
shape it up a little bit.

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:48.236
But if she comes
to me and is very

00:38:48.236 --> 00:38:51.241
enthusiastic about an
idea, more times than not,

00:38:51.241 --> 00:38:51.990
we'll run with it.

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.800
And vice versa.

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:53.100
JILLY GAGNON: Right.

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:55.100
And I think the other
thing we will sometimes do

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:57.170
is-- I think I said before.

00:38:57.170 --> 00:39:03.410
We had a joke that we were
like water out the nose into.

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:04.230
You fight for it.

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:05.770
If the other person is
like, I don't get it,

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:08.080
you try to explain yourself,
you try to fight for it.

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.410
And one of the things we
we'll sometimes do is say,

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:13.210
can we leave it in place for now
and come back to it tomorrow.

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:16.400
And see if you've processed
it, so that the person who

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:20.470
maybe brought it in can feel
a little bit less close to it.

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:22.490
And the person who
didn't bring it in

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:24.330
can turn it over in
their head and see

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:26.440
if they feel the same way.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:29.180
So that has helped the ability
to turn off the computer

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:33.480
screen, vent to your
significant other or my cats,

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:38.339
and come back later makes it a
little bit easier to do that.

00:39:38.339 --> 00:39:40.880
But sometimes you just have to
let go of things that you love

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.189
that you thought were great.

00:39:42.189 --> 00:39:43.730
And maybe they
weren't great for what

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:45.650
we were doing together now.

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:46.940
So.

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:48.170
We're like very Zen.

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:50.797
We've learned how to
get rid of all ego.

00:39:50.797 --> 00:39:52.380
AUDIENCE: Since no
one else is asking,

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:53.570
I'll ask another question.

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:59.435
Do you think of humor as there
being like genres of humor?

00:39:59.435 --> 00:40:00.810
Like, for example,
I have friends

00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:03.090
who won't watch "Curb Your
Enthusiasm" because it's

00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:03.780
cringe humor.

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:05.770
And it's just too painful
for them to watch.

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:08.910
And others just can't
get enough of it.

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:10.900
And you know, there's
the stand up stuff.

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:13.073
And then "Onion" kind
of humor and stuff.

00:40:13.073 --> 00:40:16.410
And if so, where do
you see yourselves?

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:17.910
JILLY GAGNON: Well,
we're definitely

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:20.310
in the dark humor spectrum.

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:25.050
Definitely towards that end
where I think both of us

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:26.630
see humor as a
really important way

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:27.900
to deal with difficult things.

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:30.880
It's like a catharsis, the
catharsis element of humor,

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:34.290
which sort of pushes you
towards darker topics a lot

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:36.190
of the time.

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:38.979
If you can't laugh about it,
you'll cry about it topics.

00:40:38.979 --> 00:40:40.520
So we're definitely
on the dark side.

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.228
I think we're definitely
on the dry side.

00:40:42.228 --> 00:40:44.055
It's a bit of a British
vibe, sometimes.

00:40:44.055 --> 00:40:45.180
MIKE MACDONALD: I think so.

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.070
That's what people on
Amazon have been saying.

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:47.490
JILLY GAGNON: Yeah.

00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:48.573
They're like, these Brits.

00:40:48.573 --> 00:40:49.470
I'm like, that's not.

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:52.640
We're actually I think shelved--
or like one of the drop downs

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:54.290
on Amazon is British humor.

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:55.030
I'm like, great.

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:56.524
That's fantastic.

00:40:56.524 --> 00:40:57.940
MIKE MACDONALD:
British and Irish.

00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:58.340
JILLY GAGNON: Yeah.

00:40:58.340 --> 00:40:59.339
British and Irish humor.

00:40:59.339 --> 00:41:00.290
So now you know.

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:02.230
AUDIENCE: Which
really pisses you off.

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:03.190
JILLY GAGNON:
Yeah, he's annoyed.

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:03.960
I'm like, awesome.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.581
They have such great accents.

00:41:06.581 --> 00:41:07.080
But yeah.

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.800
I'd say we're dry.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.810
We definitely
also-- I think we've

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:13.980
both said this before-- it
works better as written humor.

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:16.580
A lot of it, seeing it
and thinking it over,

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:21.270
and some of that like subtle
wit or wryness or whatever,

00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:22.890
is easier in that form.

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:25.850
And perhaps maybe we're just not
good enough performers for it.

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:29.060
But that kind of humor, I
think, plays better on the page

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:30.290
than it maybe does in person.

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:32.039
Whereas a little bit
more over-the-topness

00:41:32.039 --> 00:41:37.350
in stand-up humor, no matter how
dark it is, works better there.

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:41.570
So probably wry, a little bit
understated, and very dark.

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:43.380
AUDIENCE: And just
in the few pages

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:47.060
you read, I didn't hear a lot
of Dilbert in your office humor.

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:50.362
JILLY GAGNON: I hope that's
not a disappointment.

00:41:50.362 --> 00:41:52.320
AUDIENCE: You've delved
into some video before.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:56.350
And I was wondering if there are
any moments in your video chats

00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:59.920
that you think might make
a good thing to share

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:00.909
with the internet.

00:42:00.909 --> 00:42:01.700
JILLY GAGNON: Yeah.

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:02.130
I mean--

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:04.020
MIKE MACDONALD: Well, lately
what we've been doing,

00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.210
I have a Skype recorder.

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:07.520
So when we do our
Skype sessions,

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.470
I'll record the entire thing.

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:12.260
And then I'll go back
and skim over it.

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:14.090
And my face is in
the corner here.

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:16.010
And Julie's face is
the predominant one.

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:16.730
So I'll look.

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:19.840
And every time that she's
laughing, I'll stop the frame

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:21.320
and see what we're
talking about.

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:24.220
And then I'll cut
that in I guess

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:25.880
iMovie or something like that.

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.099
And then I'll export
the MP4 into Facebook.

00:42:28.099 --> 00:42:29.640
Right now Facebook
seems like they're

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:32.217
pretty crazy on getting
sort of raw video uploaded.

00:42:32.217 --> 00:42:34.550
So I'll upload that onto
Facebook, put that on our page.

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:36.250
And then we've got
a YouTube channel.

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:37.755
A Choose Your Own
Misery YouTube channel.

00:42:37.755 --> 00:42:38.190
AUDIENCE: Whew!

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:38.900
JILLY GAGNON: Heck, yeah.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:39.710
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah.

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:41.210
And we'll put that
on there as well,

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:43.426
and tweet it out and put
it on our Google+ profile.

00:42:43.426 --> 00:42:45.050
JILLY GAGNON: And
right now it's mostly

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:46.900
like that sort of
behind-the-scenes moments,

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:50.070
because when we're talking,
we crack each other up a lot.

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:51.570
Sometimes it's not
something that we

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:53.736
feel comfortable sharing
with the internet at large.

00:42:53.736 --> 00:42:55.590
Like what's making
us laugh so hard.

00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:56.420
But often it is.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:58.710
And so we'll take those
little 15-second moments.

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:02.490
And that is our YouTube channel
at the moment is a lot of us.

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:04.480
And then a couple
videos that were

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:08.310
us doing very erudite readings
that we put up there as

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:09.140
well for people.

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:10.630
So not a lot of views yet.

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:13.181
Please, by all means, bump
up those views on the YouTube

00:43:13.181 --> 00:43:13.680
channel.

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.720
AUDIENCE: I'll just say April
1st is a few months away.

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.500
And you could always
script one, too.

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:19.625
JILLY GAGNON: You're right.

00:43:19.625 --> 00:43:21.445
You have a very good point.

00:43:21.445 --> 00:43:22.320
Thanks for having us.

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:22.820
It was great.

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:23.120
MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah.

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:23.745
Thanks so much.

00:43:23.745 --> 00:43:27.070
[APPLAUSE]
