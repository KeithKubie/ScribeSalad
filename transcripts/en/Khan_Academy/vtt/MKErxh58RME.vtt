00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.860
Nick and Alyssa are
racing up a wall.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.750
Alyssa's height on the wall
is given by the equation.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.630
a is equal to 1/3
t plus 5-- so it

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.100
sounds like they're wall
climbers of some kind-- where

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.720
a is Alyssa's height in feet
after climbing 4t seconds.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.390
Nick started racing at
the same time as Alyssa

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.090
and is also climbing
at a constant speed.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.980
His height is shown in
the following table.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.030
So this is t in seconds,
time in seconds.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.570
This is height in feet.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.842
Who started out
higher, Alyssa or Nick?

00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:31.550
So to figure out their
starting position,

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.008
we just need to
figure out what was

00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:34.370
their height at time equals 0.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.099
That's when this
whole race started.

00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:38.890
For Alyssa, this is
pretty straightforward.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.330
When time is equal to 0,
you have 1/3 times 0 plus 5.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.110
Well, that's just
going to be 5 feet.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.590
So Alyssa's starting
position is at 5 feet

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.580
when time is equal to 0.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.240
Now, let's think about Nick's
height at time equals 0,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.740
and there's a couple
of ways that we

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.410
can go about doing this.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.390
One is just to back up, to kind
go backwards on this chart.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.140
So let me show you
what I'm talking about.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.150
So if this is time, and this is,
let's say, n for Nick's height

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.220
because we have a
for Alyssa's height.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.440
So I'm going to make
a little table here.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.110
We already know that at time
6 seconds, or after 6 seconds,

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.460
he's 6 feet in the
air or along the wall.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.780
At time 8, he is 7 feet in
the air or along the wall.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.740
And at time 10, he's gotten
to a height of 8 feet.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.650
So what's happening here?

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:40.440
Every time 2 seconds goes
by, he increases in 1 foot.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.820
You have another 2 seconds, he
increases in height by 1 foot.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.950
So you could go backwards.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.590
If we take away 2
seconds to 4 seconds,

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.880
he will decrease in
height by 1 foot.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.450
If we go back
another 2 seconds, he

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.680
will decrease in height
by another 1 foot.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.080
The reason why we
can say this is

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.680
because we know he's
climbing at a constant speed.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.430
So if we decrease by another 2
seconds to our starting time,

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.140
then we know that he would
have been 1 foot lower,

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.169
so he would have been at 3 feet.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.100
So just like that, we now
know at time equals 0,

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.170
Nick's height is
3 feet in the air.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.600
So Alyssa started
out higher than Nick.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.840
So this right over here
would be the correct answer.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.490
Now, the other way to do it is
set up an equation just like we

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.520
had for Alyssa and
substitute for time equals 0.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.960
And the way to do
that is to recognize

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.350
that Nick's height,
as a function of time,

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.220
is also going to be
a linear equation.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.382
Because they're both climbing.

00:02:34.382 --> 00:02:36.090
They're both climbing
at constant speeds,

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.810
or we know that Nick is
climbing at a constant speed.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.784
So Nick's height, as
a function of time,

00:02:40.784 --> 00:02:42.700
is going to look like--
Nick's height is going

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.120
to be some slope,
some rate of change,

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.180
essentially his height
per second at times

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.500
time plus his initial position.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.670
So how can we solve
for m, the slope,

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.830
and his initial position?

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.580
Well, the slope is just his
rate of change of height,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.810
so it's literally how
much does his height

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.900
change per unit time?

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.610
So m right over here, m is just
going to be for a unit time,

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.810
for change in time, how
much is his height changing?

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.020
And his height is--
we used the letter n.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:28.200
So we already know that
when time increases by 2,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.590
his height increases by 1 foot.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.100
So we know that m
is equal to 1/2.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.629
He increases 1/2
feet per second.

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.420
And you see that there
because it takes him

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.650
2 seconds to go 1 foot.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.110
So we can fill in m here.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:55.320
So we know now that n is
equal to 1/2 t plus b.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.350
Now, to solve for
b, you could just

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.740
substitute one of these points.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.470
All of these points must satisfy
this equation right over here.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.600
So we could use the point 6.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.920
So if we put a 6 in
here, so when time is 6,

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.240
we know that n is 6.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.490
So you have 6 is equal
to 1/2 times 6 plus b.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.950
Or you get 6 is
equal to 3 plus b.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.560
Subtract 3 from both sides,
you get b is equal to 3.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.450
So there you have it.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.130
You get Nick's equation,
or Nick's height

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.210
as a function of time.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.880
Nick as a function
of time is going

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.840
to be equal to 1/2 t plus 3.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.280
So now we have an equation
just like Alyssa's.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.970
And we can say, well,
when time is equal to 0,

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.980
he's at a height of
3, which is lower

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.200
than Alyssa's initial height.
