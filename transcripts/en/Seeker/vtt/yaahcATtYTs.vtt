00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.670
I was vegetarian for 7 years. But I uh…
cheated. Every now and then I would have like

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.649
just one crab cake. They don’t count right?

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:17.119
It’s not like they can feel pain. Oh shoot.
Apparently. They can. Noooooooooo!

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.760
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.769
We humans like to think pretty highly of ourselves.
We put ourselves on the top of the totem pole

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.220
of the animal kingdom. We’ve got our big
brains and our fancy thumbs for texting. Every

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.099
animal is beneath us. And for a long time
we thought we could just use any animal how

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:32.559
we wanted to. It didn’t matter.

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.739
For a long time we didn’t think they could
feel pain!

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.129
Scientists for hundreds of years though that
animals couldn’t feel, they just simply

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.059
reacted mechanically. I mean compared to our
complex nervous systems it made sense. But

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.239
crab’s nervous systems do have their own
complexity.

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.260
Well a study published in the journal Biology
Bulletin found that crabs and other crustaceans

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.190
“have life spans of many years and a brain
that, in size and complexity, lies somewhere

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.020
between the octopus and insects” .

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.829
They have a small brain of sorts right behind
the eyes. Their main brains are more complex

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.339
than you might think. They have three ganglia
that have fused together to form a single

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.229
brain. They also smaller brains also called
ganglia for each section of their bodies.

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.189
These smaller brains mean a quicker response
from stimuli in the environment; the nerve

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.140
signal doesn’t have to travel as far.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.130
So what happens when those nerves get stimulated?

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.750
Do they feel pain?.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.509
A recent small study published in the journal
Biology Letters found that crabs physically

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.509
react to a pain stimulus. The researchers
subjected 20 crabs European shore crabs to

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.479
electrical shock. Most, of the crabs started
walking around in their tanks and a few tried

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.270
to climb out. While some the control group
of crabs who did get shocked started to walk

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.079
but 6 did nothing. But most telling was when
the researchers tested their “blood” or

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.689
their their haemolymph. It had three times
the amount of lactic acid. A clear physiological

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:45.020
sign of stress.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.950
Another study published in the journal Animal
Behavior found that hermit crabs feel pain

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.140
and specifically avoid it. Crabs given electric
shocks were more likely to leave their shell

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.310
and to seek out another shell without the
shocks. So it’s clear they feel something

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.920
and avoid it when possible. And according
to another study published in the journal

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.799
Applied Animal Behavior Science they also
limp or show other protective behaviors called

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.009
“pain guarding” and they even show fewer
responses to negative or supposedly painful

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.009
events.

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:16.721
And so that fits a definition of “suffering
pain” as described by Temple Grandin in

00:02:16.721 --> 00:02:21.040
a study published in the journal Emerging
Concepts and Strategies in Veterinary Medicine,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.010
in which she found mammals from humans to
the lowly rat suffer from pain. She even found

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.500
evidence that birds, reptiles and fish feel
pain too. She can tell when an animal suffers

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.180
from pain based on certain behaviors, like
pain guarding and seeking analgesics, which

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.290
reduce pain. Pain guarding is like when you
dog hurts its paw and so won’t put any weight

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.910
on it anymore or Or if they were hurt in a
specific place, they learn to avoid that place

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:43.910
in the future.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.690
And a wide range of animals perform this kind
of behavior. Even chickens, when their beaks

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.319
are trimmed, peck less than usual. Other studies
on mammals and birds and even fish found that

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.440
when the animals were given analgesics like
morphine, those pain guarding behaviors stopped.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.140
Which is bad news for me and my new pescetarian
lifestyle. Ugh but shrimp just taste so good.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.890
Guess I should go whine about it somewhere
on the internet. Maybe I’ll start a website

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.680
like iwillnevereatshrimpagain.com which is
available on domain.com.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.480
No domain extension will help you tell your
story like a DOT COM or DOT NET domain name.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.709
And because you watch DNews, you can get 15%
off Domain Dot Com’s names and web hosting

by using the code DNews when you check out.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.180
So would you still eat crab after this? let
me know down below.
