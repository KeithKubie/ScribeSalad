BUILD IT

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.180
In the Arizona desert, Ernie Adams is building
miniature versions of classic cars by hand

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:22.730
from scratch, including a 1939 Chevy Sedan,
a 1929 Ford Hillbilly, and a 1949 Mercury.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.419
Adams even builds the tools that are necessary
for the creations and it takes him between

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.359
1 and 5 years to construct each one.

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.960
He calls them Dwarf Cars and some are even
street legal.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.190

Trump, Mortal Kombat, and Tom Ford but he
says although he doesn't want to be typecast

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.010
as a pizza chef he happens to be very good
at making pizza and its his favorite food.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.829
Reconnected is an art installation by Phillipe
Handford in Pendle England at the location

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.640
of where an infamous hanging took place over
400 years ago.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.090
Bridging the past and present day cruelty,
Handford decided to connect the stumps of

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.320
fallen trees cut down illegally by using metal
frames that look like spines so the trees

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.200
appear frozen in time when they fell.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.799
Radek Michalowski made this MIG-23 fighter
jet arcade cabinet that was inspired by living

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.030
near the gate of a fighter air regiment in
Poland.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.299
It's numbered 846 in tribute to a plane that
his friend's father flew.

Adrien Noterdaem "simpsonized" the game of
thrones characters by illustrating each character

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.369

Uncured is photo series by Ben Dehaan of melting
portraits.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.090
He used a type of printer where the ink dries
using UV light but disabled that function

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.209
so the photos slowly dripped.

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.790
And then he photographed the dripping to create
this effect.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.790
