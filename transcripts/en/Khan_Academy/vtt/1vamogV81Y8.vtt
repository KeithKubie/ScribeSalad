00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:03.880
Now that we know some
trigonometry, let's use

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.270
that trigonometry to
solve some word problems.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.270
So let's get started
with-- This is exciting.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.370
This is a navigation problem.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.270
So I have a ship that needs to
go from point A to point B.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.140
So let me draw that.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.440
So I'm going from point
A, which is that

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.400
point, to point B.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.250
Let me draw a nice, big--
well not so big --triangle.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.620
Big enough.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.130
There you go.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.040
Because I need space
to do my math.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.460
So let me-- Let's see.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.750
So this is point A.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.880
Point A I will draw in mauve.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.560
Point A to point B.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.140
So this ship needs to go
from point A to point B.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.470
And this problem tells us that
the distance between point A

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.455
and point B is 10 kilometers.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.690
So this guy set sail and,
because of whatever reason.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.520
He's a bad navigator or
the water is flowing

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.070
faster maybe upwards.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.670
Maybe the water's flowing
in this direction.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.340
Let me draw that in blue to
show which direction the

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.610
water-- Say the current is
flowing in that direction.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.490
And he ends up off track.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.890
He actually ends up, after
5 kilometers-- So he

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.120
travels for 5 kilometers.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.220
Let me do that in blue-green.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.380
He travels for 5 kilometers and
after 5 kilometers, he realizes

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.640
that he has gone off track.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.550
And somehow-- I don't know
maybe using his astrolabe.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.730
I don't really know what one
is, but that's what people use

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.980
when they're on ships to figure
out where they are I think.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.760
--he realizes that he is
15 degrees off course.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.630
So what that means is that
he's-- Between the path he took

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.020
and the path he should've
took is 15 degrees.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.540
At least that's my
interpretation of it.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.690
So this is 15 degrees.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.630
And, of course, he's traveled
5 kilometers in the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.280
wrong direction.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.960
15 degrees in the
wrong direction.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.750
So what he needs to know
is-- So this is-- Let

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.890
me draw a little ship.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.670
So this is where
the ship is now.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.560
That's my ship.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.120
So now this guy, this poor poor
captain, he said so how far do

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.820
I still have to go
to get to point B?

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.150
So let me-- So he needs to know
how far is-- let me pick a nice

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.150
color --how far is this
distance right here?

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.510
This may just involve
some trigonometry.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.920
So how can we figure
out this distance?

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.650
Well let's just break
down what we know.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.000
And that's how I
do trig problems.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.480
I just keep messing around
with it until I get

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.260
the right answer.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.950
So let's see if we can tackle
this problem that way.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.060
So what can we figure out?

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.610
We know this is 5 kilometers.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.750
This side is 5 kilometers.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.060
We know that this
is 10 kilometers.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.380
We know this angle.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.190
Well one thing I know I can
figure out is-- Let's just make

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.420
some right angles so we can
start using some trigonometry.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.310
Let me draw a right angle here.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.550
I just drop it straight down.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.080
So can I figure out what
this side is right here?

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.110
Let me draw that in
a different color.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.470
In this brown color.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.700
Can I figure out what
this side right here is?

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.520
Well this side is
going to be what?

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.010
This is-- If we look at this
angle, this is adjacent to

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.860
the angle and this
is the hypotenuse.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.410
So if we know the hypotenuse,
we know the angle, we want to

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.190
figure out adjacent, what
trig function should we use?

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.110
Let me write out--
down our SOH CAH TOA.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.690
So we know the hypotenuse.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.310
We want to figure
out the adjacent.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.760
So what involves adjacent
and hypotenuse?

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.620
CAH, or cosine.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.620
So we know that the cosine of
15 degrees-- so I'm going to

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.780
write over this just not to
waste space --cosine of 15

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.030
degrees is equal to
this brown side.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.170
So let's just call
this-- I don't know.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.440
I'm just going to
call it x, right?

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.940
So this is equal to x over the
hypotenuse, over 5, right?

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.560
If we solve for x, we
get x is equal to 5

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.110
cosine of 15 degrees.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:19.090
Maybe we made progress.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.640
Maybe we didn't.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.010
Let's keep trying.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.490
All right.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.140
Now let's see if we could
figure out this side

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.680
of this triangle.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.640
Well this is, to this angle,
this is the opposite, right?

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.770
This is the opposite.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.910
And we know the hypotenuse.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.220
So what trig identity
should we-- trig

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.670
function should we use?

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.970
well if we know the opposite--
Well if we want to figure out

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.130
the opposite and we know
the hypotenuse and if

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.820
we know the angle.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.050
So what trig function deals
opposite-- I was going

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.570
to say hypotenuse.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:44.180
But anyway.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.640
What trig function deals with
the opposite of the hypotenuse?

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.250
Well that's sine, right?

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.940
So the sine-- We call this y.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:59.600
We know that y is equal to--
Well, doing it the same way,

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.050
sine-- 5 sine of 15 degrees.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.020
I skipped a step, right?

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:12.660
Because we could say that sine
of 15 degrees is equal to the

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.510
opposite, y, over the
hypotenuse, over 5.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.490
And then that step
takes us here.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.200
We just multiply
both sides by 5.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.960
You get y is equal to
5 sine of 15 degrees.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.620
So that's pretty cool.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.500
We know this y.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.610
We know the x.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.620
Can we figure out
what this length is?

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.570
Let me draw it in
yet another color.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.020
Can we figure out what the
length of this side is?

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.050
Well we know from the
prompt that this whole

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.700
length is 10, right?

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.600
We know this whole
length is 10.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.530
And we know that this little
part of it is x, which

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.690
is, we figured out is 5
cosine of 15 degrees.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.810
So let's call this z.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:59.410
We know that z is equal
to 10 minus x, right?

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.760
Because this whole thing is 10.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.750
This thing is x.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:02.700
So z equals 10 minus x.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.630
And we already figured
out what x is equal to.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.820
Z is equal to 10 minus this.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.570
That's what x is.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:09.935
We didn't even have to
use the variable x.

00:06:09.935 --> 00:06:11.590
We could have just
written it like that.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:18.850
So 10 minus 5 cosine
of 15 degrees, right?

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:19.720
That's this side.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.200
Z is equal to 10 minus 5
cosine of 15 degrees.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.050
So we know z.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.150
We know y.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.470
This is a right triangle.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.010
And we're looking for this
yellow side, whatever

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.110
we want to call it.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.750
That's the answer
to the problem.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.410
Well this is starting
to look easy.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.990
This is just the
Pythagorean Theorem.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.420
So let's just-- y squared plus
z squared is going to be equal

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.010
to our-- let's just call this.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.460
I don't know.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.640
Let's call this m.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.550
Picking an arbitrary letter.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:46.230
Let's call that m.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.530
So y squared plus z squared is
going to be equal to m squared.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.730
So we could just say-- Let's
just write that down.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:53.770
I don't know why I picked m.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.920
Really just to confuse
you, I think.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:02.960
So m squared is equal to-- Well
what's y squared? y squared

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.510
is 5 sine of 15 degrees.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:10.350
So it equals-- Let me
do it in that color.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:20.540
5 sine of 15 degrees squared
plus-- What's z squared?

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.570
z is this, right?

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:28.830
z squared plus-- I'm running
out of space --10 minus 5

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:34.290
cosine of 15 degrees squared.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.826
And now I just have
to simplify this.

00:07:35.826 --> 00:07:38.060
And if you have a calculator
you could do this without

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.860
any simplification.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.390
But I want to get it
as simple as I can.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:45.030
So let me just-- So
what's this squared?

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.310
Well this is equal to-- Let me
draw a line here because I

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.580
don't want to get too messy.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:50.590
But I need all of this space.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:57.620
So this is equal to-- What
color am I using now?

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.520
This is equal to-- And
remember, this is m squared.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.930
We're going to have to take the
square root of all of this

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.030
at the end to solve for m.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:11.390
This is equal to 25 sine
squared 15 degrees, or sine

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.250
of 15 degrees squared.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:13.240
That's just how you write it.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.130
And then we do a little bit
of FOIL here to expand this.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:27.170
So plus 100 minus-- this is
just expanding this expression

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:39.330
--minus 100 cosine of 15
degrees plus 25 cosine

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.740
squared of 15 degrees.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:43.000
All I is I expanded.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.340
I said, well this whole
expression squared is equal to

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:49.460
this squared minus 2 times the
two things multiplied out.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.580
So that's 100 cosine
of 15 degrees.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.180
And then I just squared this
last term, which is plus

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.950
25 cosine of 15 degrees.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.350
If that confused you, you
might want to review the

00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.890
multiplying expressions.

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:01.580
So let's see if we can
simplify this further.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.780
So if we take this term and
this term, we could simplify

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:14.610
that to 25 times sine
squared of 15 degrees plus

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.290
cosine squared of 15.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.090
And you could skip all this and
just use a calculator and

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:21.150
figure out this exact value.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.590
But I'm just going to keep
working on it just because

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:25.160
I like to get it as simple
as possible before I

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.630
use the calculator.

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.760
So that term and
that term are that.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.120
And then it's plus this stuff.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:38.450
Plus 100 minus 100 cosine
of 15 degrees, right?

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.020
And then-- What is the sine
squared of 15 plus the

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.320
cosine squared of 15?

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.500
That's one of our most
basic identities, right?

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.050
That's the Pythagorean
Identity.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.690
Sine squared of x plus
cosine squared of x, or of

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:51.350
theta, is just 1, right?

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.000
So this term becomes 1.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.130
And I'm running out of time.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.420
So I will continue
in the next video.
