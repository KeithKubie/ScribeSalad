00:00:09.112 --> 00:00:13.152
Even after writing eleven books 
and winning several prestigious awards,

00:00:13.152 --> 00:00:15.491
Maya Angelou couldn’t escape 
the nagging doubt

00:00:15.491 --> 00:00:19.685
that she hadn’t really earned 
her accomplishments.

00:00:19.685 --> 00:00:22.592
Albert Einstein experienced 
something similar:

00:00:22.592 --> 00:00:25.966
he described himself 
as an “involuntary swindler”

00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:29.535
whose work didn’t deserve 
as much attention as it had received.

00:00:29.535 --> 00:00:33.374
Accomplishments at the level 
of Angelou’s or Einstein’s are rare,

00:00:33.374 --> 00:00:36.404
but their feeling of fraudulence 
is extremely common.

00:00:36.404 --> 00:00:38.408
Why can’t so many of us shake feelings

00:00:38.408 --> 00:00:40.594
that we haven’t earned 
our accomplishments,

00:00:40.594 --> 00:00:45.019
or that our ideas and skills 
aren’t worthy of others’ attention?

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:48.401
Psychologist Pauline Rose Clance 
was the first to study

00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:50.925
this unwarranted sense of insecurity.

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:52.294
In her work as a therapist,

00:00:52.294 --> 00:00:56.646
she noticed many of her undergraduate 
patients shared a concern:

00:00:56.646 --> 00:00:58.461
though they had high grades,

00:00:58.461 --> 00:01:01.778
they didn’t believe they deserved 
their spots at the university.

00:01:01.778 --> 00:01:05.021
Some even believed their acceptance 
had been an admissions error.

00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:07.205
While Clance knew these fears 
were unfounded,

00:01:07.205 --> 00:01:10.766
she could also remember feeling
the exact same way in graduate school.

00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:14.470
She and her patients experienced
something that goes by a number of names--

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.118
imposter phenomenon,

00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:17.662
imposter experience,

00:01:17.662 --> 00:01:19.865
and imposter syndrome.

00:01:19.865 --> 00:01:21.634
Together with colleague Suzanne Imes,

00:01:21.634 --> 00:01:26.616
Clance first studied imposterism
in female college students and faculty.

00:01:26.616 --> 00:01:30.180
Their work established pervasive
feelings of fraudulence in this group.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.645
Since that first study,

00:01:31.645 --> 00:01:34.380
the same thing has been established 
across gender,

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.134
race,

00:01:35.134 --> 00:01:36.003
age,

00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:38.370
and a huge range of occupations,

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.419
though it may be more prevalent 
and disproportionately affect

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:44.759
the experiences of underrepresented 
or disadvantaged groups.

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.271
To call it a syndrome 
is to downplay how universal it is.

00:01:48.271 --> 00:01:51.276
It's not a disease or an abnormality,

00:01:51.276 --> 00:01:53.864
and it isn’t necessarily 
tied to depression,

00:01:53.864 --> 00:01:54.825
anxiety,

00:01:54.825 --> 00:01:56.536
or self-esteem.

00:01:56.536 --> 00:01:58.780
Where do these feelings 
of fraudulence come from?

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.194
People who are highly skilled 
or accomplished

00:02:01.194 --> 00:02:03.189
tend to think others are just as skilled.

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.563
This can spiral into feelings 
that they don’t deserve accolades

00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:08.596
and opportunities over other people.

00:02:08.596 --> 00:02:11.186
And as Angelou and Einstein experienced,

00:02:11.186 --> 00:02:13.508
there’s often no threshold 
of accomplishment

00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:15.531
that puts these feelings to rest.

00:02:15.531 --> 00:02:20.357
Feelings of imposterism aren’t restricted 
to highly skilled individuals, either.

00:02:20.357 --> 00:02:24.370
Everyone is susceptible to a phenomenon 
known as pluralistic ignorance,

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.896
where we each doubt ourselves privately,

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:29.029
but believe we’re alone 
in thinking that way

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:31.244
because no one else voices their doubts.

00:02:31.244 --> 00:02:34.973
Since it’s tough to really know 
how hard our peers work,

00:02:34.973 --> 00:02:37.595
how difficult they find certain tasks,

00:02:37.595 --> 00:02:39.516
or how much they doubt themselves,

00:02:39.516 --> 00:02:42.972
there’s no easy way to dismiss feelings 
that we’re less capable

00:02:42.972 --> 00:02:44.727
than the people around us.

00:02:44.727 --> 00:02:46.637
Intense feelings of imposterism

00:02:46.637 --> 00:02:48.922
can prevent people 
from sharing their great ideas

00:02:48.922 --> 00:02:52.656
or applying for jobs 
and programs where they’d excel.

00:02:52.656 --> 00:02:54.112
At least so far,

00:02:54.112 --> 00:02:56.611
the most surefire way 
to combat imposter syndrome

00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:58.153
is to talk about it.

00:02:58.153 --> 00:03:00.226
Many people suffering 
from imposter syndrome

00:03:00.226 --> 00:03:02.557
are afraid that if they ask 
about their performance,

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:04.128
their fears will be confirmed.

00:03:04.128 --> 00:03:06.273
And even when 
they receive positive feedback,

00:03:06.273 --> 00:03:09.317
it often fails to ease 
feelings of fraudulence.

00:03:09.317 --> 00:03:10.347
But on the other hand,

00:03:10.347 --> 00:03:14.425
hearing that an advisor or mentor has
experienced feelings of imposterism

00:03:14.425 --> 00:03:16.116
can help relieve those feelings.

00:03:16.116 --> 00:03:18.193
The same goes for peers.

00:03:18.193 --> 00:03:20.717
Even simply finding out there’s a term 
for these feelings

00:03:20.717 --> 00:03:22.700
can be an incredible relief.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.191
Once you’re aware of the phenomenon,

00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:26.616
you can combat your own imposter syndrome 

00:03:26.616 --> 00:03:29.387
by collecting 
and revisiting positive feedback.

00:03:29.387 --> 00:03:32.380
One scientist who kept blaming herself 
for problems in her lab

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.557
started to document the causes 
every time something went wrong.

00:03:35.557 --> 00:03:38.160
Eventually, she realized most 
of the problems

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.902
came from equipment failure,

00:03:39.902 --> 00:03:42.150
and came to recognize her own competence.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.201
We may never be able 
to banish these feelings entirely,

00:03:45.201 --> 00:03:49.553
but we can have open conversations 
about academic or professional challenges.

00:03:49.553 --> 00:03:53.330
With increasing awareness 
of how common these experiences are,

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.808
perhaps we can feel freer to be frank 
about our feelings

00:03:56.808 --> 00:03:58.839
and build confidence 
in some simple truths:

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:00.048
you have talent,

00:04:00.048 --> 00:04:01.408
you are capable,

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:02.520
and you belong.
