00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.540
So, let's see if we can figure out how the

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.460
distributed loss level cache works. Let's say we have a

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.090
processor chip with 16 cores, organized as a four by

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.155
four mesh like this. The cores, along with their level

00:00:13.155 --> 00:00:15.855
one and level two caches and a slice of L3,

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:19.447
are connected like this. So a single tile here in

00:00:19.447 --> 00:00:22.518
this mesh has a core, a level one, level two

00:00:22.518 --> 00:00:25.672
cache private to that core, and a slice of the

00:00:25.672 --> 00:00:31.656
shared last level, level three cache. And that level three cache is eight

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:38.330
megabytes in size, has a 256-byte block size, is 16-way set associative,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:44.230
and is distributed among the slices round robin by set number.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.104
If core zero issues a load from address one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:00:50.104 --> 00:00:54.376
seven, eight hex, and if this load is a missing level one

00:00:54.376 --> 00:00:59.040
and in level two we send the level three request to what tile?
