00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.500
(music)

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.720
The book grew out of my own personal experiences.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.730
I went through a long period of chronic stress, and I myself came down with arthritis.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:26.180
I went with neighbors to the Greek island of Crete, and that was a turning point in my healing.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.880
(music)

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.230
We know now not only that stress can make you sick, but how stress can make you sick.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:42.170
And also the opposite: how relaxing, how finding a place of peace, can help you heal.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.479
And that's really what the book is about. It's about taking that science that proves these connections,

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:54.409
and putting it into the space around us. I
knew of a groundbreaking study by environmental

00:00:54.409 --> 00:01:00.330
psychologist Roger Ulrich, who had published a paper in the journal Science in 1984 showing

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.570
that patients who were recovering from gall
bladder surgery, whose beds were beside windows

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.270
with views of trees, views of nature, healed
on the average a day faster, and needed less

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.530
pain medication, than patients in the same
room who had a view of a brick wall.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.240
And that study really impressed me, and it certainly impressed the scientific community, and suggested

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.030
there is something about what you see, or
what you hear, or what you smell, or what

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.670
is it about those views that could help speed healing.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.360
(music)

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.000
So this is one of my healing places, I come here when I'm stressed and when I need a place to just sit

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.610
and meditate and reflect. It's the Bishop's Garden of the National Cathedral. It's lots of green.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.979
In the summer there's beautiful roses, and the smell, and you can sit and look at the beautiful

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.639
view of downtown Washington, and for me it's a place where I come to heal.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.120
Feeling better because you believe in something in medical terms is called "the placebo effect,"

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.640
and unfortunately that carries with it a lot of
baggage, you say "oh, you know, it's just the placebo effect."

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.500
Well the placebo effect is a very powerful
effect. It probably contributes to about thirty

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:33.020
percent or more of any cure. And what it is
is it's the brain's own healing processes.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:41.300
And it's pretty clear that place can trigger
the brain's own healing processes.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.500
Health care design architects have really embraced this, and, ultimately, the practical application--

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.900
for example for health care--is to design hospitals, or healing places, that will help people to

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.940
heal, rather than to be stressful and harm
us. Because if something as simple as a window,

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.430
and the view outside of it, can help a patient heal, think how much better patients would

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:21.460
be in hospitals if we on purpose incorporated all the elements of design that can help us heal.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.460
(music)

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.120
In the course of doing the research
for this book, I visited a lot of healing

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.430
places--the labyrinth at Chartres, Boulder,
Colorado, and the scientists who work out of there.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.370
Marburg, Germany, with its castle on the hill, that is so reminiscent of Disneyland's castles.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.739
And in fact I describe the Disney theme parks.  There are many healing places around the world.

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:53.739
It's only up to us to find our own healing
place. And it can be as small as your favorite

00:03:53.739 --> 00:04:01.719
chair in the living room, in front of the
fireplace, or it can be as large as a view

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.440
from a mountaintop. There is a turning point
in every illness, where you go from the dark

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:13.209
side to the light, and how do we get there?
How do we get to that turning point, and can

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.190
the place around you help you get there? And,
ultimately, the answer is yes.
