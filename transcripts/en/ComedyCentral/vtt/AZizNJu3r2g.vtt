00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:02.235
So you'd rather do Alaska
in the cold than Mississippi

00:00:02.268 --> 00:00:03.469
in the summer?

00:00:03.502 --> 00:00:04.237
-Yes.
-Yeah.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:04.971
Cause I don't like to sweat

00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:06.272
cause then you know my face

00:00:06.305 --> 00:00:08.307
will start melting, you know I
paint on my eyebrows.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.109
In the cold,
they stay perfect.

00:00:10.142 --> 00:00:11.044
-Yeah
-It's really good for...

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:12.345
You paint on your eyebrows?

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:14.514
-Yes I do. No nothing here.
-This isn't real?

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:15.681
So you don't have hair?

00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:17.550
None. Everything is just not-

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:18.618
I'm not even a person.

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:20.920
You're just a small
Mexican man (laughs).

00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:24.590

and also her podcast:

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:34.667
Woo!

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:42.542
I'm scared of dying
on a plane.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:43.709
-Really?
-Yes.

00:00:43.742 --> 00:00:46.112
Because then it's not
a tragedy about me.

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:47.480
It's a tragedy

00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:50.783
with me and like a hundred
and fifty other people

00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:52.085
so it's not as special.

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:53.686
Nice, so you want to die
in a special way

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.121
where that could have only
happened to you?

00:00:55.154 --> 00:00:58.157
-Yes just me. -I like it
What's a good way to go out?

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.492
Give us your perfect death.

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:01.461
Okay I was on a horse,
right, and

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:03.896
I'm riding the horse
on my estate,

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.299
and then the horse all of a
sudden goes crazy

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:07.233
and attacks me

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:09.836
and I fall off the horse
and then I die.

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:11.737
-Beautiful -Like a white woman,
like (sigh).

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.339
-Clutch my pearls. Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:16.275
And just gets stepped on
by a horse like a white woman.

00:01:16.308 --> 00:01:17.977
There it is.
Makes sense to me, folks.

00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:24.350
A woman pulled out

00:01:24.383 --> 00:01:28.221
her own buns for a burger.
-Oh, okay.

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:30.456
She said "these are my-" not
that kind of bun!

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:31.891
-I wasn't sure!
-Anyway,

00:01:31.924 --> 00:01:33.893
She's like "I made these buns."

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:37.163
"and I can only eat the buns
that I make."

00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:38.831
"So I would like a burger,"

00:01:38.864 --> 00:01:41.234
"a medium well, with these
buns."

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:43.069
-What? -She pulled out her
buns

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:45.771
and I said "Miss you gotsta go.
We don't want your buns

00:01:45.804 --> 00:01:47.807
-or your service." No!
-You didn't take the buns?!

00:01:48.874 --> 00:01:51.110
Listen they could've had
anthrax in the buns.

00:01:51.143 --> 00:01:52.411
-I don't know!
-That's a good point.

00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:53.646
What if there's anthrax
in the buns?

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:54.914
The buns looked dry

00:01:54.947 --> 00:01:56.516
I was like no thank you. I know
you didn't use

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.784
-no butter or anything, nah.
-Can't have those.

00:01:57.817 --> 00:02:01.053
This restaurant will not stand
for any dry-ass anthrax buns.

00:02:01.086 --> 00:02:02.755
-Not in Sydnee Washington's
restaurant. -Security!

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:04.324
Come get these damn buns!

00:02:07.626 --> 00:02:10.463
-Uh, 90's. 90's party.
-Yeah.

00:02:10.496 --> 00:02:13.166
Because a lot of people don't
update their clothes anyway

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.600
so all they had to do was go in
the closet

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:16.669
they didn't have
to go shop or nothing.

00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:17.937
I feel like
it's coming back down.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.773
Everybody's wearing
a 90s vintage thing now.

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:22.975
Or windbreakers
something about a windbreaker.

00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:24.544
I love
a good windbreaker though.

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:26.379
I love a good sh-sh, I
like that in the pants.

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:28.481
I love to feel like
I'm like I'm like coming

00:02:28.514 --> 00:02:30.483
I want people to hear me come.

00:02:30.516 --> 00:02:31.317
Ooh, that doesn't sound
right.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.219
I was gonna say, because, you
know

00:02:33.252 --> 00:02:34.620
-I don't know what you meant
-That does not sound right!

00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:37.623
But a lot of people just rewound
that so say it again

00:02:37.656 --> 00:02:39.892
-I want people to hear me come
-Yes.

00:02:39.925 --> 00:02:42.495
because not enough people hear
women coming anyway.

00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:44.564
-So like, honest.
-I know I haven't.

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:46.832
-Ooh!
-Now my face is melting!

00:02:46.865 --> 00:02:48.268
I'm sweating, I'm coming.

00:02:49.134 --> 00:02:50.469
All right, Sydnee, that
was Stupid Question.

00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:52.104
-You have a good time?
-A blast.

00:02:52.137 --> 00:02:53.172
Seriously?

00:02:53.205 --> 00:02:55.641
-So fun. -You know what, you get
a stupid gift now.

00:02:55.674 --> 00:02:57.176
So because your last name
is Washington.

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.446
We framed a dollar bill
because that's George Washington

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:02.415
-and we gave it to you.
-Oh my god!

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:05.484
Yeah. That's for you babe.
This is another gift I got you

00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:07.220
because
your first name is Sydnee

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:09.455
and that sounds like
a city in Australia.

00:03:09.488 --> 00:03:12.858
-I got you a koala bear.
-Are you (bleep) kidding me?

00:03:12.891 --> 00:03:14.760
-Yes, koala bear onesie!
-I always wanted one of these!

00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:16.462
-I'm gonna sleep with this.
-There you go.

00:03:16.495 --> 00:03:17.830
You gonna get it koala! Aha!

00:03:17.863 --> 00:03:19.465
(laughs)
Oh my goodness!
