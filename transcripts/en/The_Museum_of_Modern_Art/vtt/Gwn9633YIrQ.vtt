00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.060
The kung fu genre is Hong Kong cinema's most
unique and significant creation.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.300
My name is La Frances Hui.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.320
I am a film curator at the Museum of Modern
Art.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.040
In this video, we will look at the genre closely and discuss the work of Lau Kar-leung,

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.980
the great director and actor of kung fu films.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.400
There are mainly two kinds of martial arts
films.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.660
Wuxia films and kung fu films.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.760
Wuxia is a Mandarin term combining the words
'martial arts' and 'chivalry'.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.000
One of the most important Wuxia film directors
is King Hu, who made some of the most stunning

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:51.300
and artistically original Wuxia films, such
as A Touch of Zen, Dragon Inn, and Come Drink with Me.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.460
In these films, the fighting is very stylized,
imaginative,

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.000
borrowing elements from northern opera traditions.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.280
You see high kicks, intense acrobatics, antigravity
and weightless leaps,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.620
supernatural power fully  fantasized.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.440
A more recent example is Ang Lee's "Crouching
Tiger, Hidden Dragon".

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.340
You see how the heroes leap all the way up
to the top of bamboo trees, stay there,

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.740
perform extended fights, and fly all over the place.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.260
Kung fu, though, is something else.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.880
Kung fu is a Cantonese term.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.230
It literally means 'skill'.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.040
You can call a chef a kung fu master.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.200
In the context of martial arts, it refers
to southern martial arts traditions.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:52.920
Southern kung fu relies a great deal on upper
body strength, supported by solid lower body stances.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.520
The movements are closer to the ground.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.640
The kicks are lower, and you see a lot of
intricate arm and fist techniques.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.240
The most famous kung fu master is undoubtedly
Wong Fei-hung, a late Qing Dynasty figure

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.660
who ran a martial arts school in Guangdong,
who was an expert of the hung fist School

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.900
of Martial Arts, associated with southern
Shaolin temple.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.280
His story is so legendary that it has inspired
over 100 films, including

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.100
The Story of Wong Fei Hung, and King of Lion Dance.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.160
It wasn't until the '70s when the label kung
fu film was used to describe the genre.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.620
It was a time when Bruce Lee emerged and took
the world by storm, with films like

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.140
Enter the Dragon and Game of Death.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:54.680
The Chinese audience, being experienced spectators
of martial arts, wanted to see realistic fighting.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.080
They wanted to see real kung fu fighters doing
the real thing.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.520
A whole generation of actors who were actually
trained in martial arts became movie stars.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.580
Lau Kar-leung practiced the hung fist tradition
under his father,

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.320
who was a student of Wong Fei-hung's direct disciple.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.820
In the '60s, he joined the Shaw Brothers Studio
as a martial arts instructor,

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.460
making short play Wuxia films like One-armed Swordsman
and Golden Swallow.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.280
Look, a lot of directors and actors are associated
with kung fu genre, but what they deliver

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.690
is not strictly kung fu.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.040
Bruce Lee was trained in a southern wing chun
style, but he delivered far more than kung

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.760
fu in his films.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.120
Look at how he moves in "Way of the Dragon."

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.800
The way he bounces left and right; those are
steps in western boxing.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.680
You also see judo, taekwondo and he was never
shy to say how proud he was to mix different

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.900
martial arts styles, reflecting his identity
as a Chinese, and a Chinese-American,

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.540
truly a global citizen before globalization.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.360
Another action star, Jackie Chan, who is often
associated with kung fu, actually studied

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.900
Peking Opera, which gave him the
acrobatic skills to play kung fu characters,

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.060
such as the one in Drunken Master II.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.220
This athleticism makes him a great performer
in action films set in modern times.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.060
This is a fight scene in Police Story.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.010
What you see is not really kung fu, but, because
of the training Jackie Chan has received,

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.080
he is able to choreograph and perform incredible
stunts.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.920
These mixed styles are all sensational to
watch, and equally hard to execute.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.560
There's no need to privilege one over the
other.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.540
But if you want to talk about old school,
authentic kung fu, there's no one quite like

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.040
Lau Kar-leung.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.740
Lau Kar-leung has a very strong desire to
show the audience the holistic beauty of

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.420
kung fu, a discipline of body and mind.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:15.300
He loves showing the making of a kung fu master,
a strenuous, grueling process that offers

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.040
no shortcuts.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.100
He devotes a huge amount of screen time to
training sequences.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.200
"The 36th Chamber of Shaolin" demonstrates
this like no others.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:33.000
In this film, his favorite kung fu star, Gordon
Liu, goes through a series of Shaolin chambers

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.880
to fine tune each kung fu technique.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:43.960
You can say it's just a movie, but the laborious
training scenes have the feel of a documentary.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.860
No actor can act out the training without
going through the actual training itself.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.620
The process is exhausting.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:59.000
You can't watch it without feeling complete
respect for the actor and kung fu artists.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:06.300
Lau Kar-leung also likes to showcase the teacher
student relationship, informed by the Confucian

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.960
philosophy of honoring the elders.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.920
The teacher doesn't only pass down the kung
fu skills.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:18.300
He or she is also concerned with the cultivation
of the students' moral character.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.900
Lau Kar-leung's films reflect his intimate
relationship with kung fu.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.040
His action scenes are meticulously planned,
performed and filmed.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.520
He acts in his films often, and works with
his favorite kung fu stars,

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.980
all of them very well trained, and can perform his style of
kung fu.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.560
There are a few close-ups to create distractions.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.880
Medium and wide shots are often used to expose
the entire body.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.060
There's nowhere and no way for an actor to hide.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.160
The camera pulls back often to reveal the
movements as they are.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:00.800
Continuity editing is used to make the action
and the trajectory of any movement legible

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.980
to the audience.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.700
The editing cuts are really not very rapid.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.500
Certainly not like some other action films,
such as "Bourne Ultimatum", which is made

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:17.760
up of very quick cuts stitching together actions
that appear to be continuous, but most likely

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.760
performed in broken fragments on the set.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.440
Here is a great scene from "Martial Club",
showing two actors fighting in a very narrow

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.220
alley.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:34.740
What do you do with your limbs in a tight
space measuring three or four foot wide,

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.240
and how do you film it?

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:42.880
Watching a Lau Kar-leung film is similar to
watching an illustrated guide or documentation

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.020
of kung fu and its philosophy.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.920
The fight scenes are spectacular.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.760
The performers are top notch.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.740
The films are even funny sometimes.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.040
It's joyful to watch these films regardless
of how much you know about kung fu.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:04.360
Just know that you are watching the works
of the most dedicated and authentic exponent

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:10.120
of kung fu and kung fu film â€” someone who
has been hailed the grandmaster.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.400
So those are my thoughts on kung fu films
and Lau Kar-leung.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.440
I hope that you have enjoyed watching this
video.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.540
