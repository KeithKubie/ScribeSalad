00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.569
All right, you made it.

00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:02.860
Take a deep breath.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.200
I know this stuff can
be a little bit dry.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.830
In this lesson,
you didn't really see any new syntax or

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.520
unfamiliar bits of code.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.880
But you did see new ways of arranging
those tools that you know and love.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.040
As you go forward, try and focus not
just on writing code that works, but

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.040
also on writing well
designed code that works.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.110
It's very much a creative skill and

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.360
the only way really to get
better is to practice.
