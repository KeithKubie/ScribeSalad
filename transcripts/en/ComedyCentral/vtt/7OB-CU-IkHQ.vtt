00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:02.635
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:03.470
- You took-

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:04.304
- Yeah.

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:05.138
- Penis pills.

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:05.972
- I took a penis pill.

00:00:05.972 --> 00:00:07.507
- Why take these pills?

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.742
- I really just wanted to see

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:10.276 align:start size:88% position:13%
what it would be like
to get a chemical boner.

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:11.511 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Just kind of wanted
to put a little

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:13.079
extra something in
there, you know.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:15.515
- I buy this one that has a
big gorilla picture on it.

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:16.883 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Do you know that
gorillas actually have

00:00:16.883 --> 00:00:18.918
penises that are this small?

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:20.387
- Uh...

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:21.621
- You just thought these
pills would make your penis

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:22.756
one of those, like,
inflatable things

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:24.591 align:start size:84% position:16%
outside a car
dealership, just like,

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:28.661
make people come to
your boners, like...

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.530
- I forget what kind
they were, but, uh...

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.865 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Would you remember
if you heard it?

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:32.799
- Probably so.

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.834
- Okay, was it Semen Strong?

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:35.668
- No.

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:36.503
- Max Load?

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:37.337
- No.

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:38.304
- Bone Sweet Bone?

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:39.506
- No, it wasn't Bone Sweet Bone.

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:41.908 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Was it Jizz
Cannon Overspew Y2K?

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:42.876
Flaunty Python?

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.077
Was it Dick Hole Sun?

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:44.911
- No, I don't...

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:45.745
- Won't you come?

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:46.579
- Me, come?

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:47.680
- â™ª Wash away...

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.648
Planet Girth?

00:00:48.648 --> 00:00:50.817
What about Oooh, You Nasty?

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:52.719
Boi-yoi-yoi-yoing Colossal?

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:53.853
Jerk du So Laid?

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:54.854
Ween Bay Packers?

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:56.056
Dick van Dyke?

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.524 align:start size:84% position:16%
Was it Executive
Produce by Dick Wolf?

00:00:57.524 --> 00:00:58.558
- I don't think so.

00:00:58.558 --> 00:00:59.793
- Walker, Texas Dangler?

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:00.960
- No.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.128 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Was it Knock
Knock? Who's There?

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:03.430
- No, no, it wasn't.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.697
- You're not, I'm not done.

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:06.166
It's a long name.

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:09.035 align:start size:97% position:3%
Oh, was it Jizz based on
the novel Balls by Sapphire?

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:10.236
Was it Mmmmfff?

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:11.871
Was it "Hey Ladies, How Are Ya"?

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:13.506
- Uh, no.

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:14.741
- Okay.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.242 align:start size:81% position:19%
Do you know what's
in these pills?

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:17.077
- No.

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:18.511
- Do you care?

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:19.979 align:start size:84% position:16%
You don't know what's
in those pills.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:20.914
- Oh, yeah, true that.

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:22.215
- I do remember one chemical.

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:23.049
It was ...

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:29.456 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Did you even look at what
was inside these pills?

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:31.291
- No, I didn't, you know?

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.526
- Yeah, that makes sense.

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:35.228 align:start size:94% position:6%
Why not go get a
prescription for something

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:37.163
that is actually regulated?

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:38.164
- Seems like a lot of effort.

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:39.099
- Get Obamacare.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.266
- Will he give me erections?

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.702
- Go see a real doctor.

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:45.538 line:0%
Okay, Dr. Drew, in your
professional opinion,

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:47.941 align:start size:94% position:6%
what do you think of these
gas station dick pills?

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.242
- At best, a waste of time.

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:50.810
At worst, dangerous.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.779
- Do you know what exactly
is in these pills besides-

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:53.980
- There's a lot of stuff.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.248 align:start size:88% position:13%
You know, there's
something we used to use

00:01:55.248 --> 00:01:56.316
back in the day when
I was first practicing

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:57.817
called Yohimbine.

00:01:57.817 --> 00:02:00.987
- Isn't that the name of
the gorilla that they shot?

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:02.222
What kind of dangers?

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:03.556
- It's like any
other supplement.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:05.892 align:start size:84% position:16%
The problem being,
though, you don't know

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:07.527
when you're going to get
some adulterating agent

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:09.295 align:start size:88% position:13%
in there that could
harm you, in which case

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:11.764
you could really get
serious complications.

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:13.333 align:start size:84% position:16%
You can get something
called priapism.

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:14.467
- Which is...

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.769 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Which is a sustained,
painful erection

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:17.937
that does not go away.

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:19.139
- Okay.

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.406 align:start size:88% position:13%
- You can need a surgery
where they literally

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:23.176
have to splay the penis
to relieve the pressure.

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:24.811
Whenever I want to get
young men to do anything,

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:26.613
I just tell them it's going
to affect their schlongs.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:28.314 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, what about
you, though, Dr. Drew?

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:29.816
- Yeah.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.885
- When you were young and
dumb and full of questions.

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:33.119
- Yeah.

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:34.053
- Did you ever say,
"Hey, I'm going to do

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:35.355
"something like this.

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:36.556
"I'm going to try this."

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:38.958 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Hmm, we're really
going to get into this.

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.194
First of all, had there
been such a pill around,

00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:42.028
I probably would have taken it.

00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:43.496
- Yeah?

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:44.731
- Yeah, I probably... I was
young and dumb for sure.

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:47.934
- Besides the splayed
penis priapism surgery,

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:50.270 align:start size:97% position:3%
what is the worst thing
that could happen from them?

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.005
- Worst case, you
could wind up dead.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.706
- With a great dick.

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:55.041
- Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:56.476 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Voiceover] This
message brought to you

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:58.444 align:start size:94% position:6%
by Los Angeles Independent
Medical Providers.

00:02:58.444 --> 00:03:00.780
- We've all been there.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.917 align:start size:97% position:3%
You're at the checkout counter
at your gas station, 7-11,

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:06.085 align:start size:84% position:16%
wherever you buy
your shiny hot dogs,

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:09.923
and there greeting you is a
rack of mystery dick pills.

00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:12.926 align:start size:97% position:3%
They have names like Rock
Hard Weekend, and you're like,

00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:14.160
"All weekend?

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.496
"I have my sister's
graduation party.

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:18.431
"I don't want to
be hard for that."

00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:20.667
- Your dick is not a rhino.

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:23.736 align:start size:84% position:16%
- If you're a young
dude with a limp dong,

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:26.272
you probably have
intimacy issues.

00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:27.540
Go talk to somebody.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.375
- I'll talk to you
about your penis.

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:31.711
- No, I mean like a doctor.

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:34.013
- I was a doctor
in my home country.

00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:35.248
- No!

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:38.051 align:start size:81% position:19%
- A pill can't fix
a broken dicks.

00:03:39.953 --> 00:03:41.588
- Because I think I
speak for everyone

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:44.023
when I say I'd rather
deal with a limp dick

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:45.858
than a dead person.

00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:46.693
Well...

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:52.065 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Say no to gas
station dick pills.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:53.933
It's my proudest moment.

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:55.835
Right here, this is it.
