way and what you're looking at here is

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:19.740
way and what you're looking at here is
 

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.319

what we called a molecular shuttle

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:21.329
what we called a molecular shuttle
 

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:24.530
what we called a molecular shuttle
there's blue ring which is on this red

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:24.540
there's blue ring which is on this red
 

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:26.870
there's blue ring which is on this red
station as I might call it that on the

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880
station as I might call it that on the
 

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.120

left hand side moves to the one on the

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:29.130
left hand side moves to the one on the
 

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:30.830
left hand side moves to the one on the
right hand side and it moves back and

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840
right hand side and it moves back and
 

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.870
right hand side and it moves back and
forward and this is happening about

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880
forward and this is happening about
 

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:38.660
forward and this is happening about
2,000 times a second so this is the

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:38.670
2,000 times a second so this is the
 

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:42.770
2,000 times a second so this is the
first example of a potential or

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:42.780
first example of a potential or
 

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:46.610
first example of a potential or
prototype of a linear motor and you

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:46.620
prototype of a linear motor and you
 

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.010
prototype of a linear motor and you
haven't seen this in this movie however

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:49.020
haven't seen this in this movie however
 

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.260
haven't seen this in this movie however
the ring moves back and forward between

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:51.270
the ring moves back and forward between
 

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:56.380
the ring moves back and forward between
these two red stations now if we replace

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:56.390
these two red stations now if we replace
 

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:59.090
these two red stations now if we replace
two identical stations with two

00:17:59.090 --> 00:17:59.100
two identical stations with two
 

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.830
two identical stations with two
different ones so we make a bigger red

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840
different ones so we make a bigger red
 

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.340
different ones so we make a bigger red
one and one that is green and the one

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:04.350
one and one that is green and the one
 

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.790
one and one that is green and the one
that is green which is called benzidine

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:06.800
that is green which is called benzidine
 

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.440
that is green which is called benzidine
likes the blue better than the red and

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:09.450
likes the blue better than the red and
 

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:13.790
likes the blue better than the red and
so at room temperature it spends 84% of

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:13.800
so at room temperature it spends 84% of
 

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.130
so at room temperature it spends 84% of
its time on the green the blue ring and

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:16.140
its time on the green the blue ring and
 

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:20.600
its time on the green the blue ring and
only 16% on the red so this is what we

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:20.610
only 16% on the red so this is what we
 

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:22.240
only 16% on the red so this is what we
call a non degenerate

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:22.250
call a non degenerate
 

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:26.180
call a non degenerate
molecular shuttle and so again the movie

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:26.190
molecular shuttle and so again the movie
 

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:28.400
molecular shuttle and so again the movie
shows that it spends a little time on

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:28.410
shows that it spends a little time on
 

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:34.299
shows that it spends a little time on
the red and a lot of time on the green

00:18:34.299 --> 00:18:34.309
 
 

00:18:34.309 --> 00:18:36.980
 
but we can take this particular system

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:36.990

add some acid the protons will be
 

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.990
add some acid the protons will be
attached to the nitrogen and they will

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000
attached to the nitrogen and they will
 

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.450
attached to the nitrogen and they will
become positively charged and then

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:56.460
become positively charged and then
 

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.120

station then back and forward like this
on the other station and so what we do

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000
on the other station and so what we do
 

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.630
on the other station and so what we do
is look at a situation where the

00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:25.640
is look at a situation where the
 

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:28.660

of a hurricane and we need to dampen
 

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:34.870
of a hurricane and we need to dampen
down that movement in order to be able

00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880
down that movement in order to be able
 

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:37.150
down that movement in order to be able
to control it and then use it

00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:37.160
to control it and then use it
 

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:40.090
to control it and then use it
so the movement situation is a given

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:40.100
so the movement situation is a given
 

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:42.760
so the movement situation is a given

isn't that it's all passive but the fact

00:54:25.489 --> 00:54:25.499
isn't that it's all passive but the fact
 

00:54:25.499 --> 00:54:27.410
isn't that it's all passive but the fact
that we will be able to use almost

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:27.420
that we will be able to use almost
 

00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:31.120
