[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.290
SPEAKER: The man of the hour,
ladies and gents, Mr. Eazi.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.605
Let's celebrate that.

00:00:12.605 --> 00:00:13.595
Come on.

00:00:13.595 --> 00:00:14.585
Come on.

00:00:14.585 --> 00:00:16.070
You sit here.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.800
Give you that one.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.377
So the light streams here.

00:00:19.377 --> 00:00:20.210
MR. EAZI: All right.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.230
SPEAKER: All right.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.771
MR. EAZI: Yo.

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:24.990
SPEAKER: So you know, I
was advised not to do this,

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.120
but I have to ask.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.119
Can you start us off with
the signature, it's your boy,

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.659
Zaga Dat?

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:34.560
I can't-- I can't do it right.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.270
I can't do it right.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.950
Can you?

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.940
MR. EAZI: It's your boy Eazi.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.630
Zaga Dat.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.453
SPEAKER: Hey.

00:00:40.453 --> 00:00:41.900
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.620
SPEAKER: All right.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.690
Thank you so much
for joining us here.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.815
MR. EAZI: Yeah, thanks man.

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:51.760
SPEAKER: I know you've had a
crazy, crazy travel schedule.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.390
Stage at SXSW, sold out
crowd on the East Coast.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.750
Sold out crowd on this
side of the country.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.760
Congratulations on all that, and
we're happy to have you here.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.760
MR. EAZI: Likewise, man.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.610
SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.710
Awesome.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.050
So get started man.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.869
As we were putting
this together,

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.410
you know, you get
Africans in a room,

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.530
they always get energetic.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.570
People started arguing
about where you're from.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.190
Is he Nigerian?

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.650
Is he Kenyan?

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.450
So we said we'll just ask you.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.590
Or does it really matter?

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.150
MR. EAZI: I think
it doesn't matter.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.560
I'm always trying to run
away from that question.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.000
You know, but I'd like to think
that I'm Nigerian by birth.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.930
SPEAKER: OK.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.491
MR. EAZI: And then maybe
Ghanaian in the heart.

00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:40.478
AUDIENCE: That's right.

00:01:40.478 --> 00:01:42.850
MR. EAZI: You know,
because it's so funny.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.915
Is like, who I am
today is as a product

00:01:47.915 --> 00:01:51.950
or as a result of
both countries.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.820
Beats birth or stays cool life.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:03.140
I think I've lived most
of my aware life in Ghana.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.160
And I don't [INAUDIBLE]
Ghana, but--

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.235
it's

00:02:07.235 --> 00:02:10.560
SPEAKER: Let's give this
guy there his [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.440
Well, that's super exciting.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.380
And you know that's one of
the things that makes us

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.090
really excited about Mr. Eazi.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.750
That emphasis on it just
being African, and connecting

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.880
across the board.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.276
But how did you end up in Ghana?

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:25.150
Can you tell us a little
bit about the story?

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.050
MR. EAZI: I was done
with high school in 2006,

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.120
and then I remember I wanted to
go to Ontario to do aerospace

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.590
engineering.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.950
And then I think the fees, was
like, almost like 15 grand.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:44.930
Right?

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.440
And then I had to
go to the admission,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.210
and then I go to my dad,
and I told my dad, "Yo dad,

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.400
I've gotten admission, so you
need to give me 20 grand."

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.800
And then my dad, he
is like, oh, 20 grand?

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.490
I'm like, yeah, and that's just
fees, because I bumped it up.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.450
Like, that not pocket
money and [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.400
So whilst he was
thinking about it,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.680
my mom just shows
up with my sister,

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.850
and they say, oh, we've also
applied for you to go to Ghana,

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.400
and the fees is just 5,999.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.100
There's aerospace,
but we're able to get

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.420
you mechanical engineering.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.120
And you take almost
the same courses,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.700
so you could start
with mechanical

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.950
and then do aerospace masters.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.520
And my dad made the
economic decision.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.730
So he gave the excuse
that, he's like you know,

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.930
your mom have some
extended family in Ghana

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.770
and is good for you to bond
with them, and you know,

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:48.500
become African.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.930
So I go go Ghana, and before
I knew it I was in Kumasi.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.290
My mom actually lied to me.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.200
She's like, don't worry,
Kumasi is just like Ontario.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.030
Exactly the same,
with better weather.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.930
So yeah, I found myself
doing mechanical engineering,

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.430
and I fell in love
with the place.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.990
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.489
Yes, yes.

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:09.720
That's amazing.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.000
And the banku
addiction was born.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.899
So how did that
transition happen

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:22.070
from mechanical engineer,
studying mechanical engineering

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.650
to the Mr. Eazi
that we see today?

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.720
MR. EAZI: I think it is funny.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.360
I'd say it was born
out of the fact

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.360
that I always wanted to be
economically independent.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.000
So I remember in
my second year, I

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.030
went to Nigeria,
University of Lagos,

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.870
and then I found an old school
mate who was doing parties.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.920
So every weekend he would host
big parties, and at the time

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.300
he was writing a [? choral ?]
And that was the big deal.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.590
This is like 2009.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.990
And so, I just
thought to myself,

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.970
how can I start writing a
[? choral ?] in my school?

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.340
So I went back to school.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.360
At the time, my school was Kwama
Nkrumag University of Science

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.110
and Technology. .

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.380
I think we have
alumni over here.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.870
So my school was
very, very serious.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.599
Like people at the time just
used to focus on their studies.

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.640
And so I came there, and
I'm like, you know what?

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.710
Let's start partying.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.820
And I'm like you guys
can't only learn.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.180
You need to also party.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.770
So I started doing parties.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.720
That started being
very successful,

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.110
from parties, to concerts,
to fashion shows.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.990
At some point it was hard
for me to mix it with school,

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.750
because I was in the
club almost every time.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.610
And I feel whilst
doing the concerts,

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.680
I started booking some of the
biggest African artists, both

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.450
in Ghana and Nigeria
to come to my school.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.520
And before I knew it, I
was in studios with them.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:06.160
And then somewhere, somewhere
after grad, I started my MSC

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.650
and I just had so
much free time.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.800
And I was sick of clubbing
because, I'd done it all.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.950
So I start going to the
studio as a relaxation.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.690
And before you know it,
somebody is listening somewhere.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.330
Oh, Mr. Eazi, we love you.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.830
SPEAKER: OK.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.162
During your master's?

00:06:25.162 --> 00:06:26.620
MR. EAZI: Yeah,
during my master's.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.490
Specifically around the time
I was doing my [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.830
So during my
[INAUDIBLE], it was--

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.310
I had so much free
time, and for somebody

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.840
who's used to activity,
I was almost going crazy.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.750
So I just needed
something to do.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.690
And I remember one of my friends
who I'd booked in the past,

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.120
he just took me to the
studio for like two weeks.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.480
And we were recording,
and he said, oh, we'll

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.150
call it "About to Blow."

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.760
So we called it The Mixtape.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.900
We called it "About
to Blow, The Mixtape."

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.400
We put it on SoundCloud.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.230
At that time, I didn't
even put my face,

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.270
because obviously, I was trying
to have a different career.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.590
So I didn't want people--

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.650
I didn't want to go
to job interviews,

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.790
and then the guy would be
like, are you not the guy

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.780
who's singing somewhere?

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.790
I remember, I started
playing with cartoons.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.340
So I'd have this
friend who would

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.070
do animations, and
disguise my face so nobody

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.750
would know it's me.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:26.890
So yeah.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:28.041
SPEAKER: Nice, nice.

00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:30.040
What were you people doing
during your master's?

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:39.700
How did you get the parents
on board for that transition?

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.130
Everybody here that
knows African parents--

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:43.810
Was mechanical
engineering, you're

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:45.530
doing your master's, and now--

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:46.510
I want to do--

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.700
MR. EAZI: So you know
the thing is, is that's--

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.920
The thing is, my mom
and my dad always

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.630
thought I was just joking.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:59.035
Cause, you know cause, obviously
I was was still in school.

00:07:59.035 --> 00:08:00.767
I was still doing my master's.

00:08:00.767 --> 00:08:03.100
And to prove to them that I
was still doing my master's,

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.270
I would send them my grades.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.470
So, they knew I was--

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:06.690
SPEAKER: The real ones.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:10.630
MR. EAZI: Yeah, the real ones.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.550
So they knew I was
still in school.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.890
And then, I got a job.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.900
I got a job in a company
called Schlumberger.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.570
Schlumberger does well
services, testing, drilling.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:27.540
It was a huge deal at the time.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.295
SPEAKER: Still is.

00:08:28.295 --> 00:08:28.920
MR. EAZI: Yeah.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.065
And I worked there
for like eight months.

00:08:31.065 --> 00:08:31.910
SPEAKER: Oh wow.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.750
MR. EAZI: And I was
doing really good.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.250
And I was still
going to the studio,

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:40.620
so to them, they just thought
that that's his hobby.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.460
I feel there wasn't
much need to convince

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:49.080
them, cause I only decided
to do music full-time July 22

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:49.720
last year.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.550
So in July last
year, I get booked.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:57.320
I go to London, and then I
have two events in five days.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.900
I have a festival
that had 8,000 people.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:05.310
And four days later, I had
booked also Kentish Town,

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:06.980
that had almost 3,000 people.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:11.250
So in the space of five
days, I had 13,000 people

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.640
had come out to watch me.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.110
Plus, I had made over a hundred
grand pounds in those five

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.610
days.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.980
So when I called my
dad, I'm like, yo dad,

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.560
I just made a hundred grand.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:25.930
He's like 100,000 what?

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:27.810
I'm like 100,000 pounds.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.700
He's like from doing what?

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.680
I say yo, is like, I'm
a musician right now.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.392
He's like, oh, that's very good.

00:09:37.392 --> 00:09:38.100
That's very good.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.500
I need to change your name
to Mr. Eazi on my phone.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.420
So there was no need
to convince them.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.730
You know, cause like, I'd
basically already proven

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:51.310
that I could generate revenue.

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:54.680
And for the 10,000 people
to come watch you, it was--

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.670
I had the metrics basically.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.270
Basically my dad has
always been about--

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:05.620
He actually gave me a deadline
of around that time last year.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:10.730
Because after I finished my
MSC, I started doing my MSE,

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:13.500
I started doing some
gold trading business.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.080
And then I moved back
to Nigeria and started

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.680
a tech company, Phone Trader.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.920
But I wasn't really
generating good revenue,

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.890
so he just told me, you know
what, you have till July,

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.650
till the end of July,
and if you're not

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.670
generating funds from whatever
company you're pushing,

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:36.330
you might just have to go
back to work in Schlumberger,

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:37.460
or come work with me.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:41.250
Because he does ad-hoc
aviation services.

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.700
So I basically--

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.570
I was about to run
out of my deadline,

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:49.735
and then I start making
revenue, so he's like, OK, cool.

00:10:49.735 --> 00:10:52.020
I didn't need to
convince anybody anymore.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.910
SPEAKER: That's amazing.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.850
I think a lot of
Googler's ears perked up

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.600
as you're talking about the
metrics, and the revenues.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.980
People are hearing
some of the language

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.516
that we speak about every time.

00:11:03.516 --> 00:11:04.890
One of the things
that we know is

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:08.670
that it takes really great
people, and really great teams

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.140
to make anything amazing.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.060
So tell us a little
bit about the people

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.790
that we don't see that
are behind the scenes.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:19.980
MR. EAZI: Yeah, I have a very
small, very close knit thing.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.590
Because of the way the
music just snuck up on me.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:26.730
I remember the first time, the
first ever booking I had was

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:27.930
to go to the UK.

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:29.600
And at the time,
I had no manager.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.700
So I had this friend
who worked at Vodafone.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:38.250
He's a very big marketing
guy at Vodafone Ghana.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.620
So I called him to
act as my manager.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.720
So we walked into
the meeting, and I

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.960
was like this is my manager,
he works at Vodafone.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.530
You know.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:52.170
And basically we started
working together as my manager,

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.920
and he started handling
my affairs in Ghana.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.230
Especially marketing,
marketing myself in Ghana.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.770
And then I reached out
to my former rival.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:06.540
So in Uni, I used to--

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.700
At some point I had
monopoly, because I

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.680
was the only one doing parties.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.820
Then a year later, my current
manager, [INAUDIBLE], goes--

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.530
He was understudy me.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.840
He was like my boy,
he was at my parties.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.562
And next thing, he
goes to start his own--

00:12:22.562 --> 00:12:25.600
he goes to start
his own company.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.860
So I'm not going to
lie, I hated him.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.680
I felt he was he
was a snitch, cause

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.730
why would he be on my team
and suddenly go start out his?

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:39.960
So I remember, any time I saw
that he was putting events up,

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.600
I would put my event
the same day, just so

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.280
that I could flop his event.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:49.170
And I remember one time,
his event flopped my event,

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:50.550
so I couldn't take that defeat.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:51.540
I'm like, geez.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:52.920
So I called him up.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.450
I'm like, you know what--

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:56.960
The truth is, I knew
he had taken over,

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.440
cause he was under younger--

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.800
He had the younger people
coming to his party.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.590
And I was about to
graduate, so they liked him

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:06.150
because they felt oh, he was--

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:10.200
And he had so many fine
girls coming to his party.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.260
So I walk up to him.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.950
I told him,
[INAUDIBLE], you know

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:17.440
I'm the king of
this party business.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.010
I want to help you, I don't
want your parties to flop.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.710
Meanwhile, it was
my party flopping.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:28.870
And I told him that
we are not enemies,

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:30.190
the people are the enemy.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.710
So you know what we'll
do, let's collaborate,

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:35.410
and I would host a party,
and you will host the party.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.840
But we're the ones
behind both parties,

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.190
so that the customers will
feel that they are going to--

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.080
They will feel a
sense of competition,

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.640
and some will go to yours,
some will go to mine.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.630
But at the end of the day, we
are still the ones behind it,

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:50.510
and we make money.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:54.980
So we created like a
false competition scene.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.080
And so we started doing
parties and concerts together.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.010
So once it was time to--

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:04.200
Once I started seeing that
the music was getting real.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:08.500
At the time he was in South
Africa, because he's a pilot.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.800
So I just told him, and he
started handling my bookings.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.630
Because he was the
one that used the book

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.120
the artists back
in school, he was

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.940
very good at negotiating deals.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.870
So we rose from from--

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:24.250
The first ever booking I got was
like two grand, and by the time

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:27.660
he came on board, the next
booking we got was 10 grand,

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.130
12 grand, and we
just kept rising.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:36.180
So the team is just basically
the marketing lead in Ghana,

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:40.210
then [INAUDIBLE], then I
have my high school school

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:43.510
mate, who is now
my DJ tour manager,

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:47.700
then we have two people in
Nigeria who handle live events.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.870
And that's basically it.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.380
Every other person
is like ad-hoc hired.

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.920
SPEAKER: Yo, that's amazing.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.150
Such it's a small
team, do so much.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.340
It's incredible.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.130
I hope you guys are getting
your business school notes here.

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:06.419
Because you can't get
this stuff from class.

00:15:06.419 --> 00:15:07.960
Let's switch gears
a little bit less.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.350
Let's talk about the music.

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:14.200
I think one of the exciting
things that you've talked about

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.180
is how this kind
of snuck up on you.

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:19.730
But the music doesn't sound
like something that snuck up.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.670
It sounds like-- It's
a sound that people

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:25.570
feel like they just always had,
that they've been waiting for.

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:27.790
What are some of the
influences, and how did you

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:30.490
get to that identity?

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:34.960
MR. EAZI: I feel like
music is, for me, music

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.450
is an expression of myself.

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:40.900
And I'm a big believer
that human beings

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.150
are like a product of
their environments.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:48.430
And since the music comes from
the soul, it now defines me,

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:51.370
and I'm like an
easy going person.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:54.975
And then I've been influenced
by the cultures of Ghana

00:15:54.975 --> 00:15:58.030
and Nigeria, and you could
hear that in the music.

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:01.570
It is a mixture of
both influences.

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:05.140
And I feel for me, all the
times I was going to the studio

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.470
just to mess around, I
was actually practicing.

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:10.360
I was learning, because I have--

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.470
I'm sure if you
went back to Kumasi,

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:16.870
if you went back to that studio,
you would see maybe 100 songs.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.880
And I can assure you
those songs are whack.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:24.450
You know, but all those
times were formitive times.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:28.360
And yeah, by the time
I was ready to put out

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.980
the music properly, I just stuck
with what I had been doing.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:37.270
And I feel like there was the
need at every point in time,

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:40.270
and it will happen
in the future.

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.280
The sound always changes.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.730
The sound always changes.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:47.020
And trends, even in
fashion, trends change.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:51.580
And it's like a circle, it
goes round, around, around.

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.580
And so the trend
was about to change,

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:59.590
and I would just there to say
be the instigator of the trend

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.180
change.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.520
You know, it is what it is.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.220
SPEAKER: Capitalizing on a
opportunities of business

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.220
and music all around the board.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:12.310
So who are some of the folks you
were listening to growing up,

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:16.390
that you think you
hear now in your music?

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:19.569
MR. EAZI: I listened to a
whole lot of music growing up.

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:21.280
I listened to--

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.630
Because my dad was a
huge Bob Marley fan.

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:25.740
So I listened to a
lot of Bob Marley.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.245
I listened to a
lot of Dr. Alban.

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:33.550
In my Uni days, I got--

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.470
because of my roommate,
I got stuck up

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:40.090
listening to a lot of
Jay Z, Lil Wayne, Drake.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:41.470
You know.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:46.240
And yes, and of course a lot of
Nigerian music, like Lagbaja.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.090
And I feel like every
song I do, there's

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:52.672
a different part of that
influence that shows.

00:17:52.672 --> 00:17:55.090
"Bankulize" was one
of my first records,

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:59.440
was originally a Reggae record,
before "Juls" switched it

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.930
up to what it became.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.840
And that's why I call it
banku music, because it really

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.360
is Afro fusion music.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.750
Because in the bass is African
drums, and African feel.

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:13.270
By the end of the
day, I draw influences

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:16.840
from all genres of music.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:17.700
SPEAKER: Oh, dude.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:23.320
Banku music, Shitor, Tilapia.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.595
There's a lot of
music about the food.

00:18:26.595 --> 00:18:27.470
MR. EAZI: About food.

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.663
SPEAKER: About the food.

00:18:27.663 --> 00:18:28.413
What's that about?

00:18:28.413 --> 00:18:30.876
MR. EAZI: I think
I'm a low key foodie.

00:18:30.876 --> 00:18:31.660
Low key.

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.270
I believe if not for--

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:36.580
I feel like I have
a quick metabolism.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:39.160
If not for that,
I'll be really huge.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:43.900
I don't eat too
often, but when I eat,

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.090
I eat like for three people.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:48.610
You know, so so--

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:51.880
And you know for
me, since I was not

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.100
doing music to
become a superstar,

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.740
I was doing music as a hobby.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:00.850
So I had the freedom to
call my songs anything,

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:02.530
to say anything on the records.

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:08.150
Cause there was no intent of it
going beyond me or my friends.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:11.730
So it was as easy as, ah,
my friends eat Shitor.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:12.450
We love Shitor.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:14.660
So like oh Eazi, make
a song about Shitor.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:18.350
So I go to the studio,
and I make a song Shitor.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:21.410
It's crazy, oh we eat.

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.870
There's even a song I
have called "Plantain,"

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:28.210
because I love plantain, and
we made a song about that.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:31.346
So I feel it's cause there was--

00:19:31.346 --> 00:19:34.390
I'm a foodie, that's
why those names.

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:36.130
And because I was
just feeling free.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:41.920
And I feel for me, if success
would continue for me,

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.190
it's will have to be
about me not really caring

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:47.980
about making a hit record.

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.520
I would have to be sincere
every time I'm recording.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.220
And I feel is this
sincerity that people--

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.080
SPEAKER: Connect with.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.020
I have to say, that's
definitely something

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.760
I've heard consistently.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:07.020
That in some ways your songs are
almost bigger than Mr. Eazi is.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.140
Like a lot of people
know the music.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.280
They've never seen the guy.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.590
They don't really know
who the person is.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:16.640
And it seems like that
was by design initially.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.590
As you kind of move
into this next phase

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:22.805
where the music
is blowing up, how

00:20:22.805 --> 00:20:27.630
are you thinking about that,
and about your publicity,

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:30.680
and your personality,
like shining through?

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.070
MR. EAZI: Yeah, it's so
interesting to see that.

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:38.630
Like I and my team,
we basically see--

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:43.250
Now, I'm going to be saying Mr.
Eazi as like as a product, not

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:44.690
myself.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:47.330
So we basically see
Mr. Eazi as a product.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.120
Right?

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:53.180
And it is in the same vein,
if you had to product,

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:58.190
what you need to do is you
need to test the products.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:02.060
You need to go through
testing to be able to define

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.685
the market for the product.

00:21:03.685 --> 00:21:06.350
And when you define the
market for the products,

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:10.610
you run test to see if
the said market actually

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:13.070
buys in to the product
you're selling.

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.950
when you decide that, you
go on and do marketing.

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:17.390
So now your marketing
is not going

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:20.804
to be broad based, it's
going to be very direct--

00:21:20.804 --> 00:21:21.470
SPEAKER: Direct.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:24.560
MR. EAZI: --because you already
know who you are marketing to.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.170
And is the same thing we've
been doing with the music.

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:30.560
We found out that
Africans in diaspora

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.480
were the first to
embrace the music.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.410
And we started targeting
our markets and our touring

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.070
to Africans in diaspora.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:40.580
I remember, [INAUDIBLE] would
look up my YouTube views,

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:44.930
and he would see that the UK was
number one streaming position.

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:49.250
And we would just talk based on
stream data and even the store

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:50.290
that's the same way.

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:55.790
But that's why right now we're
doing a diaspora tour, reaching

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:58.400
out to the first fan base.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.070
And then to answer
your question, in June

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:05.270
we want to do a very
huge, both digital,

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:07.430
and above the line
marketing campaign.

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:10.310
Which we already started
with the mixtape,

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:12.050
which is billboards.

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:17.500
I think we had 25 billboards
across Nigeria and Ghana,

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.520
with Life is Easy on it.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.676
We had the London buses,
the London city buses.

00:22:23.676 --> 00:22:24.560
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.390
MR. EAZI: We had 12 routes.

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:29.790
We had the city buses
in Lagos as well.

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:33.050
And we will start a proper
marketing campaign called

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:35.060
Who is Mr. Eazi in June.

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:40.540
This time I would have my
face fully on every add,

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.640
and we would run
it both targeted

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.580
at our diaspora
audience, and then

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.080
back home, African audience.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:53.510
So by last quarter,
by Q4 of this year,

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:55.032
everybody should know Mr. Eazi.

00:22:55.032 --> 00:22:56.240
SPEAKER: Should know Mr Eazi.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.180
more worry about
the job interviews.

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:01.482
Dude, that's amazing.

00:23:01.482 --> 00:23:03.440
You started talking a
little bit about YouTube,

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.410
so let's chat a little bit
about this online platform

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:08.150
that you guys are using.

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:10.832
And I know there are a lot of
people in the room interested

00:23:10.832 --> 00:23:12.790
to understand how you
guys are using technology

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:17.960
to power this zero to
1,000 rise that you've had

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.180
in the last year and a half.

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:19.805
MR. EAZI: Yeah.

00:23:19.805 --> 00:23:27.050
I'd say my success at this point
has been just as a result of me

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:30.680
leveraging on an online product.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:34.410
So for instance, I'm
very big on Twitter.

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:38.720
It's almost as if I'm
on Twitter 24 hours,

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.620
and that's cause if
I'm not tweeting,

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.790
my team member in
London is tweeting,

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:46.900
or somebody in Nigeria
is handling the Twitter.

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:50.060
But what we-- and
this was [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.209
shout out to the
manager in Ghana.

00:23:52.209 --> 00:23:53.750
He just said, you
know what, if we're

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:57.830
seeing Mr. Eazi as a product,
then almost every company

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:01.850
spends a healthy amount
of their budget trying

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:03.830
to connect with the
consumers, trying

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:06.140
to connect with the customers.

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.870
So what we started
doing was, I remember,

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:11.420
we would search on Twitter.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:14.120
We would search Mr.
Eazi, and everybody

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.405
who mentions anything about
Mr. Eazi, we would retweet.

00:24:17.405 --> 00:24:20.870
We would say oh, zaga dat,
zaga dat, zaga dat, zaga dat.

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:24.224
And my fans started to
see it as something huge.

00:24:24.224 --> 00:24:26.390
I remember I would see, all
oh my God, Mr. Eazi just

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:27.530
replied me.

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:30.270
And someone else
was following them

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:32.645
and doesn't know Mr. Eazi
would be like, who is Mr. Eazi?

00:24:32.645 --> 00:24:34.340
Why are you excited?

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:37.400
Next thing, when we see
that trend, we would follow.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.060
We'd say a SoundCloud link.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.737
We would be like oh, this is Mr.
Eazi here, listen to his music.

00:24:41.737 --> 00:24:42.320
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.940
We will just have
to pause there,

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.220
so people can
understand the marketing

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.480
magic that was just dropped.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.800
A mouthful, that's amazing.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.530
MR. EAZI: So we were
taking our time to do that.

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:57.110
It was hectic, but
we saw it work.

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:59.750
What we began to
see is that even

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:02.060
though we didn't have a lot
of followers on Twitter,

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:02.560
until now.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:06.400
I now have a lot of followers,
but the interaction on a tweet

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.250
was more than the
average interaction

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:11.530
for an artist who was bigger.

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:13.720
And this was because the fans--

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.070
It was now a personal
relationship.

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:19.750
Like till today, I still, at
concerts backstage, I still

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:21.850
meet fans who call
me by my first name.

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:22.600
Hey, Tosin.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.430
And I'm like, I don't
know this person,

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:29.730
but just because of our
relationship on Twitter.

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:32.650
And it was the same thing
we did for Instagram.

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:34.780
For instance, we started to do--

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:40.060
Even as cheap as $10 a day,
$20 a day Instagram ads.

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:43.060
And let's I go to a
show and I shut it down,

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.160
we will take the
video clip and we

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.530
would promote it,
to try and target

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:48.745
between Ghana and Nigeria.

00:25:48.745 --> 00:25:52.350
We'll promote it and we'll
see our followers rise,

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:56.270
or we'll see people paying
more attention to our music.

00:25:56.270 --> 00:26:00.350
So it was, we were
heavy on Twitter,

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:02.620
we are heavy on Instagram.

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:04.930
We started doing
work on Facebook.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:09.520
And then I remember, we
started doing YouTube ads.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:14.050
I remember one day, I don't know
where, I think I was in Ghana,

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:15.940
and I was about
to watch a video.

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:19.012
And then I saw
another video play.

00:26:19.012 --> 00:26:19.720
It was for an ad.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.180
Maybe it was for
Nescafe or something.

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:25.030
I saw it play before the
video, and I had to watch it.

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:26.890
I had to watch it for
at least six seconds.

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:33.340
And then I said wow, I
think we need to do this,

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:37.690
and we basically started
doing the same for my videos.

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:41.870
And I feel like that just
basically-- that's the tool,

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:44.654
and it's been very effective.

00:26:44.654 --> 00:26:45.320
It's been cheap.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:51.280
We've not needed to get
outside funding for Mr. Eazi.

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.950
SPEAKER: Yo, that's
awesome to hear.

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:56.620
Are there any challenges
that you guys are having?

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:58.870
Because we have a lot
of people in the room,

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:00.640
thinking about these products.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:04.870
Do we have any
YouTubers in the room?

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:05.500
OK.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.930
We have some
YouTubers in the room.

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:10.450
Thinking about these products,
and thinking about ways

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:12.172
to make them better
for your use cases,

00:27:12.172 --> 00:27:14.380
are things you're trying to
do, pulling in this data.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:17.220
Is there anything that, you've
been looking at this person,

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:22.960
like man if it just did this,
we would be so much happier?

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:27.250
MR. EAZI: I feel,
for us, we've been--

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:32.080
And I think I'm right,
we've been kind of good

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.510
with the services.

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:36.910
For instance, we registered
to use the YouTube

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:42.709
Space in New York, to shoot like
a dance video for my mixtape.

00:27:42.709 --> 00:27:44.125
We thought that
was very cool when

00:27:44.125 --> 00:27:48.070
we found out that, you know.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:51.220
We've also been using the data.

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.710
The only thing is,
that for some countries

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:56.140
you can't trickle
down on the data.

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:59.480
Say for the US, you could
trickle down to see, OK,

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.700
it's New York,
it's Austin, it's--

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:06.100
And so we are better
informed to tour.

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:11.240
We know that if we have a steady
20,000 streams from YouTubers

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.920
in New York, then we could
do a 2,000 capacity show.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.070
In New York, is a no-brainer.

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:19.600
But we can't do that
for some of the cities,

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:26.920
because it's just broad, to
just country-based data you see.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.780
Yeah, and I feel like
we're just trying to--

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:31.810
It's something I
was starting with.

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:36.130
We're just trying to see
how to use the ads well.

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:39.760
Because I feel like we are
just learning on the job,

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.490
and it's providing
amazing results.

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:45.270
And you can imagine, if
we were proper, proper.

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:51.090
We proper knew how to use
AdWords, and use all these ads.

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:55.332
We'll be like unstoppable.

00:28:55.332 --> 00:28:56.040
SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:56.930
Awesome, awesome.

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:59.620
So all the YouTubers in the
room, I hope you're listening.

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:03.730
We have some data people
in the back [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:06.340
We need to drill in on
some of these countries.

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:07.680
So cool.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.940
We're almost out of
time, so I'll just

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:12.600
jump to kind of
the tech start-ups.

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.100
I know you talked a
little bit about them,

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:18.390
but tell us more
about the businesses.

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:20.590
You know, where they ended
up once the music started

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:23.710
blowing up.

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:26.830
MR. EAZI: Yes, so I was in
this incubator program called

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:30.940
[INAUDIBLE] TNG,
and that day I got

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:33.370
to work with a lot
of programmers,

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:35.710
a lot of innovators.

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:38.410
For instance, there was
this app called Pass.ng.

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:42.610
Pass.ng is a testing app.

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:44.800
So basically, there's
a test you take

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:48.480
to get into Nigerian University,
which is called the jump.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.920
Now Pass.ng.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:55.840
has all the test questions from
like 20 years back, on the up.

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.940
And then it makes it
a fun way to test.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:02.620
And then the more you
test, you get freebies.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:03.540
You could win stuff.

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:04.415
And then people pay--

00:30:04.415 --> 00:30:05.248
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:30:05.248 --> 00:30:07.600
MR. EAZI: Yes, give
me [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:12.590
People pay via the
networks, say, pay via MTN

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:15.200
or pay via [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:20.050
So that's one of the products I
was involved with studying on.

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:22.000
And it still works now.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.730
I believe last time
it was generating

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.520
like 50 grand monthly.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:30.040
50 to 100 grand monthly revenue.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.090
Then, Phone Trader still works.

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:34.534
We have seven
outlets in Nigeria.

00:30:34.534 --> 00:30:35.950
SPEAKER: So, what
is Phone Trader?

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:37.408
MR. EAZI: So Phone
Trader is like--

00:30:37.408 --> 00:30:39.160
How do I explain it?

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.130
Phone Trader is like
a car phone warehouse.

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:45.410
What we do is, we
buy used phones.

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:52.600
So say for instance, there's
about to be a new, maybe

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.860
for instance, the Samsung
Galaxy S5 is about to drop.

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.090
Then we would--

00:30:58.090 --> 00:30:59.725
Since we operate
from the telcos,

00:30:59.725 --> 00:31:03.700
we will have people
come out, and we

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.790
will buy the S4s
from them, and we'll

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:09.220
give them discounts on the S5.

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:14.140
And we will in turn take the
S4s, and do a mini refurb

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:19.780
and sell the S4s with 30
day warranty to customers.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:23.210
So we would basically
do that across a couple

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:27.240
of brands in Nigeria, and
we offer repair services.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.520
So you could find out
how much your phone

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:35.160
is worth by going on the website
and entering the details.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.810
And Phone Trader is
still operational.

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:43.150
My friend runs it, because
obviously I'm somewhere else.

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:47.290
And ultimately, what I'm
trying to do is get to a point

00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:52.720
where I can merge the brand
Mr. Eazi with the products.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:56.590
And even within, I'm searching
for like tech products that

00:31:56.590 --> 00:32:01.590
are relevant to the
music in Africa,

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:03.710
that I can launch at the point.

00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:04.840
See, when I have--

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.000
Because the music
gives you influence

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.930
and is as easy as me
saying oh, use this app,

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:12.930
or use this service.

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:14.590
And people would
just go just based

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:17.910
on the fact that Mr. Eazi
says those we should use it.

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:20.980
Yeah, exciting, exciting times.

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:21.730
Looking forward.

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:22.730
SPEAKER: That's amazing.

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:25.021
If you guys have start-ups
that you're trying to pitch.

00:32:25.021 --> 00:32:27.250
Get ready now.

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:31.030
Get him for five minutes
after the conversation.

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:36.700
So what's next for Mr. Eazi
as you're kind of going this--

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:38.090
go through this next phase?

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:41.566
I've heard some
rumblings of Eazi Core.

00:32:41.566 --> 00:32:46.860
MR. EAZI: Yeah, so
basically since it's--

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:49.030
This is no more a joke.

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:51.950
You know, cause like there's
a lot of people involved.

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:56.539
SPEAKER: 50 million streams
later, Eazi realizes.

00:32:56.539 --> 00:32:58.330
MR. EAZI: There's a
lot of people involved.

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:03.490
I mean, I've played shows
in places like Ukraine,

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:05.131
done like two shows in Ukraine.

00:33:05.131 --> 00:33:06.130
SPEAKER: That's amazing.

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:07.338
MR. EAZI: I've gone to Dubai.

00:33:07.338 --> 00:33:11.240
SPEAKER: So who is the
audience in Ukraine?

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:15.350
MR. EAZI: So it's funny,
Ukraine has thus far been--

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:18.160
OK, next to Cyprus,
it has thus far

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.590
been my most diverse audience.

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:23.120
Ukraine was the
first place I got to,

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.870
and I look in the
crowd, and I'm wondering

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:27.440
are these guys
here for Mr. Eazi?

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.030
I'm like seeing everybody, not
just Afrikaans in diaspora.

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:33.300
I'm seeing everybody
there, and I'm wondering--

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:33.890
SPEAKER: That's beautiful.

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:35.473
MR. EAZI: And I
remember in Ukraine, I

00:33:35.473 --> 00:33:38.710
was singing this song,
and I go up to this chic.

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:40.540
And then she's Scandinavian.

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:42.790
And then I'm singing,
and I put the mic,

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:46.310
because I really want to test
to see if she knows the song.

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:48.429
And then I put the mic,
and she's singing it.

00:33:48.429 --> 00:33:50.220
And in my mind I'm
like, what does she even

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:52.290
know what she's singing?

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:56.130
You know so, it's not--

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:58.210
We've realized it's not
a joke, because we're

00:33:58.210 --> 00:33:59.230
doing good revenue.

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:03.870
We're having a lot of people
who are positives on our PNL.

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:07.330
And now, we've seen that,
we've changed again,

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:09.790
we've just destructed
how African

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:11.320
music used to be put out.

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:14.330
We've leveraged on
technology to put out

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:16.060
the music in a cheap way.

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:19.179
We've hit people online, and
because it's buzzing online,

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:20.860
the radio is forced to take it.

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:24.219
We've never had to sell the
seats for any radio play,

00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:26.350
or TV play, or interview.

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:29.830
It just comes based on the
fact that we're online.

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:32.560
And sometimes I spark things.

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:36.720
I see things on Twitter,
just to get people riled up.

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:37.826
To keep the conversation.

00:34:37.826 --> 00:34:39.159
SPEAKER: Start the Twitter wars.

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:40.159
MR. EAZI: You know, so--

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:43.810
We're about to launch
what's called Eazi Core.

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:45.940
Eazi Core is supposed
to be a platform

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:51.310
to break African artists, break
African artists in general.

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:55.360
Both in an Africa
and in diaspora.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.390
So it will just be a
management platform where

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:00.130
we help you put out your music.

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:02.040
We help you do marketing.

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:06.330
We do an 80-20 partnership
with you, so we,

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:10.180
as a management take 80% of the
revenue, and you as the artist

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:11.280
takes 80%.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.860
And you still have
the independence.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:16.380
And so we're in the
process of that.

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:22.470
We're in the process of doing
huge JV type, or distribution

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:26.130
type of publishing type,
basically partnerships

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:29.430
with bigger organizations.
so that once you put out

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:32.220
your music in Tanzania,
it can immediately

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:37.290
get across Africa in
diaspora with just one email.

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:40.740
You know so, that's basically
what we're working on.

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.440
And we're also working
on the marketing

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.089
campaign we want to launch
which is, Who is Mr. Eazi?

00:35:46.089 --> 00:35:47.130
SPEAKER: Who is Mr. Eazi?

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:47.580
Awesome.

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:47.960
Awesome.

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:48.459
Awesome.

00:35:48.459 --> 00:35:52.260
So guys, we're going to
shift into questions,

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:53.684
live questions and
Dory questions.

00:35:53.684 --> 00:35:56.100
I'm going to have the first
live question, because there's

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:57.380
something I want to ask about.

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:01.720
Thank you so much Tonya.

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:07.530
You just hit on the
success in the Ukraine,

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:12.290
and this globalization
of the African sound.

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:15.900
You were recently covered in
"Vogue," "New Sound of Africa."

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:19.630
A lot of really
exciting things, Wizkid

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:22.770
signed here in the States.

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:24.870
21 Savage, as well.

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:29.220
What is going on with the
proliferation of the sound?

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.150
And it a good thing?

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:31.790
Is it a bad thing?

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:32.804
How do you see it?

00:36:32.804 --> 00:36:34.470
MR. EAZI: I feel like
it's a good thing.

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:36.270
I feel like, with
all due respect,

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:39.540
I feel like African
music is the new reggae.

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:40.929
You know, is the new dance hall.

00:36:40.929 --> 00:36:41.720
SPEAKER: All right.

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:43.410
Let's pause right there.

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:46.832
Get your Twitter fingers ready.

00:36:46.832 --> 00:36:48.290
MR. EAZI: You know,
it is exciting.

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:52.110
But I feel like this
excitement and this move

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:56.580
has been powered by
Africans in diaspora.

00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:00.420
And is being powered by
an order to call it dance.

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:04.170
Because African music
is very redeeming,

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:07.610
there's been a lot
of dance related--

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:10.110
I feel has been followed by
dance, and it is exciting.

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:12.690
And dance is a language
everybody understands.

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:15.580
And it's only going
down to the artist.

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:16.470
So it's good.

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:20.220
I just feel we as
African artists just need

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:22.320
to be able to benefit from it.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:26.910
Like if someone like Bob
Marley could move reggae music

00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:31.170
from Jamaica to the world,
there should be African artists

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:33.090
who spearhead this movement.

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:35.790
And I feel it is a
global space now.

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:36.900
There's nothing hidden.

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.950
Everything is on the internet.

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:41.860
So we just need to
position ourselves well

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:45.640
to be partakers of--

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.982
I'm sounding like my pastor.

00:37:48.982 --> 00:37:52.652
Be partakers of the new wave.

00:37:52.652 --> 00:37:53.360
SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.790
What Can people in this
room do to make sure

00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:59.190
that African artists
and Africans in general

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:01.940
are partakers of that next wave?

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.670
MR. EAZI: I feel,
first off is like--

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:06.620
And is something we always do.

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:09.020
I feel like the first
thing is like education.

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.680
You know, education.

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:14.640
Like letting people know
things that can be done.

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:15.450
Partnerships.

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:19.277
Like everything we've done has
been a lot on partnerships.

00:38:19.277 --> 00:38:21.360
For instance, we've been
partnering with streaming

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:24.010
platforms, and
they've been giving us

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:29.000
banners in countries outside
of Nigeria and Ghana.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.905
So I remember when I
released my mixtape,

00:38:30.905 --> 00:38:36.530
I had banners in Germany, in
Korea, on the storefronts.

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:39.720
And that way, I had
people from there--

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.010
OK who is this guy?

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:42.330
Let me listen to the music.

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:45.960
So I feel like if
there's anybody

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.840
that has the power to
actually break African music,

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.430
it's the tech companies.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:55.260
Because they have platforms that
the whole world is logged onto.

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:58.260
The whole world is on
YouTube, is on Facebook,

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:03.630
is on Apple Music, is on
Spotify, blah, blah, blah.

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:08.010
And partnerships like
that would help elevate.

00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:09.830
For instance, I
might have a concert,

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:15.060
and get it live streamed
and have some ads around it.

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:17.190
Things like that, basically.

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:21.258
And if you guys can give
us like Google credits.

00:39:21.258 --> 00:39:23.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:26.550
SPEAKER: Well, you guys
heard it live and direct.

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:29.640
I think we have our
assignments, our work to do.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.590
With that said, let's
jump to questions.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:35.540
Do we have live questions in
the room to get started with?

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:36.390
AUDIENCE: Hi, yes.

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:38.370
So my name is Jeff.

00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:43.080
You mentioned that you do
have people on diaspora who

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.330
are listening to you, and
you also have local artists.

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:46.010
Right?

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:48.520
Or local audience.

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:51.180
So how exactly do you
go about making sure

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:54.905
that you're not alienating
maybe the people in diaspora,

00:39:54.905 --> 00:39:59.440
or sort of like the more native
words that you might say.

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:03.490
Maybe you say a few words,
or [INAUDIBLE] words.

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:06.850
How do you make sure
that you're not sort of--

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:07.670
Which yeah.

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:09.680
How do you target your audience?

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:12.440
MR. EAZI: So basically, the
thing like I was saying,

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:15.620
I thought that there would
have been a direct need

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:18.630
to water down the lyrics.

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:21.650
So water down the use
of indigenous terms

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:23.620
and language in the music.

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:27.440
But like I said, I went out
to Ukraine, and I was singing.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:31.180
I think I was singing
"Shitor," or something.

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:34.910
I was singing a song and
this Scandinavian girl

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:36.530
was singing everything
word for word.

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:39.440
And she still kind of
understood what the song

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.450
was about and the vibe.

00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:48.490
So music is now beyond language,
because music is a soul thing.

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:50.510
And I feel like the soul has--

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:53.120
There's one language
that the soul understands

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.560
and it's sound.

00:40:54.560 --> 00:41:00.050
You know so, in that regard
I feel like you still

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:01.380
want to keep it original.

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:04.140
You still want to
keep the content 100%.

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:06.794
So I feel like there
shouldn't be any--

00:41:06.794 --> 00:41:08.210
and that's just
my opinion-- there

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:13.010
shouldn't be any
overly intention

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:15.940
to water down the music.

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:19.340
But of course, as we
travel, like for instance,

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:20.330
I'm in the US now.

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:21.889
I'm hearing new words.

00:41:21.889 --> 00:41:22.805
I'm hearing new music.

00:41:22.805 --> 00:41:28.380
It will reflect in the music
and maybe it might be more--

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:31.520
Someone in diaspora will be
able to relate to it more.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.554
And it's very good you
asked that question,

00:41:33.554 --> 00:41:34.970
because I was
listening to a song,

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:38.090
there's a song called
"Run Up," by Major Lazer.

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:42.110
And he has the
Afrobeat instrumental,

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:46.010
but it has English
throughout in the song.

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:48.830
And I can see how the
song is really huge.

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:50.990
So it's something we've
been thinking about.

00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:55.190
But I feel there shouldn't
be any direct watering down.

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:57.330
We should just follow the vibe.

00:41:57.330 --> 00:42:01.250
If I hear the song and I decide
to sing 100% English, I will.

00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:04.850
If I decide to mix it with
Ghana language and Nigerian

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:06.515
languages, it's a vibe.

00:42:06.515 --> 00:42:09.272
People will still relate to
it as long as good music.

00:42:09.272 --> 00:42:10.730
AUDIENCE: So we've
been celebrating

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:13.560
the rise of African music in
general all across the globe,

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:16.152
but there's been a trend and--

00:42:16.152 --> 00:42:18.110
I know, just because I
just came out of school,

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:19.735
there was always
backlash about artists

00:42:19.735 --> 00:42:22.475
like Drake using a lot
of African inflection

00:42:22.475 --> 00:42:25.160
in how they speak
or their music.

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:28.490
And I wonder, as an artist,
what's your take on that,

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:30.140
on other artists doing that?

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:34.640
MR. EAZI: So I feel like to be--

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:38.690
If I was pissed at that
as an African artist,

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:44.100
then the guy out in Jamaica
should also be pissed.

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:47.330
And even in, like
for instance, when

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:49.790
I was doing mining in Ghana.

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:54.200
In the hinterlands of Ghana,
where there was no network.

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:57.980
I'm talking where we're mining
for gold deep in the Bush.

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:00.980
I met these guys who only
listened to country music.

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:05.050
They are listening to country
music in the hinterland,

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:07.850
and they're asking me, oh,
do you know this artist?

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:09.480
Do you know this artist?

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:12.290
And they don't even
speak, they don't even

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:14.150
speak proper English,
and these guys

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:16.500
are vibing to
country music there.

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:20.690
So I feel like if anything,
I think is kind of positive.

00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:24.980
And I feel like it's left
to the African artist

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:26.890
to take advantage of that.

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:28.440
Cause let me give
you an example.

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:33.550
So say you might see one dance
is heavy on African influence,

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:35.000
and you can see
it in the groove.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.490
And then there's a UK
artist on the record,

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:39.640
and there's an African
artist on the record.

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:44.060
And because someone like
Drake has jumped on it

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:48.740
and, has made it a pop
sound, someone who would have

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.860
never loved that sound,
that would have never heard

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:54.350
about that sound, is now
familiar with the sound.

00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:58.820
And tomorrow, when he hears
another sound that's familiar,

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:00.470
he would love it.

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:07.790
A typical example, sometime
last year I opened my Instagram

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:11.570
and I saw Rita Ora
had reached out to me.

00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:13.960
And I'm like, yo, is
this the real Rita Ora?

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.160
And then I click.

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.112
Are you the real Rita Ora?

00:44:17.112 --> 00:44:19.700
She's like,yeah.

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:21.650
She sends me her
number, and then I

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:24.536
FaceTime to be sure
that she's the one.

00:44:24.536 --> 00:44:25.492
I see she's the one.

00:44:25.492 --> 00:44:27.740
But basically, how
did that happen?

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:32.000
She had heard a record
play on Spotify.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:32.670
Right?

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:36.860
And this record was by,
I think maybe it was even

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:39.500
a Drake record, but
she heard a record that

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:41.400
sounded like my record.

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:47.000
And you know how the app just
basically randomly puts bids

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.720
on sounds related to this?

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:52.550
And she heard it, and she's
like, oh, what music is this?

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:53.920
She heard it, she was loving it.

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.690
Next thing she goes
out to social media,

00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:57.890
she sees me there,
and she reaches out.

00:44:57.890 --> 00:45:01.540
So I feel it is very positive
for us, and we have to ride it.

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:03.230
Because at the end
of the day, if you

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:05.290
are the source of
the sound then you

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:08.350
should be able to
do the sound well.

00:45:08.350 --> 00:45:12.880
Because the source
will remain authentic.

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.580
So it's just left
for us to ride on it.

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:17.740
Say if I had a
record with Drake.

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:22.020
For instance, today I
would basically tell it--

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:24.040
Part of the agreement
for doing the record

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:27.970
will be that I will open
for you in say, 10 shows.

00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:31.480
So any time you want to perform
10 shows, I will open for you,

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:34.360
and I will perform that
record with you on five shows.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.695
And that way it's
going to help me.

00:45:36.695 --> 00:45:38.320
It's going to help
me as an African, is

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:39.320
going to help the sound.

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:42.290
So I feel like, if anything,
we should take advantage.

00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:46.360
And if there were any time
to market African music,

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.500
I feel this is the time.

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:51.730
We should be ready to
market African music

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:55.490
and that's what hopefully we'll
be able to do it this year.

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:56.050
SPEAKER: Yo.

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:57.190
That's exciting man.

00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:58.890
Aren't you guys
excited about that?

00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:02.129
You got to jump in on this.

00:46:02.129 --> 00:46:03.670
So we have some
questions on the Dory

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:06.610
from people watching
from Dublin right now,

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:08.830
and from all our
different offices.

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:10.865
So we're going to jump
into some of those.

00:46:10.865 --> 00:46:11.847
And New York.

00:46:11.847 --> 00:46:13.930
So we'll go to New York
question from [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:13.930 --> 00:46:17.050
She asks, what's your
creative process like?

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:19.720
How do you go about creating
beats, sounds, lyrics,

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:21.680
and where do you
draw inspiration?

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:25.320
MR. EAZI: Yeah, so I draw
inspiration from life,

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:29.080
from anything, anything random.

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:33.730
It could be a sound I heard
or something somebody told me.

00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:37.150
For instance, my little
single "Leg Over,"

00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:40.580
was basically someone who was--

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:41.380
[COUGHING]

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:42.510
Sorry.

00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:45.640
Someone had told me about
how his girlfriend was

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:49.870
playing on him with somebody,
sending her money from London.

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:51.150
So he just told me the story.

00:46:54.370 --> 00:46:56.260
He just told me the
story in passing.

00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:58.120
He was just like yo,
Mr. Eazi, can you

00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.220
imagine my girlfriend
has been cheating on me?

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:03.920
She has another guy in
London who sends her money.

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:05.620
And every time she
says she's going

00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:09.280
to London to see her uncle,
she's going to see him.

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:10.750
And I was laughing at that.

00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:11.620
Oh, sorry.

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:12.520
Sorry.

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:15.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:18.220
And then again, I
get in the studio,

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:21.380
and then we were
just making the beat.

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:25.090
And then unknowingly,
I'm exposing him.

00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:27.390
The first thing to
come out of my head,

00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:29.290
maybe confused me
with her [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:31.750
We should get the guy when he
send that money from London.

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:36.160
So I basically put his
story on the record.

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:38.090
I've not apologized to him.

00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:39.795
SPEAKER: Do it right now.

00:47:39.795 --> 00:47:41.080
Just look at the camera.

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:42.315
MR. EAZI: Yo, I apologize.

00:47:42.315 --> 00:47:46.310
If I say your name now,
they will know it's you.

00:47:46.310 --> 00:47:50.770
You know and that's
exactly how I create music.

00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:52.840
I feel like, and
that's the reason

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:56.510
why I won't say I make
hit record or pop records.

00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:58.400
I make records
people can relate to.

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:01.780
And so whether they are in the
club or they're in the car,

00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:04.930
or they're at home, there's
something they can relate to.

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:07.030
And that's my creative process.

00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:08.620
It's very random, very random.

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:10.350
SPEAKER: Yo, that's dope.

00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:15.430
So, next question on the Dory.

00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:18.536
African music is blowing up,
like you just talked about.

00:48:18.536 --> 00:48:21.100
Do you think it's
going to help the image

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.110
or the way people
think about Africa?

00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:28.080
Do you think it's going to
change Africa as a country?

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:29.840
$1 a day type stuff?

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:32.950
Anything around some
of the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:36.340
MR. EAZI: That's why my
team were talking about.

00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:38.140
It still boils down to us.

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:39.930
For instance, if--

00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:41.980
OK, African music is blowing up.

00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:47.020
If say, I blow up in--

00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:50.230
Even now, as a teaser
right now for myself,

00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:53.750
the next video we're
going to put out from June

00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:55.300
is for a song called "Tilapia."

00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:58.480
And we're going to Ghana
to shoot "Tilapia."

00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.010
And we're going to project.

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:03.100
We're going to show
Ghana as it is.

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:05.830
For somebody who is in
Russia listening to my music

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:09.190
and watching my video, he or
she will then see that wow,

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:11.420
this is in Ghana.

00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:14.260
OK, maybe I need to go there.

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:18.310
I've heard that there's a place
we shot my video, "Skin Tight."

00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:22.270
we shot it out was out in
the lodge just between Ghana

00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:25.240
and I think is Burkina Faso.

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:26.950
They have this reserve there.

00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:28.450
And then the owners
of the reserve

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:31.690
has told us that ever since
we dropped that video,

00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:33.610
his place has been booked out.

00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:36.550
People contacting him from
all parts of the world.

00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:40.150
And it's only because they
saw that in the video.

00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:43.870
Now if I decide to be,
as an African artist,

00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:45.655
if I decide to start
shooting videos--

00:49:45.655 --> 00:49:47.110
SPEAKER: In London.

00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:50.320
MR. EAZI: --in London
or here, and all

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:53.530
I'm showing is the
big Ferrari, and some

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:55.660
chics just dancing around.

00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.150
You know, I'm not doing
anything to help the culture

00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:59.817
or to represent myself.

00:49:59.817 --> 00:50:01.400
And that's what we
need to learn from,

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:02.524
like the dance hall artist.

00:50:02.524 --> 00:50:05.450
The dance hall artists,
they to keep it 100.

00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:07.051
That keep their videos as it is.

00:50:07.051 --> 00:50:08.800
SPEAKER: You feel like
you're in Kingston.

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:11.420
MR. EAZI: You know, and
that's why there's--

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:15.630
I feel like that's why dance
hall and reggae culture

00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:20.500
is popular because, the
artist drove the culture.

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:24.150
it is left to us to
actually actually do that.

00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.870
SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:25.370
Awesome.

00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:27.100
So final question.

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:29.315
Specially saved for last.

00:50:29.315 --> 00:50:34.280
You know, some fights might
break out on this one.

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:34.910
From Dublin.

00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:40.270
This is from Dublin also.

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:44.750
So you've infiltrated
both Ghanaian and Nigerian

00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:46.420
industries super well.

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:49.240
African music
overall are, Right?

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:53.530
But the main question
is, which is better?

00:50:53.530 --> 00:50:56.460
Ghana jollof or Nigeria jollof?

00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:59.950
And for people don't know
jollof, Google can help you.

00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:01.450
Just that's why we're here.

00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:02.430
Just google it.

00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:03.940
But what is better?

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:06.460
Ghana jollof or Niger jollof?

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:09.310
MR. EAZI: Man, I
feel like on a--

00:51:09.310 --> 00:51:11.190
on a--

00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:14.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:21.620
On a Saturday, on a Saturday
evening wedding in Lagos,

00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:22.930
Nigerian jollof.

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:28.873
On a Friday evening,
Ghana jollof.

00:51:28.873 --> 00:51:31.840
So at the end of the day,
depends on where you are.

00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:33.080
On your mood.

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:34.610
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:35.220
Brilliant.

00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:36.880
Brilliant answer.

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:39.410
With that, please let's
just celebrate Mr. Eazi, ,

00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:41.510
and thank him for joining us.

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:45.160
[APPLAUSE]
