Every December, neighbors
all over the country

00:00:02.603 --> 00:00:04.204
have their yearly Christmas
light pissing contest,

00:00:04.238 --> 00:00:05.839
outdo each other.

00:00:05.873 --> 00:00:08.342
Which is just what you want
around a bunch of power strips.

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:10.911
And there are photos
of these retina-burning,

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:12.913
holiday hellholes
all over the web.

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.581
So I'm gonna show you some bad
Christmas lights

00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:15.883
and for 250 points,

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:17.251
just answer a few questions
about them.

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:19.019
Very simple. No big deal,
just a few questions.

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:20.454
Are you nervous?
You seem nervous.

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:21.655
Why are you so nervous?
You shouldn't be so nervous.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:23.090
I'm not accusing you
of anything.

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:24.525
Anyway, let's get started.

00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:25.659
But you do seem
a little nervous.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.561
All right, let's start
with the lights

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:28.996
that kind of remind me
of something,

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.798
but I can't quite...
picture it.

00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:33.367
(laughter)

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.335
I just...

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:38.939
Reggie.

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:40.407
What is going on here?

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.577
If-if-if you build it,
it will come.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.946
HARDWICK:
Yeah, points. Very good.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.882
-Very good.
-(cheers and applause)

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:51.318
That's cute.

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:54.254
It's from, uh, field of creams.

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:55.722
Uh, James Adomian.

00:00:55.756 --> 00:00:57.624
Clearly the happiest ending
of the year.

00:00:57.658 --> 00:00:58.959
HARDWICK:
Yes, points. Very good.

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:00.160
Morgan.

00:01:00.194 --> 00:01:01.862
He's celebrating
that special time of year

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.297
when your dick gets infected.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.498
-HARDWICK: Oh, points.
-ADOMIAN: Ah.

HARDWICK:
Oh, boy.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:10.070
I am appalled.

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:11.905
Here we are doing a family
Christmas show,

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.173
and you-- all you guys
saw were pe--

00:01:13.207 --> 00:01:14.842
This is clearly Sideshow Bob.

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:17.744
I can't believe how filthy
all of you are.

00:01:17.778 --> 00:01:19.980
You had to take it down
into the pants.

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:21.548
Next, here comes Santa Claus.

00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:22.883
And before we start this one,

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:26.687
keep your eye on the angel,
all right?

00:01:41.735 --> 00:01:44.004
What's a Christmas carol you
might sing about this tableau?

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:45.239
James Adomian.

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:46.540

Uh, Silent Night,

00:02:02.756 --> 00:02:04.958
'cause if you tell your parents
I'll kill them.

00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:07.261

Here's ol' Piss Kringle.

00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:15.569
There he is.

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:17.271
Looks like he's having
a good time.

00:02:17.304 --> 00:02:19.206
What's Santa celebrating,
Morgan Murphy?

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.708
He's celebrating getting off

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.117
I would.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.719
Next up this Noel hell.

00:02:32.753 --> 00:02:34.721
(audience exclaiming)

00:02:34.755 --> 00:02:36.924
Oh, Jesus Christ.

00:02:36.957 --> 00:02:38.625
A lot of yard displays
have a theme.

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:39.860
What is the theme
of this yard display?

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:40.994
James Adomian.

00:02:41.028 --> 00:02:43.330
It looks like we've lost
the water on Christmas.

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:45.199
HARDWICK:
All right, points.

00:02:45.232 --> 00:02:46.934

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:50.804
That is, uh, Trump's
holiday internment camp.

00:02:57.611 --> 00:02:58.879
That's stupid.

00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:00.347
Next, the morning
after Christmas

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.116
when everybody is drained.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.451
There they are.

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:05.686
What happened here?

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:06.987
Reggie Watts.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.190
It looks like a bunch of
inflatable Christmas ornaments

00:03:10.224 --> 00:03:13.026
-got deflated.
-HARDWICK: All right, points.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.995
-Points.
-(laughter)

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:16.463
A little unclear.

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:17.764
Morgan.

00:03:17.798 --> 00:03:20.501
Okay, it's gonna be a little
funnier than Reggie's.

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:22.469
(laughing)

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:32.279
It's, uh, uh, Santa Claus
is coming to Jonestown.

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:33.947
HARDWICK:
All right. Points.

Points. Very good.
