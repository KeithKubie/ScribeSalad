00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.910
Inter-domain routing concerns routing between

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.810
domains or autonomous systems. It involves

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.720
the reconfiguration of the border gateway

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.280
protocol, policies or configurations that are

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.730
running on individual routers in the network. Changing BGP policies at these

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.440
edge routers can cause routers inside an autonomous system to direct

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:32.380
traffic to or away from certain edge links. We can also change the set of egress

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.310
links for a particular destination. For example, an operator of autonomous

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.880
system one might observe. Traffic to destination

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.160
D traversing the green path. But by

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.550
adjusting B to B policies, the operator might balance load across these two edge

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.780
links, or shift all of the traffic for

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.340
that destination. To the lower path. An operator might

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.290
wish to use inter domain traffic engineering if

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.720
an edge link is congested, if a link is

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.420
upgraded, or if there's some violation of appearing

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.000
agreement. For example, AS1 and AS2 have an agreement

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.270
that they only send a certain amount of traffic

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.520
load. Over that link in a particular time window.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.810
If the load exceeds that amount, an operator would need to

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.040
use BGP to shift traffic from one [INAUDIBLE] link to another.
