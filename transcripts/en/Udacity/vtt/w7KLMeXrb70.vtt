00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.240
So let's see an example of
when does it really matter.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.810
Let's look at the multiprocessor
that has coherent memory but

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.620
out of order cores.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.100
And specifically the core
can predict the branch and

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.540
later verify that it was taken or
not taken correctly.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.610
The store instructions in each core
are done strictly in program order, so

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.800
it doesn't reorder any stores.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.910
But the loads between store instructions
can be reordered on a core.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.330
Now let's say that we have CORE 1 and
CORE 2 where CORE 1 executes

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:37.550
the following code while a flag is zero,
it waits, and then it prints the data.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.320
While CORE 2 writes ten to data,
then increments

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.380
data by five then sets the flag and
let's say that both flag and

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.540
data are zero initially before
CORE 2 gets to change them.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.580
So now CORE 1 when it prints the data,

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.890
what are the values that
it can possibly print?

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.240
Can it print zero?

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.076
Can it print five?

00:01:02.076 --> 00:01:03.240
Can it print ten?

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.980
Can it print 15, and
can it print anything else?
