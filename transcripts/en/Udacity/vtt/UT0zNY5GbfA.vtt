00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.520
Malaria is a disease that's spread by mosquitoes

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.220
and involves a parasite that grows inside red blood

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.430
cells. Now the parasite that causes malaria called

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.180
plasmodium is able to easily infect normally shaped red

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.400
blood cells. But the sickle shaped cells are

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.090
harder for the parasite to infect. And even when

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.410
it does infect it, the cell bursts open before

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.240
the plasmodium has finished its life cycle. Having even

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.900
one copy of the sickle cell mutation, or the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.290
HbS allele, increases resistance to malaria, because a few

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.050
of the cells are going to be more sickle

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.640
shape. Thus providing at least a little bit of

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.520
resistance to plasmodium infection. So although the HbS allele

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.100
was recessive for sickle cell anemia, it's actually dominant

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.010
with regards to malaria resistance. This means that an

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.880
individual allele, a single allele could be dominant or

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.450
recessive depending on which trait you're looking at. I

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.810
mean, think about it. We have one allele, the HbS

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.220
allele. But there are two different traits. We can either

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.580
think about the sickle cell anemia trait. Or malaria resistance

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.750
trait. In one case this allele is recessive because you

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.550
need two copies before you really see the effect. But

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.510
in the case of malaria resistance only one copy is

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.940
enough to resist plasmodium infection, making it a dominant allele.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.510
Hopefully this adds another layer of complexity. To

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.290
how we've been thinking about single, individual alleles.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.050
Remember, one allele can have an effect on

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.610
lots of traits. So in this scenario, if we

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.592
have no copies of the HbS allele, we're

00:01:31.592 --> 00:01:36.190
going to be more susceptible to plasmodium infection and

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.160
malaria. One copy makes you more resistant to

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.010
malaria, but may give you mild symptoms of anemia

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.990
from some limited sickling of cells. But two

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.580
copies of the HbS allele would result in

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.500
full sickle cell anemia, which typically can reduce

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.050
a person's lifespan and even cause death during childhood.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.265
So in an area plagued by malaria, like

00:01:57.265 --> 00:02:00.200
Sub-Saharan Africa, which genotype do you think would

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.080
have the greatest fitness, or the greatest probability

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.930
of survival? HbA HbA, HbA HbS, or HbS HbS
