[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.480
KERRY MAGRO: It's an honor to
be here at the Google Cambridge

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.890
office.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.000
This is a topic that's very
near and dear to my heart.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.830
Growing up as a
nonverbal child--

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.062
I was actually nonverbal
till I was 2 and 1/2

00:00:18.062 --> 00:00:19.520
and diagnosed with
something called

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.490
pervasive developmental disorder
not otherwise specified,

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.310
a form of an autism
spectrum disorder, when

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.140
I was four years old.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.680
And I want to take a minute
today and really imagine--

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.570
imagine just starting off
with a potential employment

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.690
opportunity.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.810
And imagine not being able
to get over 1,000 jobs.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.790
Imagine getting denied
over 1,000 times

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.220
for a meaningful employment.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.070
Now, that's one of
the extreme cases.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.030
But that's actually one of
the cases of a young man

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.730
I know who is on the
autism spectrum, who

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.430
has an accounting major,
who graduated college,

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.490
was not able to get
over 1,000 jobs.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.500
And when I asked him
about why he thought

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.466
he wasn't getting those jobs,
it was insane to hear about some

00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:19.340
of the things that were
going on, things such

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.180
as, oh, some companies
didn't necessarily

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.820
think that disclosure
was a good idea.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.870
Some companies
didn't think that,

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.660
looking at the bottom line,
that reasonable accommodations

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.770
for me would be a
little bit outrageous.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.970
And I'm happy to say he now
has a job today at Ford Motor

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.680
Company.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.230
But it took a very,
very long time

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.190
for this man who grew up with
many challenges due to autism.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.430
And this is actually
something I deal

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.460
with almost every single
day in our community.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.490
Today, as a eight-year
professional speaker,

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.670
I travel the country talking
about autism inclusion

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.030
and trying to become the
best version of yourself.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.509
So my presentation topic
today, the ROI benefits

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.000
of hiring people with autism
and other special needs

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.750
in the workplace--

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.570
some of the things
that you truly, truly

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.280
need to know about
our community,

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.510
and I'll share about this a
little bit later, but in terms

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.620
of the autism community, over
80% of adults in the United

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.590
States are currently
unemployed or underemployed.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.280
And now I can say, based on
overcoming many obstacles,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.730
through over five different
therapies for almost 15 years

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.610
of my life in occupational,
physical, speech, music,

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.460
and theater therapy, I've
been able to overcome

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.760
many of my obstacles
today to pursue a career

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.990
in professional speaking.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.450
It's given me the
wonderful opportunity

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.760
to become an
international speaker.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.790
I had the opportunity to
write two bestselling books,

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.590
focus on special need parenting.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.890
The first book, "Defining
Autism From the Heart,"

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.800
focused on self-advocacy
skills for some of my mentees

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.230
who were trying to come
out about having an autism

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.820
diagnosis for the first time.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.670
And a second book, called
"Autism and Falling in Love,"

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.240
focus on trying to help
individuals with special needs

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.940
try to find relationships
and love for the first time.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.604
When I was 18, I had no
idea how to talk to women.

00:03:19.604 --> 00:03:21.020
Pretty sure I still
don't know how

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.860
to talk to women,
for the most part.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.730
But I wrote this book based
on 10 years of journal entries

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.447
to help some of
my mentees today.

00:03:27.447 --> 00:03:29.780
In addition to that, we've
had the wonderful opportunity

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.000
to consult on several
major motion pictures

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.460
to bring a realistic
portrayal of disability

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.020
to our entertainment industry.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.320
We have been blown away by
the amount of films today

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.410
that have been focused on
individuals with disabilities,

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.820
but also TV shows.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.550
If anyone in here has seen
shows such as "The Good

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.480
Doctor" on ABC, which focuses
on a surgeon who has autism,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.470
and "Atypical," which
focuses on an 18-year-old man

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.310
on the autism spectrum trying
to find love on Netflix.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.200
In addition to that,
I hosted a TV show

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.690
called "The Different Is
Beautiful Show" for over two

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:09.220
years with the theme that normal
is truly just a dryer setting.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.220
That was the main theme.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.190
We brought in many people
impacted by diagnosis

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.410
to share their stories
with the world to hear.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.000
And then, finally,
a nonprofit founder

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.560
who's had the wonderful--

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.510
I've had a wonderful
opportunity to give out

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.030
52 scholarships for
students with autism

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.400
to go to college in
the past six years.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.770
So in addition to that, in
addition to those two books,

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.600
we were actually also
able to contribute

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.179
to another book called
"College for Students

00:04:35.179 --> 00:04:35.970
with Disabilities--

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.070
We Do Belong," which focuses
on 17 stories of people

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.300
with disabilities who
successfully navigated pursuing

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.760
a post-secondary education.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.700
So some of the things you need
to know about our community

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.955
today is that, in terms
of the disabled community,

00:04:53.955 --> 00:04:56.330
we are the fastest growing
minority in the United States.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.675
One in five Americans currently
today has a disability.

00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:02.300
And we've had the
wonderful opportunity

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.790
to work with
countless individuals

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.310
doing coaching, mentoring,
and training services

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.350
for individuals
with special needs

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.880
as they transition to adulthood.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.250
And one of the big topics
we talk about, simply

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.710
because of that, is employment.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.420
This has given us
opportunity to work

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.240
with the Department
of Labor many times

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.960
on initiatives, such as the
Employer Assistant and Resource

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.980
Network on disability inclusion.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.250
It's a mouthful, so
we call it EARN, which

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.470
helps employers
recruit, hire, retain,

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.819
and advance people
with disabilities.

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:35.360
One of the big things you need
to know about the unemployment

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.940
rate, unfortunately, for
those with disabilities today

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.900
is that people with disabilities
are, for the most part,

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.330
majorly unemployed.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.180
I mean, the autism community
is one of the biggest signs,

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.910
but in terms of the
overall rate of individuals

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.280
with disabilities,
is just about 8.4%,

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.190
while people with
disabilities is 3.7%.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.310
So when we go into
businesses, we've

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.520
had the wonderful opportunity to
work with some amazing, amazing

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.730
organizations.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.810
We talk about these
main topics, but we talk

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.459
about so much more as well.

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:09.250
And one of the biggest
things we talk about

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.180
is that individuals
with disabilities

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.300
are more likely to
stay at a job longer,

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.290
reducing employee turnover.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.590
This has been a study
that's been done almost

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.900
on an annual basis by the
Department of Labor that's

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.940
showing that people
with disabilities

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.120
are more committed to
staying at a company longer.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.480
They're also, because
of the gratefulness

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.490
of having meaningful employment,
having lower absentee rates.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.780
And in an environment
today where we're currently

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.530
so focused on philanthropy
in many of our businesses,

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.190
87% customers say
they prefer shopping

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.060
at stores and with companies
that hire employees

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.220
with disabilities.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.110
And higher company
standing once,

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.530
if an employee leaves because of
the diversity that was offered,

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.160
they're more likely to
go onto any recruiter

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.850
websites and encourage
people to follow

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.580
that company because
of them hiring people

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:11.910
with disabilities.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.006
And then finally, in terms
of reasonable accommodations

00:07:15.006 --> 00:07:17.630
today, one of the biggest things
I get when I go into companies

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.970
is, how much will the
bottom line cost me

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.220
for hiring someone
with a disability based

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.900
on reasonable accommodations?

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.590
And I'm glad to
say today, and it's

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.790
something I spread so much
awareness about year-round,

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.490
is that's more than
half of accommodations

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.480
today are absolutely
free, which does nothing

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.540
to the bottom line.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.130
So it's a nice
little perk there.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:39.630
Just to give you a
little background

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.020
on my own personal story
growing up with autism,

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.360
I grew up wanting to
be the next Larry Bird,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.670
and I have no vertical
leap for the life of me.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.680
So that was kind
of a difficulty.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.630
However, I really got involved
with sport management.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:56.600
So one of my first internships
ever was CBS Sports.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.810
And I majored at Seton Hall
University in sports management

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:04.540
and I was hoping to pursue a
career in the sports world.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.250
Once graduating
from college, I had

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.760
offers to work with many
different sport-related

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.820
organizations in
my tri-state area.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:18.200
And I really fell in
love with my mentees.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.600
I came out for the first
time about having an autism

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.820
diagnosis because
today I'm considered

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.320
to have a, quote unquote,
"invisible" disability.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:29.030
Many people I meet to this day
say, Kerry, you have autism?

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.650
You don't look like
you have autism.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.990
And I'm like, oh, that's an
interesting way of putting it.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.350
And I have to tell them
that I will always have

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:37.919
autism for the rest of my life.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.760
But I truly fell in
love with mentoring kids

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:44.250
with disabilities as they
transition to adulthood.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.700
So I pursued a career
in public speaking.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.250
And one of the
biggest things we--

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:51.080
one of the biggest
reasons why we also

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.840
decided to do this change
was because we realized

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.690
that many, many individuals
with disabilities

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.660
were truly still not
being able to be engaged

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.350
with the world around them.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.980
So I wanted to share with all
of you really quickly a video

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.040
where we're trying to make the
world that more inclusive place

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.180
for everyone to live.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.092
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:09.092 --> 00:09:10.460
- Can you say Merry Christmas?

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.830
- Merry Christmas.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:15.210
- I am a big, big
friend of Santa.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:16.610
Me and Santa are BFFs.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:17.700
We go way back.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.510
And Santa told me,
Kerry, could you

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.680
dress up as Santa Claus,
because you understand

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.813
the needs of these kids, and
give them a holiday experience

00:09:27.813 --> 00:09:28.812
they would never forget?

00:09:28.812 --> 00:09:29.311
- Smile.

00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:31.930
Give me [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.620
Big smile, big smile.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.280
- That was different, I think.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.100
- So when everything is done--

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.930
Growing up on the
autism spectrum,

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.570
I could never meet Santa
Claus in a big mall

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:46.630
with difficulties with bright
lights, with loud noises,

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:49.450
and not wanting to be
around a lot of people.

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:54.430
I started my nonprofit, KFM
Making a Difference, in 2011.

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.680
I wanted to be a role
model for these kids

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.630
by trying to help them
with something that I never

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:00.630
was able to [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.600
- Can you dance with Santa?

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.120
Yeah, there we go.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.090
- We turn the music down.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:10.335
We turn the lights down, in
all the rooms for any kids who

00:10:10.335 --> 00:10:12.190
are affected by bright lights.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:15.850
And many of our elves are
special education teachers

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:18.255
and therapists who
truly understand

00:10:18.255 --> 00:10:19.560
the needs of these kids.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.500
- Woo!

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.000
- Yay.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.830
We were three years
trying to do this.

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:29.080
And every year,
he's either crying

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.940
and he doesn't want to do it.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.590
So this year, he made it.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:33.618
Actually, he made it.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.698
- You are an amazing mother.

00:10:38.698 --> 00:10:41.172
[INAUDIBLE] is so lucky
to have you in his life,

00:10:41.172 --> 00:10:43.040
and he always will be.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.440
- I was actually nonverbal
till I was 2 and 1/2 years old.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.810
And I remember when
the flash did go off,

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.790
I would literally just
start poking my mom and dad,

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:55.116
and not having the words to
say it, feeling overwhelmed.

00:10:55.116 --> 00:10:56.490
Year after year,
now we're seeing

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.890
more and more of these
events sprang out

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:01.850
in local communities.

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.275
- We want to go see Santa.

00:11:03.275 --> 00:11:04.150
- Let's go see Santa!

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:06.140
- Going to see Santa,
going to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:06.890
- Ho, ho, ho.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:08.003
Merry Christmas

00:11:08.003 --> 00:11:08.810
- Santa.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:09.310
- Ryan.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:10.033
Ryan, right?

00:11:10.033 --> 00:11:10.908
- Christmas presents.

00:11:10.908 --> 00:11:13.884
- Cheese.

00:11:13.884 --> 00:11:15.197
Christmas presents.

00:11:15.197 --> 00:11:17.030
- I actually only just
found out about this.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.550
For years we just struggled.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:21.190
It's the mall and the
noise and the line.

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:24.890
A lot of times, kids that
don't have visible challenges,

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:25.990
it's very difficult.

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:27.481
- Everyone say
Christmas presents.

00:11:27.481 --> 00:11:29.470
- Christmas presents.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.420
- We want to make sure
that these kids and these

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.490
communities understand the need
for us more sensory-friendly

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.780
events, that this needs
to be a national movement.

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.648

[END PLAYBACK]

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:51.370
KERRY MAGRO: So we
travel the country now,

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:55.420
and this was just one idea that
I had when four years ago, I

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.555
was just thinking about
how I can go about trying

00:11:58.555 --> 00:12:00.430
to make more of a
difference in our community

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.600
and keep kids
engaged in the world.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.080
But that Santa
event, which we've

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.120
had the wonderful
opportunity to have

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.707
over 500 children with
autism special needs

00:12:09.707 --> 00:12:11.290
to meet Santa Claus
for the first time

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:13.480
in a sensory-friendly
setting, we were thinking

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.622
about our mentees a
lot at this time, too,

00:12:15.622 --> 00:12:17.080
and how we could
go into businesses

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.630
and talk about hosting
sensory-friendly events

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.870
for maybe people who
are adults with autism

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.840
or other disabilities, to
make sure that they feel

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.520
included in the workplace.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.400
We've talked to
many land developers

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.610
about things such as
the lights in some rooms

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:35.620
and how some individuals
with disabilities

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.450
might have things
such as sensory issues

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.980
where bright lights might cause
them a little bit of issues,

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.040
to even talking about
the size of walls,

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:49.270
to make environments a little
less loud for individuals

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.980
with special needs as well.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.210
So we've started
talking about that

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:56.320
via a nonprofit organization
we started in 2011

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.970
called KFM Making a Difference.

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:01.240
At the same time, I was
pursuing my first year

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.470
as a professional speaker.

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:04.960
So now we go around to
countless businesses

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.950
and talk about the need
for more sensory-friendly

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:11.537
actual environments for
individuals with disabilities.

00:13:11.537 --> 00:13:13.870
In addition to that, we've
had the wonderful opportunity

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:17.530
to give out a scholarship
for students with autism

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.450
to pursue a
post-secondary education,

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:22.060
where we now are able to
say that we've given out

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.670
over 52 scholarships
for students with autism

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:28.930
across the United States and
internationally to pursue

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:32.170
a post-secondary education.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:35.290
And in addition to that,
the other big reason

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.630
why we do what we do
today is because we

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.300
understand that autism
and disability is

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.240
a life-long disorder.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.820
So each one of
these individuals--

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.950
when I was growing up,
I had no peer mentoring.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.890
And now I go into businesses
and I talk to them

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.761
about the importance of
peer mentors for anyone,

00:13:53.761 --> 00:13:55.510
regardless if you're
just starting the job

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:57.610
or regardless if
you're non-disabled

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.920
because each and
every single one of us

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.770
need to think about
self-reflection at times

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.790
and what's going to be our
potential in the future.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:06.740
It's so very, very important.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.410
So I want to share
a story with you.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:10.180
So over three years
ago, we started

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:14.170
a Facebook page called A Special
Community, where we highlight

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.480
people impacted by a diagnosis.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:20.680
We now have over 120,000
Facebook followers, all

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:25.060
comprised of amazing, amazing
people from our community.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.990
And every single
place we go speak

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:30.010
now, we bring a
tripod and a camera

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:33.050
and we highlight people
impacted by a diagnosis

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:35.560
to share their stories
with the world.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.610
But we also start out each
interview with one question.

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.160
And it's, what would
you like for the world

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.780
to know about you?

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.880
And we met this
amazing kid named Liam.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.720
He's 10 years old
from Minnesota.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.310
And he said he wanted people
to know that sometimes,

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:53.980
because of autism,
it's sometimes

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:55.930
difficult to make friends.

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:58.684
And I wanted to share with you
his story really quickly today.

00:14:58.684 --> 00:14:59.350
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:01.280
- So we're going to be
talking to the camera

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.380
and we want to make you famous.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:08.470
So we literally want to make you
probably the most famous person

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:09.160
on the planet.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.900
How's that sound?

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.543
- OK, OK.

00:15:13.543 --> 00:15:14.505
- No pressure.

00:15:14.505 --> 00:15:18.225
- Autism basically makes
it hard to connect.

00:15:18.225 --> 00:15:22.680
It makes it hard to get that
connection, to make friends.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:30.150
They feel like more loners
than, well, in groups.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.745
It's also a learning disability.

00:15:32.745 --> 00:15:35.320
And in some cases, it's hard--

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.640
you can't speak in some cases.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.470
I met a kid called
Tom, who he has autism,

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:48.260
but he can't speak
in proper English.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.340
He needs an iPad.

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.930
- So Liam, one
thing I want to know

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:55.690
is that I was actually diagnosed
with autism at an early age,

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:56.190
too.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:58.398
And I don't know if I've
ever actually told you that.

00:15:58.398 --> 00:16:01.410
But I want you to know
that I will always

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:04.160
be here to be your friend,
if you need a friend.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.221
OK?

00:16:05.221 --> 00:16:05.720
- Yeah.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.920
- Because even though
it may be hard at times

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.840
to connect to other
people, I feel

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.720
like so many people
with autism like us just

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:20.200
want what anyone else
wants, to feel connected

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.390
and to have a friend.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:23.976
So you've always got
a friend in me, OK?

00:16:23.976 --> 00:16:25.490
Want to pound this out?

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:26.060
- Yeah.

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:27.509
Can you blow it up, too?

00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:30.890
Oh, he blows it up.

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:32.339
You're awesome, Liam.

00:16:32.339 --> 00:16:35.664
- I'm kind of tearing up.

00:16:35.664 --> 00:16:36.164
Sorry.

00:16:36.164 --> 00:16:37.140
- That's OK.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:38.116
It's kind of emotional.

00:16:38.116 --> 00:16:38.885
[END PLAYBACK]

00:16:38.885 --> 00:16:41.010
KERRY MAGRO: So we've had
the wonderful opportunity

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:42.840
to meet with hundreds
and hundreds of kids

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.860
around the world, to
hear their stories.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.690
But then we took a step forward.

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:50.610
After every single
video we've done,

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.230
we've done a
self-assessment to see

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:56.250
how we can go about
helping maximize anything

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.397
they mention in the video.

00:16:57.397 --> 00:16:58.980
So one of the biggest
things with Liam

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.820
was he wanted to make friends.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.666
So after that video
went viral on Facebook,

00:17:02.666 --> 00:17:05.040
we started a Facebook group
for him called Liam's Buddies

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.079
where, moderated by
his mom, we would

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.599
have countless people
just saying that they

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:11.089
wanted to be Liam's friend.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:13.770
That gave Liam the
courage to actually want

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:16.290
to pursue trying to make
more friends at his school.

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:19.200
And now I can say that he
has two really close friends

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.790
at his school today.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.970
So we took this idea to start
just doing more and more

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:28.710
interviews, and this gave us an
idea to focus on how we can do

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:32.850
this to maximize employers'
understanding the world about

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:36.150
people with disabilities
and what they would like

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:37.350
for companies to know.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.090
We've actually
started a video series

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:41.130
to highlight people
with disabilities.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:44.790
To every single place we go,
we try to share at least one

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:47.190
or two videos for people
to get the perspectives

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:49.080
of individuals, not
only with autism,

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.050
but a wide range
of disabilities.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.860
So the individual right
here, his name is David.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:00.510
And David is actually one of the
most amazing people I've ever

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:01.470
met in my entire life.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:02.910
David is blind.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:07.530
He has a very rare disease
where he actually went blind

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:08.970
at a very, very early age.

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:11.850
And during his accommodations
when he was growing up,

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:15.420
he had to learn how to use
a walking cane to get around

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.930
and he had to navigate
reasonable accommodations

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:20.970
once he transitioned
to adulthood.

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:25.230
And now, actually, today we met
him speaking at a Work Matters

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:28.620
summit at PNC Bank in
Pennsylvania, where

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.560
we tried to talk about
the ROI benefits of hiring

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.890
people with disabilities.

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:35.246
And this is what David wanted
to share with the world.

00:18:35.246 --> 00:18:35.912
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:35.912 --> 00:18:40.340
- The greatest
challenge was being

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:45.030
afraid to admit that
I was going blind.

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:51.400
I was afraid to use a white
cane to travel independently.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.810
And I did, you know--

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:57.640
and then once you
face your fears,

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:01.950
and you learn the skills,
strategies, and techniques

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:04.199
as well as a
positive philosophy,

00:19:04.199 --> 00:19:06.594
understanding and
believing that it's

00:19:06.594 --> 00:19:08.510
respectable to
have a disability,

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:11.384
and surrounding yourself
with other people who

00:19:11.384 --> 00:19:15.175
are possibility thinkers,
and say, hey, I can do it.

00:19:15.175 --> 00:19:16.365
You can, too.

00:19:16.365 --> 00:19:22.540
And I think that's
one of the things

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:26.450
that I had to really
come to grips with.

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:29.970
And then once I
learned, once I really

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:33.463
believed that it was respectable
to have a disability, once I

00:19:33.463 --> 00:19:35.459
learned to use
assistive technology,

00:19:35.459 --> 00:19:38.952
once I learned to use a cane
to travel independently,

00:19:38.952 --> 00:19:43.443
once I recognized and
embraced those things,

00:19:43.443 --> 00:19:45.460
life got a whole lot better.

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:49.270
Privileged, Kerry, to serve
as the executive director

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.490
of the Department of
Labor and Industry's

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.815
Office of Vocation
and Rehabilitation.

00:19:53.815 --> 00:19:57.875
And we're the lead agency
responsible for employment

00:19:57.875 --> 00:20:01.500
and training for people with
disabilities in Pennsylvania.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.570
We've worked with
over 70,000 people

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:08.350
and helped over 8,500
people with disabilities

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:10.630
find real jobs with real pay.

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:16.940
So we're here today to partner
with PNC and other community

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:20.190
advocates and partners
to shine a positive light

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:23.360
on the potential of
individuals with disabilities

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.322
and to help people
recognize and understand

00:20:25.322 --> 00:20:27.030
and believe that people
with disabilities

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:30.550
are the most untapped talent
pool for employers to consider.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:34.240
So that's why we're here is
to help spread the good word.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:41.960
And [INAUDIBLE] don't confuse
a bad day with a bad life.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:47.210
And I think that's--

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:50.890
everybody has bad days.

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:51.860
Everybody gets upset.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.530
But I think that's really it.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.580
You've got to-- don't
just go through it

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.920
you've got to grow through it.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.760
Sorry.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.360
So I think that's
really important.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.370
Don't confuse a bad
day with a bad life.

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:12.390
That's really, really important.

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:14.705
There's going to be good
days, there's going to be ups,

00:21:14.705 --> 00:21:16.200
there's going to be downs.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.320
Some days you're the statue and
some days you're the pigeon.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:33.660
And so just knowing that
there are people out there who

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:35.520
want to see you succeed.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.362
- Can I just say really
quickly on camera--

00:21:39.362 --> 00:21:41.130
I want to jump right back in.

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:42.133
- Yeah.

00:21:42.133 --> 00:21:49.490
- I think what you're doing,
we need more people such as you

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:51.766
who just don't let
anything get in their way.

00:21:51.766 --> 00:21:54.480
Because I know I won't let
anything get in my way.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.940
And I know that
you'll do the same.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.260
- I appreciate that, Kerry.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:03.060
We need more people who are
just possibility thinkers, who

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:08.180
just do your best when
you feel like at least--

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.440
- Exactly.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.900
I think we're good.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.180
[END PLAYBACK]

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.400
KERRY MAGRO: So if I leave
you with anything today,

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:20.050
I hope it's truly that
you consider yourself,

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:23.140
what David was saying,
a possibility thinker.

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:25.660
I think in our community today,
one of the biggest things

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.390
that I see is that
companies look

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:32.500
at what they can do to help
individuals with disabilities.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.350
But I think we need to change
that mindset, where we're

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:39.130
thinking about what
individuals with disabilities

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:42.370
can do for a company versus
the other side around.

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:47.410
This, I think, and thinking as a
possibility thinker, like David

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:51.100
said, can lead to
amazing, amazing change.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.110
David, now in his
50s, has helped

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:56.140
employ thousands and
thousands of individuals

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:59.560
with disabilities simply by
growing up with a disability

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:04.540
and knowing that it is one of
the most untapped markets today

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.040
in the United States.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.130
So via our Facebook page,
we've had the opportunity

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:11.380
to interview people with
autism, cerebral palsy,

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:13.810
down syndrome, ADHD,
but also people

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:17.307
who have been impacted by
disease, such as David,

00:23:17.307 --> 00:23:18.890
to share their stories
with the world.

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:22.510
It's given us the opportunity
to have these videos seen

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:24.740
over 30 million times.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.470
And we actually
download the videos

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:31.120
for organizations, both business
organizations and also schools,

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.030
as educational videos
and resources for them,

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.830
for individuals who
simply just want

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.140
to learn from the
perspectives of those

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.870
impacted by a diagnosis.

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:44.380
So one of the big
initiatives that we do

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:47.740
is during a month
in October, which

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:50.680
has been proclaimed from
the Department of Labor

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.080
as National Disability
Employment Awareness Month.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:56.160
This is also National
Disability Awareness Month,

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.970
where we truly highlight
this untapped potential.

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:02.350
We highlight stories of
people impacted by diagnosis

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:04.450
who are succeeding in
the workforce today,

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:08.440
but then we also highlight the
people who are not necessarily

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.830
having a good time trying to
find employment, like the boy

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:14.940
I mentioned at the beginning
of my presentation.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.690
So in addition to the
videos we highlight,

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:18.970
I also share my own personal
perspective growing up

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:22.600
with autism in very
quick educational videos,

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.470
which I share with employers
throughout the month of October

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:29.095
to encourage employment of
those with disabilities.

00:24:29.095 --> 00:24:29.810
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:32.380
- Every month in October,
the United States Department

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:35.890
of Labor hosts National
Disability Employment Awareness

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:37.825
Month, an annual
awareness campaign

00:24:37.825 --> 00:24:40.210
that looks to
celebrate and educate

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:42.100
about disability employment.

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:45.620
I'm asking you today to
consider supporting the cause,

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:49.123
hosting events in your
workplace around the month,

00:24:49.123 --> 00:24:51.390
and, if you haven't
already, look

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:55.050
to employ those with
disabilities in your workplace.

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:59.490
The idea behind NDEAM,
as they like to call it,

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:02.920
goes back to 1945 when
Congress passed a law

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.470
saying that the
first week in October

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:09.190
would be National Employed but
Physically Handicapped Week.

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:10.930
Today almost one
in five Americans

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:12.960
has a disability in
the United States,

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.990
showing the incredible impact
a month like this can have.

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:18.695
I have a personal connection
to the disability community

00:25:18.695 --> 00:25:19.730
in autism.

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:23.620
I was completely non-verbal till
2 and 1/2 years old, diagnosed

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:25.280
with autism when I was four.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:28.350
And today, as an adult, after
years of supports and therapies

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:30.760
have been able to
hold down five jobs

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.240
as a professional speaker,
bestselling author, film

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:37.660
consultant, local TV talk show
host, and nonprofit founder

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.790
that mentors and
gives out scholarships

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:43.060
for students with autism and
disabilities to go to college.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.820
I now give talks to
companies about disabilities

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.730
in the workforce to educate
about the unique abilities

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:51.460
individuals with
disabilities can have,

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:52.945
if given the opportunity.

00:25:52.945 --> 00:25:56.050
I see a future where my
high school mentees, who

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:59.320
all have autism and are
extremely bright and gifted,

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:03.100
can transition to adulthood
and succeed in the workforce.

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.940
Some of them may have challenges
at first, but so does everyone.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.170
With the accommodations
in place,

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:12.160
you may very well be surprised
by what you see from each

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.780
and every single one of them.

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:17.970
To conclude, US Secretary
of Labor, Alexander Acosta

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:20.470
has said Americans
of all abilities

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:22.810
must have access
to good, safe jobs.

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:24.390
Smart employers know that.

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:26.560
Including different
perspectives in problem

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.830
solving situations leads
to better solutions.

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:32.380
Hiring employees with
diverse abilities

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:35.260
strengthens their business,
increases competition,

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.410
and drives innovation.

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:41.860
Dr. Temple Grandin reminds us to
see the person, not the label.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:44.160
Together, let's focus
on making inclusion

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.902
celebrated, not only in the
workplace, but in every place

00:26:47.902 --> 00:26:48.610
around the world.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:49.220
[END PLAYBACK]

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:53.320
KERRY MAGRO: So this initiative
truly started a few years

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:56.300
after we started speaking.

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.760
Most of the talks
we gave early on we

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.150
were talking to
employers about the power

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:04.580
of effective communication
to really spearhead

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:08.110
your organizations, both from
internal perspective and also

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:10.250
an external perspective.

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:12.460
So now today we've
kind of molded that

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:16.300
into presentations going
into not only giving

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.980
lunch-and-learn type
of events, but also

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.230
going into human
resource departments

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:23.260
and giving consultations
about topics

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:26.270
such as the interview process
for those with disabilities.

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.840
Now, just by a show of
hands really quickly,

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:33.100
who in here has met someone in
the past who maybe they didn't

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:34.880
necessarily think
deserved the job

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:39.170
but had a really, really
good interview at the time?

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:39.670
Anyone?

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:40.630
Yeah, it's happened.

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:41.500
It's happened.

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.346
Now, many individuals
with I know

00:27:43.346 --> 00:27:45.220
with disabilities,
especially individuals who

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:48.790
have communication difficulties,
social difficulties,

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:52.540
don't necessarily see
the interview process as

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:56.980
fair because a lot of the times
these people think concretely.

00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:00.490
They think that,
literally, these questions

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:02.500
have to be as concrete
as humanly possible.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.810
So we actually go into
many organizations

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:07.690
and ask about foregoing
the interview process

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:10.900
for a one-day job trial where
potential employees can just

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:14.830
truly show what they're
capable of, especially

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:17.110
in the fields of STEM.

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:19.390
So for many individuals
with disabilities

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:22.730
have really been able to
maximize science, technology,

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:24.640
engineering, and
mathematics jobs

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.220
where it's more focused
on one-on-one job

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:31.010
responsibilities versus
an actual group process.

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:33.820
So providing job
descriptions, we also

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.850
go into companies
and talk about,

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:38.350
whenever they're putting out a
job application, whether it's

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:40.960
on monster.com LinkedIn,
et cetera and so forth,

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:44.710
that they try to be as concrete
as possible and not vague

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:45.770
in nature.

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:48.190
I mean, we've all had the
application once or twice

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:51.160
where it says, you have to
have good interpersonal skills.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.650
And we're like, OK,
what does that mean?

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:56.620
So it's important to be as
concrete as humanly possible.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:59.380
And then also talking about
reasonable accommodations,

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:02.530
and the accommodations that
are available for individuals

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:05.560
with disabilities in
the workplace today.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.350
But also showing 503 compliance.

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:11.000
So reasonable
accommodations today--

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.960
we believe disclosure
is so, so important.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.656
We truly believe through
the philosophy of just,

00:29:16.656 --> 00:29:18.280
as I mentioned in
the video, Dr. Temple

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:21.100
Grandin, who is an amazing,
amazing autism advocate.

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:26.770
One of her biggest quotes is
"see the able, not the label."

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:29.590
And we truly believe
that disclosure

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:34.810
is so important for these kids
who are growing and getting

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:38.590
jobs today to be able
to actually succeed

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:39.947
in the workforce.

00:29:39.947 --> 00:29:41.530
So it's against the
law to ask someone

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:43.950
if they have a disability.

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:46.639
And providing awareness events,
not only during October, which

00:29:46.639 --> 00:29:48.430
is National Disability
Employment Awareness

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:52.060
Month, but also embracing
diversity all year round

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:56.500
truly, truly helps connectivity
amongst actual workers

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:57.370
in the workplace.

00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:00.850
And human resources should
try to be acknowledging

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:03.670
more and more to not only
individuals with disabilities,

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:07.120
but non-disabled individuals
who work at companies

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:10.030
about individuals
with disabilities

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:13.360
and some of the signs
that they may have.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.650
Reasonable accommodations
go further,

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:18.190
taking on a bigger role
with more individuals

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:21.130
later in life developing
physical disabilities.

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:23.140
Not only individuals
who are getting

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:25.480
diagnosed with disabilities
a very early age,

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.670
but as people get
older, developing

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:31.910
physical disabilities
is very, very common.

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:33.820
So more awareness
is needed focused

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.680
on the lifespan of
disabilities, not only

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:39.910
for individuals who are young,
but also individuals as they

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:42.020
are going into later adulthood.

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:45.310
So my journey with
autism employment-- now,

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:47.530
I was told by--

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:49.480
I was told by
countless people when

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:53.350
I was in school that it would
be very, very hard for me to get

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:57.340
a job one day because I would
think very, very literally.

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.230
Sarcasm would go over my head.

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:02.290
I wouldn't understand
any single joke,

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:05.550
and I didn't make my first
friend until I was 14.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:08.920
So they thought my interpersonal
skills would never give me

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.500
the opportunity to
really become someone who

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.660
could succeed in the workforce.

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:18.250
And it was a lot
of trial and error.

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:20.020
My parents became my
greatest advocates

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:23.740
growing up, truly getting
me through situations where

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.890
we would do mock interviews,
where we would truly

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:30.790
try to help assess and
transition me to the workforce

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:34.090
by giving me
schedules and trying

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:36.520
to help me understand what
the job environment looked

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:39.670
like before I even went
into that specific job.

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:42.367
And I think that's something
that could help anyone, truly.

00:31:42.367 --> 00:31:44.200
This gave us the
opportunity to give two TED

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.600
Talks in the past five years.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:50.710
The first talk in my local
community in New Jersey,

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:52.720
The Will of Opportunity--
the Path of Autism

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:57.400
to College, which focuses
on those individuals who

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.220
have autism pursuing a
post-secondary education,

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:06.040
but then also finding internship
opportunities in the workforce.

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.930
And then the second one, What
Happens to Children with Autism

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:12.400
When They Become Adults,
focuses on a question

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.940
that hits a lot of families,
especially parents.

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:19.030
And that is, what will happen
to my child when I'm gone?

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:22.210
In our community today,
especially in the autism

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:26.920
community, over 500,000
individuals with autism

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:32.080
will be reaching adulthood
within the next decade.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.540
Untapped potential,
untapped market

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:36.250
of individuals who
will be reaching

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:38.320
adulthood, and many
of these individuals

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.852
will be highly skilled.

00:32:40.852 --> 00:32:42.310
Some of the kids
I know with autism

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:45.530
are the brightest
kids in the world.

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:48.880
And my friend
Temple Grandin once

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.910
said that she believes
that half of Silicon Valley

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:54.220
is actually on the
autism spectrum

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:56.140
because they think
literally, they're

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.910
able to do one-on-one
projects so simply,

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:02.000
and they're some of the most
brightest people you would ever

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:02.500
meet.

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:06.020
So that just goes
into another quote,

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:07.750
which I share a lot of time.

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:11.110
It's that when we're
thinking about the how

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:15.820
to get these individuals
hired, it's best to think of it

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:18.040
as this quote right
here, which says,

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:20.470
"If you've met one
individual with a disability,

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:23.500
you've truly met one
individual with a disability,"

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.410
regardless of its autism or not.

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:31.060
There's no one size fits all
for a proper way of hiring

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.300
someone with a disability.

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:35.740
So it's truly important to
create your own blueprint

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:38.200
of what that looks like
by simply getting to know

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:42.430
and establishing a rapport with
the individuals you work with.

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:44.770
That can mean
anything from having

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:47.205
more social outings
after work for people

00:33:47.205 --> 00:33:48.580
to get to know
each other better,

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:53.500
from peer mentoring programs,
for actual summits where

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.860
individuals can have more
opportunities to network

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.300
with each other.

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:00.760
But also at the same time,
one of the biggest things

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.880
we talk about in a [INAUDIBLE]
basis, the importance

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:05.080
of self-reflection.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:08.230
And actually, we
encourage many employees,

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:11.380
both with disabilities and
not, to have journal entries,

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:15.460
to continue to self reflect on
their strengths and weaknesses.

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:18.025
Because, especially in
our disability community,

00:34:18.025 --> 00:34:19.900
one of my favorite quotes
from Temple Grandin

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:22.989
is "interests and talents
can truly turn into careers."

00:34:22.989 --> 00:34:26.090
But for many individuals
with disabilities,

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:28.480
they may not necessarily
think about their strengths

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.340
a lot of times
because they're so

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:33.460
focused on trying to overcome
some of the weaknesses

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:36.130
to find a job.

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:40.159
So seven ways I truly
found employment today,

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:42.670
the number one was honing
in on my key interests,

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:46.150
which I'll talk a little bit
later in this presentation.

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:48.159
Becoming a
self-advocate-- when I

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:50.980
was going to college
for the first time,

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.199
so in school, individuals
with disabilities

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:56.780
can get an IEP, which is the
Individual Education Plan.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:59.140
And when I was
going to college, I

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.370
received no transitional
services in high school,

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:04.840
so I actually went up to my
post-secondary disability

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.850
support specialist
and I told her,

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:09.700
if you could just hook
me up with my IEP,

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:11.750
I'll be out of here and
I'll be ready to go.

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:15.490
And she said, child,
sit down, and told me

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:19.240
for the first time about
reasonable accommodations.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.370
And I never, never
knew about it.

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:24.010
So I had to become
a self advocate.

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:26.610
And I was very
deer-in-headlights at the time.

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:30.130
However, I took it in stride.

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:33.220
I took less credits to
really understand the need

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:34.600
to become a self advocate.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:38.560
And having that impact at a very
early age in college actually

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:43.810
helped propel me to finding jobs
once I graduated from college.

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:48.360
Asking questions is
another big thing, I think.

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:52.300
And it may seem cliche, but
we still, as a community,

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.700
sometimes don't
ask some questions

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:56.920
because we think they're
going to be dumb questions.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.530
And there is no such
thing as a dumb question.

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:02.500
Really make sure that
you're focused on that.

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:07.300
So doing research on job careers
is also very, very important.

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:10.980
Realizing I couldn't
live by a label,

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.910
self-reflection
exercises were critical.

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:15.790
I've been writing
in a journal since I

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:18.940
was 12 years old about my
strengths and weaknesses.

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:22.090
When I found out I had
autism at 11 and 1/2,

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:25.940
we were playing celebrity
disability bingo

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:27.710
in one of my social
skills classes,

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:30.550
and I was learning that people
like Michael Jordan had ADD.

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:32.270
Magic Johnson had ADHD.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:35.560
And I asked, why am I special,
to my social skills teacher.

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.900
And she's like, oh, you
have to talk to your parents

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:38.650
about that.

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:41.590
And after school, that was
the first time they told me

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:42.790
I had autism.

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:46.600
But after that, I started
writing journal entries

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:48.760
based on just going
into IEP meetings

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.890
to learn about my
strengths and weaknesses.

00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:54.010
And then, finally, role
playing different situations,

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:57.430
such as mock interview
processes, truly helped me.

00:36:57.430 --> 00:37:01.060
So the two interests that
helped me growing up--

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:01.960
first was theater.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.210
I wanted to be the sixth
member of the Backstreet Boys

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:04.870
growing up.

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:07.750
For my 11th birthday I
wanted the white suit

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:10.500
from the "I Want
It That Way" video.

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:13.480
So I was clearly a dork.

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:16.080
I still am a dork a little bit.

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:19.080
But I fell in love
with music therapy.

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.790
At a time when I was
having difficulties

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:23.490
with loud noises,
bright lights, there

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:26.289
was always something
soothing about being onstage,

00:37:26.289 --> 00:37:28.080
even though the lights
were there, but also

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.480
something soothing about music.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.960
So I stuck to theater
for about 15 years,

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.690
and once I graduated
from high school

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:38.550
I became an autism
advocate and found

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:41.280
one of my first jobs,
which was to be an autism

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.380
consultant on major
motion pictures

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:46.490
based on my focus on the
entertainment industry,

00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:49.320
getting to work on films
such as "Joyful Noise," which

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:52.200
stars a teenager with
autism in the film.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.540
Other films such as
"Jane Wants a Boyfriend,"

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.430
which focuses on
a girl with autism

00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:58.680
trying to find love
in New York City,

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:02.070
and then also consulting on
documentaries such as "Big

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:04.320
Daddy Autism," which
looks at a single dad

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.470
with a nonverbal
child on the spectrum.

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:09.510
And "Don't Foil My Plans,"
which goes into the employment

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:11.940
background, actually
focuses on employment

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:15.100
for those with disabilities.

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:18.570
And then basketball-- I want
to be the next Larry Bird.

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:22.080
So I integrated basketball
into my physical therapy.

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.000
Growing up I could
tell you all 30 NBA

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.130
teams and every single
player on those teams,

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:28.780
simply because it was
one of my key interests.

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:30.700
And once I graduated
from high school,

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:33.870
I didn't get any Division
I offers-- womp, womp.

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:37.770
But I got involved
with NBA Cares, which

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:39.750
is a nonprofit
organization, getting

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:42.180
to interview countless
NBA celebrities

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:47.340
to share the impact sports
can have on individuals

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:48.990
with disabilities,
and asking them

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:52.350
to consider getting involved
with philanthropic causes

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:55.110
towards our special
need community.

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:59.130
So hiring people with autism
and other disabilities

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:01.860
truly just makes
good business sense.

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.140
Customers with disabilities
and their families,

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:06.600
for those in this
room who don't know,

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.420
represent a trillion
dollar market today

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:10.490
in the United States.

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:12.370
They, like other
market segments,

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:14.940
purchase products and
services from companies

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.950
that best meet their needs.

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:19.500
And a large number
of Americans today

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:22.170
say that they would prefer
to patronize businesses that

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:24.040
hire people with disabilities.

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:26.820
And then, finally, businesses
across the United States

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.550
have begun to realize that
hiring talented candidates

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:32.940
with disabilities is not
only the right thing to do,

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.310
it makes good business
sense while demonstrating

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:39.690
high return on investment
and aids in 503 compliance,

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:42.720
which every
organization has to do.

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.677
So how to manage employees
with disabilities?

00:39:44.677 --> 00:39:47.010
This is actually one of the
biggest questions we usually

00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:48.420
get during a Q&amp;A period.

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.430
And one of the biggest
things, don't come in

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:53.490
with any unperceived notions.

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:57.390
We say that sometimes
we think in a box,

00:39:57.390 --> 00:40:02.100
and you have to think
outside the box as well.

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.830
Document challenges and
strengths in the workplace.

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:09.690
Please use concrete language
as much as you possibly can.

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:14.760
And take your time when you're
talking to these individuals

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:17.040
and make sure that they
know what you said.

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.930
And if they ask
you to repeat it,

00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:21.090
sometimes that's going to
be what you have to do.

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:23.730
Make sure all team building
events are accessible.

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:25.230
This is huge.

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:28.710
I've seen so many convocations
where events have happened

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:31.650
with things such as no
wheelchair accessibility,

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:35.620
and it literally blows
my mind to this day.

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:39.990
I would also definitely look
at a leadership book called

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:41.580
"The New One Minute Manager."

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:43.950
it's a fantastic,
fantastic book that

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:46.515
really looks at how you
can go about establishing

00:40:46.515 --> 00:40:50.040
a rapport with your employees.

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.900
And offer professional
development training

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:54.090
by bringing in experts
and individuals

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:56.130
with disabilities
who have successfully

00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:58.090
navigated the workplace.

00:40:58.090 --> 00:41:01.320
These are some examples of
success stories of corporations

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:05.097
today who are currently hiring
individuals with disabilities.

00:41:05.097 --> 00:41:07.680
One of the common themes you'll
see in many of these companies

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.800
is that they have a high
focus on technology,

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:14.260
the SAPs of the world, the
Freddie Macs of the world.

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.740
So there is a focus
on those STEM jobs

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.960
that are really helping
these individuals.

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:23.280
So finally, I just want to share
with you some quotes from some

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:27.750
of my mentees on what
disabilities and trying to find

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:29.170
employment means to them.

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:32.250
So one individual,
Ron Sandinson,

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:36.630
he's one of the first
pastors to ever have autism.

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:40.620
And he want people to know,
"Employers, we with autism

00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:43.980
would love for you to understand
that not all disabilities are

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:45.000
visible.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.890
When we don't look
you in the eye,

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:50.502
it does not mean
we aren't there.

00:41:50.502 --> 00:41:51.960
If we fail to shake
your hand or we

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.820
say something not
appropriate, it does not

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:55.530
mean we're trying to be rude.

00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:57.920
When we need extra
clarification to do the job,

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.450
it does not mean we
are slow or stupid.

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:03.210
Due to autism, we process
information differently,

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:06.480
but we also have amazing gifts
like attention to details

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.680
and faithful to attended work."

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.970
And then I love this guy.

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:14.160
Matthew, who's aspiring
accountant, he says,

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.050
"When working with
people with autism,

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:18.480
it's best not to focus
on how they appear.

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.040
I feel it is more
important to focus

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:23.980
on their work and the
outcomes of that work.

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:26.910
Even if they look
uninterested and unfocused,

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:29.040
they probably are
interested and focused.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:31.345
They likely care more
than they let on.

00:42:31.345 --> 00:42:33.720
And to quote the 'Transformer'
movie, which he absolutely

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:36.480
loves, there is 'more
than meets the eye'

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.390
for individuals with autism."

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:42.720
So finally, what employers
need to focus on today

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:47.320
is clear job responsibilities
more than anything else.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:49.650
If you go to the Department
of Labor's website,

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:52.140
they have an amazing,
amazing booklet

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:54.210
called "The Business
Strategies that

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:56.852
Work-- a Framework for
Disability Inclusion."

00:42:56.852 --> 00:42:57.810
The link is right here.

00:42:57.810 --> 00:42:59.490
I'd highly recommend
for anyone who's

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:02.160
looking to hire more
individuals with disabilities

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:05.940
in their workplace to give
it a very thorough look.

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:07.800
It has some guidelines
on everything

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.870
we're talking today
about job descriptions,

00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:12.690
to how you can host
diversity events

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:16.230
in your workplace towards
individuals with disabilities.

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:20.040
And I've seen it help countless,
countless companies today.

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:27.120
So just as a final thought, I
never thought that any of this

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.560
was going to be possible.

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:31.050
When I was growing
up, people told me

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:35.340
that it would be very, very
unlikely that I would even

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:36.510
get to college.

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:38.910
And now the thing I can say
is that even though it's

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:41.760
a spectrum, disability
is a spectrum,

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.730
and some kids are going to be on
the severe end, who might need

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:47.670
lifetime care, I
can truly say today

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:51.240
that we as a community
in the United States

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:55.140
are the most diverse in
our history right now.

00:43:55.140 --> 00:44:00.030
And we need to think about ways
we can think outside of the box

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:04.620
towards maximizing the potential
of all of our companies.

00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:08.490
And with that, I couldn't
think of a better way

00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:12.600
than trying to maximize and
utilize the potential of some

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.480
of these amazing,
amazing individuals

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:19.320
with disabilities, as long as
we just give them the chance

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:22.320
to show what they're made of.

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.331
Thank you all so much
for having me today.

00:44:24.331 --> 00:44:27.097
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:32.600
And at this time, we left a
few minutes left in the program

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:35.780
for Q&amp;A. So we'd be more than
happy to answer any questions

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:36.710
you have at this time.

00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:38.630
Thank you all so
much for coming out.

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:40.331
Yes?

00:44:40.331 --> 00:44:43.280
AUDIENCE: So I'm curious,
what specific reasonable

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:48.140
accommodations tend to be
most useful for employees

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:48.660
with autism?

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:52.552
And to what extent do they
have success in getting them?

00:44:52.552 --> 00:44:54.260
KERRY MAGRO: So most
of the time they do.

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:59.390
Again, most individuals who file
for reasonable accommodations,

00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:03.740
accommodations can be anything
from written explanations

00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:07.370
to specific tasks
for specific projects

00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:08.720
that they're supposed to do.

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:11.850
Lots of people with autism
think in many different ways.

00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:13.320
Some people think in pictures.

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:15.260
Some people think visually.

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:17.350
Some people think in auditory.

00:45:17.350 --> 00:45:19.490
So sometimes they
will give things

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:22.340
such as written explanations
on all of their projects.

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:24.200
Sometimes they could
ask for accommodation

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.930
where they could get e-mails
versus actually having

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:30.530
to hear a verbal
project, and kind of just

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:35.210
have a breakdown with either
their current boss or someone

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:37.070
who was part of a human
resource department.

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:40.070
That's usually what
we see the most.

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:43.940
But then we also
see accommodations

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:49.490
such as being able to bring a
recorder for some team meetings

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:51.350
to actually be able to--

00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:55.100
a confidential
recorder-- to actually

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:59.090
be able to listen to the actual
assignments that they're given,

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:02.640
and also to provide it for
feedback for them as well.

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.679
So those are the
two biggest ones

00:46:04.679 --> 00:46:06.970
that are currently helping
individuals in the workplace

00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:08.610
today that we recommend.

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:09.440
Hope that helped.

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:11.690
Yes?

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:15.150
AUDIENCE: The notion of
clear job responsibilities

00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:16.070
is very interesting.

00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:20.030
We've-- well, thinking about
performance evaluation for some

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:25.250
reason, as well as hiring,
I found that it's difficult

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:28.400
for companies to phrase their
job requirements in that

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.780
concrete terms.

00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:33.150
So any hints on how
we can do that better?

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:35.330
KERRY MAGRO: So one
of the biggest things

00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:40.870
is when someone actually
does apply for a job,

00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:42.900
it is a process.

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.740
And one of the biggest things
I say, it's not a sprint.

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:48.710
Most of the time it is
very much a marathon

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:51.590
when it comes to each
unique individual who

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:52.820
may be applying for this job.

00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:55.280
One of the biggest
things I would truly say

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:58.250
is to really think about--

00:46:58.250 --> 00:47:00.870
we try to think of this
as an annual perspective.

00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:03.680
So we think about
the job projects

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:07.250
that an individual might
have for out the year,

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:11.660
and we try to talk to companies
about how we can kind of just

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:13.770
pinpoint some specific areas.

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:16.340
So for example, one of
the things that we'll do

00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:19.310
is we'll talk to
a human resource

00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:22.740
department about
if, for example,

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:24.890
they're in the technology
field and they have

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:26.840
to do a certain amount
of code or they have

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:29.660
to do JavaScript and
focus on a website,

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:32.552
we kind of say, we need
to have HTML in here.

00:47:32.552 --> 00:47:34.010
We need to have
JavaScript in here.

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:36.470
So we kind of try
to make it not only

00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:39.650
concrete, but as descriptive
as humanly possible.

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:44.790
Many job applications
today are only one page,

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:47.960
which we see on a lot of sites
like monster.com and LinkedIn.

00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:51.500
So we try to make sure that
it's not only concrete,

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:54.320
but its also as descriptive
as humanly possible

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:56.900
because those are two
different channels completely.

00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:58.590
So it's not only
about being concrete,

00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:00.830
but it's also making
sure that you list out

00:48:00.830 --> 00:48:03.010
every single
requirement that you're

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:05.510
going to need for that person
as well, especially if they're

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:07.940
doing a very specific
job that is already

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:10.950
going to need proper training
before they go into the job.

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:11.770
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:12.020
KERRY MAGRO: Hi.

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:13.065
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:48:13.065 --> 00:48:13.730
KERRY MAGRO: Glad to be here.

00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:15.920
AUDIENCE: I am an
intern recruiter here.

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:18.890
And I've worked with several
candidates who have autism.

00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:21.470
Happy to say that many of them
will be joining us this summer

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:23.370
as engineers, which is awesome.

00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:23.740
KERRY MAGRO: That's amazing.

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:24.240
Congrats.

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:25.130
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:26.360
So I have a question.

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:28.100
I'm just curious if you--

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:31.130
I know you mentioned companies
obviously can't ask people

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:33.350
if they have a disability.

00:48:33.350 --> 00:48:37.430
And I think you said that you
advise students, candidates

00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:39.260
to self-disclose.

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:42.470
I'm curious what your advice
is like when you tell them

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:44.566
that they should
be self-disclosing,

00:48:44.566 --> 00:48:46.190
if it's at the
beginning of the process

00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:47.944
or what the timing
of that is like.

00:48:47.944 --> 00:48:50.360
KERRY MAGRO: So one of the
biggest things with individuals

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:54.230
with disabilities we see is
that, if you don't disclose

00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:56.870
right away, it becomes very,
very difficult once they

00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:59.000
actually get into
the workforce to get

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.687
those reasonable accommodations
versus actually disclosing

00:49:02.687 --> 00:49:04.520
right ahead of time,
because usually there's

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:06.500
a few weeks before an
employer will actually

00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:10.280
start the actual
internship or position.

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:12.110
So that gives the human
resource department

00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:16.070
a possibility to talk to the
specific boss of that employee

00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:18.500
about what some of the
accommodations are going to be.

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:23.070
So if someone, for example, goes
in two, three weeks and says,

00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:23.730
you know what?

00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:25.146
I need a reasonable
accommodation,

00:49:25.146 --> 00:49:28.130
and doesn't, it kind of
brings in a very tough

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:29.249
transitional phase.

00:49:29.249 --> 00:49:31.040
And for many individuals
with disabilities,

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:34.580
along with autism, that I
know have very difficult times

00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:36.440
at times with
transitions and being

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:38.570
able to go through
that, especially

00:49:38.570 --> 00:49:41.690
when you think of many
individuals to this day--

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:45.050
I know adults love things
like visual schedules

00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:48.290
and will have these
schedules in either a book

00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:50.450
that they bring
around with them where

00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:52.970
they have everything set up.

00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:57.410
They need to do it right away
to avoid misunderstandings,

00:49:57.410 --> 00:49:59.160
miscommunication
at a later time,

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:02.900
especially with transitions,
but also with the communication

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:05.060
with their boss and their team.

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:08.371
So that's the number one reason
why we encourage disclosure

00:50:08.371 --> 00:50:08.870
right away.

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:09.280
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:09.900
Makes sense.

00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:11.067
Thanks.

00:50:11.067 --> 00:50:12.400
KERRY MAGRO: Any other thoughts?

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:14.510
Questions?

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:15.520
Yes?

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:20.250
AUDIENCE: I want to specialize
a little on the issue

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:23.980
of reasonable accommodations.

00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:28.090
One thing that I think
tends to get short shrift

00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:30.310
is sensory accommodations.

00:50:30.310 --> 00:50:31.979
KERRY MAGRO: Absolutely.

00:50:31.979 --> 00:50:33.520
AUDIENCE: So in your
experience, what

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:37.750
have you seen has worked for
people on the autism spectrum

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:43.610
in terms of specifically
sensory accommodations?

00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:46.570
KERRY MAGRO: Well,
I know sensory-wise,

00:50:46.570 --> 00:50:51.670
so actually in companies
I would always--

00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:53.781
and this has
gradually slowed down

00:50:53.781 --> 00:50:55.030
as I've gotten a little older.

00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:58.250
But I've always used
a sensory brush,

00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:00.850
which is like the size
of my palm for whenever

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:02.050
I would have a situation.

00:51:02.050 --> 00:51:04.404
Now, I know, obviously, many
reasonable accommodation

00:51:04.404 --> 00:51:06.070
in the workplace,
they don't necessarily

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:07.900
provide a sensory brush.

00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:11.890
But things-- for example,
I've seen a lot of individuals

00:51:11.890 --> 00:51:15.610
with sensory issues
prefer to use

00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:17.410
laptops for all
their assignments

00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:20.330
versus any written projects,
which is very accessible now

00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:23.770
because we're trying to go green
in many companies today anyway.

00:51:23.770 --> 00:51:28.450
So utilizing assistive
technology, laptops,

00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:31.870
especially for
more sensory issues

00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:36.250
that are focused on
just holding things

00:51:36.250 --> 00:51:37.630
such as pencils and pens.

00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:40.630
There might be textural
issues that individuals

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:43.870
might deal with,
especially if they're

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:46.900
provided in certain ways,
like having to write on paper,

00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:50.360
having to write even on a
white board or a smart board

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:52.070
it might be difficult for them.

00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:55.450
So being able to utilize
their assistive technology,

00:51:55.450 --> 00:51:59.960
whether it be an iPad or being
able to use a computer as well.

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.230
So that's one of the bigger
reasonable accommodations

00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:04.330
we see, especially
on the sensory realm.

00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:09.972
And it's going to vary for
person to person as well.

00:52:09.972 --> 00:52:10.840
Hope that helps.

00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:11.800
Yes?

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:14.200
AUDIENCE: I'm just
wondering if individual

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.920
doesn't self-disclose,
is it polite

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:22.570
and advised to ask if you
think, OK, maybe if I knew that.

00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:25.690
What are the better ways to
communicate, for example?

00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:29.050
Like whether verbal
communication or written

00:52:29.050 --> 00:52:31.860
communication should be used.

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:34.690
What's the best
way to approach it?

00:52:34.690 --> 00:52:36.370
KERRY MAGRO: Well
the thing we see

00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:41.020
the most is that when companies
do decide to get involved

00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:43.930
with professional
training and then decide

00:52:43.930 --> 00:52:49.060
to get involved with really
trying to show diversity

00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:54.520
in their workplace, it becomes
a more enlightening organization

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:57.430
to have that aha moment where
they're like, you know what?

00:52:57.430 --> 00:53:01.060
Maybe we can disclose a
disability, versus a company

00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:05.710
where they don't necessarily see
those specific accommodations.

00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:09.490
I've gone into many
companies where even

00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:12.460
being able to be
wheelchair accessible

00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:16.240
and being able to have very
visual signs of that has even

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:18.790
actually come off
to a domino effect

00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:20.660
for individuals with
learning disabilities,

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:22.034
saying that they're
doing so much

00:53:22.034 --> 00:53:24.940
for physical disabilities that
could trickle down for those

00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:26.710
with learning
disabilities and are more

00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:28.690
likely to want to disclose.

00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:31.180
So it's not only
the visuals that

00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:33.760
are around each and
every specific company,

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.710
but it's also hosting
special events

00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:38.470
and professional training
to focus on diversity

00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:40.670
inclusion in the workplace.

00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:43.630
AUDIENCE: So my example
is, for example, I

00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:46.190
was working an
individual, which appear

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:50.630
to like not paying attention
to what we were doing.

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:54.250
And later I learned
that the individual

00:53:54.250 --> 00:53:55.900
was on autism spectrum.

00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:59.360
And had I known that,
maybe I tried harder

00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:02.510
or tried different
ways of communicating.

00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:06.880
So is it something
that's reasonable to ask

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:08.740
directly or not?

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:09.940
KERRY MAGRO: No.

00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:11.000
Unfortunately, not.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.065
It's because you have to
think about the individual

00:54:14.065 --> 00:54:17.800
in that case and
what their reaction

00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:20.020
might be if that is brought up.

00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:22.390
And that could lead to
problems down the line

00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:25.270
with work effectiveness
and human resource

00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:27.850
violation or difficulty
down the line as well.

00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:29.777
So yeah.

00:54:29.777 --> 00:54:30.610
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:54:30.610 --> 00:54:31.110
Cool.

00:54:33.787 --> 00:54:34.370
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:35.932
Thanks for coming in.

00:54:35.932 --> 00:54:37.640
My wife and I are
actually in the process

00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:39.265
of adopting a child
with special needs,

00:54:39.265 --> 00:54:40.807
so this is true and
dear to my heart.

00:54:40.807 --> 00:54:41.973
KERRY MAGRO: That's awesome.

00:54:41.973 --> 00:54:43.200
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:46.550
We just finished rounds
of performance reviews.

00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:51.770
And I'm curious to hear
what have you consulted

00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:53.480
various different
companies on how

00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:57.150
to provide effective feedback
for those who have autism

00:54:57.150 --> 00:55:02.600
in knowing their condition and
how to address and help them

00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:03.260
to grow?

00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:04.010
KERRY MAGRO: Sure.

00:55:04.010 --> 00:55:06.800
So a perfect example--

00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:10.250
so the companies we've spoken
to so far, and the bigger

00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:12.860
companies-- we've gone to many
small parent-run organizations.

00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:19.460
But we've been to PNC, American
Express, JP Morgan Chase, PSEG,

00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:20.360
Wyndham Worldwide.

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:21.950
So we've even done
hotels and how

00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:26.900
to be friendlier to hotel guests
who might have individuals

00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:28.230
with disabilities.

00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:31.730
So one of the biggest
things we kind of talk about

00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:35.540
in that realm, about
trying to having

00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:38.090
that communication
and that feedback,

00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:42.620
is to truly kind of assess
short- and long-term goals

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:44.439
with all individuals.

00:55:44.439 --> 00:55:46.730
And this is not only for
individuals with disabilities,

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:49.160
but we should be doing more
one-on-ones, whether it

00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:52.250
be on a weekly basis,
a bi-weekly basis,

00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:55.880
and trying to assess,
especially to disclose, just

00:55:55.880 --> 00:56:00.440
how their process is
going in a specific job

00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:04.370
and not necessarily
focus like, so Kerry,

00:56:04.370 --> 00:56:07.190
how are you doing as a person
with autism at this job?

00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:10.130
Just being just
one-on-one with them

00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:12.650
about if their
accommodations-- if they

00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:14.240
need more accommodations
once they've

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:15.440
actually disclosed that.

00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:18.000
I think that's one of the
biggest, biggest things.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.320
We need more communication
and open communication

00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:23.780
because a lot of these
people also think literally.

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:27.860
They also don't
necessarily understand

00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:30.470
things such as different
tones of voice,

00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:32.270
different tones of
language, and especially

00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:33.936
when it comes to body
language and being

00:56:33.936 --> 00:56:36.800
able to understand facial
expressions and facial cues

00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:37.770
as well.

00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:39.590
So the more literal, the better.

00:56:39.590 --> 00:56:41.340
And I heard that was
my last question.

00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:42.530
I hope that helps.

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:45.200
But I have business cards
for every single person

00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:45.890
in this room.

00:56:45.890 --> 00:56:48.530
We expect to have
about 100 so I'm

00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:50.170
more than happy to
ask any question

00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:51.360
and after this presentation.

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:52.943
I thank you all so
much for having me.

00:56:52.943 --> 00:56:54.108
It was wonderful.

00:56:54.108 --> 00:56:55.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:57.550
Thank you so much.
