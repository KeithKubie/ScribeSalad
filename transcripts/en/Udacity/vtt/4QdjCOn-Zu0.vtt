00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.035
Let's see if this summing of the logs of factors works for other factors, apart

00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:08.880
from just powers of 10. We've already seen these 2 logs before. I've just

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.656
written more decimal places out this time. We have log based 10 of 2, and log

00:00:13.656 --> 00:00:18.715
based 10 of 3. Note that both of these are still rounded numbers. Using these

00:00:18.715 --> 00:00:23.650
two values. What do you think log base 10 of 6 is? First I would like you to

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.946
make a guess and then I would like you to find the actual answer with a

00:00:25.946 --> 00:00:30.030
calculator. Please find both of these to to 5 decimal places.
