THOR MITCHELL: So thank you
everybody for joining us.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.490
This is the Maps API
Fireside Chat.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.290
We have a bunch of people up
here on the stage and a bunch

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.080
more people down at the
front here, all from

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.000
the maps API team.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.190
So between us, hopefully
we can do our best

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.700
to answer your questions.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.140
I will let everybody introduce
themselves,

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.805
starting with Sean.

00:00:18.805 --> 00:00:19.960
SEAN ASKAY: All right, my
name is Sean Askay.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.470
I'm a developer advocate on
the Google Earth Outreach

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.100
team, and I'm also the
tech lead for KML.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.460
PETER BIRCH: I'm Peter Birch,
the product manager for Google

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.490
Earth product family, including
desktop and mobile

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.150
and also API.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.790
And I've also been involved in
some of the Earth Engine work.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.490
So if people have some questions
about that, I might

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.770
be able to answer some
of those as well.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.480
SUSANNAH RAUB: Hello,
I'm Susannah Raub.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.760
I am the tech lead for the
JavaScript Maps API.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.600
THOR MITCHELL: My name's
Thor Mitchell.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.390
I'm the product manager
for the Maps API

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.630
and the Places API.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.180
JAMES MCGILL: My name
is James McGill.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.170
I'm the tech lead for the Maps
Engine APIs and for KML on

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.080
Google Maps.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.269
MANO MARKS: My name
is Mano Marks.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.860
I'm the lead developer advocate
on the Google Maps

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.140
Developer Relations team.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.310
I'm heading up our
outreach efforts.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.910
THOR MITCHELL: OK, so we're
hoping you all came along

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.830
because you have plenty of
questions to ask, or this

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.725
could be a very short session.

00:01:20.725 --> 00:01:25.720
MANO MARKS: By fireside chat,
we mean you chat us.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.130
THOR MITCHELL: We have a mic at
the front and a mic and a

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.320
back there, and I
think we also--

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.620
do we have a roaming mic?

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.020
No, OK.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.620
So anyone want to volunteer
to go first?

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.200
Thank you.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:45.715
AUDIENCE: Google Earth--

00:01:45.715 --> 00:01:46.250
THOR MITCHELL: It's good--

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.300
you want to get it on
the video, too.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.790
AUDIENCE: Hello?

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.030
There it is.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.900
Google Earth API on mobile,
being able to integrate like

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.014
flyovers, things like that
in our own apps--

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:55.980
PETER BIRCH: I'm sorry,
I didn't--

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.560
AUDIENCE: Google Earth API,
like being able to do

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.770
flyovers, 3D stuff, so it's
not just like Street View

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.390
where it's just staggered
images, where it's more of a

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.200
smooth flow.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.500
Google Earth has that on mobile,
but it's not an open

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.229
SDK or open API.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.010
Is there any way that we can
access that in our own apps?

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.310
PETER BIRCH: Sure.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.770
So there's a couple
ways right now.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.690
So the question was about Google
Earth API on mobile and

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.680
what are some of the ways that
developers could take

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.290
advantage of this kind of full
immersive 3D, if I'm

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.360
paraphrasing that correctly.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.330
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.860
PETER BIRCH: So, first of all,
today there are some ways

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.980
developers can use that.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.360
So one is through KML.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.140
And if anyone also has more KML
questions, Sean is our KML

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.700
expert here.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.870
We can talk more about
the nuances of it.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.600
But it's a common markup
language, and that is

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.530
supported on mobile.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.220
And that's supported actually
on Android and iOS.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.260
And so if you do have KML, there
are some limitations.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.790
But you'll be able to load that
onto the mobile device

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.820
and then view that content.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.020
In addition, on Android we take
advantage of intents.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.360
And so if you use the View
intent with a file type of KML

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.780
or KMZ, it will automatically
launch Earth.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.750
And, for example, if it has
a tour in it, it will

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.205
automatically start
playing the tour.

00:03:14.205 --> 00:03:17.190
So one really easy thing you
could do today is if you have

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.060
a flyover that you wanted as
part of your application, you

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.760
could basically just have a link
that would launch Earth

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.080
and then start playing
that flyover.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.860
Now we often hear people saying,
hey, I want to be able

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.650
to do more than that.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:31.870
I want to have a full SDK.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.030
I want to be able to have full
programmability over that.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.710
We don't have anything to
talk about right now,

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:37.490
unfortunately.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.440
But it is something that we hear
more of, and we'd love to

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.950
hear more ideas and ways that
people might want to use

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.410
something like that.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.710
AUDIENCE: So there's no way to
integrate that inside the app

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.435
instead of launching the
external Google Earth?

00:03:50.435 --> 00:03:50.790
PETER BIRCH: Right.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.770
So right now, there's no way of
integrating it within your

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:53.350
application.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.600
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.580
AUDIENCE: I have a very cool app
that I have to deliver at

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.700
the end of July.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.400
And I'm sort of wondering how
many of these APIs are

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.650
available for me to use today?

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.030
What are the chances I could
deliver that, number one, from

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.940
a technical point of view?

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.400
And then would there also be
the necessary documentation

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.170
and examples available to help
me use these new APIs?

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.730
MANO MARKS: Can you say
specifically which APIs you're

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:25.590
interested in?

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:32.630
AUDIENCE: Well, I have quite a
few point-in-polygon layers in

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.300
ArcView in Arc, And I want to
be able to upload those and

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.540
then combine those with some
other mapping data and ortho

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.640
photos and things like that.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.310
MANO MARKS: So today, you can
upload all that to Maps

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.710
Engine, if you have a Maps
Engine account, and then serve

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.210
those out onto layers, onto a
Google Maps API application.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.170
That's all available
right now.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.460
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.560
And what about in terms of
examples and documentation?

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.670
MANO MARKS: We've got
fewer of those.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.270
The Maps data layer is listed as
experimental because that's

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.630
our way of saying we're
testing this

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.830
particular piece out.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.190
But you can ask questions
in our developer forums.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.970
Specifically on Stack Overflow,
we're answering

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:20.510
questions there.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:26.780
Just tag it as Maps API v3, and
then somebody will get to

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.080
answer your questions.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.550
And also, I have a couple of
samples in my slide deck.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.000
Which I did for Maps Engine, and
I'll publish that out to

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.350
Twitter tonight.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.670
I guess.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:45.100
And then there's also a code
lab tomorrow on Maps Engine

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.320
where you can take a lot
of that code with you.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.680
AUDIENCE: So you would say the
odds are pretty good I should

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.370
be able to count on those
features and deliver?

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.700
MANO MARKS: Yes.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.950
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.840
AUDIENCE: First of all, thank
you for the transit API.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.220
I have a project called Transit
&amp; Trails, and we've

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.110
been waiting for that
for a long time.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.380
It looks great.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.280
I looked at the docs.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.030
I was wondering about, is there
a way to get service

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.110
area boundaries for the agencies
that you do have in

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.250
the system and a way to get a
list programmatically of the

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.070
agencies that do provide
their data?

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.690
Because certain areas,
especially the Bay Area, has

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.260
lots of agencies and not
all of them are there.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.330
So if we can provide a way to
our users to disable certain

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.580
features if they're looking in
an area that doesn't have

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.040
transit available, that
would be great.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.940
Is there anything like that?

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.380
THOR MITCHELL: We did yesterday,
in conjunction with

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.600
the launch ad, update our FAQ,
and there is a link in there

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.700
that links to a list of all
the transit agencies, I

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.270
believe, that we include.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.770
And we don't have coverage
polygons, I think is what

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:54.670
you're asking for.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:55.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.220
We're currently maintaining our
own polygons for service

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.250
area boundaries for the agencies
we know about.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.390
But it'd be great if we could
get that programmatically for

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.580
all the other regions.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.900
THOR MITCHELL: Yeah, I don't--

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.300
that's certainly not something
we currently provide.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.910
I don't believe we expose that
on Maps either, so I'm not

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:13.490
sure that's something
we have in the

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:14.910
infrastructure at the moment.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:19.380
There is a sort of manual
process you could go through.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.630
We did introduce the
transit layer.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.800
And if you were to take the
transit layer and take, for

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.280
example, our drawing tools, and
then refer to the list of

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.270
cities that we have, you could
actually just sketch out the

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.376
polygons yourself
fairly easily.

00:07:33.376 --> 00:07:35.075
But it's a little bit
of a manual process.

00:07:35.075 --> 00:07:36.920
AUDIENCE: Yeah, cool.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.230
SUSANNAH RAUB: I'd also say,
file feature requests like

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.260
this, the team that maintains
all of this is not here.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.050
And so we would need to
communicate back with Zurich

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.830
and find out what's even
possible on some of that.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.380
AUDIENCE: Sure, absolutely.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:51.630
Thank you.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.730
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
there's any plans to support

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:03.060
Windows 7 multitouch in Earth
in either the thick or the

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.310
thin client?

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.120
PETER BIRCH: Yes, that's
something we definitely looked

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.500
at, and we just haven't
implemented it completely yet.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.800
So you're talking about for a
touchpad, or are you talking

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.750
about for touchscreen?

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.500
AUDIENCE: For larger
touchscreens like perceptive

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.840
pixel devices, stuff
along that nature?

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:26.300
Basically, anything that runs
Windows 7 multitouch support.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.060
PETER BIRCH: Yeah, I mean, it's
something that obviously

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.440
isn't there right now, but we
are definitely looking into

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.443
and would love to add.

00:08:32.443 --> 00:08:34.190
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:35.539
PETER BIRCH: I mean, obviously,
from our mobile

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:38.360
devices, we've done a lot of
work already in terms of a

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.110
touch interface.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:44.000
So we'd really like to bring
that to touchpads as well as

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.930
touchscreens on other
operating systems.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.420
PETER BIRCH: All right, guys.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.270
Don't be shy.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.630
AUDIENCE: I've got lots
more questions.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.730
So in talking with my Google
rep-- he's not a very

00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:59.870
technical guy.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:03.100
He always talks about, oh, you
know, Maps and Earth are kind

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.930
of merging together.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.870
On the web, looking at it from
that perspective, what's the

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:09.710
roadmap for that?

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:11.200
And this is kind of a two-part
question, so

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.450
that's the first part.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:14.790
I'll let you guys go.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:15.045
PETER BIRCH: Excellent.

00:09:15.045 --> 00:09:18.250
That's one of my favorite
questions.

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:18.950
So obviously--

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:19.180
MANO MARKS: Next question.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.350
PETER BIRCH: --Maps
and Earth have a

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:22.650
lot of lineage together.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.310
In fact, if you go back in
history and when Keyhole was

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.670
acquired, a lot of that
technology is what brought

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.730
satellite mode, for example,
to Google Maps.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:42.150
And in 2008, I believe, we
launched Earth View in Google

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.900
Maps as well.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.400
So we're always working and
trying to figure out how we

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.340
can bring these different
experiences to our users

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.180
wherever they are, right?

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.320
Now, there's going to be
technology limitations.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.180
So, for example, in a browser,
there's certain things that

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.730
are easy to do and other things
that are hard to do.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.980
And so, for example, when we
brought out the Earth API and

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:06.710
the plug-in, it's not because
we love plug-ins.

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:10.480
It's because that was the best
technical solution that we had

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.150
in order to bring that level
of rich, high-frame-rate

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:18.710
interactive graphics to
developers on the web.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:22.030
Now, obviously as the web has
moved forward and there's a

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:26.850
lot of great new ideas and
technologies, we have WebGL.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.540
Browsers such as Chrome have
gotten much faster.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.030
And so we're obviously very
excited about some of the

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.630
possibilities there.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:38.560
I think it's pretty fair
to say that we

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.190
are one family, right?

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:44.350
And we're trying to bring all
of our services to our

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:46.800
customers wherever they are.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.720
And we're not done.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:55.540
So we absolutely want to bring a
full immersive 3D experience

00:10:55.540 --> 00:11:00.050
to every device you are and
be able to bring that

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:01.990
functionality across
with our products.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.300
AUDIENCE: Very cool.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.140
So is there like--

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:03.470
MANO MARKS: I have--

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:04.390
AUDIENCE: --an integration
point that's--

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:05.140
sorry, go ahead.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.970
MANO MARKS: I was just going to
say, you can start to see

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:11.120
the beginnings of that with our
Maps GL experiment, how

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.270
we're doing some of the swooping
effects, and also the

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:17.910
way the Street View panoramas
work and a lot of other things

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:21.900
within that, and taking
advantage of WebGL.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.480
I think it's a really--

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.370
I love it because I think it's
a really interesting problem.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.120
Your next question is probably
going to be when.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.312
I see that, yeah.

00:11:31.312 --> 00:11:32.610
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:36.780
MANO MARKS: And we're famous
for not giving an answer to

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:37.335
that question.

00:11:37.335 --> 00:11:39.750
AUDIENCE: But there is a when?

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:44.990
MANO MARKS: We can't promise
any upcoming features.

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.390
But it's--

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:46.140
PETER BIRCH: Let me jump in.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.775
We don't have anything to
announce at this time.

00:11:47.775 --> 00:11:48.030
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:48.580
MANO MARKS: Yes.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:49.840
Thank you, thank you.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.830
I'm sorry, I forgot
my key phrase.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.630
We don't have anything to
announce at this time.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.740
But yeah, it's definitely
something we really find very

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.990
compelling and really
interesting.

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.890
And the host of new
technologies, particularly

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:07.210
vector rendering, what you're
seeing now on Android devices

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:12.690
in Maps, it brings out just
amazing possibilities.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:19.140
And we're seeing both us and
people using our APIs leaping

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.950
forward with experiments on
these kind of technologies.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:22.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.470
The WebGL stuff is very,
very interesting.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:29.325
And that leads into the second
part of the question is, kind

00:12:29.325 --> 00:12:32.590
of through the grapevine, you
want to have web technologies,

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:36.120
mobile web stuff on mobile.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:40.870
As far as bringing that onto
mobile using WebGL on Android,

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.360
the path forward on that.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.200
PETER BIRCH: So I have some
thoughts on that.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.640
I mean, obviously, mobile throws
an interesting twist in

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.240
everything, right?

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.240
Because you obviously want
something that's going to be

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.470
great performance,
and you want some

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:56.630
that's going to be portable.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:13:00.540
And those things don't always
necessarily go together.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:03.820
I think the best thing to say
is that we're very excited

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.910
about how to bring all
of this technology to

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.050
wherever users are.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:11.330
And I think we will try to
figure out the best way to go

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:12.970
about doing that.

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:19.530
Today we provide a suite of
native APIs for Android with

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.590
our WebView APIs.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:26.920
And you also have the option
of using the JavaScript v3

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:31.360
APIs, and we kind of have
that whole suite.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.250
And so we're excited about
bringing all of this

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:34.960
to mobile as well.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:39.080
Obviously, we announced
yesterday the new version of

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.000
Google Earth, and we actually
launched it on mobile first,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.610
which is the first time
we've ever done that.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:49.280
So, obviously, mobile is very
much on our minds, and we're

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.860
always looking at ways of how
we can bring that to our

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:52.810
developers as well.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:53.490
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:54.740
Thank you.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.880
AUDIENCE: Hi, John Coryat
with USNaviguide.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:07.980
I have a lot of v2 pages, like
50,000 of them, running

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.290
GAdsManager.

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:14.670
And I was wondering how does the
v3 ads performance compare

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:17.810
to v2 ads performance
in terms of revenue?

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:18.700
Is it equal?

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.900
Is it up, down, same ads?

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.480
Can you give me some perspective
on that?

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.250
THOR MITCHELL: Mike, would you
like to answer that question?

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.230
MIKE FERRO: Underlying, it
should be the similar

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:35.690
performance.

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:36.956
We're using the same--

00:14:36.956 --> 00:14:39.720
oh, do you want me up?

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.970
Denied.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.950
MANO MARKS: Mike was trying
to avoid this earlier.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:51.360
MIKE FERRO: Hi there.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.490
I guess I should introduce
myself.

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:54.470
My name is Mike Ferro.

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:59.340
I'm an engineering manager in
Sydney working on geo stuff.

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:04.920
GAdsManager, now the Ad Unit,
the Google Maps Ad Unit--

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:05.930
MANO MARKS: Sorry, go ahead.

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:06.275
MIKE FERRO: Thank you.

00:15:06.275 --> 00:15:07.485
Oh, that's much better.

00:15:07.485 --> 00:15:09.520
MANO MARKS: I was just getting
a gesture from him.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:09.670
It

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:11.092
MIKE FERRO: Did you all
hear the intro?

00:15:11.092 --> 00:15:11.876
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:15:11.876 --> 00:15:13.590
MIKE FERRO: Yeah, OK.

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:16.150
So short answer, you should
see similar performance.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.110
We're using the same underlying
targeting

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:22.580
mechanisms, basically looking
at what users might be

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.820
interested in when looking
at this place.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.150
For those of you that haven't
seen that, we use a form of

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:32.900
ads targeting that says using
historical data in aggregate,

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.070
what might users be interested
in when looking at Orlando?

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:38.540
It turns out they may be
interested in Disney World.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.030
So we'll maybe show a Disney
World app, a little bias

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.580
towards that, certainly.

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.664
Similar underlying mechanism
for v2 and v3.

00:15:45.664 --> 00:15:48.820
AUDIENCE: I have to say that
performance of the Map ads has

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.680
been just phenomenal.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:56.120
The income from it is why
I'm here pretty much.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.020
So I'm a little leery about
changing anything because it's

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:02.640
just so good, and it seems
to just ever increase.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.940
So you think it's safe
for me to go into

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.570
the v3 water on that?

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.510
MIKE FERRO: So one of the hats
I wear, I look at ads for

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:12.760
Google Maps.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.680
And in general, what we do on
Maps, like if there's a

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.250
revenue question, one of the
great things about ads in

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:22.500
general is that you get really
good data that you can track,

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.480
and that allows us to do
fine-grained experiments.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.560
So rather than definitively
answering this for you,

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.160
because I can't really, what I
would suggest is try it out.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.500
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.570
MIKE FERRO: Run it on some
percentage of traffic, if you

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.370
have the capability, or try
it out for some days.

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:39.230
You'll very quickly
get the answer.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:40.570
You can try it on some
of your sites.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:41.880
I know you're running a
whole bunch of them.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.690
You were actually a partner
for us fairly early on.

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:44.290
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:45.910
MIKE FERRO: Which is
really exciting.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:48.530
The performance has varied
across various types of sites.

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.140
Try it out.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:53.100
AUDIENCE: OK, I guess I will.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:53.370
MIKE FERRO: And good luck.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:54.620
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:16:58.014 --> 00:16:58.986
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:16:58.986 --> 00:17:03.010
Could you please tell us
anything about your road map

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:09.260
in adding special query
capabilities to the API, more

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:17.420
specifically making a special
query between own content and

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:18.670
Google Maps?

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:24.109
MANO MARKS: So are you talking
about in the JavaScript API,

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:27.619
or are you talking about
in Google Maps Engine?

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:28.970
AUDIENCE: Perhaps
with the engine.

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:29.820
I don't know.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:35.290
We are making special analyses
using our own data.

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:42.290
We are using our GIS link
library and our GIS server,

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:45.240
making mashups.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.860
Are you thinking on, our case
for example, any other

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.665
alternative in the future?

00:17:51.665 --> 00:17:51.930
MANO MARKS: Right.

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:57.130
So in Google Maps Engine,
Dylan Lorimer announced

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:00.440
yesterday that by the end of
the year, we'll have basic

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:04.020
create, read, update, and
delete operations, which

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.710
should include queries.

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:10.440
We can't say when we'll have
specific features.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.590
But obviously, spatial queries
make a huge amount of sense

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:21.480
for Maps Engine and would be a
pretty natural fit for that.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.910
So yeah, I mean, again, I
can't commit to specific

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:25.930
features and when we get.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:31.930
But by the end of the year, we
should have your basic query

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:34.870
and create, read, update,
delete operations.

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:37.150
JAMES MCGILL: So For those not
familiar with Maps Engine,

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:41.350
this is our enterprise
geospatial cloud product.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:44.670
So the idea is we make it very
easy for you to take your data

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:47.230
that you have uploaded
into our cloud.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:48.770
We perform processing
on that data.

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:50.960
And by the end of the year,
we're going to have APIs so

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.000
that you can get back that data,
run queries over it,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.600
access subsets of it.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.160
We've also got great integration
with the Maps API,

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.100
which is already launched.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.670
So we can render that data
server side as tiled overlays,

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:05.610
which allows us to very
efficiently show very large

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:07.860
data sets on top of
the Maps API.

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:09.550
And then you can integrate
that with all the other

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:11.260
components of the
API, so Street

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.190
View, editable polygons.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:15.850
So that allows you to build
really rich applications

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:18.480
without having to worry about
how you host that data and how

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.880
you make it globally available
and reliably available.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:25.550
MANO MARKS: And we did a session
earlier in Google I/O,

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:29.120
which is recorded and should be
published as a video within

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:33.340
the next 24 hours, Enterprise
Geospatial in Google's Cloud.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:34.990
It talks through it.

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:36.510
Sean Maday and I did it.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:41.260
Sean did a demo of using Maps
Engine, and then I showed some

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.960
of the developer components that
exist today and talked a

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.885
little bit about the future.

00:19:46.885 --> 00:19:49.170
JAMES MCGILL: And I believe
there's a code lab tomorrow--

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:49.550
MANO MARKS: Yes, that's right.

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:51.500
JAMES MCGILL: --as well, which
should go into some of those

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.610
processes as well.

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.190
So that may be worth
attending.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:56.060
MANO MARKS: Sean Wohltman and
Mike Evanoff are running a

00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:00.480
code lab tomorrow, where you get
hands-on access to what we

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.780
currently have available
in the API.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.130
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.560
AUDIENCE: This is a question
about the offline mapping.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.240
I know there was a big talk.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.280
It was big feature.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.220
I don't think it was
talked that much in

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.490
the past two days.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:22.530
What is the best solution?

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.330
It would be the Google
Earth portable?

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:26.880
Or would it be the
Google Maps?

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.530
What's the best solution
for offline mapping?

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:30.840
No connectivity, no internet.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.995
THOR MITCHELL: A crack team
of experts with us today.

00:20:37.995 --> 00:20:40.980
DYLAN LORIMER: I asked him
to ask this question.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.210
So my name is Dylan Lorimer.

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.450
I'm one of the product managers
with all these folks

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:45.840
on the Geo team.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.610
And I'm specifically product
manager for the Google Earth

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:50.250
portable, which you mentioned.

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.940
So I think the question was,
what's the best solution for

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.820
offline use of Maps?

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.890
It really depends on
the situation.

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.190
I think you saw the announcement
two or three

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:02.520
weeks ago that we're enabling on
Google Maps for mobile the

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.660
ability to offline or cache
content for use in

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.680
disconnected environments like
when you go on holiday in

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.230
Europe, and you don't want
to incur roaming charges.

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:14.430
It's really targeted towards
the consumer use.

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:18.000
Do you want to describe
your use case a bit?

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:18.830
AUDIENCE: Well for us
it would be for

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:20.310
disaster response teams.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:22.890
So we're kind of looking
at global,

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:24.450
like our entire country.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:26.190
I was actually trying to
get it on my phone.

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:32.060
It limits the extent of your
actual offline capabilities on

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.680
my phone, so I can't actually
get a whole country.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.740
DYLAN LORIMER: OK, so you
mentioned the Google Earth

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.480
portable, and that's actually
a solution that we launched

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.540
about a year and a half ago.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.300
And it hasn't seen
a lot of fanfare.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.640
But it's actually had quite a
lot of use for these types of

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.180
scenarios--

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.440
disaster response
and humanitarian

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.880
response types of events.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.750
What it lets you do is, kind
of for your own data-- not

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:56.620
Google's content, but the
data that you provide--

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.440
you could basically create
those little caches.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.330
And they're really only
restricted in overall storage

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:02.870
that you have.

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:04.470
So they're not really
little caches.

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:06.420
They can be quite
large, in fact.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:10.990
And they can be deployed on
laptops or on mobile devices.

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:13.290
And they can launch, essentially
Google Earth or a

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:14.970
Google Maps-like front end.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.700
And you can have a complete
mapping experience in the

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.950
field with no connectivity
required.

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:21.280
They also can broadcast.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.410
So if you run this little
cache on your laptop, we

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:25.165
provide a server.

00:22:25.165 --> 00:22:30.240
And you can actually share the
tile feed, essentially, for

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.450
other users on your network to
connect to from Google Earth

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:35.990
or web-based mapping interfaces

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:37.150
to consume the tiles.

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:40.734
AUDIENCE: What about
mobile, Dylan?

00:22:40.734 --> 00:22:44.210
DYLAN LORIMER: Yeah, so the
portable solution runs on

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:44.940
laptops today.

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:46.360
We're very interested
in how we can do it

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.630
on mobile as well.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:48.980
We don't have any big
announcements

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:50.070
around that right now.

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:52.950
But taking a step back for a
minute, we're really promoting

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:55.880
this idea of using Google's
cloud to upload your data and

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.380
to build maps with.

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:59.910
But we know that in many cases
you have to deploy those maps

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:02.070
out into the field for
those purposes.

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:05.380
So we're certainly interested
in how we can let you take

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:07.470
that content out of Google's
cloud and easily

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:10.250
cache it, so to speak.

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:11.020
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.270
DYLAN LORIMER: Sure thing.

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:20.370
PETER BIRCH: If no one else asks
a question, we're going

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:22.476
to start singing.

00:23:22.476 --> 00:23:23.830
AUDIENCE: I'm trying
to avoid coming up.

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:24.900
Sorry, I've got so
many questions.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:25.940
MANO MARKS: You don't
me to start singing.

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:28.500
AUDIENCE: Imagery with
Street View.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.950
Any way along a given route or
path to get all available

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:36.070
Street View images and points,
where all those are taken?

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:37.860
THOR MITCHELL: Not currently,
although it is a question that

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:41.470
comes up fairly regularly, so
it is something that we have

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:43.560
been known to discuss.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.410
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:49.210
And the 45-degree cool 3D
building stuff, unfortunately,

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:53.580
I can't bring in Google Earth
into stuff we're using.

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:54.950
I'd love to.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:57.165
Any chance of bringing
it into Maps?

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.960
PETER BIRCH: Fight over it.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.560
We don't have anything to
announce at this time.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.010
SEAN ASKAY: All right.

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:08.810
Next.

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:12.070
PETER BIRCH: But it sounds
like a really cool idea.

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:14.710
AUDIENCE: I like that.

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:17.880
PETER BIRCH: We'll take it
under consideration.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.720
AUDIENCE: Hi, Randy First
from Logitech.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.160
I'm looking at it from an
enterprise perspective.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.260
We'd like to have indoor maps
that are private to our

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.710
company, not shared outside.

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:32.430
And also the feature that was
shown yesterday in the keynote

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:36.150
of the Street View indoors
seems really interesting.

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:40.480
Any idea of how we would get
something like that for our

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.730
internal use?

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:49.990
JAMES MCGILL: So Maps Engine
for the indoor maps is

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:54.090
probably a good fit.

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:56.440
So Maps Engine allows you to ACL
your data so you can keep

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.280
it private just within
your organization.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.510
You can share it with other
people in your org so that you

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:02.100
can collaborate.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.210
And then you've got fine-grained
ACL on how that

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:06.270
data is distributed outside
your organization.

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:09.330
You could push some of it
publicly if you wanted to

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:11.790
build a floor plan that
everybody had access to, or

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:14.510
you can keep it locked down.

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.700
And for example, if you use
map dot [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.450
in the Maps API today, you
have the option of having

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:23.640
users authenticate via OAuth 2.0
in order to view that map.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.690
And then that guarantees that
only the people you want to

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.860
see it will be able to see it.

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.935
So using that, plus the ability
to store vector data

00:25:30.935 --> 00:25:33.400
and render those vectors on top
of Google's existing base

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.070
map, you should be able to build
compelling floor plans,

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:37.910
which you're able
to lock down.

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:40.870
MANO MARKS: You have to do a
little bit of playing around

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.360
for floors.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:46.680
Actually, if you take a look at
the Google I/O app on your

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:50.190
Android device if you've got
that, we did something

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:54.750
similar, although not using Maps
Engine, but just using

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:58.050
different floor plans and just
having a little control that

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:01.230
adds on the floors.

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:03.520
So you press 2 to get to
the second floor, 3 for

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.900
the third, et cetera.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:08.740
So that's all doable with
the JavaScript API Maps

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:10.220
Engine right now.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:13.720
One thing we don't have, and I
just mention this because it

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.210
came up in the last session,
is we don't have routing

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:17.330
within Maps Engine.

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:21.080
So we don't have a way to allow
you to do routing over

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:25.400
your own data, which would
be a nice feature.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.520
AUDIENCE: And then
the second part--

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.120
MANO MARKS: James can build
that tomorrow, I'm sure.

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.980
AUDIENCE: The second part was
the Street View indoor views

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:36.750
of the office layout itself.

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:40.960
THOR MITCHELL: The Maps API does
allow you to build street

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.590
view panoramas based on
your own imagery.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:47.790
You do have to stitch that
panorama together yourself and

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:49.530
tile it and host those tiles.

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:53.130
But it provides the methods
you need to define the

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:55.500
orientation of the panorama, the
links between panoramas,

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.280
and then put that into the

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.310
familiar Street View interface.

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:03.490
So we don't currently have a
purpose-built hosting solution

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:05.990
for that, although obviously you
could host that imagery on

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:08.000
App Engine or such like.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.500
But the capability is there in
the Maps API to offer custom

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:11.730
Street View panoramas.

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:16.190
On And we have seen a number of
organizations use that to

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:18.600
provide indoor imagery.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.120
You can even connect--

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.160
I realize you may not want to do
this in an ACL environment.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.850
But on public sites, within the
Maps API, you can connect

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:27.480
that into the existing
Street View graphs.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.270
You can move seamlessly
from Google imagery

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:30.520
into your own imagery.

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:36.390
AUDIENCE: So I actually
wanted to ask

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:39.110
about that same question.

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:42.700
How do I get my business
on the indoor--

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:46.290
not indoor mapping, but the
indoor visualization that they

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:49.700
showed in the I/O at
the first keynote?

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:51.480
THOR MITCHELL: The Street
View imagery?

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.220
AUDIENCE: Not the Street View
imagery, the indoor imagery.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.750
THOR MITCHELL: Right.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:00.810
But sorry, the indoor
photos or actually

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:02.430
the floor plan maps.

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:04.080
AUDIENCE: Indoor photos.

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.800
You may not be the team
for that or--

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.490
THOR MITCHELL: Yeah, I don't
know off the top of my head,

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:09.510
but I can find out.

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:10.180
So if you grab me later--

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.470
MANO MARKS: I'm sorry, is the
question how do you get your

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:12.610
business into there?

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:13.050
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:16.400
MANO MARKS: Yeah, currently,
as far as I know, it's a

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.980
US-only program.

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:19.180
No?

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:20.900
OK, he just expanded that.

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.360
Nabil will probably answer
this question.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:23.730
PETER BIRCH: You should get a
prize if you bring another

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:26.000
Googler up on stage, I think.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.360
MANO MARKS: Hey, Dylan
got off the stage.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.080
MALE SPEAKER: I'm not actually
part of the team, but there's

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.120
a website you can go to where
you request for a photographer

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:33.850
to come to your business.

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:36.700
They'll take photos inside, and
then they'll put it in.

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:41.170
So it's a program that we
run globally right now.

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:42.970
MANO MARKS: It's called Business
Photos, I think is

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:43.270
the public name.

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:46.860
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I think if
you just search for like

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.470
Google Maps indoor business
photos or something like that,

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:50.180
there'll be a link.

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:53.620
And then you can just say
send a photographer

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:55.230
to my place of business.

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:56.330
AUDIENCE: OK, and
to be clear--

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:56.770
MANO MARKS: And you end
up having to pay the

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:57.890
photographer.

00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:59.720
I mean, It's not
a free service.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.070
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.880
So it's not--

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:01.970
a few weeks ago--

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:03.100
MALE SPEAKER: Are you sure?

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:03.980
MANO MARKS: I thought I was--

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:04.450
MALE SPEAKER: I don't.

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:05.910
MANO MARKS: I thought
that was true.

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:07.470
AUDIENCE: So a few
weeks ago, Google

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:08.440
brought out the backpack.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.850
It was at a mapping event.

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:13.170
They brought out the backpack
where somebody gets to walk

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:16.010
through a building and
take full panoramas.

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:18.745
I want that guy to come to my
office and take pictures so I

00:29:18.745 --> 00:29:19.730
can get it out on
the internet.

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:21.590
PETER BIRCH: Yeah, so what we
announced a couple of weeks

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:24.050
ago is something called Trekker,
and that's really a

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:26.430
continuation of the
Street View.

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:29.490
So basically we started with
streets, and we can drive

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:31.460
around, and we can take a lot
of different imagery and

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:34.230
provide the great Street
View experience we had.

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:36.060
But there are some places
we couldn't drive.

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.550
And so we created the trike.

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:40.950
And that allowed us to go and
gather that same imagery in

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:45.020
places that were too narrow
or pedestrian walkways.

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:48.000
And then there were ski slopes,
and so we have a

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.190
snowmobile.

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:52.750
And we were able to get some
great imagery, including, for

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:57.090
example, the Vancouver Winter
Olympics and things like that.

00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:58.780
It turns out there's still some
other places that none of

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:00.490
those vehicles will actually
get us to.

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:02.940
But we managed to actually strap
the trike onto a boat to

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:05.100
get the Amazon.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.630
So we were able to kind of
purpose that, including, I

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:10.090
think, on a rail car
on the Swiss Alps.

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:12.900
So we have some great
imagery there.

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:16.420
The Trekker is our latest foray
into how can we bring

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:22.050
beautiful views of places to our
users in places where all

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:24.540
you can do is hike or
cross country ski

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:25.190
or some other things.

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:27.980
So that will be something where
you'll start to see

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:31.520
imagery showing up of, for
example, Grand Canyon or other

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.990
national parks and
other places.

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:36.150
But that's not something that
is currently available for

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:38.630
businesses or third parties.

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:40.910
AUDIENCE: OK, so there's no
real way for me to either

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:47.250
submit those panoramas myself
to appear as part of Google?

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:49.660
I realize I think you addressed
this gentleman's

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:52.360
question before as how I could
add those images for my own

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:56.640
use as a layer on top of
the existing maps.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.450
I think you understand
my question.

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:00.780
THOR MITCHELL: Certainly, the
indoor photos program,

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.660
business photos program, the
photographers that go out have

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.940
been trained to capture the
imagery in a specific way we

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:09.650
need with particular
equipment.

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:12.370
Extending that to be arbitrary
user-supplied

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:13.970
content would be--

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:15.300
it would have a lot
of overhead.

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:20.590
We'd have to do a lot
of review and--

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:23.070
it could become quite
frustrating if what you've

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:24.780
done doesn't quite match our
requirements but it looks good

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:26.110
enough for you.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:30.260
So right now, we only send out
trained photographers.

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.770
PETER BIRCH: Just one
last thing on that.

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:34.480
MANO MARKS: What I was going
to say is there's nothing

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.220
stopping you from creating your
own Maps API application,

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:40.130
putting it on your website,
and using your own imagery

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:42.720
within a Street View
panorama there

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.150
that's hosted for yourself.

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:45.780
PETER BIRCH: Yeah, and there
are also some user photo

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:47.810
communities, including
Panoramio, which is a Google

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:50.560
service, and ones like
360Cities, which have a

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:53.350
fantastic collection
of photos.

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:56.170
And in fact, in Google Earth,
I believe in Google Maps as

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:59.040
well, we have a layer of
360Cities panoramas.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.830
So there are communities out
there where you can actually,

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:04.750
if you have high-quality
photos, upload.

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:07.730
Those can be seen by a large
number of users.

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:10.630
THOR MITCHELL: And also, it's
a lesser-known fact that the

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:13.290
Panoramio layer in the v3 Maps
API allows you to actually

00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:15.680
specify a specific user,
a Panoramio user

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.110
whose photos to show.

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:20.920
So you can actually display a
layer of photos on your map

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.580
which you can click on and it
will open up and give you

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:25.300
larger versions and then
restrict that to only photos

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:26.530
that you've taken.

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:29.470
MANO MARKS: Although Panoramio,
to be fair, is not

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:31.810
for indoor photography
primarily.

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:37.550
It's for panoramic landscape
photography.

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:39.660
AUDIENCE: With the trike,
do you have a program to

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.150
collaborate with the rail
trail organizations?

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:46.920
MANO MARKS: Sorry, could
you repeat that?

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:47.970
AUDIENCE: The trike.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:51.970
Do you have a program to
collaborate with rail trail

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:55.100
organizations, bike trail?

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.600
PETER BIRCH: Yeah, I think--
so is the question about

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.640
Rails-to-Trails--

00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.010
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:01.000
PETER BIRCH: --and whether we're
collaborating with them?

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.300
We actually did collaborate with
them in terms of getting

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.780
that information into our biking
directions, just as I

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:06.680
know one partnership.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:10.570
I do not know if we are having
any partnership in terms of

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:13.480
getting imagery of
those trails.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:16.230
So I imagine that's the type of
thing that would be great

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:18.560
for our users, but I don't know
if we have any specific

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.060
arrangement with them.

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.000
AUDIENCE: You can't announce
a date then.

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:28.780
MANO MARKS: And by the way, I
don't know how to get you to

00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:29.980
be a Street View driver.

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:32.760
That's another question that
comes up very often.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.214
I can't comment on that.

00:33:34.214 --> 00:33:37.250
AUDIENCE: OK, we're working
with a couple of customers

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:42.590
into police and intelligence
services, and internet is not

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:43.980
an option for them.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:47.470
They can, of course, use Google
Earth Enterprise, but

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:50.380
they would love to get
it with your data.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:51.510
Is that a possibility?

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:54.700
Not now, I know, but
in the future?

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:55.740
PETER BIRCH: I didn't actually
hear the whole question.

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.815
Did you get that, Dylan?

00:33:57.815 --> 00:34:00.490
DYLAN LORIMER: Yeah.

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:01.680
PETER BIRCH: We should hand out
Map stickers every time--

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.060
DYLAN LORIMER: Hey there.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:03.120
My name is Dylan Lorimer.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.620
And In addition to the portable,
I also product

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:07.600
manage Google Earth
Enterprise.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.969
So I think the question was
is there a way to provide

00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:14.150
Google's content for use with
Google Earth Enterprise?

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:17.489
For the benefit of everyone,
Google Earth Enterprise is an

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:20.409
on-premise solution that Google
provides that lets

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:22.750
organizations build their own
maps and their own Google

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:25.139
Earths using the same technology
that we use at

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:28.860
Google in our cloud but provided
for on-premise use.

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:29.889
And we don't provide content.

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:32.230
We basically give you tools
for you to use your own

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:34.850
content to build your
own globes and maps.

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:36.750
And it's amazing to see
organizations that are

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:39.469
actually building really
purposeful--

00:34:39.469 --> 00:34:41.850
maps specific to their
use cases.

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:43.960
To answer your question, no,
we don't provide Google's

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.250
content today.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:46.420
It's come up quite a lot.

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:49.500
A lot of organizations are
interested in that, of course.

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:50.989
I think it's something we'd
like to consider.

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:53.710
And with the announcement a few
weeks ago of being able to

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:56.800
provide some of Google's content
cached in mobile

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.030
devices, that could open
some opportunities.

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:02.790
But we don't have anything to
announce today, to use the

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:05.910
term I just heard from you.

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:08.194
Which organization
are you from?

00:35:08.194 --> 00:35:09.090
AUDIENCE: Private one.

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:10.340
DYLAN LORIMER: Oh,
OK, private one.

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:18.222
PETER BIRCH: More questions?

00:35:18.222 --> 00:35:18.720
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.480
I think I may have asked
somebody about this at one of

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:22.410
the talks earlier.

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:26.300
But we had some developers
recently that on their own

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:29.770
time they were developing some
pretty cool applications with

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:31.700
Maps and Fusion Tables.

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:35.260
And we liked it so when we went
to commercialize it, we

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:39.040
kind of ran into a brick wall
because we can't use Google

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:42.140
apps for domains and put
Fusion Tables in there.

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:45.900
So I'm wondering is that
something that might be

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:46.920
changed in the future?

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:50.030
Or do we need to look at Maps
Engine for the way to

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:51.280
commercialize that?

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:01.720
THOR MITCHELL: So the question
is about Maps Engine

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.290
integration with Apps
for your domain.

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:07.470
PETER BIRCH: Well, it's slightly
different than that.

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:10.740
I think there's a separate
question about Fusion Tables.

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:14.290
And I think that Fusion Tables
is a great technology, and I

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:17.360
think its application for
mapping has got a lot of

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.050
people excited.

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:20.870
And I think what we're really
trying to do is take a lot of

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:23.720
that technology through Maps
Engine to be able to bring

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:24.900
that to our geo developers.

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:28.000
And so as we bring in new
capabilities and new features,

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.980
Maps Engine is really the
platform we're looking to

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:31.500
bring that.

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:35.130
Now specifically in terms of
Maps Engine Google and Google

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:36.770
Apps for domain, that's
a Dylan question.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:45.170
DYLAN LORIMER: So the question
is around Maps Engine running

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:47.640
on corporate domains
at Google, right?

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.380
So all of our products at Google
when we're building

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:53.800
them for the enterprise, they
should just work on corporate

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:54.990
domains, essentially.

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:56.730
And Map Engine's no exception.

00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:59.150
It's not included in
the default Google

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:00.020
Apps product suites.

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:03.190
You don't pay $50 and get Maps
Engine enabled on your domain.

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:05.190
We have a different
pricing model.

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:07.420
But we integrate very
well with it.

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:09.820
So all the administrative
tools just work.

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:12.320
All the users in your domain,
you can provision to have

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:13.610
access to Maps Engine.

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:16.680
When you share and publish maps,
those same users can get

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.200
access to them.

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.980
So it fits really well into
the Apps ecosystem.

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:32.940
AUDIENCE: A few weeks ago, I
read something like Google

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:39.825
Places will be subsumed
in Google+, yes?

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:47.730
For example, what I understood
is that in Google Places, a

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:51.700
page of the owner would
be a Google+ profile,

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.150
something like that.

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:55.130
Is that it?

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:56.800
Or nothing to do?

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.810
THOR MITCHELL: So yes, a
couple of weeks ago, we

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:04.400
launched Google+ Local, which
essentially is a new

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:08.240
destination for the information
we collect and

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:11.820
offer around businesses
and reviews, scores.

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.070
It's a much more social
experience.

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:15.590
It's integrated with Google+.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:17.140
You can contribute
your own reviews.

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.800
You can see reviews that
people in your

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.980
circles have submitted.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:26.580
And as part of that, we are
migrating from the old Google

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:32.450
Place pages to have Google+
Local pages instead.

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:36.550
So as a result, yes, we
will be migrating

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:39.594
the existing place--

00:38:39.594 --> 00:38:41.070
I don't know actually whether
it's the account as much, as

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:46.480
just the public-facing Place
pages into Google+.

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:50.820
AUDIENCE: For example, if we are
saying Google Places API,

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:53.010
it will be different now?

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:55.270
MANO MARKS: No.

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:57.470
THOR MITCHELL: No, this is
actually a point of confusion

00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:59.700
which we should have
seen coming.

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:01.310
There was some concern
that when--

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:03.710
there were a lot of articles
that said Google Places is

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:05.580
being replaced with Google+
Local, that there was an

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:08.460
assumption that the Google
Places API would follow suit.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:09.690
And that's not the
case at all.

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:15.880
In fact, the Places API is
something that we launched at

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:18.390
I/O last year, if you are
not familiar with it.

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:20.150
And then we continue to develop
at a pace, and we

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:23.830
launched a whole wealth of new
features just in the last

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:25.960
couple of days, including access
to reviews, the same

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:29.700
reviews you see on Google+
Local, access to paging so you

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:30.990
can get more results
than you used to

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:32.720
previously be able to get.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:36.270
Also, more advanced text search
features, better for

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:38.300
desktop and speech-based apps.

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:41.540
And also we're adding opening
hours information to the

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:42.850
Places API as well.

00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:45.820
So the Places API is healthfully
expanding its

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:48.190
capabilities.

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:51.750
And obviously, with
the move into--

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:55.290
the move of Google Places into
Google+ Local, that does raise

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:58.100
some interesting possibilities
for directions we can take the

00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:00.570
Places API in the future to
also to be more social.

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:01.850
And that's something that
we're looking into.

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:08.020
AUDIENCE: Where do you
get your street map

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:09.590
and cadastral data?

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:12.085
Do you get that from local
agencies, or do you develop

00:40:12.085 --> 00:40:14.006
that yourself?

00:40:14.006 --> 00:40:15.580
PETER BIRCH: I'm sorry,
street map?

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:17.550
AUDIENCE: Street map and
cadastral data, property

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:18.800
information?

00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:28.390
THOR MITCHELL: We source
them from a

00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:29.540
wide variety of sources.

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:33.420
And actually, several of our
sources have asked not to be

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:36.780
identified so they don't get
inundated with lots of

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:37.320
information.

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:42.520
But we have then moved and
shifted to our Ground Truth

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:47.580
project, which Brian McClendon
mentioned, which we are then

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:49.920
continually propagating
our own data.

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:54.870
So a lot of it is looking at
satellite imagery and finding

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:56.230
street maps from there.

00:40:56.230 --> 00:41:02.430
And plus, we add in additional
edits from Map Maker.

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:04.615
Now, there are some countries
where we haven't launched Map

00:41:04.615 --> 00:41:06.950
Maker or the Ground
Truth project yet.

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:10.510
And so we're still sourcing
from a variety of licensed

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:12.980
data from other sources.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:17.110
But we just this month announced
10 new countries

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:20.070
that we moved to Map Maker.

00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:24.300
So we are very interested in
getting data from the user

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:27.460
community, who is most
interested in making sure that

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:30.150
the maps are up to date.

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:32.820
AUDIENCE: The reason I asked had
to do with how up to date

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:33.400
the maps were.

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:37.760
Because if the cities or
counties and things like that

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:40.070
are providing the data to
you, then I guess they--

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:42.540
MANO MARKS: Yeah, I mean, it's
basically a very large

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:48.250
operation to constantly be
sourcing new data and also to

00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:51.430
be constantly looking at
satellite imagery and making

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:54.790
sure it's up to date and
incorporating user edits.

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:57.230
PETER BIRCH: And just to add to
that, if you look at Google

00:41:57.230 --> 00:42:02.030
Maps 2005, we were very
dependent on licensed data.

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:04.680
And that created a lot of
limitations for us in terms of

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:07.260
quality, in terms of the ability
to update it quickly,

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:10.030
in terms of getting coverage
in other countries.

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:12.290
And so both the Map Maker
project that we've talked

00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:15.750
about as well as this Ground
Truth, or GT, project that

00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:20.140
Brian mentioned are hugely
ambitious efforts that we've

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:24.360
launched to really just up the
quality of our maps and the

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:27.910
coverage of our maps by taking
it on ourselves.

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:32.380
It's something that has been
a major focus of our teams.

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:33.910
And I don't know if you actually
got a chance to see

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:36.630
his talk at all, and he talked a
little bit about the process

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:39.260
by which we go through and
actually get the data.

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:42.650
We're combining it with publicly
available sources,

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:45.040
including using our own Street
View data where we can

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:48.070
actually go in and look at
the streets and use image

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:51.220
recognition to look at street
signs and all these things.

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:56.160
There's a lot of science and
engineering in there to be

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:59.220
able to create the
coverage and the

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:02.100
quality of that map data.

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:04.150
MANO MARKS: And I'm particularly
proud of the Map

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:09.710
Maker project because there was
a huge percentage of the

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:10.160
population--

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.800
I think it was actually over
half the population of the

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:16.700
Earth lived in places where
there wasn't decent digital

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:17.590
coverage at all.

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:20.680
I mean, you could actually go
to some countries and see a

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:24.740
few major roads in like
Hyderabad in 2008 and that

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:25.500
would be it.

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:30.870
And we've now richly mapped
areas that had never really

00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:34.230
had that level of mapping,
at least in a

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:36.180
digital form before.

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:41.350
So I'm really proud of that
particular piece of it.

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:43.760
AUDIENCE: It's an absolutely
astounding project.

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.410
I can't believe you guys
are doing this.

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:47.670
The second question that I had
had to do with metadata

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:50.170
associated with the shapefiles
and things like that.

00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:51.770
I noticed that there were
keywords that you could

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:52.840
associate with it.

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:56.750
But we have a great deal more
metadata that are associated

00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:59.720
with each of the sets of data
having to do with who

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.240
collected it, under what
standards it was collected,

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:02.950
and things like that.

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:04.760
Is there the opportunity
to upload that

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:05.965
information as well?

00:44:05.965 --> 00:44:07.450
MANO MARKS: Are you talking
about in Maps Engine?

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:09.060
PETER BIRCH: We're going to
bring Dylan up to talk about

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:12.160
metadata for shapefiles,
I believe.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.020
DYLAN LORIMER: Yeah.

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.720
Are you talking about in
Google Maps Engine?

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:17.400
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:19.920
DYLAN LORIMER: Hey, my name is
Dylan Lorimer, and I'm also

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:21.200
the product manager for
Maps Engine, so

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.065
this is a great question.

00:44:22.065 --> 00:44:24.650
So the question's on metadata.

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:28.090
And this is actually a really
interesting topic, and I'm

00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:29.250
actually interested in
your feedback here.

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:34.370
So today when you upload
shapefiles or CSVs or KMLs, we

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:36.690
do our best to preserve
the metadata.

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:40.940
We let you also apply your own
so you can tag the data with

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:42.710
arbitrary keywords.

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:46.040
And we have some customers that
use that mechanism to

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:48.650
define their own kind
of taxonomy,

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:49.830
essentially, for the data.

00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:52.680
What we don't do a great job
of, though, is taking your

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:54.350
metadata and kind of
trying to map it to

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:55.970
well-known specs or standards.

00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:57.080
I know there are
some out there.

00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:00.360
The FGDC and INSPIRE in Europe
have put a lot of

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:01.390
thought into this.

00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:03.880
We're really keen to figure out
what the right story is

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:06.070
there, and we really
want your feedback.

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:08.290
So my point is that we
preserve your data.

00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:10.740
We let you apply your own tags,
and we index that and

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:11.610
make it searchable.

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:15.170
We don't yet have a great story
on schema mapping and

00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:17.380
how to expose that in
more useful ways.

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:20.580
AUDIENCE: So we would put our
metadata in there as sort of

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:23.080
keyword phrases that we
ourselves would understand

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:24.550
what the meaning were
as opposed to

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:26.530
some sort of standard?

00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:27.340
DYLAN LORIMER: Today.

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:28.995
That's how you do it today,
but we do preserve it.

00:45:28.995 --> 00:45:32.140
If you were to upload sidecar
files or associated files that

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:36.610
have an FGDC-style schema, we'll
preserve that today.

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:39.850
We just don't yet parse it and
make use of it in a good way.

00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:41.090
We're really keen to do so.

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:44.260
It's come up with numerous of
our government customers

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:48.650
specifically, who want to be--

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:50.660
to leverage standards and have
better interoperability, so

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:52.310
we're keen to help
you out there.

00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:54.110
AUDIENCE: The government of
British Columbia is working on

00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:56.780
a project to try to create a
single database for all of the

00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:58.090
mapping data that's collected.

00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:01.120
And all of this mapping data is
so fragmented, it's what I

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.110
call weak data.

00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:04.175
And once it's brought
together, it

00:46:04.175 --> 00:46:05.380
will be very powerful.

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:07.650
However, one of the concerns
that people have is the

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:08.710
quality of the data.

00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:11.130
And it's not like there's good
quality or bad quality.

00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:14.380
There are varying levels of
veracity that you assign to

00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:15.210
any given data set.

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:17.590
And so having standards to
understand it and another

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:19.060
metadata would be really
important to

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:20.970
make this data powerful.

00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:22.600
DYLAN LORIMER: How would you
want to expose that through

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:23.550
APIs as well?

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:26.840
I'm curious if there's a way you
want to expose attributes

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.830
for third parties or developers
to query.

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:31.500
AUDIENCE: Well, the biggest
problem is what you mentioned

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:34.770
before, which is having a
standard set of keywords that

00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:37.040
define specifically what
the attributes mean.

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:42.820
So adopting a standard, which
if they are out there, would

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:43.820
be the most important.

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:46.180
And then in terms of the API,
just something like a keyword

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:48.470
value pair would probably be--

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:51.990
or XML would probably be a
good way to structure it.

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:53.330
But it's the standards
that are, I

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:54.500
think, really important.

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:56.260
DYLAN LORIMER: And then when you
query the metadata, do you

00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:58.540
want to be able to do like
inequalities on it or just

00:46:58.540 --> 00:46:59.270
keyword lookup?

00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:03.630
Like do you want to say like
greater than, less than type

00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:04.600
of operations?

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:05.160
AUDIENCE: Oh, yes.

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:06.900
Oh, yeah, we'd need a full
query capability.

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:08.270
DYLAN LORIMER: OK, thanks.

00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:09.520
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:14.718 --> 00:47:16.025
PETER BIRCH: All right,
who's next?

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:21.910
AUDIENCE: Last question,
I think.

00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:23.370
Static maps.

00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:25.270
When a static map is delivered,
you get a drawn

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.950
route on it.

00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:29.130
It's really frustrating to try
to find that map, that point.

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:31.770
We've had to do some kind of
hairy math, which you are much

00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:33.970
better at doing than us.

00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:36.380
It would be really cool to
encode that route data on the

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:39.700
PNG or something similar to that
so that the route on the

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:42.150
static map is delivered back.

00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:43.200
Any thoughts on that?

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:46.840
THOR MITCHELL: So you're saying
how do you get the

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:49.870
textual instructions that
go with an image?

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:52.050
AUDIENCE: So we get an image
that's a static map with a

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:53.560
route on it.

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:58.740
Knowing where that route is on
the image in a per-pixel, like

00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:03.420
where is the red line type of
thing, it doesn't come back

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:03.950
with the data.

00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:08.030
So we need to calculate that and
it's somewhat inaccurate

00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:08.910
on our side.

00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:13.030
THOR MITCHELL: So there's two
parts of this, actually.

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:17.220
One is the service that provides
the polylines that

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:19.730
are drawn on a static map is the
same service that drives

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:23.310
the directions API, and the
directions API does return a

00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:26.710
polyline as a vector for you.

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:28.720
I realize that, however, if
you're looking to pick out the

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:31.140
individual pixels, that might
not be what you need.

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:33.640
But it does give you
the sequence of

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.850
vertices on that polyline.

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:38.450
What I have seen someone do,
which I thought was pretty

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:42.750
creative, was request
two static maps.

00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:45.660
One is a normal static map which
has the map on and has

00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:46.710
the polyline on.

00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:49.360
The other is a static map where
they've used star maps

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:52.260
to turn the entire map white
and then specify that the

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:54.350
polyline be rendered in black.

00:48:54.350 --> 00:48:56.820
So what you end up with is a
bitmap that tells you where

00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:58.970
the polyline is on
the static map.

00:48:58.970 --> 00:49:01.150
AUDIENCE: Very cool, but if
it's a very intricate map,

00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:04.720
it's hard to get turns
and distances.

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:04.970
THOR MITCHELL: Right.

00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:07.740
In which case, you need the
directions web service because

00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:09.145
the directions web service will
give you the polyline,

00:49:09.145 --> 00:49:13.810
but it will also give you the
time and distance along each

00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:16.420
step and textual directions.

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:18.440
And obviously, you can take that
polyline, and you can use

00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:22.240
the geometry library that we
have to calculate other things

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.710
about that that you might
need as well.

00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:26.950
AUDIENCE: But the static image
that comes back, the bounding

00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:28.740
of it is different.

00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:33.390
And so knowing where 0, 0 is
and where the line starts--

00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:35.140
SUSANNAH RAUB: It sounds to me
like you're going to need to

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:38.010
use a combination of tools for
what you're trying to do.

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:39.870
And without knowing exactly the

00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:42.110
problem that you're trying--

00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:44.650
what your actual goal is, it's
hard for us to necessarily

00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:45.780
engineer that solution here.

00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:46.860
AUDIENCE: Is there a way
that it can code

00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:48.490
that data in the PNG?

00:49:48.490 --> 00:49:51.000
MANO MARKS: It seems like this
might be a good question on

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.010
Stack Overflow, and then we
can sort of dive into it a

00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:55.270
little bit more deeply.

00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:58.980
Or one of us in the Sandbox
could talk to you about it

00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:01.130
more deeply offline.

00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:01.510
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:02.760
All right, thank you.

00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:12.310
AUDIENCE: So some of the new
stylistic tools that you

00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:16.290
introduced in the Maps API, like
the dashed polylines and

00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:19.000
the symbols and some of that,
is there any plans to port

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.570
that to the Earth API and
then furthermore into

00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:22.820
the KML spec itself?

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:29.450
You haven't had a
question yet.

00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:30.440
SEAN ASKAY: I'm so sorry,
could you repeat that?

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.900
I'm not sure if I quite caught
the first half of it.

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:35.000
AUDIENCE: So some of the new
stuff that you introduced in

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.660
the Maps API, like
stylistically, like the dashed

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:41.070
polylines and the symbols and
arrowheads, is there any plans

00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:45.690
on introducing that into KML and
also into the Earth API?

00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:47.110
SEAN ASKAY: Yeah, so we're
definitely interested in

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:49.800
adding richer styling
features to KML.

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.690
We're currently working with the
Open Geospatial Consortium

00:50:52.690 --> 00:50:54.660
to revision KML.

00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:57.560
And there have been a lot of
proposals from other groups to

00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:00.200
the standard to do just that, to
add dotted lines, different

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:02.560
types of highlighting
and stuff.

00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:03.620
We don't have anything
to announce yet.

00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:03.980
AUDIENCE: Of course.

00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:06.420
SEAN ASKAY: But it's definitely
something that both

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:08.670
Google and people outside of
Google interested in the KML

00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:11.630
standard are very keen on
working on, and it's a

00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:13.040
personal interest of mine.

00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:16.680
So nothing right now, but
we're thinking about it.

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:19.380
AUDIENCE: OK, second question.

00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:22.320
A lot of our end users complain
specifically in Earth

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:25.870
about the way disambiguation is
handled, like i.e. you have

00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:30.470
10 ships in a port, and it's
very hard to see stacked up

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:31.660
what's actually there.

00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:34.390
I was wondering if that's
something that's been

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:35.220
commented on.

00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:37.690
Any plans to address
it, et cetera?

00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:38.960
PETER BIRCH: So are you thinking
about the desktop

00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:40.650
client or the API?

00:51:40.650 --> 00:51:42.930
AUDIENCE: Desktop client more
specifically, but if it was

00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:45.620
something that was going to
be improved in the API.

00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:47.260
PETER BIRCH: Yeah, I
mean, so this is a

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:48.270
hard problem to solve.

00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:50.780
AUDIENCE: Agreed.

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:53.330
PETER BIRCH: And I think there's
more flexibility in

00:51:53.330 --> 00:51:56.145
the API in terms of returning
a list that might--

00:51:56.145 --> 00:51:57.760
if you have a hit,
and you could get

00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:00.540
back a list of objects.

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:05.060
In the desktop client, one of
the challenges we have is that

00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:06.810
the user is the one driving
the experience.

00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:09.370
And they could have any number
of different layers on that

00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:11.410
could have no correlation
with each other, right?

00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:13.220
So you might have the
photo later on.

00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:15.770
You might have a couple of other
layers from the gallery,

00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:17.600
and then you might have
your own content.

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:22.210
And if you click on a point, we
need to let the user-- we

00:52:22.210 --> 00:52:24.840
need the user to give us more
information about which one

00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:25.720
they're looking at.

00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:30.900
We have the-- we call it the
turkey tail disambiguation

00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:32.670
right now, which is not--

00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:33.640
MANO MARKS: I call
it the star.

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:35.120
PETER BIRCH: The star, sorry.

00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:36.590
AUDIENCE: Starfish is
what we call it.

00:52:36.590 --> 00:52:40.970
PETER BIRCH: Which has
some challenges.

00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:46.490
And I think we'd love to hear
some more ideas about what

00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:50.780
would work better for you in
terms of ways to make it

00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:52.500
easier for users to kind of--

00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:54.440
because we still do need the
information from the user,

00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:57.330
which is which of the various
things that you've just

00:52:57.330 --> 00:52:59.270
intersected with is the
one that you're

00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:00.060
most interested in.

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:02.190
And we don't want to get in the
mode where we just show

00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:05.800
the top one because that is
going to hide some data.

00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:06.070
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:07.280
Maybe--

00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:08.230
MANO MARKS: I think there's
a lot that you

00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:09.840
can do server side.

00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:14.070
You could do originated KML
network link hierarchy that

00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:17.880
would, at a higher level
aggregate into a single

00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:22.520
placemark with a list within the
description balloon of all

00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:25.950
those ships in port
or whatever.

00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:29.720
And as you get in closer,
it spreads it out.

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:33.300
Something along the similar
lines but for the Maps API is

00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:36.300
our MarkerClusterer utility
library, which I don't know if

00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:37.400
you're taken a look at.

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:40.140
And that might actually give
you some ideas in terms of

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:43.910
algorithms that you could
employ for clustering.

00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:44.910
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:46.530
Definitely.

00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:48.442
Cool, thank you.

00:53:48.442 --> 00:53:50.110
THOR MITCHELL: So I
think we have time

00:53:50.110 --> 00:53:52.190
for one more question.

00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:55.490
Maybe you want to grab it
while it's on the table.

00:53:58.040 --> 00:53:59.850
AUDIENCE: Yesterday they talked
about the new canvas

00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:01.630
overlay layer, but I didn't
see it in the doc set.

00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:04.360
Is that coming soon, or did I
just miss it and didn't look

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:06.240
in the right place?

00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:11.100
MANO MARKS: Brendon Kenny is
about to release that into the

00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:11.980
utility library.

00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:14.690
I don't know that it's actually
gone out yet but--

00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:16.240
AUDIENCE: Oh, it's in
the utility library,

00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:17.540
not the Maps API.

00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:20.510
MANO MARKS: It's an open source
project, and I believe

00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:22.700
he said it will be part of the
utility library, so yeah.

00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:23.040
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:24.330
I was just looking in
the wrong place.

00:54:24.330 --> 00:54:24.810
Thank you.

00:54:24.810 --> 00:54:26.780
MANO MARKS: No problem.

00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:28.020
MANO MARKS: I think we actually
have time for one

00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:29.660
more quick question.

00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:34.620
PETER BIRCH: I have
a question.

00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:37.540
Thor, you talked about a lot of
great API stuff yesterday.

00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:40.460
What's the new API that you're
most excited about?

00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:46.570
Choose one of your children

00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:48.460
THOR MITCHELL: Susannah's in
my ear going, Transit,

00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:49.710
Transit, say Transit.

00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:56.060
I'm surprised.

00:54:56.060 --> 00:55:01.050
So I'm going to hedge my bets
and say there are two things.

00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:05.010
So one service that you may not
have heard of unless you

00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:08.670
attended one our sessions, I
think it was earlier today,

00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:13.480
was we announced we are working
on a new API for asset

00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:18.140
tracking, tailored to asset
tracking companies, which

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:20.850
essentially allows you to--

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:25.420
we already have a large number
of customers who use the Maps

00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:27.580
API in conjunction with their
asset tracking business.

00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:30.460
And right now, we don't have
any tools particularly

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:31.730
tailored to them.

00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:33.670
And asset tracking has some
interesting challenges of its

00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:37.150
own because what you tend to
find is that the amount of

00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:40.000
data that's generated on a
day-to-day basis can be quite

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.390
significant.

00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:45.600
And so we are building custom
infrastructure to support

00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:49.260
collecting very, very, very
high volumes of vehicle

00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:52.210
locations over time and then
make it easy for you to store,

00:55:52.210 --> 00:55:54.710
serve, render, analyze.

00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:57.240
There's also some very
interesting things we can do

00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:59.660
because we have access to the
underlying map data to improve

00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:01.720
the quality of that data
and provide interesting

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:03.380
added-value services on top.

00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:05.020
So that's a very exciting
project, which I think you'll

00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:08.250
see evolve over the course of
the next six to nine months.

00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:15.560
The feature that we launched
at this event that most

00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:18.470
excites me that's available
right now is the symbols work

00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:19.800
that was just mentioned.

00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:22.750
If you haven't seen that, we
posted to the blog on that

00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:25.320
yesterday with some examples.

00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:26.860
The interesting thing about
symbols-- and this is the

00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:30.020
feedback that I've had
repeatedly all day, including

00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:32.440
from a senior VP as Google--

00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:35.300
is that you don't appreciate the
potential and the value of

00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:37.180
this feature until you see it.

00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:39.940
It seems like such
a simple idea.

00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:43.410
But when you see what you can
do, it's extraordinary.

00:56:43.410 --> 00:56:45.750
So I would encourage you to
take a look at the geo

00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:47.450
developer blog, and have a look
at the demos on there,

00:56:47.450 --> 00:56:49.360
and start thinking about ways
you can use that because we

00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:53.340
think it will inspire an
amazing wave of new

00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:54.930
interesting Maps API
applications and

00:56:54.930 --> 00:56:56.010
visualizations.

00:56:56.010 --> 00:56:58.230
There was a blog post yesterday
which said something

00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:59.480
like, I think this feature will

00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:01.430
revolutionize online mapping.

00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:02.580
And we went, oh, that's
very nice.

00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:05.280
Thank you.

00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:07.810
OK, and with that, the red light
is telling me that we

00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:08.400
are out of time.

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:09.610
So thank you all for
coming along.

00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:16.168
[APPLAUSE]
