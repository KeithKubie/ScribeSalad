00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.883
Believe it or not, you're already a quarter of the way through the course.

00:00:03.883 --> 00:00:07.522
Excellent work. In the last unit, we learned about linear equations and

00:00:07.522 --> 00:00:11.778
inequalities. We looked at how they can be represented using tables, graphs, and

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:15.959
equations. In this unit, we'll continue that approach. We'll look at not just

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.953
one line, but two. Two lines or two linear equations are considered to be a

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:24.381
systems of equations. Let's try to make meaning of these systems of equations by

00:00:24.381 --> 00:00:28.387
renting a car. You're going to rent a car from a car company called Car-nival.

00:00:28.387 --> 00:00:32.296
You have $45 to spend on the car rental and Car-nival is going to charge $5 for

00:00:32.296 --> 00:00:36.127
a registration fee and $10 per hour for renting the car. So we're going to

00:00:36.127 --> 00:00:40.389
figure out what's the longest time you can rent the car. You might already be

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:44.578
able to solve this problem in your head, but we're going to try a different

00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:46.910
approach. We're going to use systems.
