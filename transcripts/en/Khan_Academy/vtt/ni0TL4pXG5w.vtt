00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.970
In the last video,
we finished up

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.580
asking ourselves, how
much do we produce

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:11.330
if the market price is at $0.45?

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.330
And just going with the
logic that we introduced

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.840
in the last video, you want
to produce as much as possible

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.690
to spread out the fixed cost.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.340
But you don't want to produce so
much that the marginal cost is

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.380
higher than your
marginal revenue.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.540
And your marginal revenue
is your market price.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.510
Every unit, every
incremental unit,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.390
you're going to get $0.45.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.780
So you want to look
at the quantity

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.000
where your marginal
revenue, the $0.45,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.695
is equal to your marginal cost.

00:00:36.695 --> 00:00:38.070
So we could look
at it over here.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.770
So if we look at our
marginal revenue,

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.110
let's say $0.45 is
right over there.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.470
You want to look where the $0.45
is equal to your marginal cost.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.017
And it looks like it
is right over there.

00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:51.600
Now we could even
see it on our table.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.030
When does our marginal
cost equal $0.45?

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:02.930
It equals that when we produce
8,000 gallons of our juice.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.010
Now the reason why this
is somewhat interesting

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.140
is at that point the
amount of revenue

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.490
that we're getting per
unit, our marginal revenue,

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.060
is less than our
total cost per unit.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.310
We're selling each
unit at $0.45,

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.490
but our total cost for
each of those units

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.610
is $0.48 on average.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.570
So this right over
here is our total cost.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.845
So you might say, look, I'm
making a loss on every unit.

00:01:27.845 --> 00:01:29.470
The total amount of
revenue I'm getting

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.540
is a smaller
rectangle over here.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.310
It's the quantity times the
marginal revenue per unit.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.100
So this is the amount of
revenue that I'm getting.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.300
Let me color it in carefully.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.540
That is the amount of
revenue that I'm getting.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.920
While my costs are
this larger rectangle.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.950
My quantity times my
average total cost per unit.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.970
And so what I end
up with is if you

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.780
take that revenue and you
subtract out that quantity,

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.490
you end up with a loss
of exactly this much.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.200
You are operating, in
this situation, at a loss.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.820
You're operating at a loss when
you are producing 8,000 units

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.650
and you're getting
$0.45 per unit.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.750
So does it make sense
for you to do this?

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.540
And we can even
figure out the loss.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.740
You are producing 8,000 units.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.080
You're selling them
for $0.45 a unit.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.900
And it costs you $0.48 per unit
to produce them on average when

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.830
you put all the costs
in, $0.48 cents per unit.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:37.587
So you are losing $0.03
per unit, I guess gallon.

00:02:37.587 --> 00:02:39.170
We're talking about
orange juice here.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.970
And it's times
8,000 gallons, means

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.770
that we are losing
we are losing $240.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.940
8,000 times $0.06
is 24,000 cents,

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.780
which is the same thing as $240.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.452
So does it make sense
for us to do this?

00:02:56.452 --> 00:02:58.910
Well, one way to think about
it, let's say we didn't do it.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.480
Let's say we're
like, hey, I'm not

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.770
going to produce any gallons.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.740
Well then what's
going to be our loss?

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.870
Well, we're assuming that
this is our fixed cost.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.750
We've already
committed ourselves

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.530
to this expenditure
right over here.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.440
Whether we produce no
drops of orange juice,

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.510
we are still going to be
spending $1,000/ So if we

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.610
produce nothing, we are
guaranteeing ourselves a weekly

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.880
loss of $1,000.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.170
And so this is at
least better than that.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.340
So by starting to
produce some units,

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.830
we are at least able to
offset some of that loss.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.690
And we're spreading
out that fixed costs

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.754
over more and more
and more gallons.

00:03:33.754 --> 00:03:35.420
And you might say,
hey, well why don't I

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.140
just keep producing
more and more units?

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.600
Why don't I go here and maybe
I produce 9,000 units where

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.980
the marginal cost
all of a sudden

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.200
is higher than our
marginal revenue?

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.720
And the reason why that
won't make any sense to do

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.390
is because if you produce
that many units, then

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.910
all of a sudden each of
those incremental units

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.530
that you're producing
beyond the 8,000,

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.150
you're losing money on those.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.060
That 8,000 in first
unit, the marginal cost

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.120
is going to be higher
than the marginal revenue

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.680
that you're bringing
in on that unit.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.210
So you're going to
be losing money.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.320
You're going to start having
a lower profit than even

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.670
the negative $240 loss.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.640
It'll start going at a negative
240 something, negative 250,

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.209
and so forth and so one.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.800
So you still don't want to
produce beyond that point.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.800
And we'll touch more deeply
on it in future videos,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.180
but this is essentially
what differentiates

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.050
the short-term supply curve
from the long-run supply curve.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.570
In the short-term,
we're going to assume

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:32.970
that we have these fixed costs.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.470
And so it's just
going to make sense

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.020
to produce equivalent
to our marginal cost.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.860
But over the long-run, maybe
our fixed items, our capital,

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.130
our machinery wears off or maybe
the contract for my employees

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.230
wear off, and then we
have a different cost

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.060
structure over the long-term.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.040
But we'll think about
that in another video.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.330
But the simple answer
is, assuming these really

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.660
are your fixed
costs, you still want

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.130
to produce as many
units as possible

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.850
so that your marginal cost is
equal to your marginal revenue,

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.510
which in this case
is the market price.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.400
We are price takers.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.970
So it actually is a rational
thing to produce 8,000 units

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.550
and take a loss on that and
take a $240 per week loss

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.250
as opposed to just
producing nothing and taking

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.420
$1,000 per week loss.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.730
Now it might not be rational
once these things have

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.570
been worn out-- your robots
and the employees' contracts.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.840
It might not be rational to
continue them past their term.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.770
And we'll think about that
more because obviously, we

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.140
are running at a loss.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.437
This is not necessarily
a good business to be in,

00:05:40.437 --> 00:05:42.270
but now that we've
gotten into the business,

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.900
we might as well
stay in it in order

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.750
to recoup some of our costs here
or at least spread them out,

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.720
or at least not have
$1,000 per week loss.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.160
Anyway, see you
in the next video.
