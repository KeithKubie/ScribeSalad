00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.540
NARRATOR: Today, Irish Americans
are just considered, Americans.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.120
But when they first came
to the country as refugees

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.460
they were seen as an
infestation, a plague.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.040
Here's why Americans hated
but now love the Irish.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.460
It all started with
potatoes, or a lack thereof.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.880
By the mid 1840s, the
average adult in Ireland

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.750
ate over 10 pounds
of potatoes per day.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.210
They didn't have
much of a choice.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.330
After centuries of
oppressive British rule,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.880
most Irish lived in poverty.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.250
Potatoes were easy to grow,
packed with nutrition,

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.750
and, most importantly, cheap.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.250
But in 1845, a fungus, phyto--

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.500
a fungus began to eat
its way through Ireland's

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.880
precious crops.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.500
The potato plants
started to shrivel,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.670
and Ireland's British
overlords didn't seem to care.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.750
The great hunger
lasted until 1852.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.750
By the time the famine ended,
some 1 million Irish had died

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.710
from starvation and disease.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.040
By 1855, nearly 2 million
had fled, the majority

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.710
of them to the United States.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.920
The Irish encountered
much resistance in the US

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.210
for several reasons,
including religion.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.120
Most of the Irish immigrants
in the US were Roman Catholic,

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.460
and there had long been bad
blood between Protestants

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.120
and Catholics.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.540
Some Protestants believed this
exodus of Irish immigrants

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.920
was a papal army seeking to
overthrow the US government

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.210
and establish a new
Vatican in Cincinnati.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.620
Others just worried
that these newcomers

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.290
would take their jobs.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.920
As with every wave
of new immigrants,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.080
most of the Irish who came
to the US during this time

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.460
ended up taking dangerous,
low-paying work.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.710
Irish Catholics also brought
their love of the drink.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.960
Irish-owned pubs popped
up across the country,

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.120
giving the new immigrants
a foothold in the economy

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.330
but also leading to an ugly
stereotype, the Irish as

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.460
job-stealing, junk cretins.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.460
Discrimination was rampant.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.670
Entire political parties
sprung up to fight

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.170
this perceived Irish menace.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.960
Members of the
so-called American Party

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.170
referred to themselves
as Know Nothings

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.790
because when questioned
about their membership

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.120
they claimed to know nothing.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.580
But they had a very active
agenda and vowed to only

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.120
elect native-born Americans--

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.000
no, not them, just the
non-Catholic whites.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.580
They also started violent riots
and picked street fights in

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.330
Irish-Catholic neighborhoods.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.120
But after years
of discrimination,

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.670
the Irish fought back,
not in the streets

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.500
but at the ballot box.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.830
Their sheer numbers
gave them strength.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.620
They voted Irish Catholics into
powerful political positions

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.670
across major East Coast cities.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.830
At the same time,
non-Irish Americans

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.790
also started to come around
to the whole Irish pub thing.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.880
And as the Irish moved
up the social ladder,

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.670
nativists, like
the Know Nothings,

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.210
shifted their prejudices to
the next wave of immigrants

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.380
from China and Eastern Europe.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.210
The Irish became
Irish Americans,

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.120
and non-Irish Americans
started to act

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.880
more Irish, or at least how
they thought the Irish acted.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.960
Today, Irish traditions,
including music, dance,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.960
and drink, have been woven into
the fabric of American society.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.120
So the next time you fly an
Irish flag on St. Paddy's Day,

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.540
remember what Americans
once hated and feared

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.290
is now a staple of our culture.
