00:00:13.758 --> 00:00:16.040
I am going to start with a challenge.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.830
I want you to imagine each of these two scenes

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.878
in as much detail as you can.

00:00:21.878 --> 00:00:23.260
Scene number one:

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.925
"They gave us a hearty welcome."

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:29.344
Well, who are the people who are giving a hearty welcome?

00:00:29.344 --> 00:00:30.838
What are they wearing?

00:00:30.838 --> 00:00:33.005
What are they drinking?

00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:34.753
OK, scene two:

00:00:34.753 --> 00:00:37.484
"They gave us a cordial reception."

00:00:37.484 --> 00:00:39.722
How are these people standing?

00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:41.978
What expressions are on their faces?

00:00:41.978 --> 00:00:44.752
What are they wearing and drinking?

00:00:44.752 --> 00:00:47.110
Fix these pictures in your mind's eye

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.130
and then jot down a sentence or two to describe them.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.049
We'll come back to them later.

00:00:52.696 --> 00:00:54.692
Now on to our story.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.668
In the year 400 C.E.

00:00:57.668 --> 00:01:00.524
the Celts in Britain were ruled by Romans.

00:01:00.524 --> 00:01:02.992
This had one benefit for the Celts:

00:01:02.992 --> 00:01:06.778
the Romans protected them from the barbarian Saxon tribes

00:01:06.778 --> 00:01:08.381
of Northern Europe.

00:01:08.381 --> 00:01:10.681
But then the Roman Empire began to crumble,

00:01:10.681 --> 00:01:13.372
and the Romans withdrew from Britain.

00:01:13.696 --> 00:01:15.918
With the Romans gone, the Germanic tribes,

00:01:15.918 --> 00:01:19.218
the Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and Frisians

00:01:19.218 --> 00:01:21.433
quickly sailed across the water,

00:01:21.433 --> 00:01:22.752
did away with the Celts,

00:01:22.752 --> 00:01:25.476
and formed kingdoms in the British Isles.

00:01:25.476 --> 00:01:28.293
For several centuries, these tribes lived in Britain,

00:01:28.293 --> 00:01:31.407
and their Germanic language, Anglo Saxon,

00:01:31.407 --> 00:01:35.791
became the common language, what we call Old English.

00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:40.942
Although modern English speakers may think Old English sounds like a different language,

00:01:40.942 --> 00:01:46.662
if you look and listen closely, you'll find many words that are recognizable.

00:01:46.662 --> 00:01:51.018
For example, here is what the Lord's Prayer looks like in Old English.

00:01:51.018 --> 00:01:53.506
At first glance, it may look unfamiliar,

00:01:53.506 --> 00:01:55.092
but update the spelling a bit,

00:01:55.092 --> 00:01:58.873
and you'll see many common English words.

00:01:58.873 --> 00:02:03.516
So the centuries passed with Britains happily speaking Old English,

00:02:03.516 --> 00:02:06.785
but in the 700's, a series of Viking invasions began,

00:02:06.785 --> 00:02:11.186
which continued until a treaty split the island in half.

00:02:11.186 --> 00:02:13.281
On one side were the Saxons.

00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:15.413
On the other side were the Danes

00:02:15.413 --> 00:02:18.520
who spoke a language called Old Norse.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.379
As Saxons fell in love with their cute Danish neighbors

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.571
and marriages blurred the boundaries,

00:02:23.571 --> 00:02:26.250
Old Norse mixed with Old English,

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.258
and many Old Norse words like

00:02:28.258 --> 00:02:29.127
freckle,

00:02:29.127 --> 00:02:29.589
leg,

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:30.116
root,

00:02:30.116 --> 00:02:30.767
skin,

00:02:30.767 --> 00:02:32.051
and want

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:34.575
are still a part of our language.

00:02:34.575 --> 00:02:37.360
300 years later, in 1066,

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.377
the Norman conquest brought war again to the British Isles.

00:02:41.377 --> 00:02:43.961
The Normans were Vikings who settled in France.

00:02:43.961 --> 00:02:46.807
They had abandoned the Viking language and culture

00:02:46.807 --> 00:02:48.963
in favor of a French lifestyle,

00:02:48.963 --> 00:02:51.090
but they still fought like Vikings.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.602
They placed a Norman king on the English throne

00:02:53.602 --> 00:02:58.271
and for three centuries, French was the language of the British royalty.

00:02:58.271 --> 00:03:01.128
Society in Britain came to have two levels:

00:03:01.128 --> 00:03:03.341
French-speaking aristocracy

00:03:03.341 --> 00:03:05.744
and Old English-speaking peasants.

00:03:05.744 --> 00:03:09.080
The French also brought many Roman Catholic clergymen with them

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.320
who added Latin words to the mix.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.234
Old English adapted and grew

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:15.788
as thousands of words flowed in,

00:03:15.788 --> 00:03:19.240
many having to do with government, law, and aristocracy.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.227
Words like council,

00:03:20.227 --> 00:03:20.823
marriage,

00:03:20.823 --> 00:03:21.708
sovereign,

00:03:21.708 --> 00:03:22.633
govern,

00:03:22.633 --> 00:03:23.367
damage,

00:03:23.367 --> 00:03:24.995
and parliament.

00:03:25.117 --> 00:03:26.447
As the language expanded,

00:03:26.447 --> 00:03:28.433
English speakers quickly realized what to do

00:03:28.433 --> 00:03:31.117
if they wanted to sound sophisticated:

00:03:31.117 --> 00:03:34.376
they would use words that had come from French or Latin.

00:03:34.376 --> 00:03:36.609
Anglo Saxon words seemed so plain

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.493
like the Anglo Saxon peasants who spoke them.

00:03:39.832 --> 00:03:43.236
Let's go back to the two sentences you thought about earlier.

00:03:43.236 --> 00:03:45.260
When you pictured the hearty welcome,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.747
did you see an earthy scene with relatives hugging and talking loudly?

00:03:49.747 --> 00:03:51.212
Were they drinking beer?

00:03:51.212 --> 00:03:54.157
Were they wearing lumberjack shirts and jeans?

00:03:54.157 --> 00:03:56.762
And what about the cordial reception?

00:03:56.762 --> 00:04:00.307
I bet you pictured a far more classy and refined crowd.

00:04:00.307 --> 00:04:01.623
Blazers and skirts,

00:04:01.623 --> 00:04:03.026
wine and caviar.

00:04:03.594 --> 00:04:04.790
Why is this?

00:04:05.068 --> 00:04:09.261
How is it that phrases that are considered just about synonymous by the dictionary

00:04:09.261 --> 00:04:12.753
can evoke such different pictures and feelings?

00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:15.787
"Hearty" and "welcome" are both Saxon words.

00:04:15.787 --> 00:04:18.912
"Cordial" and "reception" come from French.

00:04:18.912 --> 00:04:22.447
The connotation of nobility and authority has persisted

00:04:22.447 --> 00:04:24.634
around words of French origin.

00:04:24.634 --> 00:04:26.870
And the connotation of peasantry,

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:27.919
real people,

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:28.966
salt of the Earth,

00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:32.091
has persisted around Saxon words.

00:04:32.091 --> 00:04:35.390
Even if you never heard this history before,

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.832
the memory of it persists in the feelings evoked

00:04:38.832 --> 00:04:41.145
by the words you speak.

00:04:41.145 --> 00:04:44.865
On some level, it's a story you already knew

00:04:44.865 --> 00:04:47.261
because whether we realize it consciously

00:04:47.261 --> 00:04:49.213
or only subconsciously,

00:04:49.213 --> 00:04:52.904
our history lives in the words we speak and hear.
