[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.370
SPEAKER: Thank you, everyone,
for coming to Talks at Google.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.250
It is my pleasure to welcome
Beau Kilmer of the RAND

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.330
Corporation.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.030
He's the co-author of
"Marijuana Legalization--

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.790
What Everyone Needs to Know."

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.400
After the talk, we will
have a little Q&amp;A, which

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.060
will not be recorded, so you
can ask some freer questions,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.180
perhaps.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.680
OK.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.360
So, everyone, please give a big,
warm welcome to Beau Kilmer.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.075
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:38.680
BEAU KILMER: All right.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.388
Well, is this on?

00:00:39.388 --> 00:00:40.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.290
BEAU KILMER: Great.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.570
Well, thank you, Scott.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.050
And I want to thank my friend
Jeremy Miles for making

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.542
this whole thing happen.

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:47.500
And I thank all of you
for taking some time out

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.475
of your day to come chat
about marijuana policy.

00:00:50.475 --> 00:00:52.600
As Scott mentioned, I work
at the RAND Corporation.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.330
Our headquarters are
just down Main Street.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.660
We're a nonprofit, nonpartisan
research organization

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.670
that really tries to
focus on improving

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.420
policy and decision-making
through research and analysis.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.090
I started at RAND as
a drug policy intern

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.040
about 20 years ago, and I never
really left the organization.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.260
But it was about six years
ago, I'm leaving Amsterdam.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.630
The guy driving the
car seems to know

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.870
everyone and everything
associated with the Dutch drug

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:20.740
trade.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.860
So I'm just peppering him with
questions about trade routes

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.450
and wholesale prices.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.300
This goes on for
about 2 and 1/2 hours.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.000
We end up pulling in to this
kind of nondescript building,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.340
almost seems like it's
in a neighborhood.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.560
Walk out, get into the building.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.870
And the guy who runs
the place comes up,

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.150
and he starts answering
all my questions,

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.220
starts showing me
some documents,

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.070
and then starts walking
me around the place.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.221
Well, not long enough before
we get to the flowering room.

00:01:48.221 --> 00:01:49.720
And I got to tell
you, I felt like I

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.480
was a kid in a
candy store, but not

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.000
because I was around
a bunch of cannabis.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.920
I felt like I was a
kid in a candy store

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.620
because I was around a
bunch of cannabis data.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.950
You see, I was in the only
place in all the Netherlands

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.085
where it was actually
legal to produce marijuana.

00:02:06.085 --> 00:02:07.960
A lot of people think
it was legalized there,

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.580
but that's not the case.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.080
Yes, if you're 18
or older, you can

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.999
walk into one of the coffee
shops and buy up to five grams

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:15.790
because they have an
official policy of not

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.540
enforcing the law against
small-scale transactions.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.040
So you kind of think about it
being legal in the front door.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.280
However, it's still prohibited
to grow and actually

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.230
sell marijuana to
those coffee shops.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.500
So it's actually illegal
in the back door.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.800
But the facility I
was in was the place

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.619
where they were producing all
of their medical cannabis.

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:36.910
So they would produce it there.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:37.826
They would package it.

00:02:37.826 --> 00:02:38.740
It would get tested.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.660
And then it would actually
be shipped to pharmacies.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.035
Very different from here in
Venice with the dispensaries.

00:02:43.035 --> 00:02:46.490
It actually would go
to real pharmacies.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.660
But when the guy kind
of opened up his books

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.640
and kind of showed
me the costs of what

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.750
it took to run the place,
that's when my jaw dropped.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.450
He had calculated
that the incremental

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.800
or the marginal cost of
producing and testing

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.990
what was arguably some
of the highest quality

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.620
marijuana produced in the world
was on the order of about one

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.570
euro per gram.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.347
Yeah.

00:03:12.347 --> 00:03:13.930
And so that just
confirmed to me that,

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.600
wow, if we actually legalized in
the United States or elsewhere,

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.200
you're gonna see kind of a
big push down on the prices.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.850
And I got to tell
you, this place where

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.670
I was, it wasn't necessarily--
relative to kind of what you

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.160
see here in parts of
California or Colorado

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.500
or Washington-- this
wasn't a big facility.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.420
That flowering room I
was telling you about

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.700
was only about 600 square feet.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.550
So it just made
me realize, again,

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.710
that if you legalize
in the United States,

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.940
you get rid of the risk.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.040
You allow for big,
industrial grows.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.454
You allow competition.

00:03:43.454 --> 00:03:45.370
You're really gonna push
down those production

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.050
and the distribution costs.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.800
Well, you may be
wondering, well, so what?

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.960
Who cares?

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.990
But it turns out that
for a lot of the outcomes

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.260
to actually get discussed in
marijuana legalization debates,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.420
it happens that
price really matters.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.570
Price is going to influence what
happens to the illicit market.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.517
It's going to influence what
happens to tax revenues.

00:04:04.517 --> 00:04:06.850
And it's also going to have
implications for consumption

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.840
and public health.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.320
So it was kind of that
experience combined with some

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.930
of the work that I had done
trying to project what would

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.407
happen with legalization if
it happened in California--

00:04:16.407 --> 00:04:18.490
not only in the state, but
also what it would mean

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.160
for the Mexican drug
trafficking organizations--

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.350
that really influenced
a lot of the insights

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.350
that I provided to both
editions of the book.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.260
So around 2011
and 2012, we spent

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.600
a lot of time kind of
putting this book together.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.440
Get it published in 2012,
and then what happens?

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.600
Legalization.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.800
What happened in November of
2012 was really unprecedented.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.890
There, the voters in
Washington and Colorado,

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.290
they not only voted to
get rid of the prohibition

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.190
on marijuana.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.740
They actually voted to allow
for-profit corporations

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.870
to come in and begin
producing and selling.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.170
Very different from how things
are set up in the Netherlands.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.560
And then at the end
of 2013, Uruguay

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.080
became the first country
in the world to legalize.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.220
November 2014, you had
Alaska, Oregon, District

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.680
of Columbia all legalized.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.920
So by around 2015-2016,
we knew it was actually

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.280
time for an update.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.360
And so we released the
new version here in 2016.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.760
But both books kind of
follow the same format.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.480
It's about 140, 150
frequently asked questions.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.120
We've got questions in
there, what is marijuana?

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.674
When was it prohibited?

00:05:26.674 --> 00:05:28.090
What are the
arguments that people

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.130
are making about why
you should legalize

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.240
personal freedom, criminal
justice issues, tax revenues?

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.280
We've got a whole
chapter focused

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.730
on summarizing the literature
on the health risks associated

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:40.667
with marijuana.

00:05:40.667 --> 00:05:42.250
We've got a whole
other chapter that's

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.370
focused on what's known
about the medical benefits.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.320
And then we also have
a whole chapter focused

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.210
on the non-medical benefits.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.120
But I have to say, that's
a pretty thin chapter,

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.480
since there isn't a lot of
academic research focused

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.720
on the nonmedical
benefits of marijuana.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.600
But with the book, we had
this large focus on health.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.110
But I have to say, one of the
biggest takeaways from what

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.910
we did is that you got to be
skeptical of anyone who claims

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.970
that they know whether or not
marijuana legalization is going

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.330
to be a net positive or a net
negative for public health.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.010
We really don't know.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.770
In fact, even if marijuana
legalization over time--

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.320
if it leads to a large
increase in youth consumption,

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.015
a large increase in dependence,
that doesn't necessarily

00:06:29.015 --> 00:06:31.390
mean it's going to be a net
negative from a public-health

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.290
standpoint.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.780
Because so much is
going to depend on what

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.840
happens to the
consumption of alcohol,

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.730
how legalization
influences the consumption

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.690
of tobacco, prescription
opioids, and other drugs.

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.370
And so a lot of
how this is going

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.177
to play out with
respect to public health

00:06:47.177 --> 00:06:48.760
or some of the other
outcomes is going

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.280
to depend on a lot of
these design considerations

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.694
or the implementation issues.

00:06:52.694 --> 00:06:54.610
So what I wanted to do
for the next 10 minutes

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.777
or so are kind of walk
through four of these design

00:06:56.777 --> 00:06:59.110
issues, which I'll conveniently
begin with the letter P,

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.200
that I think are really going
to shape how this all plays out.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.500
And the first one
is profit motive.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.600
If you are a
jurisdiction, and you're

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.530
thinking about alternatives to
prohibiting marijuana supply,

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.270
you actually have
a lot of options.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.280
You don't have to allow
for-profit companies

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:15.900
to come in.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.290
I mean, that's what
we're going to be

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:18.873
seeing in California,
what's happening

00:07:18.873 --> 00:07:21.110
in Washington and Colorado.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.540
A couple of reasons
to potentially

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.840
be concerned about this--

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.390
Pareto's Law, the 80/20
rule, is in effect.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.010
So it's 20% of marijuana users
that account for about 80%

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.190
of the consumption.

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.752
These are your daily and
your near-daily users.

00:07:33.752 --> 00:07:35.710
So if you allow a bunch
of for-profit companies

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.301
to come in, realize that's who
they're going to be targeting.

00:07:38.301 --> 00:07:40.300
They're going to be trying
to create heavy users

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.310
and try to nurture those that
are already in the market.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.684
This is what we
see with alcohol.

00:07:43.684 --> 00:07:46.060
80/20 rule applies
there, as well.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:51.790
Another potential issue with
allowing a for-profit system

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.250
is with the creation of a lobby.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:57.580
And if that lobby ends
up acting anything

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.320
like the alcohol and the
tobacco lobbies-- it may not.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:00.830
Who knows?

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.320
But if they act
like them, then we

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.111
would expect over time
that they would then

00:08:04.111 --> 00:08:05.860
begin to push
against regulations,

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.710
push against taxation,
and then maybe push

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:10.840
against any types
of changes that

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.949
were in theory supposed to
be influencing public health.

00:08:13.949 --> 00:08:16.240
But the bottom line is that
you've got a lot of options

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.330
here.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.360
So this is actually
a figure that I

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.430
produced with some colleagues
for the state of Vermont.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.910
So RAND, we don't have
an official position

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:28.000
on marijuana legalization
or marijuana policy.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.370
But a couple years ago,
the governor of Vermont

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.080
kind of saw the
writing on the wall.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.788
He knew that they were
going to be having

00:08:33.788 --> 00:08:35.110
discussions about legalization.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:38.320
So he wanted some work
done to kind of help

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.384
inform the debates they
were going to be having.

00:08:40.384 --> 00:08:42.840
And so I told the governor,
his staff, I said,

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.430
hey, RAND's not going to come
out and say, don't legalize

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:46.727
or you should legalize.

00:08:46.727 --> 00:08:48.310
But what we can do
is kind of walk you

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:50.712
through a lot of the different
options that are out there

00:08:50.712 --> 00:08:52.670
and talk about some of
the potential trade-offs

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.779
and what could be some of
the unintended consequences.

00:08:55.779 --> 00:08:57.820
And so we have a whole
chapter that's focused on,

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.780
well, how do you actually
supply marijuana?

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:05.680
And so this is kind of the
big figure from that chapter.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.650
And in the piece-- and we
talk about this in the book,

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:09.185
as well--

00:09:09.185 --> 00:09:10.810
we kind of talk about
the pros and cons

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.500
of these different approaches.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.530
For example, if you
wanted to legalize

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:18.470
but didn't necessarily want to
allow for-profit corporations,

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.200
you could actually
go to-- you've got

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.240
at least three options here.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.835
You could just allow
adults to grow their own.

00:09:24.835 --> 00:09:26.960
In fact, that's what's
happening in Washington, DC.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.543
That's what the
voters approved there.

00:09:28.543 --> 00:09:31.240
And that's actually what's
being debated in Vermont.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.460
You could also potentially
have cannabis buyers clubs

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.540
or cooperatives.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.310
This is what they're
doing in Spain.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:38.759
Uruguay is setting
these up, as well.

00:09:38.759 --> 00:09:40.300
You also have them
kind of popping up

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.760
in different parts of Europe.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.890
You can actually
do the Dutch model

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:46.600
and just kind of
allow the retail sales

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.870
but kind of keeping the
back door still illegal.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:51.370
But there are a
couple of criticisms

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:52.900
with these potential models.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.460
One-- it might be hard
to regulate the product.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.716
And for people who
want to legalize,

00:09:57.716 --> 00:09:59.340
that's something
that's very important.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.960
Let's regulate it
and kind of test it.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.672
Another criticism
of these models

00:10:03.672 --> 00:10:05.380
is that, well, they
might not necessarily

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.446
bring in a lot of revenue.

00:10:07.446 --> 00:10:09.820
And there are some people that
this is an important piece

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:10.930
of why they want to legalize.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:12.730
They want to bring in
significant revenues.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.100
I have to say, when
Uruguay legalized,

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.584
that was not part of
the calculus whatsoever.

00:10:17.584 --> 00:10:19.750
And there it was actually
kind of a different model.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.833
Whereas in the States, it
seems that the public is

00:10:21.833 --> 00:10:25.240
for this and the politicians
are kind of standing back.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.224
In Uruguay, it was
the exact opposite.

00:10:27.224 --> 00:10:29.140
The government wanted
this, and the population

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.189
at the time, 2/3 of
them were against it.

00:10:31.189 --> 00:10:32.980
But there the reasons
for doing this-- they

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.630
wanted it to reduce
violence associated

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:36.700
with the Paraguayan
traffickers coming in.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.850
And they also
thought it made sense

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.270
from a human-rights standpoint.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:44.730
But when it came to
revenues, that wasn't really

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.710
part of the discussions at all.

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:50.940
But if you are a jurisdiction,
and you want to legalize,

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.130
and revenues are
important for you,

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.050
you still have other
options out there

00:10:55.050 --> 00:11:00.180
besides just allowing for-profit
industry to kind of take over.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.699
For example, you could
have government stores.

00:11:02.699 --> 00:11:04.240
And in fact, there's
this one place--

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.470
it's a small city north
of Bonneville, Washington.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.050
They actually have a
city-owned marijuana shop

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.115
where they're selling.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:17.760
A lot of places don't
talk about this because

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.380
of the federal prohibition.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.521
And if you're a state and you
set something like this up,

00:11:22.521 --> 00:11:24.270
you're essentially
ordering your employees

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.272
to violate federal law.

00:11:25.272 --> 00:11:27.480
So in some places they're
kind of worried about this.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.910
North of Bonneville,
not so much.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:33.060
I think the store opened
up either in 2014, 2015.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.049
There's been no crackdown.

00:11:35.049 --> 00:11:36.840
You could also potentially
limit the market

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.660
to nonprofit
organizations, potentially

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:44.340
those that maybe have a focus on
child welfare or public health.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.040
And even if you are going to
allow for-profit companies

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.340
to get involved, you could limit
it to those kind of for-benefit

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.070
corporations that have social
and environmental goals--

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:55.680
for example, those that focus
on the triple bottom line

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.030
of people, planet, and profits.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.610
So you've got a lot
of options here.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:02.190
And while here in
California the state's

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:05.280
in the process of trying
to develop regulations

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.790
with the passage of
Proposition 64 last November,

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:10.500
it's going to leave
a lot of discretion

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.780
up to the local
governments about whether

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.940
or not to allow
production in the area,

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.870
to allow retail stores,
or even marijuana bars.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:22.070
So local jurisdictions can make
decisions about this, as well.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:23.820
So they could have
shops, but they may not

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.320
necessarily-- they
don't necessarily

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.830
have to be for-profit.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.460
So there are options there.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.100
The next P I want to
talk about is potency.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.380
And one of the decisions
confronting jurisdictions

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.330
is do you try to
put a limit on it?

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.180
There are dozens of cannabinoids
in the cannabis plant.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.622
THC's the one that gets
most of the attention.

00:12:41.622 --> 00:12:43.580
That's what's responsible
for getting you high,

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.390
but for some people, it
can increase panic attacks.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.880
It can even possibly increase
the probability of experiencing

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:48.713
a psychotic symptom.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.870
About 10 years ago-- it was the
last time we looked at this--

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:58.580
right around 2007, 2008,
of all the marijuana that

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.540
was consumed in
the United States,

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:03.660
probably between 40% to
67% of it at the time

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.042
was still coming from Mexico.

00:13:05.042 --> 00:13:06.750
And the stuff that
was coming from Mexico

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:10.980
probably ranged
between 4% to 8% THC.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.960
You walk into any of
the dispensaries now,

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.842
you're seeing products
well in excess of 20% THC.

00:13:15.842 --> 00:13:17.550
That doesn't necessarily
mean that that's

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:18.810
what everyone's buying.

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.430
But we ended up
just doing some work

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:22.110
for the state of Washington.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:24.060
We're analyzing all
the transactions

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.160
that have happened
since they legalized.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.050
And sure enough, we're
finding that flower

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:29.790
dominates all sales.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:32.250
But within the
flower sales, it's

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.250
sales of products
that are at least 20%

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:39.990
THC that accounts for
most of the transactions.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:42.390
And then you also
have the concentrates

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:45.390
and some of the extracts
that people will dab or even

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:48.990
vaporize that can
be 75%, 80% THC.

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:51.630
Thing to keep in mind
is most of the research

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.650
that's been done on the
health consequences,

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.370
whether they be the
risks or the benefits,

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:59.550
a lot of the studies that kind
of get quoted in marijuana

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.550
policy debates,
they're largely focused

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.970
on people who were smoking
low-potency product in the '80s

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.440
and '90s.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.570
We really don't have
much information

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:13.800
about the health consequences of
these higher-potency products.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:18.434
We do know that if you vaporize
as opposed to smoking a joint,

00:14:18.434 --> 00:14:20.100
you're not going to
have the combustion.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.016
So you're not going to
get as many carcinogens

00:14:22.016 --> 00:14:23.010
from the smoke.

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:24.180
But we really don't know--

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.550
take a high-school kid
who smokes a joint a day

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.710
versus the high-school
kid who dabs every day.

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.450
We really don't know
if one is better

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:33.359
than the other in terms of kind
of overall development there.

00:14:33.359 --> 00:14:35.400
And so as I said, one of
the things jurisdictions

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.320
have to think about is
do they-- especially

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.630
if you're a risk-averse
jurisdiction-- do you initially

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.084
want to put a limit on
THC in these products?

00:14:42.084 --> 00:14:43.500
Because especially
if you're going

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.752
to allow for-profit companies
to get involved, once that train

00:14:46.752 --> 00:14:48.210
starts, it could
be a heck of a lot

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.700
harder-- if you decide
10 years later that you

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.031
want to put limits on it,
it could be a lot harder.

00:14:53.031 --> 00:14:54.780
We even saw that with
the tobacco industry

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:55.760
and flavored products.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.970
It took a long time to
get flavored products out

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.600
of tobacco, and we
still have menthol.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.110
But as I said, THC's
the cannabinoid that

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:04.750
gets most of the attention.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:06.475
But there's another
one that seems

00:15:06.475 --> 00:15:08.350
to be getting more
attention now in the press

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:09.391
but also from scientists.

00:15:09.391 --> 00:15:10.055
And that's CBD.

00:15:10.055 --> 00:15:12.180
And so CBD's not necessarily
going to get you high.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:14.730
But CBD is believed
to potentially offset

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:19.710
some of the negative effects
of THC in terms of anxiety

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.820
and potentially
psychotic symptoms.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:25.200
And so my guess is that 10 years
from now, and maybe even sooner

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.570
than that, a lot of these
marijuana policy debates

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.070
are actually going to focus on--

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.740
what should the
THC-to-CBD ratio be?

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.560
So it won't necessarily be about
just THC, but also should we

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.300
have a floor for CBD?

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.730
But I have to say, the
evidence isn't there yet.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:42.097
We can't tell you what
the optimal ratio is.

00:15:42.097 --> 00:15:44.680
But I know that more scientists
are kind of looking into that.

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.721
But the bottom line is,
if you're a jurisdiction,

00:15:46.721 --> 00:15:50.059
you have control over what's
sold in your jurisdictions.

00:15:50.059 --> 00:15:51.600
The question is
whether or not you're

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.940
going to use that discretion
to potentially shape

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.370
the market, especially
given that we really

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:58.620
don't know how this is going
to play out from a health

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.810
perspective.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:03.490
The third P I want to
talk about is price.

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:05.346
As I mentioned before,
with legalization,

00:16:05.346 --> 00:16:06.720
there are a number
reasons why we

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.594
would expect that
production and distribution

00:16:08.594 --> 00:16:10.290
costs would go down.

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:12.930
Most importantly, you're
getting rid of the risk.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:13.980
Go outside of Cali--

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.580
go to Kansas, for example.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.840
There you buy marijuana, you
buy cocaine, or you buy heroin,

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.600
a lot of what you're doing is
compensating the drug dealer

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.130
and everyone else
along that supply

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:26.227
chain for their risk of arrest
and risk of incarceration.

00:16:26.227 --> 00:16:28.560
You get rid of that, that's
going to dramatically reduce

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.799
the cost.

00:16:29.799 --> 00:16:31.590
You also allow increasing
returns to scale.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.930
If you allow big
production, you've

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.164
got competition,
changes in technology.

00:16:36.164 --> 00:16:37.830
So there are kind of
a number of reasons

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:40.860
why we would expect these
costs to go down over time.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.880
Now, of course, as
I said, price is

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.210
important for thinking about
the illicit market, what's

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:47.630
happening with consumption,
also in terms of what

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.090
happens with tax revenues.

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:50.816
So it might be
that jurisdictions

00:16:50.816 --> 00:16:53.280
will want to do something to
potentially kind of inflate

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.180
the price.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.400
And there, jurisdictions
have a number of options.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.105
Obviously, they could tax,
put a tax on the product.

00:17:00.105 --> 00:17:02.640
They could impose
a minimum price.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:06.560
You could also just
have less competition.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.599
You could also impose
a number of regulations

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:09.640
which could add on costs.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.099
So jurisdictions
have decisions there.

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:14.790
But the thing about taxation
is that really nobody knows

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.950
the best way to tax marijuana.

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:19.619
And the issue is if
the tax is too high,

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:21.790
you're still going to
have the illicit market.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:22.980
So a lot of the work
that we've been doing

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.359
is trying to help
jurisdictions begin

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:26.250
to think through some
of the pros and cons

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:27.865
of these different options.

00:17:27.865 --> 00:17:29.865
The one that gets the
most attention and you see

00:17:29.865 --> 00:17:32.010
in most states
that have legalized

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:34.500
is an ad valorem tax,
just based on price--

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.510
for example, 15% of retail,
or in Washington state,

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:40.632
it's 37% at the retail level.

00:17:40.632 --> 00:17:42.090
The advantage to
that is it's easy.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.470
People know those
types of taxes.

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:45.000
It's easy to apply.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.250
A couple potential
drawbacks-- one,

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:49.890
if you're not smart about
bundling, people can beat it.

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:54.070
I'll sell you this pipe for $30
and give you the weed for free.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:58.230
The other potential drawback
to an ad valorem tax

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:02.280
is as the prices go down, so
will your revenue per sale.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:08.100
So this is why as more analysts
and researchers get into this,

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.864
you're seeing more projections.

00:18:09.864 --> 00:18:11.530
Here's what the
marijuana market's going

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:16.980
to look like in 2021, 2025.

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.800
Big numbers, lots of billions.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.600
The thing you have to
keep in mind when you're

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.036
looking at those models is are
they building in the potential

00:18:25.036 --> 00:18:26.910
for some of these price
drops and what that's

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:28.739
going to mean for tax revenues.

00:18:28.739 --> 00:18:30.780
Because I think a lot of
them are not doing that.

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:32.460
And especially as more
states get on board,

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.626
if you had a change at the
federal level, as I said,

00:18:34.626 --> 00:18:38.100
you could dramatically
reduce those prices.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.865
The second option for taxation
is a weight-based tax.

00:18:40.865 --> 00:18:42.990
And this is actually what
they're doing in Alaska--

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.439
$50 an ounce at the
wholesale level.

00:18:45.439 --> 00:18:46.980
And once again, the
advantage to that

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.105
is that it's easy to apply.

00:18:48.105 --> 00:18:52.740
You just do it right
there before it

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.660
goes to the retailers.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:56.220
But the potential
drawback to that

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.830
is if you make the
tax based on weight,

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:00.810
it creates incentives
for the producers

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.950
to produce more potent marijuana
and also for people to purchase

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:04.957
more potent marijuana.

00:19:04.957 --> 00:19:06.540
And to the extent
that we really don't

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:10.380
know much about the
health consequences there,

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:12.020
that's an issue for some people.

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:15.610
And I should say when we
talk about the concentrates

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:19.010
and the high-THC products,
the other big unknown

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:21.240
is we don't know
much about titration.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.594
That is, say you had a 5%
joint and someone just smoked

00:19:24.594 --> 00:19:25.260
the whole thing.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.140
Well, if they had a joint
that was then 15% THC,

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.240
are they only smoking
a third of it?

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.680
There isn't much
research on that.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.679
But so when we begin
thinking about these health

00:19:33.679 --> 00:19:36.120
consequences, that's going to
be important, and especially

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.710
in terms of you
think about effects

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:42.990
on the lungs and the different
devices that people are using.

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:45.720
But another way of tax-- there
are a number of different ways.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.720
But the other way that
they're starting to talk about

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.660
in Canada, and I
think it deserves

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.700
some serious
attention, is taxing

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.190
as a function of THC,
tax as a function

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:57.810
of the amount of intoxication.

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:00.450
And, in fact, that's what our
federal alcohol tax is based

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:02.100
on, the amount of alcohol.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.310
And the idea there
would be to the extent

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:08.040
that we don't know much
about the health effects

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.480
of these high-potency products.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.855
If you're not going to put a
limit on it, at least if you

00:20:11.855 --> 00:20:13.590
apply a THC tax,
you could then try

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:18.860
to nudge users towards some
of the lower-potency products.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.120
At least make it more
expensive if people really

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.710
want to get intoxicated.

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:27.930
And the THC tax really hasn't
gotten a lot of attention

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:29.170
in the States.

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:31.170
Most of the people that
are writing the ballots,

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:32.961
they want to put
something simple on there.

00:20:32.961 --> 00:20:35.970
So it's very easy to just
put an ad valorem tax.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.890
But the other
issue is you've got

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.320
to make sure that you feel
really good about your testing

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.077
and labeling regime.

00:20:42.077 --> 00:20:44.410
Because if you have a great
testing and labeling regime,

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:47.460
it's going to be very
easy to impose a THC tax.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.097
But if you don't have
a good testing regime--

00:20:50.097 --> 00:20:51.930
and you run into these
issues now especially

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:55.225
with the federal prohibition.

00:20:55.225 --> 00:20:57.030
For example, some
of these states,

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:59.640
the states themselves aren't
necessarily doing the testing.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.650
They're working with a
third party that then is

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:03.870
monitoring the other testers.

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.780
And in some of the places,
you've got gaming going on.

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.300
And I've heard the director
of public health in Colorado

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.360
say that he would like
to set up a lab where

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.416
the state of Colorado
would do the testing.

00:21:14.416 --> 00:21:16.290
But he's worried that
if you were to do that,

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:17.580
you'd then be ordering
your employees

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:18.538
to violate federal law.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.790
So that's why it doesn't
get as much attention here.

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:27.397
Canada, they've had a
regulated medical system

00:21:27.397 --> 00:21:28.230
for quite some time.

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:30.090
I think the way it
works is they've got

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:31.950
about three dozen producers.

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:34.590
And the only way it's
legal at the federal level

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:36.750
is for you to get it
from those producers.

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:40.650
You order online, and then
they just send it to you.

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:43.770
That's how it's legal
under federal law.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.870
But of course, in BC and
some of the other places,

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:48.286
you've got dispensaries all
over the place, which are kind

00:21:48.286 --> 00:21:49.740
of in this legal gray area.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.073
But the bottom line is there
are a lot of different ways

00:21:52.073 --> 00:21:54.080
that you could tax the product--

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.700
tax as a function of
the amount of canopy.

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.101
But the implications that
you make about taxing

00:21:59.101 --> 00:22:01.350
could down the line have
really important implications

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:03.720
for health.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.570
The final P I want to
talk about is permanency.

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:09.050
And as I said, nobody knows
the best way to tax marijuana.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:11.460
Nobody knows the best
way to regulate it.

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.211
So if you're smart
about this, you'd

00:22:14.211 --> 00:22:15.960
want to kind of build
in some flexibility.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.334
So as you learn
more about what's

00:22:17.334 --> 00:22:19.200
happening in other
jurisdictions,

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.180
as we learn more about
different cannabinoids

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.960
and the interactions
with the cannabinoids,

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.630
that you'd kind of
want to build that in.

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:30.690
But it's a lot easier to
build in that flexibility

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:33.390
at the beginning as
opposed to try to force it

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.820
after a law's been in
place for quite some time.

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:38.120
For example, especially
with taxation,

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.620
do you want changes in taxation
to have to go to the voters?

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.179
Or do you want it
to go to-- is it

00:22:43.179 --> 00:22:44.970
going to have to be
some legislative group?

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:47.310
Or do you want to have an
independent body making

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:48.799
decisions about the taxation?

00:22:48.799 --> 00:22:50.340
So these are decisions
that you would

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:54.330
have to make before a policy
ends up getting passed.

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:57.087
And I showed those
different options,

00:22:57.087 --> 00:22:58.670
those different
middle-ground options.

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.290
I think for some jurisdictions,
the middle ground

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:03.180
might be a destination.

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:06.520
For other places, it may
just be a step along the way,

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.540
especially for
risk-averse places.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.610
And so another option
for these jurisdictions

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:15.550
is to begin to build in a sunset
clause and say, you know what?

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:17.340
We're not happy with
the current system.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:21.262
We're going to try supply
regime X for five years.

00:23:21.262 --> 00:23:23.220
At the end of five years,
we'll make a decision

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.260
if we want to continue with
that or try something else.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.260
Once again, that doesn't
get a lot of discussion

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:29.520
here in the United States.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.020
Although, I think it
was Minnesota kind of

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:33.719
built something like that into
its medical marijuana regime.

00:23:33.719 --> 00:23:35.385
But if you're a
risk-averse jurisdiction

00:23:35.385 --> 00:23:37.350
and you don't want to
just immediately jump

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:39.390
to kind of the
profit-maximization model,

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:41.570
you've got other
choices out there.

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:43.350
And I know we're
here in California.

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:44.100
We're here in LA.

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.090
So I imagine a lot of
you might be thinking,

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.930
well, look, the legalization
discussion is over here

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:50.280
in California.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:55.680
But I'd push you to kind of
step back from that a little bit

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.610
for a few different reasons.

00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:59.130
First of all, the
state still hasn't

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:03.150
released what its
regulations are going to be.

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:05.070
And there are multiple
agencies involved.

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:07.050
So once that comes
out of Sacramento,

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:09.510
there's going to be a huge
debate throughout the state

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:12.570
about whether or not those
are the right regulations.

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:14.970
Second thing to keep in mind
is that this is still all

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:16.354
illegal under federal law.

00:24:16.354 --> 00:24:18.270
And once again, I would
be skeptical of anyone

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:20.400
who claims that they know what
the federal government is going

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.200
to do about marijuana
at the state level.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.030
Nobody really knows yet.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:26.880
But the third thing,
which I alluded to before,

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:31.830
in California is that Prop 64
gives the local jurisdictions

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.760
a tremendous amount
of discretion here.

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.260
So I think you're going to see
a lot of debates about, well,

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:37.380
do we allow producers?

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:38.490
Do we allow deliveries?

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:40.680
Do we allow retail shops?

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.442
And also, the marijuana bars--

00:24:42.442 --> 00:24:44.400
that's going to be very
different from Colorado

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.970
and Washington in that
local jurisdictions can

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:50.539
make allowances for
on-site consumption.

00:24:50.539 --> 00:24:52.080
So you can be walking
down the street

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.810
and go to this bar to get your
gin and tonic or Cabernet.

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:57.360
And go a couple stores
down, and that's

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:01.590
where you can hang out
and consume edibles and--

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:04.020
I'm not sure how it's going
to work with indoor air laws.

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:06.180
I think a lot's going to depend
on the local jurisdictions

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:06.750
there.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:11.520
But even though Prop 64 passed,
Prop M passed here in LA,

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.760
I think you're still going
to hear a lot about marijuana

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:17.190
policy in Southern California.

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:19.770
And I think the final
thing I'd like to say

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:21.470
is as you're kind
of participating

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:23.760
or kind of listening
to those discussions,

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.590
remember that
reasonable people can

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:29.940
disagree about what to do when
it comes to marijuana policy.

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:32.790
So much of this comes
down to personal values

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:35.059
and your preferences for risk.

00:25:35.059 --> 00:25:36.600
There are some people
that don't want

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.300
the government telling them
what to put in their bodies.

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:39.220
They're going to vote one way.

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.520
There's some people that are so
fed up with drug prohibition,

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.811
they're going to vote that way.

00:25:42.811 --> 00:25:45.180
There are other people that
are opposed to intoxication.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:46.970
They're probably going
to vote this way.

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:49.740
For those that are unsure
about this from a public-health

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:53.160
standpoint, it might
depend on the details.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.037
And so an anecdote
here-- so when

00:25:55.037 --> 00:25:57.120
we were working on that
first edition of the book,

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.850
I was working on it with
three other coauthors.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.740
So we worked together
to kind of come up

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:06.150
with those first 15 chapters
with the 140 questions.

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:08.196
And we were all in
agreement about here's

00:26:08.196 --> 00:26:09.570
what the science
says, and here's

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:11.692
what the science doesn't say.

00:26:11.692 --> 00:26:13.150
But then at the
end, we said, well,

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:16.140
what if we added a chapter 16
where we each wrote a couple

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.930
pages about our opinions
about marijuana legalization,

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:22.260
how we think things should
play out given the evidence?

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:25.350
We didn't plan it this way,
but it turns out all four of us

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:27.090
were all over the map.

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:28.950
One was very pro-legalization.

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:30.690
One was very anti-legalization.

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:32.220
There were a couple
of us that were

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:34.320
in the middle, wanted
reform, not necessarily

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.554
a for-profit model.

00:26:35.554 --> 00:26:36.220
But here it was.

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.640
We all agreed on what
the science said.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.550
But still, our personal values
and our preferences for risk

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:45.306
really then ended up shaping
our policy prescriptions.

00:26:45.306 --> 00:26:46.430
So with that, I will close.

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:49.260
And I look forward to kind of
continuing this discussion.

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.610
[APPLAUSE]
