00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
In this video we're
going to talk a

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.860
little bit about amines.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.850
And these are just organic
compounds where you have a

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.170
nitrogen bonded to groups
that contain carbon.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.590
So if I were to just draw some
amines right here, you could

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.040
have something like this where
you have a nitrogen bonded to

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.450
two hydrogens and then maybe
some type of carbon chain.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.240
Maybe it's just one
carbon right here.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.600
So maybe you have a carbon,
which is also bonded to three

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.750
hydrogens like this.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.480
In this case you would
have a primary amine.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.140
If you have the nitrogen
bonded to two carbons.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.610
So if you have something
like this, a nitrogen

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.980
bonded to two carbons.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.330
So it has one carbon
chain right there.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.920
And I'm just drawing
methyl groups here.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.620
The chain could keep on going.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.180
Maybe you have two like that.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.500
And then you have a hydrogen
right there.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.950
This would be a secondary
amine.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.520
And then finally you could
imagine, if you had it bonded

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.500
to three, it would be
a tertiary amine.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.850
And this is just to get you
introduced to the terminology.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.040
CH3, just like that.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.870
Now like all of the other new
groups or new types of

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.670
compounds that we've explored,
what I want to do is just

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.080
introduce you to the
naming of it.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.620
Because one, that lets you
recognize them when you hear

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.490
their names.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.790
But it also, I think on some
level, familiarizes you with

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.470
their structure.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.550
So let's do a couple
of naming examples.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.890
I drew these ahead of time.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.210
And in general, just to
remember, amines are a pretty

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.360
high-priority group.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.490
Out of all the things that we've
learned so far, the only

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.960
thing that is a higher
priority is

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.710
actually the alcohols.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.250
Or actually the thiols, which I
don't even remember if I did

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.900
a video on it.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.320
But thiols are just like
alcohols, but instead of an

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.120
oxygen you have a sulfur.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.560
So this comes right
after those.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.200
So let's think about this
one right here.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.240
So we always want to look for
our longest carbon chain.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.890
And our longest carbon
chain is right here.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.220
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven carbons.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.810
You want to start numbering
it closer to

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.650
the functional group.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:13.770
One, two, three, four,
five, six, and seven.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.410
And then the functional
group is on the two

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.590
carbon right there.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.390
So first of all,
seven carbons.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.120
We would use the prefix hept.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.940
So it would be heptan.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.370
Let me write that down.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.620
So it'd be heptan.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.500
And since our functional group
is an amine in this situation,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.480
it has a higher priority than
the fact this is an alkane.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.640
So this will actually
define the suffix.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.505
So we would then say well then
on the two carbon-- let me do

00:02:46.505 --> 00:02:50.450
this in new color-- on the two
carbon right over here we have

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.440
the amine group.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.690
So it's heptan-2-amine.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.850
And we're done.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.490
We know that we have an amine
group on the two carbon.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.310
Now let's do this one.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.080
This one's a little
bit more hairy.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.200
So first of all, we always want
to figure out the longest

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.780
carbon chain.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.180
And it looks like the ring
is going to be the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.140
longest carbon chain.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.920
We have one, two, three, four,
five, six carbons.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.050
So this thing right here
is the longest chain.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.890
We only have one, two
carbons right there.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.280
One carbon and one carbon,
right over there.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.400
So our root is going
to be cyclohexane.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.720
I want to make sure I
have enough space.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.970
Cyclohexane.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.490
And then once again it's an
amine, so this is going to

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.110
take higher priority.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.850
So we're not just going to put
an e at the end and call this

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.190
cyclohexane.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.440
This takes higher priority.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.000
So it will actually
define the suffix.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.040
And another thing to think about
is you could say, OK

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.520
this is going to be the
one, this is going

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.310
to be the one carbon.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.560
And so you could call this
cyclohexan-1-amine.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.400
But in general, if this is
defining it, you always assume

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.280
that you're going to start
numbering right there at

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.810
number one.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.350
So you could just call
this cyclohexanamine.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.649
If it's written like this you
assume that the one carbon is

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:23.710
where the amine group
is attached.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.760
Now what else do we have
on this thing?

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.610
We took care of the amine.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.920
We took care of the cyclo.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.340
Well we have this ether
right here.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.590
And this ether has
one, two carbons.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.610
If it was just a two carbon
chain, it would be ethane.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.170
But since we have it's an ether,
it's bonded to this

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.700
oxygen, we call this ethoxy.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.750
So that right there is ethoxy.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.490
And we're going to have to think
about how we're going to

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.090
number this.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.230
So I'll leave that alone.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.530
And what are these over here?

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.460
Well this is a methyl group.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.170
That's a CH3 implicitly.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.920
You don't see it drawn.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.890
There's a carbon there.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.940
And if carbon is neutral, it
has to have four bonds.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.510
And if you only draw one of
them, the other three are

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.650
assumed to be the hydrogen.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.370
So this is a methyl group.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.900
And then this is also
a methyl group.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.190
So we have dimethyl.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.510
So this is also a methyl
group right over there.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.670
And when we think about
numbering, we could number

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:19.820
from one, two three.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.980
Or we could start numbering
one, two, three.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.950
And in general, you want to go
numbering in the direction

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.750
where you hit the functional
group first. So we want to go

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:32.380
one, two, three,
four, and five.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.090
So this right here
is 5-ethoxy.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.450
And this is one, two dimethyl.

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.040
These two combined, you
would call this

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.340
one comma two dimethyl.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.420
And then when you want to list
them in order, the ethoxy

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.910
would take precedence in
alphabetical because the di

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.080
you shouldn't count in the
alphabetical order.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.460
This is just saying
two methyls.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.470
So you really just want to look
at the two of whatever

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.340
you're talking about.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.180
M comes after e in alphabetical
order.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.970
So this is going
to be 5-ethoxy.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.810
Actually let me just rewrite
the whole thing.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:17.320
So this is going
to be 5-ethoxy

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.570
1,2-dimethylcyclohexanamine.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.230
And we're done.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.415
This was probably one
of the longest words

00:06:42.415 --> 00:06:43.510
we've used in naming.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.350
But hopefully you see when you
break down the different

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.280
pieces, it actually makes
sense that it

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.540
represents this molecule.
