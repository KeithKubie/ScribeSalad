on the Davos question I personally think
 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.750
on the Davos question I personally think
that we're at a critical juncture where

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760
that we're at a critical juncture where
 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.190
that we're at a critical juncture where
we could address the twin challenges of

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200
we could address the twin challenges of
 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.810

meeting the energy needs of a growing
 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.850
meeting the energy needs of a growing
population and also fly to address the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860
population and also fly to address the
 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.639

LED lighting systems the benefit of
 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.480
LED lighting systems the benefit of
using these is that there are no running

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490
using these is that there are no running
 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.240

would they be able to get lighting for
 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.710
would they be able to get lighting for
their own daily uses but think of the

little bit of time in the evening trying
 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.550
little bit of time in the evening trying
to get literate so essentially this is a

no means for modern lighting systems to
 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.270
no means for modern lighting systems to
get get access to these technologies and

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280
get get access to these technologies and
 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.520
get get access to these technologies and
literally light up a billion lights so

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530
literally light up a billion lights so
 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.170

and I hope we can make a major beginning
in this year because this would not only

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860
in this year because this would not only
 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.840
in this year because this would not only
address the critical need for energy as
