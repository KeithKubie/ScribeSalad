00:00:08.446 --> 00:00:11.376
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We're in a mandatory
evacuation situation now.

00:00:11.606 --> 00:00:13.836
You're looking at anywhere
from 10 to 14,

00:00:13.836 --> 00:00:15.776
15 feet of storm surge, parish wide.

00:00:16.186 --> 00:00:18.876
&gt;&gt;Narrator: A hurricane is
bearing down on New Orleans.

00:00:19.046 --> 00:00:21.586
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay, right now I'm
going to need the fire department.

00:00:22.086 --> 00:00:24.716
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And eighth graders from
Landry Middle School, have assembled

00:00:24.716 --> 00:00:29.346
at the nearby emergency response
center to deal with the mock crisis.

00:00:29.346 --> 00:00:30.726
&gt;&gt;Student: Do we deliver babies?

00:00:30.726 --> 00:00:31.346
&gt;&gt;Student: We're going to try.

00:00:31.596 --> 00:00:33.946
&gt;&gt;Student: How are we going to
get the paramedic to her house?

00:00:34.586 --> 00:00:38.876
&gt;&gt;Student: We're going
to send two paramedics.

00:00:39.046 --> 00:00:40.676
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Power is
out, bridges are down,

00:00:40.676 --> 00:00:43.276
and a pregnant woman
is calling for help.

00:00:43.416 --> 00:00:48.146
The situation demands clear
judgment, teamwork and improvisation.

00:00:48.396 --> 00:00:51.716
&gt;&gt;Student: Two minutes apart,
that baby is coming out.

00:00:51.906 --> 00:00:54.336
&gt;&gt;Student: So we have any
type of transportation?

00:00:54.336 --> 00:00:56.206
&gt;&gt;Girl: Don't we have--
oh, the truck, you know,

00:00:56.246 --> 00:00:57.886
the drive through water--

00:00:57.886 --> 00:00:59.686
&gt;&gt;Student: It's like a Hummer.

00:00:59.796 --> 00:01:01.686
&gt;&gt;Student: So we're
going to use that truck

00:01:01.686 --> 00:01:04.026
to bring the paramedics to her house.

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:09.816
&gt;&gt;Dianne: Anytime we teach and we use
real relevant real life experiences,

00:01:09.946 --> 00:01:13.156
kids are immersed in those
experiences and learning is fun.

00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:17.806
And the bottom line is when learning
is fun, it's easy and it comes quick

00:01:17.806 --> 00:01:18.876
to the kids, and they enjoy it.

00:01:19.426 --> 00:01:22.396
&gt;&gt;Narrator: After some anxious
moments, the storm passes,

00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:25.836
and science teacher Linda
Watsky quizzes her class

00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:27.836
on what they've gained
from the exercise.

00:01:27.836 --> 00:01:29.536
&gt;&gt;Student: I will always
remember the stress.

00:01:29.536 --> 00:01:32.506
I mean, it's hard being Parish
President, you've got people, like,

00:01:32.816 --> 00:01:36.446
you know, Christie over here,
well you've got a fire over here,

00:01:36.706 --> 00:01:39.556
and let's say, Teneesha over
here, a tree fell down over here.

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:42.586
And I'm, okay, well all
right, okay, well then, okay,

00:01:42.706 --> 00:01:43.326
then I'm going to do this.

00:01:43.326 --> 00:01:45.216
All right, and then it's stressful.

00:01:45.216 --> 00:01:48.376
I mean, you've got to listen
to so many things at one time.

00:01:48.376 --> 00:01:51.086
&gt;&gt;Linda: Okay, how does what we were
learning in class, relate to this?

00:01:51.536 --> 00:01:52.916
What does it take to solve a problem?

00:01:53.326 --> 00:01:55.786
Do you always have to be
right the first go round?

00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:56.616
&gt;&gt;All: No.

00:01:56.886 --> 00:01:59.466
&gt;&gt;Linda: Okay, so the same
with, in scientific method.

00:01:59.896 --> 00:02:03.756
The difference in class is you're
solving it to learn knowledge.

00:02:04.546 --> 00:02:08.196
In here, you're solving it to save
people's lives, and I think that's

00:02:08.306 --> 00:02:09.206
where the stress comes in.

00:02:09.886 --> 00:02:11.756
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The back of your
car has to be on this line.

00:02:12.486 --> 00:02:15.056
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Not all of Landry's
class work is stressful.

00:02:15.106 --> 00:02:17.386
&gt;&gt;Teacher: If you hold it
just there for your partner.

00:02:17.676 --> 00:02:19.076
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In fact,
much of the hands

00:02:19.076 --> 00:02:22.436
on project based learning
here is downright fun.

00:02:22.436 --> 00:02:22.946
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay?

00:02:25.346 --> 00:02:27.916
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To engage their
students at the end of the year,

00:02:28.216 --> 00:02:32.286
the eighth grade teachers came up
with a project focusing on cars.

00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:37.816
In science class, students
made balloon propelled cars

00:02:37.816 --> 00:02:42.196
out of recycled materials, and
road tested their various designs.

00:02:44.146 --> 00:02:45.546
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Oh, it curved,
look at that.

00:02:46.626 --> 00:02:49.936
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Like most Landry
projects, the car unit was featured

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:52.066
across the eighth grade curriculum.

00:02:52.206 --> 00:02:55.386
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Try to write some
different selling points.

00:02:55.576 --> 00:02:58.616
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In language arts,
students wrote car commercials,

00:02:58.726 --> 00:03:01.966
and in math, they calculated
loan payments.

00:03:02.416 --> 00:03:03.746
&gt;&gt;Teacher: At six percent,

00:03:04.106 --> 00:03:06.616
of whatever you get
for item number seven.

00:03:06.676 --> 00:03:07.926
&gt;&gt;Student: So multiply six percent--

00:03:07.926 --> 00:03:08.926
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Percent times that.

00:03:09.006 --> 00:03:09.246
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay.

00:03:09.666 --> 00:03:13.596
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They also used the web
to plan trips and find information

00:03:13.596 --> 00:03:16.616
on fuel economy and
environmental impacts.

00:03:16.936 --> 00:03:19.356
&gt;&gt;Student: Not only is the
vehicle going to save the earth,

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:21.836
it also comes with
most standard features

00:03:21.836 --> 00:03:24.026
that all consumers
really, really like.

00:03:24.706 --> 00:03:27.936
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And they evaluated
pitches from local car salesmen.

00:03:28.186 --> 00:03:30.836
&gt;&gt;Salesman: Here you can see, this
truck, at least, it's fully equipped,

00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:34.846
it has cruise control, the tilt
steering wheel, it has power windows

00:03:34.846 --> 00:03:36.766
and power door locks,
and power mirrors.

00:03:36.866 --> 00:03:38.656
&gt;&gt;Student: How much does it
take to fill up the tank?

00:03:39.046 --> 00:03:39.626
How much it costs?

00:03:39.966 --> 00:03:40.866
&gt;&gt;Salesman: And that's
going to be close

00:03:40.946 --> 00:03:44.176
to 40 dollars for, you
know, an empty tank.

00:03:44.796 --> 00:03:46.926
&gt;&gt;Teacher: In the math thing,
they were very much into it.

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:47.646
We talked about--

00:03:47.646 --> 00:03:50.256
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The eighth grade
teachers coordinate their efforts

00:03:50.256 --> 00:03:54.356
and evaluate the progress of
projects during their daily 45 minute

00:03:54.356 --> 00:03:55.056
shared time.

00:03:55.056 --> 00:03:58.396
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And we had little
scenarios where they reached

00:03:58.396 --> 00:04:01.106
in the bag and pulled out
whether they're single

00:04:01.216 --> 00:04:04.606
or whether they have three kids,
so when they went to pick the cars,

00:04:04.606 --> 00:04:09.036
it was like, you know, I
want this car that's 147,000,

00:04:09.036 --> 00:04:11.656
but my income on my
profile card says,

00:04:12.036 --> 00:04:18.026
all I'm making is 48,000 dollars, but
I have to take care of three kids.

00:04:18.026 --> 00:04:19.286
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For these teachers,

00:04:19.286 --> 00:04:23.296
the benefits of team teaching extend
beyond curriculum development.

00:04:23.476 --> 00:04:25.996
&gt;&gt;Dianne: One of the
things that the kids say,

00:04:26.396 --> 00:04:28.196
is they see that we work as a team.

00:04:28.736 --> 00:04:32.176
Plus that's also the way the
business world is run, in teams.

00:04:32.836 --> 00:04:36.246
So what we expect them to be
able to do, as young adults,

00:04:37.016 --> 00:04:39.026
that is what we practice here,

00:04:39.026 --> 00:04:42.806
so that they can see the
real world connection.

00:04:42.806 --> 00:04:45.366
&gt;&gt;Student: The downpayment
you gave was 1,000,

00:04:45.366 --> 00:04:47.656
so more or less what you have is 48.

00:04:47.716 --> 00:04:49.526
So this is how much you
wanted to pay, but--

00:04:49.526 --> 00:04:51.846
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At Landry,
students practice teamwork, too.

00:04:51.846 --> 00:04:52.296
&gt;&gt;Student: Are you lost?

00:04:52.516 --> 00:04:53.396
Are you getting me?

00:04:53.696 --> 00:04:54.206
&gt;&gt;Student: I got you.

00:04:54.296 --> 00:04:54.686
&gt;&gt;Student: You got me?

00:04:54.746 --> 00:04:57.806
So what happens is, you
have to pay the bank back.

00:04:57.806 --> 00:05:00.636
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students of varying
abilities are grouped in teams

00:05:00.636 --> 00:05:04.626
of four, which often include
older students needing extra help.

00:05:04.726 --> 00:05:07.106
&gt;&gt;Jont'e: We don't
really work by ourselves.

00:05:07.106 --> 00:05:10.226
Because we sit in groups, and
if we have a question, well,

00:05:10.396 --> 00:05:13.486
if we don't know it, then we ask,
like, our peers and our pupils,

00:05:13.846 --> 00:05:15.946
and if they don't know it,
then we ask the teacher,

00:05:15.996 --> 00:05:18.886
because it's really like a community.

00:05:18.886 --> 00:05:22.296
We stay-- we're one big family,
and we are the Landry family

00:05:22.296 --> 00:05:23.446
and we help each other out.

00:05:23.726 --> 00:05:26.066
&gt;&gt;Linda: I've had kids come
back to me and tell me,

00:05:26.066 --> 00:05:27.966
"Do you remember that
project we did?"

00:05:28.496 --> 00:05:31.756
They have never, ever come back and
said, "Remember that test we did?"

00:05:32.546 --> 00:05:34.826
So I think that's the impact.

00:05:34.826 --> 00:05:38.776
If the kids remember, test scores
will go up, and our test scores have.

00:05:39.116 --> 00:05:41.626
&gt;&gt;Student: We need
two and two, because--

00:05:41.626 --> 00:05:43.656
&gt;&gt;Mentor: I know another
Y. I'm doing Ys over one.

00:05:44.036 --> 00:05:45.266
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Volunteer mentors

00:05:45.266 --> 00:05:48.496
from local industry are also
part of the Landry family.

00:05:48.786 --> 00:05:52.916
&gt;&gt;Paul: We come here once a week, and
we get the satisfaction of working

00:05:52.916 --> 00:05:57.416
with excellent students
and seeing the future.

00:05:57.656 --> 00:06:00.166
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And when
new technology is thrown

00:06:00.166 --> 00:06:02.746
into the mix, learning is a blast.

00:06:03.046 --> 00:06:03.346
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Out.

00:06:04.626 --> 00:06:07.716
Go back, same way, in
and out, in and out.

00:06:08.196 --> 00:06:10.626
&gt;&gt;Paul: We're doing a study
of motion and graphing.

00:06:10.626 --> 00:06:12.806
We're letting the students
see that, as they walk,

00:06:12.806 --> 00:06:15.856
this motion detector here, graphs
their path, and we're going

00:06:15.856 --> 00:06:18.646
to show them that their walk
can be interpreted into math.

00:06:18.886 --> 00:06:19.946
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You see it?

00:06:19.946 --> 00:06:20.936
Where's that gap?

00:06:21.566 --> 00:06:24.346
The gap is way up there,
you know why?

00:06:24.796 --> 00:06:25.946
What is it reading?

00:06:26.286 --> 00:06:26.966
&gt;&gt;Student: Nothing.

00:06:26.966 --> 00:06:28.696
&gt;&gt;Teacher: It read
nothing, it read the wall.

00:06:28.956 --> 00:06:29.296
So we--

00:06:29.296 --> 00:06:31.776
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While students,
teachers and community members work

00:06:31.776 --> 00:06:36.106
in teams throughout the year, the
ultimate test of teamwork at Landry,

00:06:36.456 --> 00:06:39.466
comes when a group of traveling
circus professionals arrives.

00:06:40.236 --> 00:06:42.236
[Cheering]

00:06:42.456 --> 00:06:43.816
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Known as
Circus of the Kids,

00:06:44.256 --> 00:06:48.866
they spend two weeks turning ordinary
students into high flying acrobats

00:06:48.916 --> 00:06:50.996
and accomplished performers
who delight

00:06:50.996 --> 00:06:55.486
and terrify an audience
of peers and parents.

00:06:55.606 --> 00:06:58.396
&gt;&gt;Vanessa: It raises their self
esteem, lets them know that,

00:06:58.576 --> 00:07:02.436
as long as you try, you know, at
anything, you can do your best.

00:07:02.566 --> 00:07:03.926
You just have to be positive.

00:07:03.926 --> 00:07:07.646
It's kind of dangerous, but if
they teach them well, actually,

00:07:08.016 --> 00:07:09.656
yeah, he was a fire eater.

00:07:10.296 --> 00:07:14.496
So I just was glad when it was over.

00:07:15.166 --> 00:07:19.606
&gt;&gt;Student: And now for your
entertainment our jugglers, Amanda--

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:22.256
&gt;&gt;Student: At first when I heard
about it, I was like, circus,

00:07:22.256 --> 00:07:26.906
you know, I can't do this,
I'm not even going to try.

00:07:27.036 --> 00:07:30.706
But when they started showing me
how to do this, they demonstrated it

00:07:30.706 --> 00:07:33.986
for us, and it was like,
okay, well maybe I can do it.

00:07:34.296 --> 00:07:35.976
And I started doing it, and realized,
I'm really good at this stuff

00:07:36.516 --> 00:07:39.806

00:07:40.306 --> 00:07:41.506
