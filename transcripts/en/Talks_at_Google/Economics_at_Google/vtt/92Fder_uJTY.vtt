00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.630
AYELET OZ: What I'm going
to talk to you about today

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.100
is the lot going on in criminal
justice in Israel these days.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.320
It's actually very
exciting times

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.070
to be a lawyer, which is always.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.710
And we kind of
rethink a lot of what

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.280
we used to think about
punishments and about prisons,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.100
and it's a trend that started
around the world except the US,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.170
which we'll talk
about in a second,

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.390
and starting to
move on to Israel.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.820
And actually we're in
really exciting times.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.610
So I want to first take you back
about a decade ago, like 2009.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.470
And a decade ago, it seemed
as if Israel is just following

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.390
the footsteps of the US.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.370
And what happened in
the US more or less

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.480
since the 1970s
is what we usually

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.680
call the incarceration crisis
or the mass incarceration

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.760
of the US.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.540
There's been a huge
leap in the number

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.880
of Americans incarcerated.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.800
Lots of them are black.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.460
Actually, one of the figures
is that if you are, I think 25

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.400
and black in the
US, you have more

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.900
of a chance to be
in prison than you

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.270
have to graduate from college.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.840
So this is a lot
about race in the US

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.360
and a lot about how the US
deals with criminal justice

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.630
and with crime rates.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.440
And it seems as if Israel
is following this--

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.966
Yeah?

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:40.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.570
AYELET OZ: The
question is what's

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.670
the difference between
a jail and prison.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.140
So jail is mostly for
shorter prison sentences.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.380
A lot of times, it would
be in the state jail,

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.830
and prison is for
longer sentences.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.260
And what you can actually
also learn from this graph

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.040
is that the prison
sentence, there's not only

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.040
more people in prison, but
prison sentences are also

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.150
longer, meaning people get
sent to longer years in prison

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.949
in America now.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:14.120
And just like to give you
kind of an international

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.620
perspective, this is how
removed the US is in terms

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.400
of its incarceration rate.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.030
Meaning this is like
most of Europe and such,

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.920
and the US is just
off the charts.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.600
This is Israel.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.760
I'm really sorry that
the graphs are in Hebrew.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.840
It's from PDFs.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.730
So I'll explain
what it's saying.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.140
Israel is in red
in both of them.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.220
So what we see here
is first that we

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.000
have a lot of use of
prison sentence in regard

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.070
to other sentences.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:03:03.650
So it's about 0.42
in prison in regard

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.790
to fines and other
punishments, and 177 people out

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.610
of every 10,000 in prison.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.830
And again, if we return to
the US, you remember the 698.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.650
So we are not there yet,
but we are still very high

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.210
up in comparison
to other countries.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.520
And this is like, if
we talk in numbers,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.020
we see it as a slight decrease,
actually, in people in prison

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.800
in Israel in just like the
last two or three years,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.080
but it's mostly stable.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.960
I would say just so you
got your numbers right

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.800
that these are only criminal
prisoners in Israel.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.400
There are also
about 6,000 of what

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.830
we call security
prisoners, which

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:59.150
are people who are incarcerated
for security felonies,

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.710
and there are about 600 migrants
who are in migration detention.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.140
This number used to be
higher, but now it's

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.870
somewhat along the 600.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.070
Talking about security
prisoners is a large topic

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.800
and we'll not discuss it now,
mostly because what we're

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.860
talking about is
criminal justice policy

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:24.770
and how we relate to crime,
and security prisoners, usually

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.220
the number rises and
falls more in regards

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.580
to the security situation than
what we are talking about.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.300
But I just wanted you
to have the numbers.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.390
And as you can see, even
if we compare Israel

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.080
to similar countries
like in terms

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.340
of size of the
population and such,

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.530
these are mostly the
Nordic countries,

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.760
which we'll return to
later on, because Finland

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.950
is a very interesting story.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.120
You can see we are
much higher than that,

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.330
and this is the figure
that I've lost before,

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.720
which is how much we
use prison in comparison

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.100
to other sentences.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:10.450
And the number is, I think
today, it's closer to 40%.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.850
And the question is, OK,
so you tell me, OK, we

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.020
need to fight crime somehow and
the way we need to fight crime

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.470
is by putting people in prison.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.340
But the thing is, Israel
doesn't have that much crime.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.180
So you know, if we compare
it to other countries who

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.500
have like a mediocre amount
of crime, and not only that,

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.980
the crime rate is
not only decreasing,

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.700
actually falling down
in the last decade.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.850
This is the crime rate
in the last decade,

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.987
and it's a constant trend.

00:05:46.987 --> 00:05:48.820
It's actually a trend
that happens elsewhere

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.720
in the world, meaning
crime rates are going down,

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.610
mostly in the developed world,
and in Israel in specific.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.860
And it does not match
the rise in prison.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.400
So you cannot say, well, we
use prison more so the crime is

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.430
declining.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.770
So this is not the case.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.560
OK, so why do we use punishment?

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.670
So now I want to kind of like
go back from the graphs and such

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:17.140
and try to show you,
OK, so why do we

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.310
use the prison sentence that
much if we don't have the crime

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.810
rate.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:29.090
And the answer is there's no
need to do that, basically.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:34.900
So up until the '90s,
more or less, like the way

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.010
all criminal justice
specialists thought

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.090
was, well, OK, let's
put this in an equation.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.450
So we put the chances of
someone to get caught,

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.360
and the punishment he's
going to get, multiply

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.770
the one by the other, and this
is what will make him decide,

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.720
do I want to commit
this crime or not.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.340
So if, for example, I enjoy
robbing the elderly very much,

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.860
I will say, OK, I have about
a 50% chance of getting caught

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.320
and I will spend two
years in prison if I do.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.120
So I have this one year
calculated prison sentence,

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.410
but you know, I actually enjoy
robbing the elderly a year

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:15.690
and a half.

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.650
So OK, I'll do it.

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.900
It's worthwhile.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:25.660
You know, like our basic
101 economic thought.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:32.500
The problem is that when you put
this to test, none of the data

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.240
actually supports this.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.590
One of the things that was
most studied in criminology

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.470
is this question, does
increasing the punishment

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:42.820
create deterrence.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.190
And if there's one thing
criminologists would agree on,

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.570
the answer is no.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:52.870
If you've tried to
think, OK, why, then no.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.420
So first I tell you
that it's not correct

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.640
because of the studies
that were done.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.680
There were studies
that were created,

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.170
like they had all these
experiments, you know,

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.260
and you add the punishment
and nothing changes.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.780
And they had like
natural experiments

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.540
in which the punishment
rose, but still there

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.040
was no effect on crime.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.310
And then, well, you try to think
about it, but why, you know.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.430
Let's take our nice
elderly robber.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.500
He got his math right, right.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.700
And there's actually a few
quite intuitive explanations

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.655
to why this doesn't work.

00:08:27.655 --> 00:08:29.030
First is that people--

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.290
Yeah?

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:31.990
AUDIENCE: Does
this hold even when

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.984
you increase the
punishment drastically,

00:08:33.984 --> 00:08:38.830
like capital punishment
for every minor felony?

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.780
Will this still hold?

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.210
AYELET OZ: This actually is
the extreme that does work.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:48.190
So for example, when you have
like some natural experiments

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:52.690
in which, let's say the legal
system collapsed totally,

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:56.140
so no punishment for
nothing, you do see a rise,

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.810
but this happens
only at the margins.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:02.620
Meaning if you either kill
everybody or have no law

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.900
at all, you will see an effect.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:09.590
But let's say, well, you
know, your every day new bill,

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.890
OK someone robbed
the elderly, let's

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:18.080
put 10 years on elderly robbery,
this virtually makes no change.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:25.480
So one thing is because
people mind more

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.300
the chances of getting
caught versus the punishment.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.020
So if you do raise the
chances of getting caught,

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.150
meaning you put more
officers out there,

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:37.960
you do see a change
in deterrence.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.610
So for example,
I'll give myself.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:43.390
I used to drive my bike
on the sideways to work,

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.310
and then they
started giving fines

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:48.460
to people right on the sidewalk,
and I stopped doing that.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:52.310
Actually stopped driving,
now I walk to work.

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:56.620
And this would help, meaning
increased enforcement

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:01.090
does help, but if they
would leave the enforcement

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:02.610
as is and would
only say, no, you

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:06.970
don't get a 500 shekel fine,
you will get a 1000 shekel fine,

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.450
this would not help.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.450
This would not change
the behavior of people.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.695
One reason is because
people underestimate

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:14.820
their chances of getting
caught, so they would say,

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.200
OK, well, you know,
they'll put me

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.080
a life sentence for
driving on a sidewalk,

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.150
but they'll never
catch me so who cares.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.460
Another main reason is--

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:32.620
I saw you laughing when I gave
you our nice elderly robber,

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.930
and the reason
that you laughed is

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:40.180
that no one, no criminal,
or actually most criminals,

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.640
do not do this calculation.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.960
People perform felonies,
mostly street felonies,

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.910
meaning violence,
break through and such,

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:55.390
because of a variety of reasons,
and rational decision making

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:56.640
is the least of.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.400
It's because they're
addicted to drugs or alcohol,

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.170
or because they got caught
up in being very excited,

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.510
so they made a felony.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:11.752
It's a variety of reasons,
and people do not calculate.

00:11:11.752 --> 00:11:13.210
And actually, when
they did studies

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:16.050
in which they ask people, what
did you think of when you did,

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:18.820
I don't know, the
murder or something,

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.740
like the vast majority
of people do not even

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.890
think about the punishment
that they're going to get.

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.950
It's just not something that
is calculated when you actually

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.380
perform felonies.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.180
Another reason is
because, well, if I'm

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.230
going to ask you now, what
is the punishment for armed

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:37.449
robbery, like I don't know.

00:11:37.449 --> 00:11:38.240
AUDIENCE: 10 years.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.010
AYELET OZ: 10 years?

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.640
And I'm going to rephrase,
how much do people actually

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.220
get for armed robbery, like
not what's within the law.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.075
The law says, I
think, about 10 years.

00:11:47.075 --> 00:11:47.950
AUDIENCE: Five years.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:49.810
AYELET OZ: Five years.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:51.360
Three years.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.610
OK, so as you can see, we
can throw hands around.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.856
People actually don't
know what the punishment

00:11:56.856 --> 00:11:57.730
for armed robbery is.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.580
I'm actually a criminal
justice lawyer, and in order

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.490
to see what the punishment--

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:04.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.040
AYELET OZ: Yes,
so actually, OK, I

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.010
need to get my case law
right, you know, the trends.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.480
People don't actually know.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.930
There is some kind of like
common understanding, which

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.140
is many times wrong about
how much people get,

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.110
and most necessarily when
the law is changed, you know,

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:23.710
because again there was this
guy who robbed the elderly

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.450
and now we're going to
double the sentence,

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:28.810
there's no reason that
potential criminals would

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:30.410
know what the punishment is.

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:32.140
So this is another
reason why it does not

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.480
affect their decision making.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.130
And they'll never
catch me, is actually

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.360
something we discovered.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:38.860
Yeah?

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.651
AUDIENCE: I think it's
not necessarily true

00:12:40.651 --> 00:12:43.540
because a lot of people
who perform armed robbery

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.225
are part of street
gangs, and they know what

00:12:46.225 --> 00:12:48.580
sentences their friends get.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.410
AYELET OZ: Let's take
the street gangs.

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.960
Even if they do
know, and generally

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.990
like organized crime
and such, the idea

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:58.420
is that they become
a member of a gang,

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.910
not because they enjoy,
usually, armed robbery,

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.500
but because of the social
tension that [INAUDIBLE] them,

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:10.150
because the organization pays
for them and for the families,

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:15.520
meaning that the total
reasons that lead them

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.400
to those armed
robberies and such

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:22.120
is far more complex than what
is the punishment for it.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.190
Actually, what the
punishment for it

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:27.970
is somewhere so low in the
decision making mechanism,

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:33.040
so to use this as our main
tool for fighting crime

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:38.000
is actually not
effective, most of all.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:38.500
Yeah.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.590
AUDIENCE: Question, is there
a difference between offenses

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:47.620
where there is a big difference
between the punishment as

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.550
described by the law and
the actual punishment,

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:53.570
which is trends by
case law rather than

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:58.530
where the case law follows
strictly or almost completely

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.360
with the legislated punishment?

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.060
AYELET OZ: Actually, in
the vast majority of cases

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.840
there's a huge difference
between what's ascribed in law

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.989
and what is actually
given, and it's actually

00:14:09.989 --> 00:14:10.780
part of the system.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.000
The sentences are
maximum sentences

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.240
except for when there
are mandatory minimums.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.990
Mandatory minimums are still
heavily used in the US,

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:23.380
and they are a
considerable reason

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.640
for what we saw in the
incarceration crisis.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.910
And there are a lot of problems
with mandatory minimums,

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:34.570
but in this case, in
like this spectrum,

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:38.600
they do raise the
certainty of punishment,

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:45.550
but they have like a lot of
problems that would make us not

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:46.840
want to use them.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:52.210
Like one thing, they
promote guilty pleas.

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:55.010
So if I can, you know,
plea something else,

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.070
even if I didn't do it, only to
escape the mandatory minimum,

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:00.910
I will do it, because
if I do go to court,

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.490
I might get the
mandatory minimum,

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:05.140
and there are a lot
of other problems

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.515
with mandatory
minimums, but they

00:15:06.515 --> 00:15:08.360
do solve this specific problem.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:08.920
Yeah?

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.200
AUDIENCE: Are there
mandatory minimums in Israel.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.075
AYELET OZ: There are.

00:15:12.075 --> 00:15:14.500
There are a few, actually,
like back a decade ago,

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.850
there was this huge trend.

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:18.280
Like everything got
mandatory minimums.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.080
But actually,
there's case law that

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:26.050
says that you can put the
mandatory minimum on like,

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:30.010
to be served only if
he does another crime,

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:32.470
or as civil work.

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:35.665
So there are all kinds of ways
that case law kind of like

00:15:35.665 --> 00:15:39.900
tried to move the
mandatory minimums around.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.310
So they are not as
harsh as in the US,

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:46.330
and actually, nowadays the
trend kind of went down,

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.480
I think a lot because of
the problem of guilty pleas,

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.810
and because they saw that
mandatory minimums kind

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:57.620
of distort the system and
the play between the parties.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.420
So now they don't
use it that much,

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.670
although they could come back.

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:03.190
Like it's a running
trend, we can call it.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:10.210
But then, OK, a bit to what
this guy was saying, OK

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:11.150
so what happened.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.420
OK, but we can't
stop sending people

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:16.270
to prison because the crime
rates will go off the roof.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.570
And here, we actually have
the really interesting example

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:21.010
of Finland.

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.800
And like just to put
Finland in perspective,

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:30.670
this is more or less the
incarceration rate in Europe.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:34.930
So we have over here the
former Soviet Union, which

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:38.170
uses incarceration quite a bit.

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.700
This is Eastern
Europe, Western Europe,

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.256
and these are the
Nordic countries.

00:16:42.256 --> 00:16:43.630
As you can see,
as we always say,

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:45.880
the Nordic counties
are really nice.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.120
They don't use prison a lot.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.960
They just hug over there
all the time, you know.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.500
It's a really lovely
place to live.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.720
So as you can see, all
the Nordic countries

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:58.990
use prison in quite a low rate.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.780
And they use a lot of
alternatives to incarceration.

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.329
They actually have a
really nice system.

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:10.480
But Finland was not as nice
as it went up until '90s.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.470
So you could see, if we zoom
in on the Nordic countries,

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:17.619
you could see that Finland
had in comparison quite

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:20.260
a large incarceration rate.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:25.839
So if they had somewhere
around 60 people per 1000,

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:31.150
Finland had nearly 200
per 1,000 population,

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.840
and then it had this
big prison reform,

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:40.270
and went down and became as nice
as the other Nordic countries.

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:45.370
And you would expect, OK, if
we reduce by 2/3 our prison

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:48.272
population, OK, the crime
must go off the roof,

00:17:48.272 --> 00:17:50.170
right And what we
see is actually,

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.510
there is an increase
in the crime

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:58.000
rate in the Nordic countries
ever since the '50s to now,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.750
but what we can see, Finland is
somewhere here in the middle,

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:04.240
it does not jump up
more than everyone else.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:08.980
Like, it reduced its
prison population by 2/3,

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:12.640
but the rise in crime
was similar to all

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.600
the other countries
who never had those.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:20.200
So you can see, I think
it's a very strong example

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:26.080
to show that there really
is no logical connection

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.640
between the use of the prison
sentence and the crime rate.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.372
Yeah?

00:18:30.372 --> 00:18:37.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
number of prisoners [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.330
population and the
other is percentage

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:44.610
of crime of sentences
that are imprisonment

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:47.250
because in one case
for this metric,

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.770
you have an effect of
prior incarceration,

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:54.550
but people who were
incarcerated in, I don't know,

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:58.550
1940s or something, they
could get out of prison,

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:02.990
but since people are not
put in prison anymore,

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:04.702
I think it's two
different metrics.

00:19:04.702 --> 00:19:06.660
AYELET OZ: OK, these are
two different metrics.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.319
What can you study
from this to this?

00:19:09.319 --> 00:19:10.860
Like these are two
different metrics.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.000
They don't need to combine.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.958
And I do agree these are
two different metrics.

00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:17.850
What I'm saying is that
you would expect the crime

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:21.270
rate in Finland to behave very
differently than the crime

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:22.740
rate in the other countries.

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:28.200
So because they had this really
major reform, and what you see

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.797
is not that change.

00:19:29.797 --> 00:19:32.130
This is what I'm trying to
make out of these graphs, not

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.790
more than that.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:34.800
Yeah?

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.492
AUDIENCE: What about Singapore?

00:19:37.492 --> 00:19:42.723
I understand that in there
the punishment is severe

00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:45.300
and the crime is really down.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.250
AYELET OZ: I must
admit I don't know,

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:49.770
so I don't want to
just make up things,

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:52.770
but what we do see many
times and we're not

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:56.520
going to get there, that the
reasons for why there isn't

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.620
or there is no
crime are actually

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.710
much wider than the
criminal justice system.

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:06.990
So for example, if you
have a welfare state,

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:09.640
the crime rates are lower, and
it's because of the welfare.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.736
It's not because of how much
people they put in prison.

00:20:12.736 --> 00:20:13.610
Yeah?

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:18.200
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering about
this measure of crime rates.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.630
Imagine that you, with your
scooter riding on the sidewalk,

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:25.786
it would not be counted there,
unless you were caught, maybe,

00:20:25.786 --> 00:20:27.760
and then you have to
pay the fine and so on.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.360
But people are riding on
the sidewalk all the time,

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.795
and I doubt that
most of them are here

00:20:32.795 --> 00:20:34.260
in Israel's crime rate.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:40.590
AYELET OZ: There is a somewhat
stable rate of how much people

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.480
report certain crimes.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:47.700
So for some crimes, we have
virtually 100% report rate,

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.340
homicides, things that
have to do with insurance.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:54.370
For example, if your
apartment got broken into,

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:57.600
because you need the insurance
it's virtually close to 100%.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:03.600
We have other areas in which
there's a very low report rate.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:07.410
For example, if your bikes
get stolen, in most times,

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.395
actually going to the
police would do nothing.

00:21:09.395 --> 00:21:11.520
And unless you actually
want it for your insurance,

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.320
you won't do it.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.060
There's a big
question, for example,

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:19.170
about sex felonies,
how much is there

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:21.190
versus how much is reported.

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:26.770
But for all of these, the
report rate is pretty stable.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:30.270
So for example, if this
goes up or this goes down

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:34.190
will not tell us how much crime
there really is in a country.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.830
It differs.

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:36.940
Like the report rate
differs between countries.

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.690
The more you trust the
police, you'll report more.

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:41.250
But it does tell
you, does it go up

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:45.690
or does it go down,
because there's no reason

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:49.750
to believe that the report rate
had changed so dramatically,

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:51.210
especially not in this country.

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:55.635
Like there wasn't
a big, like down

00:21:55.635 --> 00:21:58.780
rate or up rate in how much
you believe the police.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:21:59.330
Yeah?

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:04.980
AUDIENCE: Let's say that car
theft is highly reported.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:10.170
Since the 1950s, there is
also more cars in society.

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:13.170
AYELET OZ: Yeah, but again, once
you put everything together.

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:16.480
So yeah, kinds of
crime do change.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.830
But in the meaning
of the overall trend,

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:23.810
it gives you, even if you can't
say, oh, well we have 10,000,

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:28.240
and you know, really put
some essence in this number,

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:31.020
the trends do give
you the picture.

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.605
There were other?

00:22:32.605 --> 00:22:33.105
OK.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.650
And now I want to stop
talking about international

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:43.340
comparisons, and now
I want to give you

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:47.060
a bit of who are the
people in prison in Israel.

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.820
Like when you think of people
in prison, what you usually

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:55.040
think about are
the sex felonies,

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.980
you think about, our
nice armed robber, you

00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:59.360
think about homicide.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.400
But the vast
majority of prisoners

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.100
are actually in very
short prison sentences.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:07.820
So as you can see--

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:11.000
I thought I had
the numbers, but I

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.830
think the common number is
that about 75% of prisoners

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:19.880
are up to two years in
prison, and everybody else

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.520
are in the long tail.

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.120
So when we talk about
the use of prison,

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:33.920
we usually imagine those
very serious felonies,

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.780
but the people who are
actually going into prison

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:42.950
are most of the time for
medium range felonies.

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:44.630
So if it's a really
low felony, you

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:46.770
will usually not go to prison.

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:49.820
But kind of like
the medium range

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:53.480
is the vast majority of people
in prison who just change.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:58.130
So one problem with
the prison sentence

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:03.140
is that it has what we call the
criminogenic effect, meaning

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:08.390
if there's one thing that will
determine if someone will go

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:12.080
to prison again, yes or not, is
the question, was he in prison

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:12.840
before.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:18.410
People who were in prison
to a vastly larger ratio

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:23.060
go back to prison, and
there are a few explanations

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:26.060
to why this is
happening, one of which

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.300
is that people are getting
accustomed to prison,

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.920
meaning once you've been
to prison for, let's say,

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:35.030
six months, you're not as scared
of it as people who come out.

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:38.690
We actually have this really
big problem with minors,

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:41.630
meaning a minor who was
arrested, for the first three

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:45.530
days, let's say two weeks,
he will do everything

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:46.940
to go out of prison.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:51.890
He will agree to go to
rehabilitation plans.

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:55.530
He will agree to take all
kind of restrictions and such.

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:57.800
But after he's been like a
month and a half in prison,

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.710
oh, you know, you get
accustomed to stuff.

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:03.950
And prison, actually, you
know, you could live in there.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:06.750
No one is asking
you to do anything,

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:09.810
you've got your friends,
and OK, well, I'm

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:11.930
not going to go to rehab now.

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:13.670
Rehab is hard.

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:16.910
And it's actually a great
problem with minors, but also

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:18.300
with adults.

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:22.730
People get accustomed to
prison, and in prison they

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:26.930
get a network of other
people who are criminals,

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:30.710
and many times they
get disconnected

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:36.800
from the previous environment,
from the previous community,

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.930
and this is the only
community they know.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:42.020
They have a really
hard time going back

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:46.790
to society in regards
to work, to employment,

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:48.410
to finding an apartment.

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:50.180
So all of these
things actually do

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:51.600
what we call the rotating door.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.280
They put people back to
prison basically because they

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:59.090
have nothing else to look for
outside once they're going out

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.200
of prison.

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:04.130
So we do have a really
important mission

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:09.140
to try to prevent those
short time sentences,

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.440
because I think we can all agree
that if someone, I don't know,

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:16.100
raped a woman, he
should be in prison.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:19.935
Actually, like in most
cases, it won't be debatable.

00:26:19.935 --> 00:26:21.870
AUDIENCE: So what crimes
are we talking about?

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:29.830
AYELET OZ: We're talking about
breaking into apartments,

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:31.700
like in small numbers.

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:37.160
We're talking about
drug felonies.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:43.430
We're talking about battery and
assault in a really low key.

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:46.690
We're talking about
slightly larger theft.

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:49.730
So this is like really
low violence act

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:56.030
or mediocre property felonies,
basically, and drug felonies.

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:56.530
Yeah?

00:26:56.530 --> 00:27:00.475
AUDIENCE: Isn't like just
the fact of getting convicted

00:27:00.475 --> 00:27:02.170
enough to put you
into this cycle,

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:04.610
even without going to prison?

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:06.480
AYELET OZ: No, not
to the same extent.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.230
I mean, yes, and we'll
talk about alternatives

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:11.720
to the criminal process.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:15.930
There is some problem
when you get convicted.

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:19.820
So it has some of these effects,
but the effects of taking you

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:24.140
out of the community, of
isolating you, and making you

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:27.350
like recreate your
sense of identity,

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:29.270
this happens to a
large extent in prison

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:31.700
and will not happen if you
still live with your family,

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.650
if you still go to work
and all these things.

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:37.750
So the concept of
isolating you is

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:42.520
one of the harsher
effects of prison.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:46.460
Like this is the huge
amount of the punishment,

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:50.770
and it's also the one
thing that has the most

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:54.100
effect on what happens next.

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:58.390
So actually, yeah, so
I'm going to go back

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:00.920
to the money in a second.

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:04.600
So there was actually this
very important committee,

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:11.749
you said, in 2015, led by the
Supreme Justice Dalia Dorner.

00:28:11.749 --> 00:28:13.540
And this why it's called
the Dorner report.

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:17.500
And it actually tried to
rethink criminal justice

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.040
policy in Israel, and unlike
most of these committees,

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:24.250
this actually like
really got implemented

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:26.470
in government decision.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:29.290
Now they are following
reports on how

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:31.490
everything should change.

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:34.660
But it really had
its wave, and it's

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:37.730
something that is very real
in criminal justice today.

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:40.180
It's not something like,
OK, let's take our report,

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:42.580
put it in a nice
drawer and carry on

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:46.000
with our lives, which is usually
happening with such reports.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.220
So the Dorner report had a few
very important suggestions.

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:54.820
One is, as we started
talking about,

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:58.240
what you think about
what happens in prisons,

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:01.870
and what works and what doesn't,
and data is sometimes very

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:07.210
different, is to try to create
data based criminal justice

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:08.170
policy.

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:11.410
So you know, if you're
a member of Parliament

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:15.130
and you want to propose
a bill to increase

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:18.580
the punishment for something,
first get your data right.

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:23.200
Would it help, what are
the specific attributes

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:27.550
of this population, all of these
things, how much would it cost.

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:32.350
So first, now everybody
following the Dorner report,

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:35.500
every bill in regards to
criminal justice policy

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:39.136
needs to have like this little
research on how it's actually

00:29:39.136 --> 00:29:40.510
going to affect,
and not what you

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:43.224
think because you
read it in the papers.

00:29:43.224 --> 00:29:44.890
Another thing is
extending the community

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:48.520
courts, which we'll
come to in a second,

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.370
to increase the use of
early release and parole.

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:53.260
Early release, what
we call [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:59.390
like when you go home after
2/3 of your prison sentence,

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:04.070
the rates of using parole is
actually radically decreased

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.570
in Israel.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:09.760
It used to be about like 65%
of people would get parole,

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:14.410
and now we're talking about
around 25% of prisoners.

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:16.210
And the problem is
that people tend

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:18.130
to see parole as some
kind of a reward,

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:20.090
like OK, you've
behaved nice in prison.

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:21.710
We'll let you go early.

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:23.770
But I don't think it's
actually the right way

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:28.180
to think of parole, because what
we do when you do parole is,

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.300
you get this, I don't know,
a few months or sometimes

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:35.290
a few years in
which you still have

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:37.170
large leverage against a person.

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:38.770
Like OK, you're
going to go to rehab,

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:40.640
or you're going to go to prison.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:46.020
So you can actually help a
person go back to society

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:48.500
like hand in hand and
one step at a time.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.860
So OK, let's get you back
together with your family,

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.200
or if this is hard,
let's let put you

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.390
in a rehabilitation center.

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:56.920
OK, let's do this.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.350
Why don't you go to work,
OK, and we'll follow,

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:01.300
and we'll help you
go back to work.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:06.730
So when you finally finish your
prison sentence and parole,

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:10.360
you can actually go back,
and the revolving door

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.000
will not be standing right
there in front of you,

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.670
because OK, you've done
it one step at a time.

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:18.370
While if you don't get a
parole, it's just like,

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:20.740
you know, at some point
your prison sentence ends,

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.360
and you just go out
and there's nothing.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.120
There is no support group.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.260
You have nowhere to work.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.210
You have nowhere
to live many times.

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:31.030
And you know, you just like
crash into the revolving door,

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:31.990
basically.

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:34.630
And I think one of the things
the Dorner report had said

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:37.360
is that we need to rethink
our use of early release.

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.230
It's not a reward.

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:41.260
It's something that we do
in order to protect society,

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.122
basically.

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:49.360
In order to reduce the number of
early or very short time prison

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:53.410
sentences, they did say,
OK, let's allow more time

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:54.550
for community work.

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:57.820
Now in Israel community work
is limited to six months,

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:00.350
and there was a bill that
changed it to nine months.

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:02.770
So OK, some of these
people can work

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:06.880
more time so we can avoid
those short prison sentences,

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:11.290
and the open prisons which
we'll talk about in a second.

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:13.460
And the one thing
that I wanted to add

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.490
was, OK, you know,
where's the money.

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:18.640
How much does it cost, all
this prison, and the thing

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.890
is it's really costly.

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:23.990
It's a lot of money to
put people in prison.

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:28.420
So if you put people in
prison, this is the first row,

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:33.740
it's about 120,000 shekels
a year per prisoner.

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:36.820
And if you take care
of it in the community,

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:43.480
meaning a hostel or
parole officer, et cetera,

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:47.048
it's somewhere
between 5,000 to let's

00:32:47.048 --> 00:32:50.980
say 50,000 shekels per year.

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:54.550
AUDIENCE: These numbers,
10,000 shekels per month?

00:32:54.550 --> 00:33:02.110
AYELET OZ: Per month,
yeah, from the prison

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:05.080
organization, from Shabas.

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.640
Like these are the
prisons' numbers.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:10.700
This is what they
base their budget on.

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.150
AUDIENCE: They
probably have to--

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:16.770
I mean, even if you lower
the number of prisoners,

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:19.020
don't we still have
to pay some costs for,

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:21.565
you know, the number
of guards might

00:33:21.565 --> 00:33:26.290
be, like not lower the same
way and for the facilities,

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:28.810
we still have to pay for them.

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:35.390
So I'm not sure,
[INAUDIBLE] overhead

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:38.621
in which you can't reduce if you
reduce the number of prisoners.

00:33:38.621 --> 00:33:41.120
AYELET OZ: I think it depends
on how much you reduce, right?

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.400
AUDIENCE: I mean, I don't think
to myself, like 10,000 shekels

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.080
just for food, for
transportation.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:50.410
AYELET OZ: Yeah, but you don't
need guards guarding you 24/7.

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:51.850
You don't need education.

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:56.440
You don't need a counselor.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:02.110
You don't need special people
to drive you from one place

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:03.910
to another that includes guards.

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:10.750
The cost of keeping a prisoner
safe, and going to the doctor

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:13.810
and going to his court
sessions, and not fighting

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:16.210
with the other
prisoners, and making

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:19.330
sure he does not commit suicide,
sometimes are very pricey.

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:22.360
For example, in a
maximum security prison,

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.219
those rates would go really up.

00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:27.850
Like making sure, for
example, an ex-officer

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:31.469
does not get killed in
prison, that costs a lot.

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:36.159
For others, it would be cheaper.

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:40.181
AUDIENCE: If I release
someone, then immediately I--

00:34:40.181 --> 00:34:41.889
AYELET OZ: It's not
easy, but it depends.

00:34:41.889 --> 00:34:45.400
Like you know, if you released
let's say 1,000 people,

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.317
you might be able to--

00:34:46.317 --> 00:34:48.066
AUDIENCE: You might
be able to close the--

00:34:48.066 --> 00:34:50.380
AYELET OZ: Yeah, you may
do, and that would save.

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:56.630
And actually if you look, if
you look at the numbers, though,

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:59.470
actually like if you
compare from 2010,

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:02.170
there was really a
substantial drop.

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:04.510
Like we're talking 2,000 people.

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:06.350
This is about three prisons.

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:09.380
This is a lot of money.

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:12.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
graph before?

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:14.245
AYELET OZ: Which
one, the before.

00:35:14.245 --> 00:35:17.040
AUDIENCE: We just talked about,
so we talk for 2010 until now,

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.280
so what happened before?

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:24.335
Like it was on the rise and
then started falling down, or?

00:35:24.335 --> 00:35:25.960
AYELET OZ: It's
complicated, basically.

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:27.293
Like there were a lot of trends.

00:35:27.293 --> 00:35:31.030
Now if we talk about like prison
history from the 1950s to now,

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:35.280
that's going to require
a longer talk, basically.

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:40.360
AUDIENCE: Of the 423
[INAUDIBLE],, does it include,

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:43.030
we have the education programs,
or just the maintenance

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:45.220
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:48.280
AYELET OZ: This is
basically the salary

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:51.520
of the parole officer divided
by the number of people

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.000
he can treat.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.540
So this is like if the guy's
going to the community,

00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:59.680
meaning he lives at his own
home and the parole officer

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:02.800
basically like manages him,
so that's the lower number.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.530
And this is if he
is in a hostel.

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:10.810
So this is why I said like we'll
take it from 5,000 to 50,000.

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:13.276
So there is like some
prisoners, you know.

00:36:13.276 --> 00:36:14.900
Well, basically, they
can live at home.

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:15.940
They can work.

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:18.650
You just need to make sure
they don't do anything wrong,

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:20.080
and that would be
the cheaper one.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.900
And some of them will need to
go to a drug rehabilitation

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:25.030
center, which are
very expensive.

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:28.840
But still, even in
the expensive side,

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:32.480
it's still much lower than
a prison sentence amount.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.360
Yeah?

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:40.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
aggregated numbers.

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:44.560
Have you done segmentation
by age and by crime type?

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.280
AYELET OZ: Crime time?

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.510
AUDIENCE: Crime type.

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:50.650
My hypothesis is that it
would be very beneficial.

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:53.820
Again, I'm just
shooting off my hip.

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:58.290
It would be very beneficial
for like youngers.

00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:02.910
If you decide not to send
to prison people below 18,

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:05.530
and then try to find them
some sort of army service,

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:08.200
like we can use the army as
a rehabilitation service.

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.536
Because it's like--

00:37:10.536 --> 00:37:12.940
AYELET OZ: It does
actually happen.

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:15.115
It's a major figure.

00:37:15.115 --> 00:37:17.320
AUDIENCE: My hypothesis
is that if someone starts

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.230
getting to jail when
he's young, he's

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:19.350
going to stay in
jail all his life.

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:21.497
So the going back, going
back and forth, this

00:37:21.497 --> 00:37:22.910
is the reason I've always
seen, like they always

00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:24.350
talk about the
African Americans,

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:26.530
is that there's problems
there, because in the US,

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:30.592
because it's not an ideal
place, and some places,

00:37:30.592 --> 00:37:32.550
some people discriminate
people because they've

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:33.610
got [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:43.010
The young African American get
easily into jail at 14, 15,

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:47.886
and then they became exposed
to all the criminals,

00:37:47.886 --> 00:37:49.740
and they become criminals.

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:52.520
So I would say like, it
seems like [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:55.762
for young people and
for guys that are like,

00:37:55.762 --> 00:38:00.641
I'd say on the border between
non intentional crimes,

00:38:00.641 --> 00:38:02.524
or I don't know.

00:38:02.524 --> 00:38:04.190
AYELET OZ: All right,
so first regarding

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:06.800
juvenile criminal
justice, there's

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.140
a huge difference between
Israel and the US,

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:12.380
and it used to be like
this for all the time.

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:15.080
In the US, basically,
for harsher felonies,

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:17.670
they treat juveniles
as if they were adults,

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:21.290
and they send them to
unthinkable times in prison.

00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:23.000
In Israel, this is not the case.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.270
In order to be a juvenile
and get into prison,

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:30.320
meaning into the Ofek prison,
which is the juvenile prison,

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:36.080
you need to drop out of several,
a long list of places before.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:39.200
The entire system
tries, and I'm saying it

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:43.070
like as a public defender,
tries its best in order not

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:46.670
to send young and
juvenile people to prison.

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:52.700
The amount, I think now in Ofek,
there are about 150 juveniles,

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:55.580
and these are all the juveniles
from the entire country.

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:58.580
There is a substantial
attempt in order

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:00.230
to try to rehabilitate
juveniles.

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:02.180
So I'm putting juveniles out.

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:07.100
They do go to prison only in
like the hardest, hardest,

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:08.270
hardest cases.

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:14.330
And in this way, Ofek in a way
is the most difficult prison

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:15.080
in Israel.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:19.400
Like the average adult
prisoner would be much easier

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.520
than the average
juvenile in Ofek.

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:23.990
So I'm putting juveniles aside.

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:26.450
And as we said, the group
that we're talking about,

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:30.290
we're not talking about the
killers and the rapists.

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:35.519
We're talking about this
huge amount of, as we said,

00:39:35.519 --> 00:39:37.310
it's not that they're
unintentional crimes.

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:39.710
For unintentional crimes,
unless you killed someone,

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:41.760
you will not go to prison.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:45.830
But if it's your first time,
or let's say, you know,

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:48.800
it's not your first time, but
it's kind of like something

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:54.080
that has to do with your
drug addiction, you could go,

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:58.700
like go back to seven months
in prison over and over again.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:02.570
But besides us paying you to
go to prison for seven months,

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:04.740
it won't help in any way.

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:08.180
So we need to rethink it,
not because, you know,

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:11.270
you deserve it, but
because it would be cheaper

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:13.910
and it would be more
effective to think

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:17.780
about it in other ways, because
just putting you to live seven

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:19.477
or nine months in
prison would just

00:40:19.477 --> 00:40:22.060
do no good, except you are going
down, coming down, coming in,

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:23.600
coming out.

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:26.750
And it could actually
happen a lot of times.

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:32.840
So now we have 10 more
minutes to kind of give you

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:38.270
some of these new ideas, new
ways of thinking that we now

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:41.780
have in order to think, OK,
so we have this young drug

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:44.000
addict who comes in
and out of prison,

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.760
and we're trying to rethink
what to do with him.

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.500
And now I'm going to
answer the question,

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.375
then we're going to see
this beautiful video,

00:40:50.375 --> 00:40:51.250
the community courts.

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:53.455

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:02.390
So solve the terms and
cost, you could just

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:04.880
have mandatory capital
punishment every penalty.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.846
You solve everything.

00:41:07.846 --> 00:41:09.980
AYELET OZ: A, it will
not solve everything

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:12.905
because it's immoral to
kill people for everything.

00:41:12.905 --> 00:41:14.280
AUDIENCE: That's
another problem.

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:17.742
AYELET OZ: OK, I'm adding
basic humanity in here.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:43.470
AYELET OZ: OK, so I'm going to
propose your idea of vicious

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:49.390
like a dictatorship to my boss
and we'll see what happens.

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:51.900
But basically, there is no--

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:55.872
Unless you go and kill everybody
for like stealing stuff,

00:41:55.872 --> 00:41:57.330
what you're going
to do is put them

00:41:57.330 --> 00:41:59.977
in prison for a long time,
which will not be helpful.

00:41:59.977 --> 00:42:02.310
AUDIENCE: And if I may, so
think about for example Saudi

00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:04.590
Arabia, where they
chop off thieves' hands

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:09.180
and they behead their
rapists and drug dealers,

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:10.920
crime doesn't stop there.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.550
It still continues, it seems.

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:15.630
They're still chopping
heads and arms.

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:20.410
AYELET OZ: I'm not
quite sure actually.

00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:27.040
OK, so one thing I want to
show you, and how may I say it,

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.590
I'm sorry for this video.

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:30.996
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:42:30.996 --> 00:42:32.120
AYELET OZ: What we figure--

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.450
OK, we'll let them
sing for a second.

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:37.420
- [SINGING IN HEBREW]

00:42:53.280 --> 00:43:01.560
AYELET OZ: The amazing
singer here, she's the judge.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:07.524
And the people singing with
her are the prosecutor,

00:43:07.524 --> 00:43:09.170
the defender and
the defendants--

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:09.800
[END PLAYBACK]

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:13.140
AYELET OZ: --in the
community court.

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:14.240
So as you can see--

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.890
AUDIENCE: You might want to
repeat that because that music

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:16.700
was really high.

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.890
AYELET OZ: Yeah, so
what I said was that--

00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:19.956
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:19.956 --> 00:43:21.830
AYELET OZ: Yeah, this
is how they're elected,

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:24.860
and their ability to
use the camera, right.

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:27.830
This is another main feature.

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:31.520
So the woman with the big
belt and the white shirt

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:33.320
in the middle was the judge.

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:36.680
On either side were the
prosecutor and the defendant

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.500
and the defense attorney.

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:43.400
And as you can see, they're
singing, not very good.

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:44.780
And what happens
in the community

00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:46.670
courts, which now
there are three,

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:50.470
and there are going to be six
by the end of the year, is OK,

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:55.460
we take our drug addict who
comes in and out of jail,

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:58.910
and we figure out, OK,
coming in and out of jail

00:43:58.910 --> 00:43:59.630
does not help us.

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:01.530
That's what we said before.

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:04.520
So the community
courts, they're trying

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:07.820
to use the authority
of the criminal process

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:10.430
and the authority of
the judge in order

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:17.300
to help people to
get all the help

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:19.940
they need in order
to be rehabilitated.

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:22.370
And they can be
rehabilitated from addiction.

00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:25.340
They can have a lot
of other issues.

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:26.930
That can be lonely.

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:30.920
They can have a lot of
debt they can't handle.

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:33.230
So once you go to
the community court,

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:34.640
which it's a regular court.

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.560
It's in the court system.

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:40.080
There's one in [INAUDIBLE],, one
in Tel Aviv, one in Beersheba.

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:43.430
And so if you agree
to go in this,

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:45.360
you get into a
really long process.

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:49.110
It's usually somewhere
between a year and two years,

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:53.040
very intensive, in which you
get all the support you want.

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:56.900
So you have someone taking
care that you'd go to rehab,

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:58.466
someone helping you
find employment,

00:44:58.466 --> 00:44:59.840
someone helping
you with the kids

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.610
if you don't have
anywhere to put them,

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:05.460
someone helping you with parents
guidance, whatever you need.

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:08.960
So every person in
the community courts

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.930
gets what he or she needs,
and there's actually

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:15.140
a really big group of
different professionals

00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:17.300
there to help them
do what they need.

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:19.490
And as long as they're
in this process

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:22.010
and do what they need
to do with all the help

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:26.200
they get, in the end the
case will be overturned

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:31.050
or they get like no punishment
at all, something of this sort.

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:34.460
So actually what they do
is they use the stress

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:37.620
that this caused out of the
criminal process and the fear,

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:40.670
and the fear that you might
go to prison, and all of this

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:45.530
in order to gently push you into
a community that supports you

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:48.080
and helps you try
to figure out what's

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:49.700
the main problems you have.

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:52.850
So another name for
the community court

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:54.680
is problem solving courts.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.840
So the idea is
that the people who

00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:01.430
go there like break the
law because there are

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:05.780
other underlying problems,
like the criminal involvement

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:08.240
is only the peak of
the iceberg and we

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:12.350
need to go down, figure,
OK, why was she or he doing

00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:16.310
what he did, and there's
actually a very good success

00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:17.030
rate.

00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:20.720
It's about two years old,
the project, so they're

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:23.660
only the first
people coming out,

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:28.070
and for now the recidivism
rate is really low.

00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:33.590
The people say they
trust the system,

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:38.700
that they trust the government
and the regime much more,

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:42.590
and people are actually
managing to regain

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:45.560
control over their lives
using the community court.

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:49.100
So this is one thing that is
happening, is now actually

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:52.670
increasing, so they will
be in each of the districts

00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:56.410
by the end of 2019, I think.

00:46:56.410 --> 00:46:58.760
Yeah, you had a question?

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:00.650
AUDIENCE: Who's pushing this?

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:04.670
AYELET OZ: Who came up with the
idea is actually a young doctor

00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:06.260
called Daniella Beinisch.

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:09.950
She studied the problem
solving courts in the US

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:11.510
and finished her PhD.

00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:15.650
She joined with Ashalim Joint,
which is a part of Joint,

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:19.670
and they joined in and
convinced the court

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:21.860
system and the
prosecution and everyone

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:23.880
to come along and try it.

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.720
AUDIENCE: So I guess my question
was, it went through the courts

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:27.680
system, or?

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:29.940
AYELET OZ: She is
an actual judge.

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:31.750
Like she judges other cases.

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:32.660
It's in the court.

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:33.618
It's part of the court.

00:47:33.618 --> 00:47:34.730
It's a regular court.

00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:37.760
And if you fail
out, you know, you

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.222
will be given a sentence
according to what you did.

00:47:40.222 --> 00:47:41.180
AUDIENCE: I understand.

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:44.590
Again, my question was,
was this something that

00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:49.150
came from elected
officials, or from judges?

00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:52.040
AYELET OZ: The idea came
with Daniella from the US.

00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:55.520
She came here and she actually
convinced everybody else.

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.470
AUDIENCE: Who was
the decision maker?

00:47:57.470 --> 00:48:01.190
AYELET OZ: In the end, I
think it was the court system.

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:03.320
Like they needed to say,
OK, we're going to do.

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:05.810
But you know, if the
prosecution would say,

00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:09.220
well, I'm going to go to this
sing along, it'll never happen.

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:11.370
Like the really amazing
thing is that she

00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:14.790
managed to put everyone
around the table and say,

00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:16.170
OK, we're going to try this.

00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:18.337
And at first, like people
looked at her like,

00:48:18.337 --> 00:48:19.920
I don't know, this
hippie from the US,

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:21.810
what's she talking about.

00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:24.680
But now, actually, like
it's something that

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:28.150
has really gained confidence.

00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:30.570
People really believe in
this and it's quite amazing

00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:31.130
to go there.

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:31.774
Yes.

00:48:31.774 --> 00:48:32.940
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:36.075
You said in the
beginning of the talk

00:48:36.075 --> 00:48:42.560
that there's no correlation
between jail time and the crime

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:43.790
rates.

00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:45.330
But you said there
is correlation

00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:46.996
between the chances
of me getting caught

00:48:46.996 --> 00:48:47.950
and the crime rates.

00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:51.720
So if we increase the number
of police officers and so on,

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:54.114
that will reduce
the crime, right?

00:48:54.114 --> 00:48:54.780
AYELET OZ: Yeah.

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:55.315
[INAUDIBLE]

00:48:55.315 --> 00:48:57.190
AUDIENCE: So I'm wondering,
why don't we just

00:48:57.190 --> 00:49:01.680
shorten all the jail
times, or instead of like

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:03.962
what you just described,
the community courts, it

00:49:03.962 --> 00:49:05.586
sounds really warm
and fuzzy, but if we

00:49:05.586 --> 00:49:06.800
took that budget
and instead of that,

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.383
we had more police
officers out there,

00:49:08.383 --> 00:49:12.540
wouldn't that do
much better results?

00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:14.250
AYELET OZ: Firstly,
I do agree totally

00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:17.760
that if we lower the
budget of the prison system

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:21.060
and put the money in police,
that would reduce the crime

00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:24.450
rate more, meaning we first
need, like a lot of crime

00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:26.820
would go down if we
increase enforcement.

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:28.020
So this is correct.

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:29.910
I don't think that
it would actually

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:31.740
solve these kind of cases.

00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:34.770
The cases that come to
the community court cases

00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:37.410
are mostly of repeating
crime that again,

00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:39.930
comes from underlying problems.

00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:42.390
The people, you know,
that have no money to feed

00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:44.460
their kids would
steal even if they

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:47.490
know they get caught because
they just have no other option.

00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:50.340
If he's a drug addict,
he will go and steal

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:56.260
because he feels he
has no other way to go.

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:59.380
So in these cases,
which are actually

00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:04.090
a large number of the reasons
that lead people to crime,

00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:06.690
the only way to actually
try and make a difference

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:08.510
is to try to solve the
underlying problem.

00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:10.710
If not, like you can
put them, you know,

00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:13.830
you will have less crime because
they will be in prison more,

00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:16.440
but in many of the
cases, deterrence

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:18.270
itself will not
cause them to stop

00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:20.250
because they see no other way.

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:22.893
AUDIENCE: Do you feel
that the punishments today

00:50:22.893 --> 00:50:27.410
for light crimes are
too long or too short?

00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:29.990
AYELET OZ: A, I think they
send too many people to prison.

00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:31.835
Like if you're in
prison, for me,

00:50:31.835 --> 00:50:35.060
it doesn't that matter that much
if you're there for six months

00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:36.380
or for 12 months.

00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:37.250
It's not the length.

00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:42.290
It's the effect of
putting you to prison.

00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:47.690
It has so much effect,
so much bad effects,

00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:49.802
that this is what
I want to stop.

00:50:49.802 --> 00:50:52.010
And I think this is more
important than the question,

00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:54.470
like do you put someone to
three years or to five years.

00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:57.480
I mean, for this person, I
guess it's really important,

00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:00.870
but when we look at it
as a policy question,

00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:03.650
I think this is what we
need to put our finger on.

00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:05.540
The open prison is
actually another thing

00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:06.830
that is just starting.

00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:11.060
It's really used
a lot in Europe,

00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:14.570
which we said one of the
main problems of prison

00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:17.150
as we know it is
that they isolate you

00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:19.537
from your community, from
your work, from everything.

00:51:19.537 --> 00:51:21.620
So what they're creating
now, and there's actually

00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:23.060
one going to be
created in Israel,

00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:26.130
it's building up right
now, is open prisons.

00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:29.210
So the idea is that, OK,
you need to serve your time,

00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:33.500
so you need to have some
restrictions on your liberty,

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:37.080
but you don't necessarily need
to be isolated from everything.

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:40.880
So what an open prison is,
it's usually, as you can see,

00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:42.380
here it's from from the UK.

00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:45.400
It's a nice little
neighborhood basically,

00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:48.200
and sometimes it will be
a building within a city

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:51.890
or two buildings within a
city, that people are there.

00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:54.680
They need to be there
in certain hours.

00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:57.580
They need like their
entire daily agenda

00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:58.400
is set up for them.

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.980
Like 4:00 in the morning,
you go, you have breakfast,

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:03.930
you go to work, then you go
to therapy, then I don't know,

00:52:03.930 --> 00:52:05.930
you may have an hour off,
and then you come back

00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:07.880
and you sleep at the prison.

00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:11.270
But the idea is that
you can maintain

00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:13.900
some of your connections
to the community,

00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:17.000
again, so when you
finish your prison time,

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.050
you have somewhere to go.

00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:19.990
So OK, you have your workplace.

00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:22.220
You've continued to
work the entire time.

00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:25.100
The idea is to try
to find a punishment

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:28.370
that in some ways restricts
your liberty, and you know,

00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:30.680
none of us would want to go
and live in an open prison.

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:32.060
It is punishment.

00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:34.550
But it does not have
all the bad influences

00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:35.990
that prison time has.

00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:37.590
And you say, well,
they can run away.

00:52:37.590 --> 00:52:41.960
The idea is that many
prisoners go out and come back

00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:43.280
and they go to vacations.

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:45.950
Prisoners don't run that
much as you might think.

00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:50.300
Like you know the
teaspoon that you're

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:54.290
carving your way to freedom,
that doesn't happen.

00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:58.100
Like most of the prisoners go
out to vacations, they go back.

00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:01.820
They know the price for not
coming back is enormous,

00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:03.470
and they figure
out, well, you know,

00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:08.390
I'd rather spend my prison time
and not sit another few years

00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:12.500
for an attempt to run away.

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:14.850
And this is what the
open prisons are about.

00:53:14.850 --> 00:53:18.800
So yeah, people might run
away, but actually the chances

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:21.860
are not very big, and the people
who go there to begin with

00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:24.570
are people with medium crimes.

00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:26.480
They're not very dangerous.

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:29.290
So it actually works very well.

00:53:29.290 --> 00:53:33.020
AUDIENCE: It sounds like more
people with financial problems

00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:36.590
will want to go in then
people would want to go out.

00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:38.060
AYELET OZ: Yeah,
well, as I said,

00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:42.979
I'm not quite sure any of us
would say, yeah, I know, my--

00:53:42.979 --> 00:53:45.020
AUDIENCE: If you remember
Mr. Micawber from David

00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:46.850
Copperfield, I
think he sort of did

00:53:46.850 --> 00:53:49.514
that in the debtors' prison.

00:53:49.514 --> 00:53:51.680
AYELET OZ: Another thing
that is happening right now

00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:54.830
and is pushing, let's say
pushing people out of prison,

00:53:54.830 --> 00:53:57.110
basically, in a
matter of policy,

00:53:57.110 --> 00:54:00.560
is A, the overcrowding
decision of the Supreme Court.

00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:06.330
Just last year,
Justice Rubinstein

00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:11.420
set a case law that said that
prisons are way overcrowded

00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:17.450
and it's unconstitutional,
so the state by April 2019

00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:21.290
needs to reduce its
prison population in order

00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:23.575
to fit the
overcrowding decision.

00:54:23.575 --> 00:54:27.410
So this is one reason why
everybody's in a hurry

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:29.270
to reduce the prison system.

00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:31.880
And another important case
law to know that kind of

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:36.650
helps this is an old case law
from 2009, which abolished

00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:38.850
prison privatization in Israel.

00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:41.690
One of the reasons that
costs, high rise in the US,

00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:45.980
was private prisons, and once
the option of private prisons

00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:50.270
was actually blocked in Israel
in 2009, it actually, in a way,

00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:55.490
stopped the amount in
which the prisons can rise,

00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:58.370
because it's really expensive
to build a public prison.

00:54:58.370 --> 00:55:01.670
So just like, you
know, there are also

00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:06.990
these decisions
that kind of help,

00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:13.910
that kind of support all the
criminal justice reforms.

00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:16.750
AUDIENCE: So let's give a chance
to people from [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:18.070
to ask some questions.

00:55:18.070 --> 00:55:22.756
AUDIENCE: So the graph showing
that the population in prison

00:55:22.756 --> 00:55:28.190
is declining, do we attribute
that to the Dorner community

00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:31.520
changes, or something else?

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:34.550
AYELET OZ: It's actually not
due to the Dorner report,

00:55:34.550 --> 00:55:38.030
because we saw the
decline a bit earlier,

00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:41.300
and also the implementation
of the Dorner

00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:47.330
report in like everyday cases
is just in its beginning.

00:55:47.330 --> 00:55:48.740
It's actually a good question.

00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:52.430
Why we see one major reason
is because the crime rates

00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:53.360
are going down.

00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:56.030
Actually, the number of cases
are going down in Israel

00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:59.180
quite dramatically, so there
are just fewer prisoners

00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:00.650
because there are fewer cases.

00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:04.970
It's more about that than
about the Dorner report.

00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:06.835
AUDIENCE: Do we know why?

00:56:06.835 --> 00:56:09.210
AYELET OZ: Well, A, because
the crime rates are dropping.

00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:10.504
AUDIENCE: Yeah, why?

00:56:10.504 --> 00:56:11.920
AYELET OZ: Why is
a good question.

00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:15.110
There's not actually
a straight answer

00:56:15.110 --> 00:56:19.270
because it's also a global
trend of lower crime rates.

00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:28.260
It has to do with the
population getting a bit richer,

00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:32.870
meaning a lot of macro
explanations, none of them

00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:34.010
that we can be sure of.

00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:35.540
It's actually a
really good question

00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:36.914
why the crime
rates are dropping,

00:56:36.914 --> 00:56:39.050
because it's also
dropping worldwide.

00:56:39.050 --> 00:56:45.470
So trying to explain it with
one policy decision or other

00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:47.120
is probably wrong.

00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:48.290
We just know it happens.

00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:53.444
No one quite knows for sure
why it's dropping, but it is.

00:56:53.444 --> 00:56:55.110
AUDIENCE: OK, then a
different question.

00:56:55.110 --> 00:56:55.880
AYELET OZ: Yeah.

00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:57.530
AUDIENCE: You used
to have a blog.

00:56:57.530 --> 00:56:59.600
I was a big fan of it.

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:01.656
You stopped updating the blog.

00:57:01.656 --> 00:57:03.240
What happened?

00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:07.790
AYELET OZ: Actually, I
forgot to pay my hosting

00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:09.770
and they deleted it.

00:57:09.770 --> 00:57:12.000
OK.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:12.860
AUDIENCE: Very sad.

00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:13.985
AYELET OZ: It was very sad.

00:57:13.985 --> 00:57:16.010
Actually, I also got
[INAUDIBLE] blog deleted

00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:19.820
because I forgot to pay
his hosting as well.

00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:21.710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:22.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:22.590 --> 00:57:35.290
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:57:35.290 --> 00:57:41.700
AUDIENCE: OK, so this
discussion takes into account

00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:44.620
that criminal rehabilitation
possibilities and everything.

00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:46.510
But I didn't hear
anything about society,

00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:48.990
which it expects of our justice
and especially the victims.

00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:51.340
I didn't hear the
word victim even once.

00:57:53.890 --> 00:57:56.480
What about their
need for justice

00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:59.220
and their need for
personal safety?

00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:03.920
If the grandma who
was robbed sees

00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:08.200
the one who robbed her getting
out or not even getting

00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:14.400
into prison, I mean, you
can tell her all that,

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:18.600
but in many cases, she
won't want believe it.

00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:21.698
She won't trust the law
enforcement system anymore

00:58:21.698 --> 00:58:23.854
and might not report.

00:58:23.854 --> 00:58:26.020
AYELET OZ: I'll try and
answer, because the question

00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:30.730
of victims' rights movement
is actually a large question.

00:58:30.730 --> 00:58:31.940
I will say a few things.

00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:37.210
First, I think that the
most important places

00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:38.890
for the victims'
rights movements

00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:41.320
are actually in the
more severe sentences.

00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:43.470
It's not about the
short sentences,

00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:47.080
because as we say, in severe
violence, in the armed robbery,

00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:52.060
people would sit a long,
four or five years.

00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:55.990
In sex offenses, people
would sit a long time.

00:58:55.990 --> 00:59:00.340
And I think our need
to address the victims

00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:02.770
is most important
in these cases,

00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:05.830
in the cases in which
the crime created

00:59:05.830 --> 00:59:10.530
substantial trauma,
sometimes substantial risk

00:59:10.530 --> 00:59:13.160
or substantial harm
to the victims.

00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:16.420
And I think that in
many cases, actually,

00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:19.540
criminal law reform and victims'
rights would go hand in hand.

00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:23.050
For example, I would say
that the government needs

00:59:23.050 --> 00:59:25.030
to compensate victims' rights.

00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:26.800
For example, what's
happening now

00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:29.710
is that usually the
offender is said,

00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:36.670
OK, you need to compensate
the victim with the total,

00:59:36.670 --> 00:59:41.410
like the maximum for today is
256,000 shekels, and you know,

00:59:41.410 --> 00:59:44.150
if it's, let's say a rape
case, they would put it,

00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:50.560
OK, you need to pay 256,000
shekels, and he goes to prison

00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:52.780
and he's broke, and
the victim is never

00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:54.700
going to see this money.

00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:57.610
I mean, even if you turn
the rapist upside down

00:59:57.610 --> 01:00:00.230
and shake him, there will
be no money out of it

01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:01.600
because he has no money.

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:06.040
And I think in a way,
putting the victim vis-a-vis

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:11.140
the offender is a way the
government can walk away from,

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:13.720
and I think we
need to compensate

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:15.910
by the government the victims.

01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:18.280
AUDIENCE: The victim
doesn't want the money.

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:21.280
The victims want to see
the criminal suffer.

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.580
AYELET OZ: Let me answer.

01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:23.380
No, this is

01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:24.210
AUDIENCE: That's why
we punish people.

01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:24.910
AYELET OZ: NO.

01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:25.540
Another thing.

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:26.170
No.

01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:27.095
AUDIENCE: They want retaliation.

01:00:27.095 --> 01:00:27.970
That's the original--

01:00:27.970 --> 01:00:29.500
AYELET OZ: No.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.860
Yeah, but the thing is that
studies and discussions

01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:37.030
with victims showed that
victims are many people

01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:39.130
and victims want many things.

01:00:39.130 --> 01:00:41.840
Some victims want to
see the offender suffer.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.750
They want them never
to go out of prison.

01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:45.550
There are some victims.

01:00:45.550 --> 01:00:52.830
Other victims do what we call
I forgot the English term,

01:00:52.830 --> 01:00:55.810
but the idea is that
they meet their offender,

01:00:55.810 --> 01:00:59.960
and what they want is their
offender to say, I'm sorry.

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:04.000
And what they want is some
kind of acknowledgment

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.720
of what was done to them.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:07.870
And there are actually
these arenas in which

01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:10.450
offender and victim can meet.

01:01:10.450 --> 01:01:12.970
It's done in therapy and
so on, so it's not like,

01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:14.890
oh, go meet them somewhere.

01:01:14.890 --> 01:01:18.919
And the offender says, I now
acknowledge what I did to you,

01:01:18.919 --> 01:01:20.960
and I am sorry, and I will
try to make it better.

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:24.790
And we have a lot of victims
saying, this meant more to me.

01:01:24.790 --> 01:01:27.280
And we actually have
this, it's a kind

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:31.780
of a well known story of
this woman who was actually

01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:34.870
beaten very hard,
and then like, I

01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:36.980
think she had like a
head injury or something,

01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:38.290
something really serious.

01:01:38.290 --> 01:01:43.000
And she goes and she meets this
young man who did this to her,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.870
and she actually understands
how for him, it actually

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:47.870
changed his entire life.

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:50.810
He got like 15 years in
prison or something like that.

01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:55.920
And she goes and she meets him,
and he sees what he did to her

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.140
and acknowledges
what he did to her.

01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:03.460
And she actually like kind
of keeps in touch with him

01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:06.670
while he's in prison,
and this gives him

01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:11.860
a sense of meaning that
he somehow managed,

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:15.040
not to make right but to
acknowledge what he did,

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:18.170
and she feels that she
has some kind of meaning.

01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:20.890
And this sense of meaning,
and actually yes, money, money

01:02:20.890 --> 01:02:24.280
to pay for therapy, money
to pay for a lot of things

01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:26.420
that many time victims want.

01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:30.596
And some of the victims
want nothing to do.

01:02:30.596 --> 01:02:31.720
They don't want to hear it.

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:33.550
They just want to move
on with their lives,

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:35.620
and actually, when
you actually talk

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:39.100
to victims or with
advocates of victims,

01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:40.840
you see victims
want lots of things.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.120
And there was
actually a few cases

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:46.282
in which like, you know,
the prosecution says, well,

01:02:46.282 --> 01:02:48.490
you need to send him to a
long time in prison because

01:02:48.490 --> 01:02:49.030
of the victim.

01:02:49.030 --> 01:02:51.321
And the victim says, I don't
care if he goes to prison.

01:02:51.321 --> 01:02:53.690
I just want to move
on with my life.

01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:56.500
So trying to speak in
the name of victims

01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:03.100
and assume what victims want is
something I really don't like.

01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:06.100
I think that we need to listen
to victims and what they want,

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:09.280
and I think that in
many times, actually

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:13.570
the defendant's rights and
victim's rights would go hand

01:03:13.570 --> 01:03:17.410
in hand, because in a
way, they are the two

01:03:17.410 --> 01:03:22.500
humans in the system, and
many times, looking at them

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:26.010
and what they need
and what they think

01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:29.480
would make them make
different decisions than what

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:31.393
the system would decide.

01:03:31.393 --> 01:03:40.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Criminal punishment

01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:44.180
would still be there, and it
would serve in the future,

01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:46.420
if he comes back and
do the same thing

01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:49.950
for some reason, the
only thing that changes

01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:51.470
is the actual punishment.

01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:54.142
It's not the conviction itself.

01:03:54.142 --> 01:03:56.100
AYELET OZ: But also, as
I said, victims' rights

01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:59.760
are mostly relevant to the
really harsher crimes, which

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:03.750
are actually a different
talk than the shorter prison

01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:06.367
sentence that usually
have no victim.

01:04:06.367 --> 01:04:08.700
For example, like in a drug
offense, there is no victim.

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:11.460
It's wrong, and we've put
people in prison for it,

01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:12.650
but there is no victim.

01:04:12.650 --> 01:04:14.263
No one is actually hurt.

01:04:23.787 --> 01:04:25.370
SPEAKER 1: So thank
you you very much.

01:04:25.370 --> 01:04:27.974
Actually, it was quite
fascinating for me to see.

01:04:27.974 --> 01:04:29.390
I didn't think
about it in advance

01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:33.030
that Googlers are engineers,
and they think numbers.

01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:36.820
And we had many project
managers who will automatically

01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:39.420
say, how do we optimize
the system, what

01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:40.410
are the flaws here.

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:41.790
It was very interesting to me.

01:04:41.790 --> 01:04:43.840
So thank you very much.
