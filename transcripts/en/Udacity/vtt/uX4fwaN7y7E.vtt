00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.550
Welcome to the assignments for lesson four. First, congratulations on

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.760
making it this far in the course. Hopefully you're really starting

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.420
to see your identity as a designer change and improve. And

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.700
in fact that's the first thing we'll do in these assignments

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.390
is we'll come back to that question we asked in the

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.670
very beginning of the course where we ask you to rate

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.500
your identity as a designer and a developer on a scale

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.810
of one to ten. After that, you're going to have a

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.180
chance to give us some feedback. After all, you are users and we do want to

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.360
know whether we delighted or disappointed and either

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.940
way, we want to know how to do better

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.750
next time. Finally and this is the most

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.510
exciting part you will take the final project app

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.440
that you have been working on. And add

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.550
moments of delight by leveraging the power of Android.
