[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.800
-It's really a pleasure to
introduce Robin Cotton to you.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.640
She is a molecular
biologist and biochemist

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.300
who is going to talk about
forensic DNA testing.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.190
She's now associate
professor and director

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.990
of the Biomedical
Forensic Program

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.140
at BU School of Medicine.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.500
Dr. Cotton's experience
with forensic DNA

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.650
began at Selmark
Diagnostics back in 1988

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.290
and she served as the lab
director for the Selmark lab

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.810
from 1994 to 2006.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.760
In that position
and since, she's

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.090
served in a number
of high profile cases

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.530
around the country.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.940
She's been an expert
witness in DNA cases,

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.240
about 200 cases in just about
every state in our nation.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.500
She also oversees the
development and implementation

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.590
of new techniques
for using the lab,

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.099
as well as participating
in this casework

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:08.160
and testifying in court.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.230
She is an elected
member of the board

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.330
of directors of the American
Society of Crime Lab Directors

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.520
and the lab accreditation
board for a four-year term

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.170
and is, as I said, now director
of the Biomedical Forensic

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.430
Sciences Program at BU.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.027
So please welcome
Dr. Robin Cotton.

00:01:25.027 --> 00:01:27.522
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.570
-Well, I hope my voice is good.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.870
There we go.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.190
I want to thank the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.040
for putting on such
a wonderful series

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.650
because I got to
come to the symposium

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.290
and it was, if you didn't
get there, really wonderful.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.150
And I would really like
to thank all of you.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.130
I'm amazed to see
so many people who

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.510
came out on a super
cold, snowy night

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.190
to hear about forensic science.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.060
So we'll talk about
that for a little bit

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.420
and we'll give you a
little bit of background.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.300
It's not going to
be hugely in depth

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.169
because we don't
have time to do that.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:15.360
And then I'm going to see if
I can discuss with you some

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.880
of the things that are
difficult about what we do

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.760
and some of the things that
are difficult about what

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.170
we do just because
we're interacting

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.650
with the legal system.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.080
I came to forensic science
almost by accident.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.330
I left a very nice, comfortable
post-doc at NIH in 1988

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.480
and went to work for a small,
private laboratory that

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.750
was in Germantown, Maryland,
a little ways up the road.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.580
At least the traffic
was going this way

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.700
and I was going that way.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.410
That was probably
the best thing.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.190
And I worried about
that for a long time

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.010
because I had left the
strictly research environment.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.420
And after a couple of
years of worrying about it,

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.740
I never looked back.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.180
And apart from my wonderful
choice of a life partner, that

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.490
is the best decision I made.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.920
It turns out that doing
the same thing all the time

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.100
can be challenging and fun in
ways that you wouldn't imagine.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.220
Now, these look
like maybe pictures.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.690
We're all seeing crime scene
and forensic people on the TV

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.430
all the time.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.570
These are actually pictures
of our students at BU.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.430
We do use lovely blue lights
as alternate light sources

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.310
to identify where there might
be a blood stain or a semen

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.490
stain or something else.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.710
People do stand around behind
crime scene tape trying

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.340
to figure out how they're
going to approach whatever's

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.970
going on.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.720
And that's our field space,
which is over in Holliston.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.380
And evidence does arrive in
labs in little brown bags

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.820
with evidence tape
on them indicating

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.480
who opened it on what date
and what part of the package

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.750
was opened.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.120
So all of that stuff
is real, but most

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.630
of the rest of the
stuff that you see on TV

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.800
is kind of not real or edgy.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.390
It could be very edgy, right?

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.920
So this slide is here
just to give you an idea

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.050
and give me a way to talk about
forensic science in general.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.330
The National
Institutes of Standards

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.810
has recently convened about
500 forensic scientists

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.700
and academic experts to
begin to write standards

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.520
for all of these activities.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.210
So you see on your right
is biology and DNA,

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.760
and there we have biological
methods, which includes

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.120
DNA and interpretation of data.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.260
And we also have
wildlife forensics,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.610
which is usually species
identification, but not

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.340
always through DNA.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:12.410
And so that little wedge is the
thing I know something about.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.690
At BU, we also teach
the chemistry things

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.740
which are explosive; firearms;
trace evidence, which is really

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.000
material science
applications; seized drugs,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
which are is this powdered sugar
or is it cocaine or something

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.180
worse; and toxicology, what
does this person who didn't

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.670
make it have in their body?

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.640
So those disciplines
we work with at BU

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.000
and we also teach
crime scene and a lot

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.350
of general criminalistics.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.390
There are, however,
these other things

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:55.250
that are very important to
regular forensic laboratories.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.620
One is digital and multimedia,
like what does this guy have

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.520
on his computer and
when did it get there

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.580
and what was he doing with it?

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.690
And there's also pattern
evidence, fingerprints,

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.200
comparisons of tool marks,
tire tracks, footwear,

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.430
things like that.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.990
And some of these disciplines
are not as sciencey

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.460
as we would like them to be
and that will be a big part.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:27.040
So right at the moment, DNA
does have standards and crime

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.210
labs have standards.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.240
We'll come to another slide
about that in a second.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.980
But technical standards
currently do not exist.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.940
There are guidelines in
some of these disciplines,

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.540
but not standards.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:44.080
So this activity at NIST with
this 500 or so people divided

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.660
up into all these
different areas

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.130
is to write technical standards.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.320
And in our case
of DNA, we will be

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.510
writing additional technical
standards, which are needed.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:01.610
So just as, again, an
overview, most forensic labs

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.860
are publicly funded.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.230
So in Massachusetts, you have
the Massachusetts State Police

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.200
Crime Laboratory, which
is under the umbrella

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.950
of the Massachusetts
State Police.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.800
And you have the Boston Police
Department Crime Laboratory,

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.970
which is under the umbrella of
the Boston Police Department.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:22.330
In addition to publicly
funded laboratories,

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.960
there are private
laboratories-- ones

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.830
that do DNA, ones
that do toxicology,

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.190
ones that do digital
evidence, and others

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.530
around the country that
may have other specialties.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:38.180
And in addition to that, there
are private practitioners

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:43.550
and consultants who are also
active in the forensic arena.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:50.240
And that kind of covers your
group and where they work.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.370
The position of
crime laboratories

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:57.660
under law enforcement
agencies is currently

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.700
being hotly debated.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:06.580
However, if you say, well, we
have a big pool of people here

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:11.990
who think that they shouldn't be
under law enforcement agencies,

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.190
wedging them out from
under the law enforcement

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:18.860
agency is a whole other
story because then you're

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.360
into politics and
people don't like

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.050
to give up the things
that they control, right?

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:28.340
So if that's the
direction we should go,

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.390
it's not going to
happen very fast.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:37.740
Now, another really good thing
is that most-- it's not 100%,

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.450
but it's close to all-- crime
laboratories are accredited.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:46.070
There are about four
accrediting bodies in the US.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:50.295
They all accredit to the
international standard ISO/IEC

00:08:50.295 --> 00:08:51.950
2.7025.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:55.290
Most of them have some
supplemental standards

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.910
that are specific to
forensic science like how

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.550
do you collect the
evidence, how do you keep

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:06.120
a proper chain of custody, how
do you write a proper report,

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.260
things like that that are
different for forensic science

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.730
than for some other activities.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.610
And as I said a few
minutes ago, right now only

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:20.450
DNA and forensic biology
have technical standards

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:24.390
that are required, and
that is because there

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:30.550
is overarching national
legislation from 1994 that

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:36.460
allows the FBI to have a
convicted felon database.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:40.570
And that database is
managed by the FBI,

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:45.020
and only if the lab is
accredited and meets

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.760
these technical
standards is the lab

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:54.430
allowed to put either evidence
or convicted felon profiles up

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.140
to the database.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.990
Now, I don't have any slides
about that database here,

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:02.170
but it's very, very
powerful because it really

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.730
consists of multiple databases.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:08.986
But the two major ones
are convicted offenders

00:10:08.986 --> 00:10:12.570
in one pile over
here, of which there

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:16.190
are around 11 million profiles.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:20.760
So we're not talking some
little tiny data set.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:25.060
And then over here
are the case profiles.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.760
These are case
profiles from evidence.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.580
And so if there's a
case that comes up,

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:38.480
it can be searched against
the offender database.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.310
If a match is made,
then that's a huge lead.

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.670
If no match is
made, it can still

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.900
be compared to the
other case profiles.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.540
And if it matches some
other case profile,

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.860
then you can connect
two cases and then

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.130
these two police agencies
can get together, exchange

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:02.030
information, and possibly
come to a faster solution

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:04.730
for that particular case.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:08.180
Now, we'll leave general
forensics for a moment.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.790
Let's talk about forensic DNA.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:14.500
In 1985, there were
two papers published

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:20.030
that really give us the tools
that we're currently using.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:21.970
The first of those
papers was published

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.460
by Alec Jeffreys,
who's now Sir Alec

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.210
Jeffreys from the
University of Leicester.

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:31.360
And he had one of
those aha moments

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.840
that scientists
sometimes get to have

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.730
where he gets off this
autorad, this x-ray film

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:42.110
from his experiment, and
looks at it and goes,

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:44.920
I don't know what went wrong.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:51.880
And then has the aha moment
of everybody on this film has

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.530
a different banding pattern.

00:11:54.530 --> 00:12:01.430
We're visualizing the first
individualization of humans

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:04.700
across all the people
that I have on this thing.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:09.730
It was a fabulous thing
because I've done research,

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.230
I know a lot of researchers,
and a lot of stuff

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:15.150
like that just
goes in the trash.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:19.130
And you just go oh, it didn't
work, let me do that again.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.370
And he didn't.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:27.470
In the same year, Kary
Mullis discovers PCR,

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:30.820
develops the method for
PCR, which revolutionized

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.210
all of diagnostics, all
of molecular biology,

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.890
and for which he received the
Nobel Prize not too long after

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:40.960
that because it was
such an important tool

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.090
and allows us to identify some
specific segment of DNA we

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:49.120
would like to copy, copy
it in an exponential form.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.180
So from two copies you
end up with millions

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.390
and then you have enough
mass of this material

00:12:55.390 --> 00:13:00.130
to actually do some chemistry
with it or test it in some way.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:05.240
These two things did not
come together in forensics

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.890
until the late 1990s,
with our current testing.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:16.160
But Jeffreys' discovery was the
basis for the early testing,

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.020
and that was RFLP testing.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:24.430
So what you're looking
at here came from my lab.

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.600
This is a film that was part
of the evidence in the Simpson

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.790
trial.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:33.040
And so you're looking at
these banding patterns.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.630
This is the top of the gel
and the DNA migrated down

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.880
according to size and
then the sequences

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:46.140
are identified
through hybridization

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.735
with radioactive probes.

00:13:47.735 --> 00:13:51.350
It's been a time since I had
to talk about one of these.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:57.570
But these were wonderful to take
to court because a six-year-old

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.330
can do this, right?

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:04.090
So here's one known right
here, here's another known,

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:06.040
and here's another known.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.080
And here's our evidence.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.130
Which one does it match?

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:14.650
It matches known number two.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:17.250
The evidence in this
case is DNA that

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:23.390
was extracted from a blood stain
on socks in Simpson's residence

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:26.290
and known number
two is Nicole Brown.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:32.120
So it's easy.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:36.320
You couldn't explain
it, it's not too hard.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.630
But that was then, right?

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:45.340
Now we have short
tandem repeats.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:49.230
And what we're
testing are 16 loci

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:52.800
and soon the labs will
move to testing 22.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.790
So the FBI sort of
decides on the panel,

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:59.420
companies make
the kits that have

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.990
the primers and the
[? TAC ?] and the everything

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:03.970
to do the amplification.

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:06.930
And what we're doing
with all these loci

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:11.770
are looking at variation
in the number of repeats

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:13.590
that we have in our DNA.

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:16.940
So in this case, this
allele has six repeats;

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.900
this allele has nine; the
genotype for this locus

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.840
is a 6-9.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.790
It's nice to see in the diagram.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:29.460
In reality, we're
looking at this.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:34.300
So the x-axis here
is molecular weight.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:38.150
So this is a locus
where the alleles have

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:42.340
been made by virtue of choosing
the primers to be smaller

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.390
in length.

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:44.580
This is longer.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:48.660
And this y-axis is the
height of the peak.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:53.750
Now, the peak heights are
informative and sort of not

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:57.340
perfectly quantitative, but
relatively quantitative,

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.480
which I don't have
time to show you later.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.170
But that does become
important when

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:05.020
you're looking at mixtures.

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:08.070
And so we have four loci here.

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:11.220
This one's heterozygous,
heterozygous, homozygous,

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.120
heterozygous.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.870
And then all these
four are heterozygous

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:20.620
and this one is also.

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.740
So that's what the
current data looks like.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:25.810
This is half of a profile,
but I wanted to make it big

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:29.050
so it would be easy to see.

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:34.400
And you might notice that
at this locus right here,

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.770
the two peaks are
approximately equal in height.

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:40.190
That's a good thing,
that's what we expect.

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:42.670
We have one copy of each allele.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:46.860
We would like them to PCR
exactly the same amount

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.720
and give us the same height.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:53.570
But we have these other loci
where the heights of the peaks

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:57.620
are not equal, and this
is mainly a problem

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.650
with the PCR reaction.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:01.510
It's more of a
problem when you're

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.450
using very small
amounts of DNA and less

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:07.030
of a problem with
larger amounts.

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:11.750
But what it means is
we have to understand

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:16.520
how big those
differences might be so

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.240
that we know when we're sort
of past the normal differences

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.210
when we analyze data.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:27.060
And so that's the data
that's coming down the pike.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.880
So the process goes like
this, and we're going

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.060
to have two slides of process.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:35.190
But ultimately, if you don't
care about the process,

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:38.680
you know that you get a
profile out at the end.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.080
So first of all, evidence
is found at the scene

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.610
and the scene is messy.

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:46.180
Now, I'm not a
crime scene person.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:49.160
In fact, I probably
shouldn't tell you

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.090
this because you won't
think it's so interesting,

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:54.920
but I've not been
into a crime scene

00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:00.270
because they're not happy
events and I never was really

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:03.020
sure that I wanted to go there.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.850
Just knowing something
about the evidence

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:07.510
felt like that was enough to me.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.800
It's like physicians,
you don't want

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:18.870
to know too much because having
the mentality that you're

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:24.870
going to get the bad guy is not
the mentality that you want.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:29.440
You need to look at that
data in an unbiased manner,

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:34.680
and so for me I was
never-- I don't want to go,

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.370
I'm happy with my position.

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:42.350
So evidence is collected at the
scene, brought into the lab,

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:44.360
and then you have to
find well, does it

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.390
have biological material on it?

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:52.430
And so there are relatively
fast-acting chemical tests that

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.730
turn a color or turn
black or something

00:18:55.730 --> 00:19:00.150
that says I
presumptively have blood

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:04.930
or I definitely have
blood or I may have semen

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:06.650
or I definitely have semen.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:08.390
And semen, of
course, is ultimately

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:10.960
identified microscopically
because you're

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.440
going to see sperm.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.450
And so at that
point, then you're

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:18.210
going to take a sample
from that evidence.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:22.030
You would always like to save
some portion of that evidence

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.480
for later testing.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.630
Because if you
don't get anything,

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:28.960
maybe you didn't do a very
good job and somebody else

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.280
is going to try or maybe you
don't have the right technology

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.100
today but you're going to have
the right technology in five

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.930
years.

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:39.820
If you think about the
RFLP film that I showed you

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:46.270
a few minutes ago, that took
about 500 times more DNA

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.350
than what we can do today.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:52.370
So if you didn't test it with
RFLP and you hung onto it,

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:55.050
you can test it now.

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.940
So then the DNA gets
purified from the evidence

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:01.760
in some manner, goes through
a PCR-based procedure

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.810
to say how much
human DNA do I have?

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:08.732
Because of course, these
are not nice, clean samples.

00:20:08.732 --> 00:20:10.690
I used to think-- everybody
in forensic thinks,

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:14.030
oh, we're the only people who
have all these messy samples.

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:17.510
But that's not true because
people in water quality

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:19.750
and all kinds of
other disciplines

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:23.320
have really disgusting
samples, as well.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.840
And so I keep telling
the forensic people,

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:29.475
you're not the only ones,
other people do this, too.

00:20:29.475 --> 00:20:31.350
And in fact, that's
important because there's

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:34.670
information in that literature
that helps people figure out

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:38.750
how to get rid of inhibitors
or other things are a problem.

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:43.150
So anyway, then you
PCR amplify your DNA,

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.490
run your capillary
electrophoresis,

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:46.560
and get your profile.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.050
And now you're all happy,
you have your profile.

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:52.080
And now there is a protocol
and a set of things

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.920
that you want to do
to think about how

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.720
to interpret this protocol.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.720
And we're not going to
spend a lot of time here,

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.360
but first you have to
recognize what's a peak

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.640
and what's an artifact.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.565
There are artifacts
in the PCR, there

00:21:04.565 --> 00:21:07.450
are artifacts in the
capillary electrophoresis.

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:10.730
Most of those are
very easily diagnosed.

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:13.980
You have to understand
when is your PCR

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:17.600
telling that you may
have lost some data.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.690
If you think about that allele
that was really short compared

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.690
to the taller one
it was next to,

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:28.130
if it got much shorter it
might join the signal that

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:29.710
was at the baseline, right?

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:32.260
So you can
occasionally lose data,

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:36.600
depending on the amount of
DNA that you started with.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:42.420
And then you have to think
about how many contributors do I

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.730
have in this profile?

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:46.430
It's very easy to
define when you

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:50.290
have a single source profile,
which is what we looked at.

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:54.960
It's more difficult if you
have two, but it's doable.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:58.130
If you have three or
four contributors,

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:03.210
you have now reached a
mathematically complicated

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:03.990
problem.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:06.990
So we'll talk about that
a little in a little bit.

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:12.050
And at the and, if you are
including a known individual

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:15.900
as a possible contributor
to an evidence profile,

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:21.320
you are required by law and
by the accreditation standards

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.880
to put a numerical
weight to that.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:29.100
Is that likely to happen
because that profile occurs

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.510
in 100 individuals?

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.240
Sort of like blood types, right?

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.070
Think about testing with blood
types-- 60% percent of us

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:39.640
sort of have O, so they
would have included you

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.390
if you had O. And
then you're like,

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:45.150
well, wait, tons of people have
O. But you're still included,

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:46.710
right?

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:49.560
So you have to put some
weight to that profile.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:55.230
Does that profile occur in
one in 100 million or 100

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:56.690
billion individuals?

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:59.400
Well, then that match
is pretty meaningful.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:04.710
But you cannot just say, the
person is included because that

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:09.550
inclusion could range from
range from being included at one

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:14.860
or two loci in a profile, where
that's all the data you have,

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:20.440
or it could be an inclusion
at 16 or 15 loci in a single

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:24.740
source profile, where no one
else on Earth is likely to have

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:28.570
that profile, except, of
course, always identical twins.

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:31.550
So in any case.

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:37.890
So I want to talk Just briefly
about persistent challenges

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:39.500
that we have.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:42.870
And one of the first ones
sounds like, well, this

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:44.270
shouldn't be hard, right?

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:48.850
Recovery of cells from
substrates and the efficiency

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:51.740
of the recovery
of DNA from cells.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.280
If we walk into this
room and there's

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:57.230
a blood stain over there
on the yellow wall,

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.510
how are we going to
get those cells off?

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:02.880
Basically, people wet
a swab and swab it.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.060
Well, that doesn't
get them all off.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.910
I mean the more
cells we get off,

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:11.450
the higher the amount of
DNA we're going to have

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.590
and the more likely
we can get a result.

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:18.990
So removing cells from a
substrate-- it might be a wall,

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.360
it might be a vaginal
swab, it might

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.520
be something else-- it matters.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:28.250
And cells, it turns out when
they're all dried on there,

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:32.280
they really don't
like to let go.

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:36.580
And then we have this
balance in DNA efficiency.

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:40.400
You can get all the DNA
but it's not really clean,

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:44.780
or you can get a portion of
the DNA but it's really clean.

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.970
And bringing those
things sort of more

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:52.320
together would be a good
idea and is something people

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.620
are working on.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:25:00.030
But those tools actually
can still be improved.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:03.620
We need consistent and
accurate interpretation

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:08.600
of profile results when we
have very low amounts of DNA.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.750
And it turns out
that can be tricky.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:16.920
And then we need prevention
of contamination.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.470
And I have a story to
go along with that,

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:22.360
which is not particularly
a good story,

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.290
so not occurring
in Massachusetts.

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:28.922
Triple homicide in a home.

00:25:28.922 --> 00:25:32.520
A defendant is
charged and convicted

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.910
and in prison on death row.

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:37.990
Now, I don't know whether
this man is guilty

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:42.390
or not but the scenario
is that some DNA testing

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:46.470
was done in 1999 with STRs.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:53.080
It's not super powerful, but
he visited this home the night

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.280
before the homicide.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:58.570
So now you don't know is
DNA there because he visited

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:00.050
or because he did something?

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:08.800
So one of the weapons was a cast
iron skillet which broke apart.

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.840
That's how hard it was used.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:14.450
So the handle of
that skillet was not

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:17.630
tested in the original testing.

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:21.310
So now the case is going
through all the court

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:26.870
proceedings and appeals that
go with a death sentence.

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:32.880
And in 2005-ish, they decide to
test the handle of the skillet.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.260
They test the handle
of the skillet.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.930
The handle of the skillet
comes up with a single source

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:40.210
male profile.

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:45.000
And the defendant's attorneys
and the other people are going,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.160
I don't know.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:52.130
Anyway, so they compare that
to the database, no match.

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:54.800
And they do something
that they should do,

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.320
and they were careful,
and they said, well,

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.840
we need to allow other people.

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.300
So they test the lab people.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.960
In fact, almost all
labs know the profiles

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.140
of the people working
there, which you can imagine

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.710
would be important for
chasing down contamination.

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:12.170
It's not the lab people.

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:14.706
The single source profile
on the handle of the skillet

00:27:14.706 --> 00:27:16.330
was consistent with
the court reporter.

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:22.810
The court reporter and others
in the courtroom handled

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:28.300
the evidence during the trial,
and now what you have is

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:34.070
evidence that you cannot
retest, or even if you retest it

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:37.960
and get something, that
something is suspect.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:42.610
I mean for people who were are
really looking for the answer,

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:47.860
it just kills you because your
opportunity for that answer

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:50.510
because they didn't
know-- I mean it's '99,

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.800
they should have known
but they didn't do it.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.800
They didn't do it right.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.950
So all of those things matter.

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:05.700
Now, if we go back up one
second to this consistent bit,

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.680
we know this is also a problem.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:12.050
Because the National
Institute of Standards

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:16.440
sent some complicated mixture
profiles out to a lot of labs--

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.570
not the evidence, just
the paper profiles

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:23.840
like the green and blue
one we saw a while ago--

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:27.620
and asked the labs to
use their own protocol.

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:32.970
So they had evidence and
some fake known people.

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:37.560
They asked the lab to compare
the evidence to the knowns

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.220
and write a report.

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.200
In the best of all
possible worlds,

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.840
right, they would get back the
same report from every lab.

00:28:49.305 --> 00:28:51.532
No, they did not.

00:28:51.532 --> 00:28:55.960
Not only that, in some
labs there were different

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:59.250
reports within the lab.

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:01.550
So now we really have a problem.

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:06.270
So I'm going to-- oh, one slide.

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:09.150
So this is just a
way to say, this

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:11.020
is the contamination issue.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:14.410
In my lab at BU, I
had a student who

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:20.360
picked off the microscope stage
10 cells, put them in a tube.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:24.130
We put in some reagents,
didn't really clean it up any.

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:27.490
We can easily
reproducably get a profile

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:31.830
from 10 cells in a
perfect clean scenario.

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:36.210
Typically, you're going
to use a nanogram or so,

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:38.670
but think about what
happens if you have

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:40.890
four people in that nanoram.

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:44.140
Now you're sort of
at low amounts of DNA

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.460
for all those four people.

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:50.560
You don't know in advance how
many contributors there are.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.050
You can't know that.

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:54.690
You can see it when
you get the profile,

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:59.190
but you can't see it when
you're handling the evidence.

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:01.470
Let's say you had
a sexual assault

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:04.810
and there was a
consensual partner.

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:08.440
Then you might say, well,
it's likely I might see three.

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:12.630
But there are procedures for
trying to separate out sperm

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:15.800
from the other cell types
that are in that evidence.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.930
Those procedures
are pretty good.

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:22.200
So maybe in your sperm
fraction, you might have two

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.430
and maybe you can manage that.

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:29.060
But you never know ahead of
time what you're going to get.

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.480
So let's think
about-- these are just

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:34.360
kind of slightly weird
cartoons, but they're meant

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.490
to make a very important point.

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:39.620
If I have one
contributor, one person,

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:44.030
I'm going to either have two
alleles that are the same,

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:47.540
that person will be homozygous,
I'll see a single peak,

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:50.540
or they'll have two different
alleles, they're heterozygous,

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:51.720
I see two peaks.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.390
That is not difficult
to figure out.

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:56.990
That's as easy as the
Simpson [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:56.990 --> 00:31:01.860
If I have two contributors,
I might have one peak

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:04.870
if both people are
homozygous for the same peak.

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:08.480
I might have two,
three, or four.

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.790
This is half of the
combinations that you

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:16.530
could have because you have
to just reverse them, right?

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:21.800
So all together, there
14 ways that I can mix up

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.600
the alleles of two
people for each

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:28.040
locus to get one, two,
three, or four peaks.

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.980
Now, you can in
most circumstances

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:35.230
kind of sort that out
because you might also

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:37.580
have more of one
person than the other,

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:39.250
so the peak heights
of one person

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:42.740
may be higher than the other,
than the second person.

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:46.210
And so in a lot of circumstances
you configure that out.

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:48.690
OK, great.

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:51.990
What happens when
you go to three?

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:55.790
Here is what happens
when you go to three.

00:31:55.790 --> 00:32:00.260
And these are just
sort of the basics.

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:05.996
All together, there
are 150 combinations

00:32:05.996 --> 00:32:10.300
of ways that you can put alleles
from three people together

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:15.120
to get one, two, three,
four, five, or six peaks.

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:20.090
You cannot sort this out
by staring at the profile.

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:23.260
No amount of staring
at the profile

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:26.000
is going to let this
come into your head.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.710
And yet, my lab
and other labs have

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:34.820
been trying to do this by
hand for a very long time.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:38.710
The concern is-- now,
I don't have a lab

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:43.400
anymore so hopefully I would
have fixed it by now, right--

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:48.150
but the concern is that when
people-- so this is just three,

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:49.840
imagine four, right?

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.440
That gets even worse.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.295
And if somebody in
here is a mathematician

00:32:53.295 --> 00:32:55.040
and you have a graduate
student and you

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.680
want them to do a cool problem,
I have a problem for you

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.180
because nobody
has really figured

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.920
out how many permutation
combinations there

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:04.640
are for four.

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.320
Somebody tried,
but they gave up.

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.880
I know there's a proper
math way to do that,

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:13.160
but I tried it and
I couldn't do it.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:17.780
In any case, now
I want to tell you

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:20.930
a very short-- I'll try to make
it short-- story about this.

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:26.630
And that is let's imagine
we have the six alleles

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:29.430
and we're just going to call
them one, two, three, four,

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:31.480
five, six.

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:35.910
And let's imagine
that the defendant

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:40.100
has alleles one and six.

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:44.030
Well, that profile has
alleles one and six, right?

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:52.480
But as it's pictured, nobody
in that particular combination

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.920
has the genotype one in six.

00:33:55.920 --> 00:34:00.550
It's the genotype that matters,
not whether the alleles are

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:01.940
present.

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:05.660
And that's what you cannot
decipher when you have three

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:06.920
contributors.

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.600
And I was reading a transcript
a couple of years ago,

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.540
and the transcript was not good.

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:18.230
And the witness is
saying in relation

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:24.980
to the defendant and the mixture
profile, his alleles are here.

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:26.400
Now, what does that say?

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.880
It sounds like she knows
that the alleles that

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:33.790
are the same between the
profile and the defendant

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:35.610
are actually his.

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:38.570
But she doesn't know that.

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:41.909
He might be a one-six, but she
doesn't know the genotypes that

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:43.449
went to make up that mixture.

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:46.205
So she's saying that, and then
pretty soon the prosecutor

00:34:46.205 --> 00:34:50.080
is saying, his alleles are here.

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:54.610
And then on cross-examination,
the defense attorney

00:34:54.610 --> 00:35:01.500
starts using that very same
language, his alleles are here.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:04.220
That is wrong.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:05.740
That is not OK.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:07.900
Now every witness
knows that they're

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:12.080
supposed to make things
simple for the jury.

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:15.190
But there's simple and
then there's wrong.

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:16.430
So all right.

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:20.320
Now we're going to leave
this because I'm getting

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.760
close to being out of time.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:25.700
These are new things that
are coming down the pike.

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:30.210
And of these new things,
they're all cool and wonderful.

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:33.710
The most important right
now is the last one,

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:39.720
which is software-- mathematical
modeling software which

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:44.220
is designed to model
the peaks in the profile

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:49.880
and figure out what the
real contributors are.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:53.960
That software works for
two-person and three-person

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:57.080
and sometimes
four-person mixtures.

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.170
It has limitations.

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:01.910
We all know what
those limitations are.

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:06.090
And the implementation of
that software in the last,

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:12.310
I would say, a year and a
half is really picking up.

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:16.120
So of the new things,
that's the most important.

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:19.050
And the others are going
to be very cool toys

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:20.280
and will help out a lot.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:24.110
But let's move on because
I want to do these things.

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:33.000
You could be as geeky
as you want at school,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.530
but you cannot be that
geeky when you go to court.

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:40.380
It does not work.

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.180
Now, there are a lot of
pressures on laboratories,

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:45.870
these are some of them.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:50.940
Crime laboratories have budgets,
they have personnel issues,

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:54.870
they need to do
high quality work.

00:36:54.870 --> 00:37:02.760
The amplification kits,
one kit to run 200 samples,

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.370
costs $4,000.

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:09.040
It's not cheap to do this work.

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.580
And when sequencing
comes along, which it is,

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:15.370
it's going to be
even more expensive.

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:17.570
There is no requirement
for anything

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:19.990
other than a Bachelor
of Science degree

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:22.720
if you want to do
this work, unless you

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:25.040
want to be a technical
leader, in which case

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:29.280
you need a master's degree,
which sometimes when

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:32.130
I'm granting somebody
a degree I'm going,

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:39.190
oh my God, please don't let that
student be a technical leader.

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:40.770
This one over here, good.

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:44.060
That one over there, maybe not.

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:47.890
Most labs do not have
dedicated research staff,

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:53.550
and so as the very complicated
things come down the pike

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:55.850
they are all going to
have some-- not all,

00:37:55.850 --> 00:37:57.970
but a lot of labs-- are
going to have issues.

00:37:57.970 --> 00:37:59.950
And some labs are
huge, they have

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:02.230
100 analysts or 50 analysts.

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:05.340
But some labs have four.

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:09.310
And validation is required in
order to put new things online,

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:11.430
so that's important.

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:17.070
Also there's no central
repository for validation data.

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:20.570
There's no requirement
for really serious

00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:21.790
continuing education.

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:26.634
You have to have eight hours
per year or something like that.

00:38:26.634 --> 00:38:28.550
But you know what happens--
you go to meeting,

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:30.880
you sit for eight hours,
you get as much as you can,

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:34.490
then you go back and you go,
OK, I've got to do my work now.

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:37.270
That isn't staying with you.

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:39.240
We need to have a
better understanding

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:43.210
of how errors happen and how
bias affects our judgment

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:47.510
when we're
interpreting profiles.

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:51.010
And we also, and I have a
great story to go with this but

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:53.710
I'm not going to tell you
because I don't have time.

00:38:53.710 --> 00:39:01.330
We need to do a better job
of connecting basic research

00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:03.070
with forensic science.

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:05.970
So the quick story was
I had a student who

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:10.070
wanted to work on a procedure
to see if we could get better

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:12.210
recovery of DNA from sperm.

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:13.770
So I sent him to the library.

00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:15.180
I said, go off, look at this.

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:17.580
Well, it turns out--
and this is my fault,

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:20.400
I didn't know-- I
mean it turns out

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:24.880
there is massive amounts
of literature on sperm

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:28.580
because people want
to have babies.

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:31.460
I didn't know that massive
amount of literature was there.

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:33.120
I never went and looked at it.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.770
And it turns out
that when you go

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:36.950
look at that and
all the biochemistry

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:40.050
that they now know in
developmental biology of how

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:43.450
sperm come to be has
a lot to do with how

00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:45.450
we should extract the DNA.

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:49.840
And now it was just
mind boggling to me

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:53.800
how I had ignored all
that information for such

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.100
a long time.

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:57.640
And there are many, many
other examples of that.

00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:01.070
There's a lot of research out
there that could be applied,

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:02.690
but those people
don't know anything

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:05.660
abroad forensic science
and the forensic scientists

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:07.490
don't know about that research.

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:13.340
And there's no real vehicle
to get those people together.

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:15.940
There's a guy on
the BU campus who's

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:20.000
doing surface-enhanced Raman
spectroscopy, which I can say

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.460
it but I can't do it, right?

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:27.690
It turns out he has a method for
identifying body fluids that he

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:29.970
may be able to make
a portable instrument

00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:33.070
and identify body fluids
at the scene and say,

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:36.060
that is a rust spot, but
that is a blood stain.

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:39.260
Let's pick up that
piece of evidence.

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:41.870
I don't even know how he figured
out he might want to do that.

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:44.860
But he called us
up and said, do you

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:46.320
have people who
know these things?

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:50.120
And we're like, oh, yeah,
we have those people.

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:55.340
So forensic science
is very public.

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:57.270
Partly it's because
you're going to court.

00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:59.970
So there's the Simpson
trial, the World Trade Center

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:04.030
identifications,
innocence projects,

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:06.530
exonerations very important.

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:09.726
Everybody's probably read about
Annie Dookhan, and thousands

00:41:09.726 --> 00:41:11.750
of cases.

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:20.640
She was being helpful to
the police, very productive.

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:24.400
And that lab, I must
say, was not accredited.

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:32.130
And shame on the Massachusetts--
I don't know who it would be.

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:36.740
The crime lab was accredited,
but this lab was not.

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:44.660
So that might not have caught
it at the very beginning,

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:50.440
but at the rate she was doing
that it would have been caught.

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:53.840
So you have good days in court.

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:57.600
Now you've done your
test, you have your data.

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:01.410
How things go doesn't
just depend on you,

00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:04.610
but depends on
all these players.

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:09.230
A good attorney on
both sides is worth

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:12.640
a huge amount because
a good attorney knows

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.740
what questions to
ask and they should

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:16.240
be asking those questions.

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:19.330
And the witness should be
prepared to answer them.

00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:23.130
The witness should be prepared
to not be defensive and treat

00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:27.860
the proceedings with respect
and understand their role.

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:33.350
A bad day in court is when
everybody is not prepared,

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:36.150
nobody's really doing their job.

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:39.510
Prosecutors will say to
a witness a, they'll say,

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:41.420
I don't have time
to pre-trial or talk

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:45.360
to you in advance and b, I'll
just ask you a few questions

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:47.880
and you just run with it.

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:49.280
No.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:56.400
That doesn't work because a,
if the witnesses good they're

00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:04.230
still basically on their
own and they may not

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:07.205
know what's most important
to the prosecutor.

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.940
You can't wing it on your own.

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:13.930
That is basically
the bottom line.

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:16.180
You can't be defensive.

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:18.680
It's your job to
answer the questions.

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:21.130
And sometimes the
attorneys are obnoxious

00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:23.090
and sometimes they yell at you.

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:26.750
I've had attorneys
call me a liar.

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:28.490
Yeah, really.

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:29.900
I mean look at me.

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:30.940
I look nice, right?

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:40.570
It's insulting, but you
have to set that aside

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:45.940
because your role is to
explain what you got.

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:49.650
And if you're all insulted
and you're all defensive,

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:52.310
you're not going to
be able to do that.

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:55.740
It's the jury, it's you guys
out there, that have to decide.

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:58.960
It's my job to tell you
what that data means

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:01.280
and be clear about
what it doesn't mean

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.420
so you can't misinterpret it.

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:07.860
Going to court requires
communication skills,

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:09.380
it requires a lot of patience.

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:12.780
You know how on TV it's
always fast and like that?

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:14.310
No.

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:18.370
It is slow as molasses.

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:24.380
And the attorneys stumble
over-- in attorney language year

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:25.990
doing loci.

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:28.630
I don't know why
every attorney thinks

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:33.480
it's called the loci instead
of a low loci, but they do.

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:35.650
You have to have
a lot of patience

00:44:35.650 --> 00:44:39.520
and you have to have depth in
your scientific understanding

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:40.660
of what you're doing.

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:44.000
It's not called on all the
time, but when you need it,

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.110
it needs to be there.

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:51.100
And communicating science to
non-scientists is difficult.

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:54.070
It takes practice.

00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:55.850
In the beginning, I
would write it out

00:44:55.850 --> 00:44:59.880
and then I got pretty
comfortable with testifying.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:04.060
And then we switched to
PCR and I thought, well,

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:05.830
I really understand PCR.

00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:07.770
I'll be able to just do it.

00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:10.790
And the first time I
testified about PCR,

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:13.440
you would have thought I was
speaking a foreign language.

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.850
I mean nothing came out right.

00:45:15.850 --> 00:45:17.260
It didn't make any sense.

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:18.900
No person could
have on understood

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:21.810
what I said and I promptly
went home and said,

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:24.490
OK, well you've got to write
this out and practice it

00:45:24.490 --> 00:45:27.780
so that it makes some sense.

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:29.910
And sometimes it's just hard.

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:32.420
Lab make mistakes,
people make mistakes.

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:34.900
You have to answer
to those mistakes.

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:38.230
You cannot just go,
it's not my problem.

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:40.340
If you have something
to say and it's not

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:43.070
positive about yourself
or your laboratory,

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:49.230
you just have to say it in a
voice that's matter of fact

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:50.570
and speaking the truth.

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:55.330
So I have one slide, which is
my favorite slide, because it's

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:56.790
a quote from Einstein.

00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:59.590
And I think it speaks
to lots of people,

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:03.770
but it especially speaks
to forensic scientists.

00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:07.710
The right to search for the
truth implies also a duty;

00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:10.980
one must not conceal
any part of what

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:13.760
one has recognized to be true.

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:17.660
If you have an inconclusive
result, that's it.

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:18.960
That's all.

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:23.080
If you're not sure, you say so.

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.770
If your lab made a
mistake, you say so.

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:31.030
A good witness will do that.

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:37.280
And it's a privilege to
be able to do this work.

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.210
It's fun.

00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:42.850
It's nice to do good
science and then find

00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:46.450
people who are excited about it
because the lawyers are always

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:50.020
like, this is super cool.

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:55.050
Testifying is mostly OK.

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:56.770
And thank you for having me.

00:46:56.770 --> 00:46:59.520
[APPLAUSE]
