00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.805
- [Voiceover] Many 18th and 19th century

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:07.241
Romantic poets were believers in rebellion

00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:10.027
against social conventions,

00:00:10.027 --> 00:00:14.648
express strong emotion, and
the power of imagination.

00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:16.871
So, spider-sense is already sensing

00:00:16.871 --> 00:00:18.219
something a little bit off.

00:00:18.219 --> 00:00:19.961
So we're talking about many 18th

00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:22.595
and 19th century Romantic poets.

00:00:22.595 --> 00:00:24.558
So we're talking about poets,

00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:27.797
so the poets were believers in rebellion

00:00:27.797 --> 00:00:31.198
against social conventions,

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:34.530
and express strong emotions.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.398
So, this is strange,
because the first part

00:00:37.398 --> 00:00:39.290
of this, we're listing
the things that they did.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.378
So the poets were believers in rebellion

00:00:42.378 --> 00:00:45.033
against social conventions,

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:48.666
and they expressed strong emotions,

00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:51.870
or were believers in rebellion against

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.587
social conventions,
expressed strong emotions,

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:56.629
so what's really troubling here,

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.404
why this feels off, is that this,

00:00:59.404 --> 00:01:04.037
the were believers, were,
this is in the past.

00:01:04.037 --> 00:01:06.220
This is in the past right over here.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.399
While express right over here,

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.020
this is in the present.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.854
So, the verb tense is off.

00:01:16.854 --> 00:01:18.610
We're definitely talking about stuff

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.143
in the past, 18th and 19th
century Romantic poets.

00:01:22.143 --> 00:01:24.140
So all of these statements about them

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.596
should be in the past.

00:01:25.596 --> 00:01:27.193
So it should be, were
believers in rebellion

00:01:27.193 --> 00:01:31.567
against social conventions,
expressed strong emotions,

00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:33.515
and the power...

00:01:33.515 --> 00:01:34.893
I guess, express strong emotions,

00:01:34.893 --> 00:01:36.241
and the power of imagination.

00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:37.428
So even this is a little bit strange.

00:01:37.428 --> 00:01:39.317
So let's just read the different choices.

00:01:39.317 --> 00:01:41.077
So we don't like it as is,

00:01:41.077 --> 00:01:43.455
so let's rule out A.

00:01:43.455 --> 00:01:46.728
It's unchanged, as the
underlined part unchanged,

00:01:46.728 --> 00:01:48.579
so let's look at the other choices.

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:51.249
Many 18th and 19th century Romantic poets

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:52.747
are believers...

00:01:52.747 --> 00:01:53.745
So this is in the present,

00:01:53.745 --> 00:01:54.789
but clearly, we're talking about things

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:55.659
that happened in the past.

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.771
18th and 19th century poets,

00:01:57.771 --> 00:01:58.816
so we're going to rule this out,

00:01:58.816 --> 00:02:01.230
we don't like this
happening in the present.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.237
Many 18th and 19th century Romantic poets

00:02:04.237 --> 00:02:07.871
who believed in rebellion
against social conventions,

00:02:07.871 --> 00:02:09.810
express strong emotion.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.053
So once again, we're keeping this part

00:02:11.053 --> 00:02:13.280
over here, this is in the present.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.579
Express, it should be expressed.

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.159
It should be in the past tense.

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.677
We're talking about 18th
and 19th century poets.

00:02:19.677 --> 00:02:21.371
So we'll rule that one out.

00:02:21.371 --> 00:02:23.949
Many 18th and 19th century Romantic poets

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:27.889
believed in rebellion
against social conventions,

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:31.755
to express strong emotions,

00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:36.550
and the power of imagination.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.241
So this is strange,
because they didn't believe

00:02:41.241 --> 00:02:44.085
in rebellion against social conventions,

00:02:44.085 --> 00:02:48.953
so that they could
express strong emotions.

00:02:48.953 --> 00:02:51.002
The meaning here just seems off,

00:02:51.002 --> 00:02:53.985
so I hope that this
one reads a lot better.

00:02:53.985 --> 00:02:57.758
Many 18th and 19th century Romantic poets

00:02:57.758 --> 00:03:01.183
believed in rebellion
against social conventions,

00:03:01.183 --> 00:03:03.353
so far, so good, past tense.

00:03:03.353 --> 00:03:06.221
The expression of strong emotions,

00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:08.415
and the power of imaginations.

00:03:08.415 --> 00:03:10.719
So this is really neat, because,

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:13.616
what did the poets believe in?

00:03:13.616 --> 00:03:15.276
They believed in,

00:03:15.276 --> 00:03:18.144
and once again, it's past
tense, so that's good,

00:03:18.144 --> 00:03:19.522
and they believed in three things.

00:03:19.522 --> 00:03:20.807
It's very clearly articulated.

00:03:20.807 --> 00:03:24.395
They believed in rebellion
against social conventions,

00:03:24.395 --> 00:03:25.754
that's the first thing they believed in.

00:03:25.754 --> 00:03:27.668
The second thing they believed in is

00:03:27.668 --> 00:03:30.408
the expression of strong emotions,

00:03:30.408 --> 00:03:32.393
and then the third thing
that they believed in,

00:03:32.393 --> 00:03:34.529
was the power of imagination.

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:36.352
So this believed, this past tense,

00:03:36.352 --> 00:03:38.768
this action of believing in the past,

00:03:38.768 --> 00:03:41.496
this applies to these three clauses.

00:03:41.496 --> 00:03:43.435
They believed in rebellion
against social conventions,

00:03:43.435 --> 00:03:45.048
the expression of strong emotions,

00:03:45.048 --> 00:03:47.484
and the power of the imagination.

00:03:47.484 --> 00:03:49.146
What was really kind of bothering me

00:03:49.146 --> 00:03:51.257
up here in the original one,

00:03:51.257 --> 00:03:54.401
this verb tense, they were believers,

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.618
and then they express strong emotion,

00:03:56.618 --> 00:03:58.556
and then the power of imagination.

00:03:58.556 --> 00:04:02.915
Is this something they're expressing?

00:04:02.915 --> 00:04:04.119
If all of these were things that

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:05.712
they were expressing, they should have put

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:08.747
the expressed out front.

00:04:08.747 --> 00:04:10.237
For several reasons, this first one

00:04:10.237 --> 00:04:12.257
was very strangely formed.

00:04:12.257 --> 00:04:16.214
But we really like E.
