A wise person once told me: laci, you gotta
fake it till you make it. It wasn't until

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.100
I got a little older that I realized that
was wrong. So, so very wrong.

Hey everyone, Laci Green here with a DNews
update! The data is in: Harvard scientists

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.580
have found that women who fake orgasms are
more likely to have cheated on past partners.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:31.580
My first thought: BUT SO MANY WOMEN FAKE IT.
Every woman I know has faked it at least once.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.000
A study out of the UK put the number at 80%
- 80% of women fake it at least half the time.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.340
For men, the number is closer to 20%. It's
also true that a good chunk of people cheat

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.470
- approximately 1 in 5. To understand the
possible connection between faking orgasm

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.130
and cheating, first we gotta take a closer
look at why faking orgasm is so common.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.550
There are lots of reasons someone might fake
an orgasm. The most common, it seems, is that

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.920
they don't want to hurt their partner's feelings
by saying.....yeahhhhhh this really isn't

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.790
doing it for me. Often times people mistakenly
believe that penetration is supposed to bring

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.250
about orgasm, when only a small proportion
of women have orgasms that way. They might

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.110
also be bored. Or tired and ready to wrap
it up. Ultimately, faking orgasm or pleasure

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.210
is about poor communication - the inability
to say "that doesn't feel good, I'm tired,

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.280
I'm bored" or whatever. Which is bad news
because faking it ends up communicating the

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.450
WRONG THINGS. It says "yeah that feels good,
I enjoy that" when it actually means the opposite.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.140
And worse, their partner has no way to know.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.690
So what about the study's connection to cheating?
Correlation isn't causation of course, but

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.310
I have a few ideas about why these two might
be related. Faking orgasms and cheating in

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.090
relationships can actually be caused by the
same things. Both can arise out of dissatisfaction,

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.590
feeling bored, not wanting to hurt feelings,
opting to keep up a performance rather than

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.710
have the challenging or awkward conversations
that need to be had about how things are going.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.280
And, this non-communicative approach can of
course be bad sexually, romantically, emotionally,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.340
and wreck havoc on sex lives and relationships.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.219
I think that the root of this all -- bad communication
-- is common in sex and relationships because

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:13.950
we really don't have many conversations about
what that sort of communication looks like.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.540
It's cloaked in awkwardness and discomfort,
shame, concern about hurt feelings, confused

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.230
emotions -- many people lack the language
to effectively say what they're feeling. It's

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.790
a symptom of a much bigger issue in how we
approach sexuality in the West. That's my

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.090
analysis, anyway. What do you guys think?
