00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.090
Let's say that f of x
is equal to 1 over x.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.150
And we want to think about
what the limit of f of x

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.910
is as x approaches 0 from
the positive direction.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.700
And to think about
this I'm going

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.490
to set up a little table here.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.680
So let's set up x and then
let's think about what f of x

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.740
is going to be.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.420
I'm going to approach 0
from the positive direction.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.620
So let's say we try 0.1.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.150
Then we're going to try 0.01.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.580
Then we can try 0.001.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.940
Then we can try 0.0001.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.700
So notice-- each
of these numbers--

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.954
they're all larger than 0
and they're approaching 0

00:00:45.954 --> 00:00:47.120
from the positive direction.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.790
We're getting closer and
closer and closer to 0.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.820
So when x is 0.1, f of x is
just going to be 1 over this.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.600
This is 1/10 so 1 over that
is just going to be 10.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.020
To 1 over 0.01 is
going to be 100.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.372
1 over 0.001 is
going to be 1,000.

00:01:07.372 --> 00:01:14.840
1 over 0.0001 is
going to be 10,000.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.320
So you see, as x gets
closer and closer to 0

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.140
from the positive
direction, f of x

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.000
just really grows
really, really fast.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.580
So what we say here
is the limit of f

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.460
of x as x approaches 0
from the positive direction

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.130
is going to be equal
to positive infinity.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.520
Or we could just write infinity.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.330
This thing over here-- if
we put something really,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:42.420
really close, so if
we say 0 point seven

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.820
digits behind the decimal
place, then 1 over that's

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.816
going to be 1 with one,
two, three, four, five, six,

00:01:50.816 --> 00:01:53.130
seven zeros.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.970
Did I do that right?

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.744
Here I had four places
behind the decimal, four 0's.

00:01:56.744 --> 00:01:59.260
Here I have one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.530
and here I have seven 0's.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.723
So you see, as we get
closer and closer to 0

00:02:02.723 --> 00:02:05.000
from the positive
direction, the f of x just

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.570
gets larger and
larger and larger.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.259
It's just completely unbounded.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.500
So we'd say this is
equal to infinity.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.100
Well, let's think
about another limit.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.637
Let's think about the
limit as x approaches 0

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:19.970
from the negative direction
of f of x, or the limit of f

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.737
of x as x approaches 0 from
the negative direction.

00:02:22.737 --> 00:02:25.070
Well in that case, we can
just make each of these values

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.980
negative.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.376
So if x is negative
0.1 then this

00:02:29.376 --> 00:02:30.500
is going to be negative 10.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.309
If this is negative,
then this is negative.

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:34.100
If this is negative,
then this is negative.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.891
If this is negative,
then this is negative.

00:02:35.891 --> 00:02:38.000
If this is negative,
then this is negative.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.900
And so what we see here is
that this gets more and more--

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.297
becomes larger
and larger numbers

00:02:42.297 --> 00:02:43.380
in the negative direction.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.713
If we keep going, if we're
thinking about a number line,

00:02:45.713 --> 00:02:48.160
further and further and
further to the left.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.980
So we can say the
limit of f of x

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.350
as x approaches 0 from
the negative direction

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.460
is equal to negative infinity.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.780
Well that's interesting.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.130
Now let's think about
a limit as x approaches

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.470
either positive or
negative infinity.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.630
So let's now think
about the limit of f

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.070
of x as x approaches infinity.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.920
And one way to set up this
table-- we can just say--

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.080
do a similar thing.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:27.690
x and f of x-- so if x is
10, then f of x is 1 over 10.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.520
If x is-- and I'm just going to
go larger and larger numbers--

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.260
if x is 1,000, then f
of x is 1 over 1,000.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:45.314
If x is 1,000,000, then f of
x is going to be 1/1,000,000.

00:03:45.314 --> 00:03:47.970
So you see as x gets larger
and larger and larger

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.950
in the positive direction,
this f of x now gets

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.106
closer and closer
and closer to 0.

00:03:53.106 --> 00:03:54.480
So we can say the
limit of f of x

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.720
as x approaches
infinity is equal to 0.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.780
Now let's think
about the limit of f

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.150
of x as x approaches
negative infinity.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.090
So we're going to
take numbers that

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.870
are more and more
and more negative.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.890
Well if x is negative 10, this
is going to be negative 1/10.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.802
If x is negative 1,000, this is
going to be negative 1/1,000.

00:04:17.802 --> 00:04:20.260
If this is negative 1,000,000,
this is going to be negative

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.120
1/1,000,000.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.280
But we still see that
we are approaching 0.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.320
So here, once again, we are
once again approaching 0.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.820
So what implications
does this have,

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.072
besides that we've just been
able to deal with limits.

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:34.530
And once again, I
haven't given you

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.030
a formal definition of this,
but it's hopefully giving you

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.241
an intuition as we
take limits to infinity

00:04:39.241 --> 00:04:41.240
to negative infinity--
actually this is supposed

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.770
to be negative infinity--
limits to infinity, limits

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.610
to negative infinity, or when
our limited self is infinity,

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.940
or negative infinity.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.060
So one, we're seeing
that we can do that.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.700
But let's actually
try to visualize

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.350
this when we look at the graph
of f of x is equal to 1 over x.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.480
So let's do it--
actually maybe I

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.000
want to be able to keep
looking at all of this stuff,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.190
so let me set up the graph.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.890
right over here.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.800
So that's our x-axis.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.980
This right over
here is our y-axis.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.280
And let's graph f of x.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:22.680
So we see that if x is a very
small number, if x is 0.1,

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.769
then y-- y is equal
to f of x-- is

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:26.060
going to be a very high number.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.260
And as the closer and
closer we get to 0

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.230
from the positive direction,
f of x approaches infinity.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.490
So it just keeps
approaching infinity

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.160
as we get closer
and closer to 0.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.920
As x gets closer
and closer to 0,

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.360
the y value just gets
higher and higher.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.610
Then, as our x value gets larger
and larger, our f of x value

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.990
gets smaller and smaller.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.240
So it looks something
like that it approaches 0.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.740
Similarly, if we approach x
from the negative direction

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.811
right over here,
we saw that f of x

00:05:59.811 --> 00:06:01.185
is approaching
negative infinity.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.290
So as we get x is closer
and closer to 0, our f of x

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.390
gets more and more
and more negative.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.720
And then as our x becomes
more and more negative,

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.370
the x itself becomes
more and more negative.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.090
We see that our function
is approaching 0.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.740
So the way I've drawn it,
we see that there's actually

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.090
a two asymptotes for the graph
of f of x is equal to 1/x.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.230
You have a horizontal
asymptote at y is equal to 0.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.040
When x approaches infinity, f
of x gets closer and closer to 0

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.710
but never quite touches it.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.550
When x approaches
negative infinity,

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.670
f of x is getting closer and
closer to 0 from the bottom

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.310
but it never quite touches it.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.970
And we also have a vertical
asymptote right over here

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.250
at x is equal to 0.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.870
And we see that because
as x approaches 0

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.245
from the positive direction,
y approaches infinity.

00:07:04.245 --> 00:07:07.430
And as x approaches 0 from
the negative direction,

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.430
y approaches negative infinity.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.940
So the limit here, at x is equal
to 0-- so if you were to say,

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.630
we looked at the limit
as x approaches 0

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.940
from the positive direction and
from the negative direction,

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.398
but we see that
they're approaching

00:07:19.398 --> 00:07:20.410
two different things.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.490
So we definitely have a vertical
asymptote at x is equal to 0.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.740
But the limit as x
approaches 0 of f

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.475
of x-- this is not defined.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.130
Why is that?

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.380
Well, when we approach 0
from the positive direction

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.421
we get a different thing
than when we approach it

00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:40.206
from the negative direction.
