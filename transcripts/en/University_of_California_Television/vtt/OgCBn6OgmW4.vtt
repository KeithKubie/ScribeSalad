00:00:00.716 --> 00:00:01.549
(mouse clicking)

00:00:01.549 --> 00:00:04.382
(digital beeping)

00:00:05.895 --> 00:00:09.450
(upbeat piano music)

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.450
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.923
Bipedal, naked, large-brained,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.713
long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
but still trying to understand ourselves,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.913
aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.883
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.683
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.243
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.893
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.940
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.693
understanding of the past.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.160
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.703
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.960
An exploration made possible

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.737
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:15.847 --> 00:01:19.847
(bright digital keyboard music)

00:01:21.235 --> 00:01:24.735
(upbeat electronic music)

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.713
- First question is from Marcus.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.510
Nature recently published a claim

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.723
that humans lived here in
San Diego 130,000 years ago.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:53.563
Is there any

00:01:53.563 --> 00:01:56.253
genetic evidence to
support that inference?

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.393
- To my knowledge there is none.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.313
Where the evidence is,

00:02:03.313 --> 00:02:04.146
is that,

00:02:07.345 --> 00:02:09.440
there were civilizations

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.000
within the Americas, probably,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.380
up to about 16,000 before now,

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.623
not very much earlier than that,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.560
that those people probably
came on a coastal route,

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.950
from the north, but
there is a lot of debate

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.950
among the Americanologists
about the age at which

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.020
the first settlements in
South America occurred,

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.150
relative to say, Kennecott
Man and Clovis Man,

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.773
which are in the 10 to
13,000 years before now,

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.050
but unlike what happened in Europe,

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.050
or in the Russian area
where Denisovan Man,

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.500
or Denisovans were discovered,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.630
there is no evidence of any introgression,

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.430
which is sort of a sophisticated
word for hybridization

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.287
with any other people,

00:03:09.287 --> 00:03:13.419
Neanderthals probably
hybridized to some extent

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:16.733
with modern humans and Denisovan DNA

00:03:17.798 --> 00:03:22.798
which comes from the
Southern Russian area,

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.240
it is found throughout the oceanic area,

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.383
from Southeast Asia towards New Guinea,

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:34.039
whereas that DNA doesn't seem

00:03:35.363 --> 00:03:37.410
to appear in the European area,

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.480
on the other hand the Neanderthal DNA

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.290
does appear through everywhere
in the western hemisphere,

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.960
except Africa, where there is no evidence

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.170
that there was any hybridization.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.510
So that's a sort of a
two-minute history of that.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.958
- Before you leave,

00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.203
I have just received this question,

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.853
could the out of Africa
model be overturned some day?

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.150
- I think it's, did everybody hear that?

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.863
It said can the out of Africa
model be overturned one day.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.913
I think it's highly unlikely,

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.380
there was what was called
the multi-regional hypothesis

00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:24.340
before people started to get significant

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.070
amounts of genetic
information from Africans

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.480
and compare it to the variation

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.750
that existed in the rest of the world,

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.750
there was this hypothesis
from Walpart in Michigan.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.690
- Walpart.
- Walpart, yeah,

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.690
that humans, hominids evolved several

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.200
times in different places,

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.040
and I think that hypothesis

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.163
has pretty much gone by the board now,

00:04:52.818 --> 00:04:57.120
and acceptance by most paleo archeologists

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.223
is that modern humans exited from Africa,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.530
whereas probably Homo
Erectus exited a lot earlier,

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.950
so what we talk about,
about out of Africa,

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.700
what I was talking about is
called out of Africa two,

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.610
and out of Africa one is Erectus.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.800
- Exactly, and before you leave,

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.060
a lot of people present
this as an either or,

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.640
paleontology versus
molecular data, high five.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.263
Both lines of evidence.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.643
Now we turn to monkeys.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.820
Dorothy, is there much theft
of nuts by dominant monkeys,

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.370
or is there sharing between
even unrelated monkeys,

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.490
I ask this as you note the cohesive nature

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.063
of your study group in Brazil.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.669
- Okay so let's see,
there's two questions,

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:54.669
do the dominant steal, and is
there sharing among unrelated,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.610
Right, those are the two?

00:05:58.378 --> 00:06:02.420
So dominants don't steal nuts,

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.610
but they do displace lower ranking

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.050
individuals at anvil sites,

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.820
so the competition that we've seen

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.610
is not about the nut per se,

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.820
but about access to the anvil,

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.610
and particularly access
to that hammer stone,

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:23.020
the hammer stone is the most uncommon,

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.690
or the least available resource,

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.683
the most valuable resource
because it's rare.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.840
So I did once see

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.840
a young juvenile steal a nut
that his mother had cracked,

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.940
but that's a different kind of theft,

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.853
and his mother was annoyed,
but nothing much came of it.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.380
That could be familiar too.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.450
(audience laughs)

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.510
Let's see the other question was

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.563
Sharing and among unrelated.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.560
So capuchins are quite tolerant
towards young individuals,

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.150
adult capuchins are quite tolerant

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.160
towards young individuals,

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.933
up to around, somewhere
around two or two and a half,

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.610
and it's quite common for
an adult to crack a nut,

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.060
or to be busy cracking nuts,

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.860
they're often doing this for a while,

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.540
and there's more than
one nut that's cracked,

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.340
and for a whole crowd of
juveniles to be clustered around,

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.810
the pictures I showed often
showed one or two juveniles,

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.100
sometimes it's three or four,

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.500
and they are often sitting so close

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.360
to the adult that is cracking,

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.779
that you have the idea that maybe

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:34.180
they are gonna get cracked too,

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.380
they don't seem to,

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.520
but they really crowd in closely,

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.230
and the adult just keeps
on doing what it's doing,

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.430
and the young ones are right there,

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.410
and it is not frequent,

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:50.360
but we have seen an adult allow juveniles

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.110
to simply take nuts from their hands,

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.380
we don't see active giving,

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.280
I saw that once in 15 years of watching,

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.023
I don't know how many
thousands of bouts of cracking,

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.150
and some individuals are more tolerant

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.410
towards the young ones than others,

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.410
and they're kind of preferred
partners for the young ones,

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.760
they kind of hang around
with the nice guys,

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.170
and they are frequently scrounging

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.270
at anvil sites when an
adult has finished and left,

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.720
then there's all kinds of
debris and remains there,

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.890
and that's very attractive

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.330
to the young ones and they go there,

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.000
so there's a lot of you can call it,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.483
post prandial sharing that happens

00:08:29.483 --> 00:08:32.040
at the anvil in this way,

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.870
and a degree of relatedness

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.173
is not particularly important in this,

00:08:37.287 --> 00:08:38.990
in the first place if it's a male

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:41.700
we aren't certain of
paternity in any case,

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.485
and if it's a female,

00:08:43.485 --> 00:08:47.160
she doesn't seem to mind
if it's her own offspring,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.380
but typically it is closer relatives

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.230
when it's the female that's cracking.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.333
- Thank you very much, next
question is for Dietrich,

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.110
and as he comes up here I'll add to it,

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.103
we all saw that picture of the chimpanzee,

00:09:07.462 --> 00:09:10.010
and it was not doing very
well at making stone tools,

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:11.260
and it didn't have pants.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.700
How can we suggest evolutionary

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.660
progression of human technology

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:24.220
when Neolithic technology
appears cross culturally

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.623
and independently across time?

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.970
I can repeat that if you need a minute.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.480
How can we suggest
evolutionary progression

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.720
of human technology when
the Neolithic technology

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.853
appears cross culturally and
independently across time?

00:09:46.738 --> 00:09:49.263
- Well I don't think I know
a lot about the Neolithic,

00:09:50.155 --> 00:09:51.740
but I wouldn't probably
want to characterize

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.710
there being one unitary
Neolithic technology,

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:59.830
and I also would hesitate
to use the word progress

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:02.860
in really any kind of evolution,

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.300
but in terms of technological evolution,

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.650
I think what we see is really

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.950
a diversification in the
paleolithic time period,

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:14.920
where you have older
technologies sticking around,

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:19.840
but newer technologies being
added in some places to that.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.680
Certainly there's a lot of
potential for reinvention,

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.130
again I don't know much about Neolithic,

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:26.977
but for instance the hand
taxes that I was talking about,

00:10:26.977 --> 00:10:29.110
particularly the earlier ones,

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.000
the early esculapian,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.780
I think it's not unreasonable

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.970
to think that that tool
was invented many times,

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:36.720
a lot of people think that explains

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.160
some of the geographic
patterning that we do see.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.630
So I think this cultural accumulation

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.000
and diversification is not

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.843
at all incompatible with
multiple reinventions.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:52.813
- Thank you.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.790
My next question indicates

00:10:55.790 --> 00:11:00.300
that the voles and opossums were big hits.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.663
This one's for Leah.

00:11:03.828 --> 00:11:06.060
It actually is the outline

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.480
of a long-term research project for you,

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.280
so do voles breed fast enough,

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:16.180
that you could follow multiple
generations of blind voles,

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.200
to see if any permanent evolution

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.450
of brain organization
had occurred over time?

00:11:27.366 --> 00:11:29.840
- I'm not certain I
understand the question, so?

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.503
- I think what they're asking is,

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:38.800
can you look at the abolition
of the brain in blind voles

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.913
by having multiple generations
in your laboratory,

00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:48.661
given that we all are here on this planet

00:11:48.661 --> 00:11:50.010
for only about a hundred years.

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.750
- Okay, so I'll say two things,

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:55.602
one is that this might
relate to your question,

00:11:55.602 --> 00:11:58.090
there's actually a natural experiment

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.650
of naturally relatively blind animals,

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:01.710
they're called blind mole rats,

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.420
and I took them out of my talk,

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:06.360
because I thought I wasn't
gonna have enough time,

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.780
but it turns out if you have animals

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:08.690
that are naturally blind,

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.080
you have skin growing over their eyes,

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.040
and their eyes get an ophthalmic,

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.000
really, really tiny,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.250
and they only use their visual

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:17.087
system for circadian functions,

00:12:17.087 --> 00:12:20.860
night and day, and not object recognition,

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.560
it turns out that if you
look at their neocortex,

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.140
it looks a lot like the
bilateral nucleate voles

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.760
that we made, you can't
get rid of the one,

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.620
but it gets functionally
re-specified to become auditory.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.550
In terms of voles,

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.240
I'm not thinking they breed fast enough,

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.710
but I think a related question would be,

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:42.067
what would happen if you looked
at the experimentally blind

00:12:42.067 --> 00:12:46.603
monadelphous that we made,

00:12:47.521 --> 00:12:49.840
and have their mothers reproduce,

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:54.750
and consistently have the
monadelphous be blind,

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:58.120
so you're now rearing
this culture of blindness,

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.570
I think you'd probably
see some differences,

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.720
then just the sort of
things that we described,

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.660
so I think that might kind
of answer the question,

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.346
or am I just like blah.

00:13:07.346 --> 00:13:09.249
- Probably how many generations

00:13:09.249 --> 00:13:10.628
of that would you have to run?

00:13:10.628 --> 00:13:12.000
- I don't think it would take very many,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.370
because I will say we did rear

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:17.162
our blind animals in a
highly enriched environment,

00:13:17.162 --> 00:13:20.280
so we said can we take this
natural somatosensory plasticity

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.550
and amplify and direct it
by rearing these animals

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:27.463
in a large cage with lots of
different tactical textures,

00:13:27.463 --> 00:13:29.180
and we were able to change
neural response properties,

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.090
we were able to change connectivity,

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:32.700
we were able to change behavior,

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.470
so that you can actually manipulate things

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:37.330
beyond just removing sensory activity,

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.857
but changing the environment even further.

00:13:39.857 --> 00:13:41.137
- Very good thank you,

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.403
finally for John Shea,

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:49.600
I see different people using
a variable amount of tools,

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.330
my sister carries tools and uses them,

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.203
I rarely reach for tools,

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.683
we are the same species
doing different things,

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.740
would your scheme classify us differently?

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:10.947
- No.

00:14:10.947 --> 00:14:12.350
(audience laughs)

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:14.210
- Perfect, and I have a follow-up,

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:16.110
it's not exactly a follow-up.

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:18.500
Why is fire not considered a tool,

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.310
where does mastery of fire fit
in the history of technology,

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:25.053
and what impact did it have on
pre-human brain development.

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.020
- That's a bit outside
of my area of expertise,

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.330
I can make fire,

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.100
I enjoy making fire,

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.940
but I'm not an expert on the
development of Pyro technology,

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.460
the earliest claimed evidence of fire

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.736
are between one and a half million

00:14:41.736 --> 00:14:43.360
to a little under one million years ago,

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.570
I think the evidence grows stronger

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:46.700
in more recent contexts,

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:47.710
it's a tool,

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:49.203
it's a physical process,

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:54.745
but we have such tenuous
and fragile remains of fire,

00:14:54.745 --> 00:14:58.430
it's not as amendable to
describing its variability

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.000
in terms of the traces that remain,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.240
for example, one can
make fire by collision,

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.250
flint and steel,

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.370
friction,

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:05.640
several different kinds of friction,

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.653
using a lens,

00:15:07.701 --> 00:15:09.640
how you could discriminate

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.710
those various complex
different ways of making fire,

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:15.080
simply by a pile of carbon stained soil,

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.610
is an unsolvable problem at present.

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:19.090
How early humans made fire

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:20.950
is one of the big unanswered questions,

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:22.310
I truly regret I can't give you

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:24.423
a straightforward answer for that.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:28.330
- More research to be done,

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.510
and with that I'll turn it over to Pat,

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:33.510
who has now organized the
questions from the second session.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.683
- So will start with Paula
who was the first speaker,

00:15:42.986 --> 00:15:44.450
and Paula the question is,

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:47.150
are there a disproportional number

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.650
of dyslexics among English speakers,

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:53.830
given that English was suggested

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.773
as being especially problematic?

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.643
- The answer to that is yes,

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:04.990
the more transparent a language is,

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:06.990
the easier it is to learn to read,

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:09.340
and the fewer people
struggle to learn to read,

00:16:10.283 --> 00:16:12.650
so languages like Spanish or Latin,

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:15.360
where one sound one letter,

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.950
you have a lot less problems learning it,

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:21.240
and we're not only talking about dyslexia,

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.930
we're talking about learning

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:24.663
it as a second language as well.

00:16:27.356 --> 00:16:29.260
- And a related question for you,

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.210
do dyslexics have impairment

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:34.733
concerning numbers and mathematics?

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:38.910
- Well it's really interesting,

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:41.588
all academic achievement in the end

00:16:41.588 --> 00:16:44.660
is highly related to
your language ability,

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.950
because 80% of whats taught in schools

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:51.170
is taught by spoken
language, oral language,

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:53.360
not written language,

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.470
and there are children of course

00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:59.020
who are quite good at mathematics

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:02.733
who still are really
struggling with reading,

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:06.110
so I'm kind of answering
it into different ways,

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:09.280
if you improve children's
language ability,

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.333
let's say children who are struggling,

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.460
in both spoken and written language,

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.300
their math scores go up comparably,

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.360
so I think we have to
think about math in terms

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.650
of what you have to say inside
your head verbally as well,

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:26.853
as just the symbolic numbers.

00:17:27.919 --> 00:17:30.340
- I may want to ask a question,

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:31.620
I'm probably not supposed to,

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.373
so I'll just block out there.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.063
The question I have is this,

00:17:36.063 --> 00:17:38.780
that a number of years ago you showed

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:42.278
this really kind of amazing thing,

00:17:42.278 --> 00:17:44.930
which is that a subset of dyslexics

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:48.280
who were otherwise
cognitively quite normal,

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:53.280
have limitations on the
processing of auditory signals,

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.530
such that it's very difficult

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:58.100
for them when they are acquiring,

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.240
forget about reading,

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.120
when they are acquiring a language,

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.340
hearing,

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:07.460
it's difficult for them to
distinguish between pa and ba,

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:11.900
and so they grow up calling
a poplar tree a popular tree,

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:16.840
and so when Paula suggested this,

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.501
she had a wonderful experiment to show it,

00:18:20.501 --> 00:18:22.410
and it was that children
who were diagnosed

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:25.280
as having slow language milestones,

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.410
or being dyslexic,

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:29.000
but who are otherwise cognitively normal,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.630
couldn't distinguish between
these very fast transience,

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:35.808
beep boop, boop beep,

00:18:35.808 --> 00:18:37.641
They couldn't do it,

00:18:37.641 --> 00:18:40.583
they didn't know in which
one the low came first,

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:44.870
and that strikes me as
being a remarkable thing,

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:48.350
and what I think is kind of
interesting in this context,

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:50.090
where we are thinking about evolution,

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:55.090
is the question, if once
language was such a thing,

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.270
and such an important social tool,

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.910
you would think if the genetic folks,

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:06.880
those who see genetic changes

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.790
all over the place in modern humans,

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:13.430
you would think that that
would be selected against,

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:16.380
and that over a few generations,

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:17.670
dyslexia,

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:20.290
or at least not being able
to distinguish between,

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:22.061
beep boop, boop beep,

00:19:22.061 --> 00:19:24.220
would be selected against,

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.853
and yet it's not.

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.455
This is just partly a reflection,

00:19:29.455 --> 00:19:31.610
I'm sorry I don't really want to go on,

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:33.430
but it's partly a reflection

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:36.800
of the worry in general that I have,

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.180
which of course is related

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:41.120
to those humans on the East Coast,

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.880
who want to see genetic changes

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:47.623
and innateness for everything practically,

00:19:48.932 --> 00:19:50.020
and so I'm just slightly cautious,

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.720
so I'll bring that to a halt,

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.320
but I'll just ask you,

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.993
don't you think it would
have been selected against?

00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:00.080
- Okay, I've got to start with one thing,

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.490
and that is a lot of people wonder

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:07.100
what's the relationship
between the sound and reading,

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.950
because a lot of people think dyslexia,

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:12.460
is something to do with
seeing things backwards,

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.490
it's been pretty much an old wives tale,

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:20.280
but it's still in the public
view what dyslexia is about.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.810
In fact in order to become
a proficient reader,

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:26.220
you have to become aware that words

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:29.430
can be broken down into
smaller units of sound,

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:32.530
and it's those sounds that
the letters represent,

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:34.540
so if you're having difficulty in reading,

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.490
most scientists around the
world have demonstrated

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:41.250
that difficulty for
about 80 to 90% of kids

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:43.870
comes down to auditory processing

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:46.186
of the type you're talking about.

00:20:46.186 --> 00:20:49.240
It's a long story to answer it,

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:54.240
some people feel that
individuals who are dyslexic

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.000
actually have talents in other areas,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.490
particularly in the visual spatial domain,

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:03.610
and that they're not selected against

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:04.960
if you want to think of it that way,

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.200
because they're bringing
other things to the table,

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.728
but when you look at those
little kids that are struggling,

00:21:11.728 --> 00:21:15.560
it's a pretty tough road for a long time,

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:19.720
and one of the things I
often have said to parents

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.860
who are so concerned about their children,

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:26.860
if we had a different outcome of interest,

00:21:28.368 --> 00:21:29.550
the violin playing rather than reading,

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:32.670
we'd have a whole different
group of impaired children,

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:34.370
so it's a cultural thing

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:37.487
that reading has become so important.

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:40.460
- Thank you and I apologize

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:43.690
for sort of abusing my privilege.

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:46.433
I think we are on to
Raphael at this point,

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.563
so Raphael,

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.940
what is your take on mathematical

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.820
ability being genetically selected for,

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.180
I think you did kind of
summarize that at the end,

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:01.038
but you might like to do that again,

00:22:01.038 --> 00:22:04.300
like the Malcolm Gladwell theory

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:08.010
of South Indian rice
farmers being better at math

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:10.100
because of selection for farmers

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.100
with better geometrical skills,

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.910
and I think Harbending,
who's a geneticist,

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:17.410
said something about Ashkenazi Jews

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:19.170
being better at mathematics,

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:21.410
because they weren't
allowed certain other jobs,

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:23.280
and so they had to be accountants.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.680
So I wondered if you might
want to address that?

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.380
- Well in my talk I was trying
to show that mathematics

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.560
is a cultural trait invented

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:36.610
for very specific needs
and so on and so forth,

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:38.470
also mathematics is multi faceted,

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:41.080
it's not just about number
crunching arithmetic,

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.280
it's about logic,

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.870
spatial relations,

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:45.550
and many other things,

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:47.070
and then of course we
have to make a distinction

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:48.720
between school mathematics,

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.310
and let's say more formal mathematics,

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:53.460
and so here the question would be,

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:54.760
which one are we talking about.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.860
So clearly if you have a
culture that deals let's say,

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:01.210
because of arts and crafts,

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:03.960
and dealing with making
things with their hands

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.530
and weaving et cetera, et cetera,

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:08.430
you're going to have some
kind of spatial capacities

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:09.390
for putting things together,

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:11.833
but that in itself is not mathematics.

00:23:11.833 --> 00:23:15.560
Now if you put those people
in some sort of environment

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.870
where there's going to be
let's say numerical relations,

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:20.470
or counting or doing things with space,

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:23.370
maybe they are going to have
an advantage that's for sure.

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.550
- And another question,

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:31.453
this has to do with learning
disabilities and mathematics,

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:35.490
where people may have limitations

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.640
on doing any form of arithmetic,

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.900
although they may be cognitively

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.140
quite normal in other domains,

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.910
so they might be able to

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.140
recognize the number six,

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:52.510
but if you said that
this banana cost $600,000

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:54.480
that wouldn't make any difference,

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.063
whether you said that
you said it was $0.60.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.300
Do you know anything about the circuitry

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.403
that is impaired in those kinds of cases?

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:08.870
- That's not my domain of research,

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:10.053
but I would say again,

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:12.800
I personally don't want

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.320
to reduce mathematics to number-crunching,

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.660
so an accountant is not a mathematician,

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.370
they do a lot of number-crunching.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:22.385
So it could be that
there are certain things

00:24:22.385 --> 00:24:24.470
that are impaired because of that,

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:26.330
but learning disabilities could

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:28.210
occur at many different levels,

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:30.231
you could have mathematicians
who are actually awful

00:24:30.231 --> 00:24:34.810
at doing the percentages for
the tip in the restaurant,

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:36.093
oh you're a mathematician,

00:24:36.093 --> 00:24:38.240
oh my god, terrible.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.920
There are math books
that don't have numbers,

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.170
because it's not necessarily about,

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:46.870
the fruit or the juice of
math is about other things,

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.620
so number happens to be the cornerstone

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:51.890
for bringing math to being,

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:53.660
but then you could have people

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:56.050
who are not very good at number-crunching,

00:24:56.050 --> 00:25:00.630
but being amazing logicians,
or mathematician in that sense,

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:03.090
so mathematics is so multifaceted

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:04.593
that we can't just say this is it,

00:25:04.593 --> 00:25:06.620
this is the math team.

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:07.940
- So multifaceted in the way

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:10.411
that being an athlete is multifaceted,

00:25:10.411 --> 00:25:12.430
you might be a great football player,

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:13.890
but a poor snowboarder.

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:16.463
- Sure, exactly, there's
certain body morphologies,

00:25:16.463 --> 00:25:19.340
that are more appropriate
for certain kind of sports,

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:22.330
so if you want to play in
the NBA and you're 5'2",

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:24.570
well it's not gonna work very well,

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:26.250
same thing if you wanna do snowboarding

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.170
and you don't have good balance,

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:29.770
then it's not gonna work either.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.703
- Okay, so now we are
moving on to Candice,

00:25:35.016 --> 00:25:37.890
and the question is,

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:42.570
how iPhones and iPads affect children's

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:44.950
brains during very early development,

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:49.003
like between birth and
say, four years old,

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.580
and the second question is
don't they need to get bored

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:55.240
in order to explore and enhance

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:58.043
their creativity and
cognitive development?

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.240
- So I think the question of very early,

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.740
I work with adolescents,

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:07.570
but many of the fears are the same,

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:09.769
the American Academy of
Pediatrics has a standing

00:26:09.769 --> 00:26:13.160
hour limit that they've
placed for young children,

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.807
and that hour limit,

00:26:14.807 --> 00:26:16.470
first it was an hour,

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:18.407
most recently it was two hours,

00:26:18.407 --> 00:26:21.030
but what they'd look at with kids,

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:23.680
what they were actually
doing was four or five hours,

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:25.363
and what they've done,

00:26:25.363 --> 00:26:29.390
is they've modified it for
families to make a family plan,

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:31.410
what fits with your family,

00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:32.580
each family is gonna be different,

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.710
and time in front of the screen
is gonna be very different,

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:40.280
if it's with a child, mum, or caregiver,

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.620
reading with the child and
interacting with the child,

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:44.650
if that app is high quality,

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:46.870
looking at puzzle making or something,

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:51.870
or just passive viewing on
YouTube or something like that.

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:54.870
So I think the idea,

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:57.760
no one is recommending
that a young baby is put

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.190
in front of a screen for
a long period of time,

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:01.670
that's not what we're talking about,

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:05.240
but the idea that we could
place some arbitrary number

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:08.460
on screen time without
considering how it's scaffolded,

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.100
or how children are introduced,

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.230
or how technology is integrated

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:14.580
into the home is difficult.

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:15.413
- Don't go away.

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:19.630
I think this pertains to

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.610
some comments in the
earlier part of your talk,

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:25.450
so the question goes like this,

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:30.030
if mental health is culturally
defined and self identified,

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:33.070
that's a bit of an if I think,

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:35.640
how can we separate
the child's correlation

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:39.410
of digital technology and material health,

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:42.480
these may influence
their personal happiness,

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.420
I guess this has to do

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:47.303
with the reliability of their reports,

00:27:48.925 --> 00:27:50.420
this may influence them to try

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.283
to get away with what they want.

00:27:55.146 --> 00:27:56.810
- So the question might be,

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:59.890
we don't see this association
between reported screen time,

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:00.960
whether it's by the child

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.880
or maybe by an adult in mental health,

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.680
and maybe that's due to
some error in reporting,

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.610
so there are other ways to measure it,

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:09.370
you can do a digital device logs,

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:10.780
so you can actually track the amount

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.640
of time the kids are online,

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.330
you can use other metrics,

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:18.000
so in many of our studies
we actually get cognitive

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.040
tested performance,

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:21.130
we administer them in the home,

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:22.680
for example we have a paper coming out

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:27.230
showing no association
between digital technology use

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:30.390
and cognitive performance
based on end of grade testing,

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:32.930
or tests that we administer in the home,

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:35.320
except that these very extremes,

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.990
and when we find those we
can get rid of those effects,

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:39.350
if we take into consideration

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:42.190
how much material
resources the family has.

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:44.660
So what we might be observing when we see

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:48.870
these negative associations
between kids online a lot,

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:51.520
and poor outcomes across
a whole lot of domains,

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.230
there's a whole lot of
other stuff happening

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:56.010
in that house with that
kid in that family,

00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:58.210
and sometimes it's just
not about the phone.

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:01.810
- Okay, I think that we've got it,

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:05.380
and now Joe Henrik,

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:07.460
now Joe, you're kind of in trouble here,

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.983
because you've got about five questions,

00:29:11.323 --> 00:29:13.510
so prepare yourself.

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:18.510
Okay, how do you explain the
success of insular communities,

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:25.030
and their technological success,

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:27.660
and if I may just elaborate
for this question,

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:31.980
the Inuit for example live in
these tiny little villages,

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:36.500
and they have invented the
most remarkable devices,

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.940
including remarkable clothes

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:43.290
and boats and dogs and on and on,

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:46.070
so is that something you can address?

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:47.590
- Yes,

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:49.180
I think it's Chapter 13,

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.073
no 11.

00:29:51.073 --> 00:29:53.190
- Okay that's done then.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:56.370
- Can I just say a few more words on that,

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:58.613
just in case people
haven't got the book yet.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.150
So if you look at the
details of the ethnography,

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:04.330
from either groups in Australia,

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:06.030
or groups like the Inuit,

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:09.340
they often have elaborate
cultural technology social norms

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:11.990
which interconnects these
otherwise disparate groups.

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:16.760
So things like seal partners,

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.000
so you will have certain individuals

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.640
which are gonna share seal meat,

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.710
So when you find a seal you got

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:22.260
it eventually go find your partner,

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.700
which could be a long trek,

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.640
then you get to interact
in their community.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.582
Other kinds of long-distance relationships

00:30:27.582 --> 00:30:30.350
keep these lines of communication open.

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:32.063
We know from the trading
networks in the Inuit

00:30:32.063 --> 00:30:33.720
that they were all interconnected,

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.110
and in fact the languages
were very similar.

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:38.030
What seems to have happened
prior to the Inuit,

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:39.390
was a group called the Dorset

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:41.950
had previously spread
across the Canadian Arctic,

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:44.770
and they had more complex technology,

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:46.010
but then over time,

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:46.890
they broke apart and they

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:48.800
became more technologically isolated,

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.490
and then they lost bows and arrows,

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:51.630
which was a big trouble for them

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:54.005
when the Inuit arrived
with bows and arrows.

00:30:54.005 --> 00:30:58.058
And another example from
Australia is linguistic exogamy

00:30:58.058 --> 00:30:59.600
so you have to marry someone

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.250
who speaks a different language from you,

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:03.690
that creates a marriage bond
between other communities,

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:05.193
there's also communal rituals.

00:31:06.785 --> 00:31:08.035
- That's great,

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:10.410
do you want to say a little bit more

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:13.973
about the spices that we can
use for antimicrobial effects?

00:31:16.372 --> 00:31:18.340
- So I recommend, the paper

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:20.950
is by Paul Sherman and Jennifer Billings,

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:24.850
and they actually rank the
spices according to the number

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:27.110
of different bacteria
species that they kill,

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:29.104
the top ones are the ones you'd guess,

00:31:29.104 --> 00:31:32.240
garlic, onions, chilis are up there,

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.680
they get about 75%

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.339
of the bacteria they've tested against.

00:31:36.339 --> 00:31:39.270
And then the really powerful
ones are these combinations

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:41.350
like chili powder, which has
several different spices,

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:44.123
I think 13 different spices in it.

00:31:45.735 --> 00:31:47.135
- Okay we'll look for those.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:52.550
So then the observation is that there are

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:55.690
of course these wonderful
social insects like termites

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:58.310
who have a kind of collective brain,

00:31:58.310 --> 00:32:01.620
so is there a strong or a weak analogy

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.200
between the collective brain

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.500
for hominids that you are thinking about,

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.943
and the collective brain for termites?

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.160
- So I think the best work on

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:14.480
this is by a biologist named Tom Seeley,

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.470
and he has a book called
Wisdom of the Hive,

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:20.470
and he actually discusses how
bees make communal decisions,

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:22.630
by all the bees go out
to their different areas

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:23.900
and they come back together,

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.390
and they can do these waggle dances

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:27.400
which is a way of
aggregating the information,

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.180
until one signal wins out,

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:31.700
and then they all go that way.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:35.390
So there are parallel
patterns in other species,

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:36.990
where information is aggregated,

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:39.740
and the group functions as
a kind of collective brain.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:40.600
In the case of humans,

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.140
ours is just a more powerful system,

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:44.380
because with cultural learning

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:45.310
we can communicate

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:47.260
so many different kinds of information.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:52.550
- Okay, and what were the genetic changes

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:55.510
that occurred about two
million years ago such

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:57.070
that hominids gathered

00:32:57.070 --> 00:33:00.223
in larger groups that
made all of this happen?

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:06.460
- So the case that I make in
The Secret of Our Success,

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.930
is that the changes weren't genetic,

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:11.850
so I don't like genetic
magic bullet explanations,

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:14.290
so I proposed one thing

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:16.870
is that there was a larger predator guild,

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:19.970
and one of the ways mammals
respond to more predators,

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:21.430
is they cluster in larger groups,

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:23.580
so if we had a Savannah bipedal ape,

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:24.880
it would cluster in larger group,

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.500
with a larger predator guild.

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.640
At the same time the environmental

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.670
fluctuations began to increase,

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:33.110
so we now know this from
these deep lake cores,

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:34.960
that showed you were
getting more fluctuation,

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.080
and theoretical work done

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.388
by Rob Boyd and Pete Richardson,

00:33:38.388 --> 00:33:39.859
indicates that we should expect

00:33:39.859 --> 00:33:41.700
more reliance on social learning

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:44.010
when you see the environmental change.

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:45.740
So those are two key factors

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.090
that don't have anything to do with genes

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:48.760
That would have meant that primates

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.160
were more likely to cross.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:50.993
And there was a bunch

00:33:50.993 --> 00:33:52.380
of different species of Australophocaena,

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.764
so there are a lot of
natural experiments going on,

00:33:54.764 --> 00:33:56.993
and the idea is that one of them crossed.

00:33:59.081 --> 00:34:01.803
- Okay, and the last question I guess,

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.083
is human evolution accelerating,

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.003
I don't know, yeah.

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:10.080
- Well the one thing we do know,

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.180
is that since the origins of agriculture,

00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:15.510
there's been a whole new
suite of selection pressures

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:17.500
and populations have gotten a lot bigger,

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:18.990
so if you have larger populations

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:20.830
you have more chance for mutations,

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:22.680
more chance to find beneficial mutations

00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:25.290
and then adapt to all these
new selection pressures,

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:27.620
which include new disease environments,

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:28.880
new kinds of food,

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.605
the spread of dairy,

00:34:30.605 --> 00:34:33.070
so there's been a lot of
genetic change in our species,

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:34.470
and some population biologist

00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:37.240
have argued indeed that
it is accelerating.

00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:39.983
- If I may just take the
liberty of following that up,

00:34:39.983 --> 00:34:42.410
so correct me on this,

00:34:42.410 --> 00:34:44.430
because I'm sure I'm wrong,

00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:49.430
the geneticists tend to say
that the main genetic changes

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:54.810
really pertain to things
like digestive enzymes

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:56.383
like lactase,

00:34:57.441 --> 00:35:00.663
and two features of the immune system,

00:35:01.824 --> 00:35:03.870
and finally to things like eye color

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:06.680
and skin color and hair
texture and so forth,

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:10.550
but so far at least,

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:15.550
they don't see anything that
you might call a genetic change

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:17.810
For greater sociality,

00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:19.420
or for greater niceness.

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:21.935
Or for, yeah.

00:35:21.935 --> 00:35:23.620
- Right, so my reading

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.503
of the literature is the same as yours.

00:35:25.503 --> 00:35:26.562
- Oh, okay.

00:35:26.562 --> 00:35:28.330
- Although I would say things

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:30.520
like lactose genes to change behavior,

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.410
so if you can process
lactose then you drink milk,

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:35.440
and that gives you a whole
new set of possibilities.

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.250
Things like genes that increase

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:39.921
your ability to process
alcohol can change behavior.

00:35:39.921 --> 00:35:41.587
- For sure, yeah.

00:35:41.587 --> 00:35:43.160
And the last question is,

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.320
I guess this could be for you,

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.170
but it's just sort of in general,

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:50.320
I guess I think dogs are really important,

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.360
and I think dogs have been around

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:56.220
for what, about 30,000 years,

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:57.610
living with hominids,

00:35:57.610 --> 00:36:01.520
and they do seem to have been

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:04.410
an extraordinarily powerful tool,

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:08.910
at least for scavenging and
for safety and so forth,

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:13.910
and I bet that they do provide
a kind of cultural evolution

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:16.830
that has served us really quite well,

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:20.040
I really wanted to have dogs in this talk,

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:21.927
I mean in this meeting,

00:36:21.927 --> 00:36:23.363
but there wasn't room,

00:36:24.341 --> 00:36:28.638
so okay, thank you.

00:36:28.638 --> 00:36:30.648
- So I'd like to thank Pat
Churchland and Tim White

00:36:30.648 --> 00:36:32.840
for this fantastic symposium,

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.390
and of course all the speakers,

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:35.530
stay tuned for dogs,

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:37.650
the dogs and the wolves
will come back one day,

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:38.493
I promise.

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.840
And of course I'd like to
thank the audience here,

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.630
and the audience watching the webcast,

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:48.760
I look forward to seeing
you at the next symposium.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:51.270
Thanks very much for
the supporters as well,

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:53.790
as well as the team
that made this possible,

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:55.560
the audiovisual team,

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.040
so with that I thank you again,

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.510
and I look forward to seeing you again,

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:00.947
have a wonderful evening.

00:37:00.947 --> 00:37:03.763
(audience applauds)

00:37:03.763 --> 00:37:06.346
(upbeat music)
