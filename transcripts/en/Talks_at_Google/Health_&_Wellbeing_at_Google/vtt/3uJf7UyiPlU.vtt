[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.917 --> 00:00:08.250
CAROLINE DEHNERT MOYER: A lot
of people know what AA is.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.380
Just a moment about what
Al-Anon is because I don't

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.300
think that's as well-known.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.140
Al-Anon is-- I call it
the sister program to AA.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.410
It's where if you have
a family member that's

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.650
struggling with alcoholism,
you join Al-Anon.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.430
We get together.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.900
We talk about our struggles
as family members.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.640
It was actually
founded by the wife

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.890
of the guy that founded
AA, which I think

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.760
is kind of fitting because I
think these really go together.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.980
When they go together
well, it actually

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.770
addresses the disease
better because it truly

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.880
is a family addiction, and we'll
talk about what that means.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.240
But so here we are
talking about addiction.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.280
I'm going to tell a story about
my brother, who growing up he

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.908
became a crack cocaine addict.

00:00:54.908 --> 00:00:56.700
And then Jam's going
to talk about his road

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.560
to recovery from
heroin addiction.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.630
But just one other
little minute before we

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.140
get into the stories about how
we landed on this stage, which

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.990
is kind of a couple of things
happened together, sort of

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.710
like the perfect storm.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.530
The first was that
I actually started

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.702
going to therapy myself.

00:01:11.702 --> 00:01:14.160
And I started going to therapy
a couple years ago because I

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.740
was just having, honestly,
a really hard time dealing

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.090
with my brother and his needs
and what he was going through.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.770
I also have two
little kids and a mom.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.180
And I was like, I can't--

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.030
this is mercy.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.985
Please, somebody.

00:01:27.985 --> 00:01:29.610
My friend, who's in
the audience today,

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.027
referred me to a
therapist, and it

00:01:31.027 --> 00:01:33.150
was one of the best
things I think that I did.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.810
So that happened a
couple of years ago.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.733
And she said, you need
to talk about this stuff.

00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:38.650
So that was one thing.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.630
The second thing--
I'm getting a little

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.310
shout out to Sharon
if you're out there,

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.170
my manager on
Livestream in New York.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.010
Sharon, thank you for nudging me
with the appropriate force to--

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.830
she said, Caroline, you've been
here a long time at Google.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.705
You need to find
your voice again.

00:01:54.705 --> 00:01:57.330
And I was like, well, what does
that mean, find my voice again?

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.540
Find something you really care
about outside of your core work

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.230
responsibility.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.610
And probably everybody's
manager says that at some point.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.960
So you go on to our internal
systems, and you're like,

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.620
I'll become a coach or I'm
going to take this one on one

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.960
class on allyship or whatever.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.690
So I did that, and I was like,
this is not what Sharon means.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.640
And the third thing
that happened was I

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.120
got an email from Ann, who
is one of the co-organizers

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.040
of the conference today.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.940
And she sent out a call
for speakers last December

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.440
or November saying hey, we want
to put on this mental health

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.150
conference in Chicago.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.690
Who wants to talk?

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.570
And I was like, mmm, no.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.085
But then I was like,
OK, find my voice.

00:02:40.085 --> 00:02:41.460
Sharon wants me
to find my voice.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.060
So I reached out to Ann,
and I was like, Ann,

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.880
what do people talk about
at these conferences?

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.708
And so she shared
some of the talks

00:02:49.708 --> 00:02:51.000
that people were going to give.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.950
And I read some of these things,
and I was like, holy shit,

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.020
these are some brave
people to get up and talk

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.428
about-- if anybody was here
yesterday, it was amazing,

00:03:01.428 --> 00:03:03.220
the stories that people
were talking about,

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.150
and the stories afterwards in
the micro kitchens and stuff.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.280
So I already know that
we're touching people

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.103
with this conference.

00:03:10.103 --> 00:03:11.520
The second thought,
though, that I

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.410
had after reading
that was oh my god,

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.250
nobody's going to
talk about addiction.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.360
And we cannot have a mental
health conference in Chicago

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.320
without somebody
talking about addiction.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.890
And I was like shit,
I think I just found

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.050
the voice that I need to find.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.370
It's there.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.660
It's gotta come out.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.330
And I was like, OK, Ann, I
think I can talk about this.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.540
And as soon as I did that,
I sent a text to this man,

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.910
and I said hey,
Jam, you don't even

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.648
know me at all because the rock
concert happened much later.

00:03:39.648 --> 00:03:41.190
I said you don't
even know me at all.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.860
But I've seen the talks you've
done at high schools to kids,

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.138
and it's powerful stuff.

00:03:48.138 --> 00:03:49.680
And people need to
hear your message.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.097
And I said this is a different
audience than a high school

00:03:52.097 --> 00:03:54.810
gym, I said, but I know I'm
not the only one with family

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.250
members here at Google.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.583
Somebody came up to me in the
micro kitchen this morning

00:03:58.583 --> 00:04:01.050
and she said, I'm going to
be very touched by your talk

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.675
because I have a brother that's
dealing with a heroin addiction

00:04:03.675 --> 00:04:04.250
right now.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.110
So thank you for
validating that I'm not

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.990
the only one with
a family member.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.190
I said, I'm also not the
only parent here at Google

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.010
that worries about our kids.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.350
And I'm certainly not
the only one that--

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.430
I know there are
people that struggle

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.930
with their own
addictions at Google.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.555
So I said please come do
this talk with me, Jam.

00:04:22.555 --> 00:04:24.180
In five seconds he's
like, I don't even

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.950
know who you are, but yeah,
I'm going to come to your talk

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.450
with you.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.580
It's like thank you.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.530
Thank you, you know?

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.530
So that is how we got
on this stage today.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.250
And with that, I'm going
to go into my story which

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.930
starts with this picture here.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.490
This is going back
a long time ago.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.670
This is me, cute
little Caroline.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.470
This is my oldest brother
holding me, my twin brother,

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.970
and my brother Carl
that we're going

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.390
to be talking about today some.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.340
So this is what a
typical Sunday morning

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.770
looked like in our household.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.600
I grew up in Evanston, happy,
sort of middle class family.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.480
My parents were both musicians.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.580
You'll see there's a little
music theme going on today.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.400
And we would wake up
often on a Sunday morning.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.340
My dad played the trombone.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.360
And we were all required to
get our instruments out and jam

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.380
Sunday morning style.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.480
So this is kind of
what it looked like.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.030
And it was a very happy
household for a lot of years.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.500
We would do this Sunday morning.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.090
Then WWF would come on.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.472
We would do the "Hulk Hogan",
"Andre the Giant" thing,

00:05:27.472 --> 00:05:28.930
and then we would
watch the Chicago

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.060
Bears lose at 12:00 Central.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.810
JAM ALKER: Got a lot
of nodding heads here.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.270
CAROLINE DEHNERT MOYER: Yeah,
babies of the '70s here.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.520
And this was a very happy home.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.010
And I say that because
I think a lot of times,

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.490
people think addicts come
out of unhappy homes.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.290
And we'll hear a little bit
of a story about difficulty

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:49.270
in early years.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.400
But we had a very
happy home growing up.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.340
But then comes high school.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.070
And if chapter one is like
happy home, chapter two

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.660
it's called the diagnosis.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.965
And the diagnosis was my dad
being diagnosed with cancer.

00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:07.090
And I remember how it went.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.910
We're all the four of
us in the basement,

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.070
you know, typical basement,
just junkyard toys,

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.570
and we had a pool table.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.780
My mom and dad come down to the
basement, and they sit us down.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:22.000
And my mom, it was, says kids,
we have something to tell you.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.580
Your father has been
diagnosed with cancer.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.420
And we were like OK, we
know that word is terrible.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.580
And my brother Carl says--

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.610
I remember this-- can't
they just cut it out,

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.220
like surgically remove it?

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.560
And of course, that was not
the kind of cancer he had.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.350
So he started chemotherapy
the next week,

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:47.270
and the chemotherapy on and
off for the next decade.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.200
And in that decade
you have hope, right?

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.920
And then you lose your hope.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.680
And you're looking
for remission,

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.940
and remission doesn't happen.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.920
And on and on.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.980
And we're going on and on,
too, because life has to go

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.150
on and on.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:06.610
And so on and on, for my
brother, looked like--

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.750
this is high school prom,
Sweet Carl in the white--

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.970
did everybody wear white
tuxedos in these years?

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:13.900
I don't know.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.360
He was trying to
learn how to be a man,

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.490
and my dad was dying in front
of him, a very slow death.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.200
And life went on for me, too.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:29.860
I turned to my violin as,
frankly, a source of coping.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.640
It was a way to escape.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.450
And my parents had their
25th wedding anniversary

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:36.610
some here in here too.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.070
And I want to talk a little
bit about the different coping

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.820
mechanisms because I
think that's where it

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.370
started originally going wrong.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.010
So coping for me,
yes, it was music.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.740
But I want to tell
a little story.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.940
And if anybody sat in
her coaching session

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.450
with Sally Anderson and she asks
you what your superpower is,

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.460
I know my superpower
is my ability

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.530
to compartmentalize things.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:01.090
And a story just to illustrate
that is I wake up one morning.

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:02.150
I'm in high school.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.470
My dad is sprawled out on
the floor in what turns out

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:09.430
to be a diabetic coma, which
is a pretty common side

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.140
effect of chemotherapy.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.130
We call 911.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.830
The ambulances come,
the paramedics come in,

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.660
and they're trying
to talk to him,

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:20.230
and he can't talk because he's
basically just completely out

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:20.980
of it.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.630
And they're asking
me what his name is,

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.000
and I'm like Edmund
Dehnert, D-E-H-N-E-R-T.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.710
And I'm spelling.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.573
I always have to
spell my goddamn name.

00:08:28.573 --> 00:08:29.740
Thank god I married a Moyer.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.049
That's easier to
spell these days.

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:34.515
But it was
D-E-H-N-E-R-T. Thank you.

00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:35.890
And they put him
on the stretcher

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.419
and they took him off
to Evanston Hospital.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:42.580
And I remember then thinking OK,
I'm going to go catch the bus

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.390
and go to high school now.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.480
And that's what I did.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.188
I got on the bus and
went to high school.

00:08:47.188 --> 00:08:49.120
I took the physics
test and I aced it.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.920
And since that day, this
ability to put tragedy over

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.340
on this side in
its place for when

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.220
it can have time to be
addressed was very useful.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.300
And then I could go on with
the rest of my life over here.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.210
And so I find that I'm
able to really do that

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:09.010
quite effectively.

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:11.770
Unfortunately, my
brother was not

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.520
able to cope in that same way.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.990
And he started turning to
alcohol in high school.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:18.580
By the time he went
off to college,

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.850
it started to be
cocaine, and eventually

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.130
he turned to crack
cocaine, and he really

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.690
spiraled pretty far down.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:30.400
So at this point, the one
time Jam and I rehearsed this,

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.390
he said tell me more about
what Carl's relationship was

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:37.420
like with your dad
during those years.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.090
And this image
flashed into my mind,

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:43.360
which I shared with him the
first time, which was there

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.320
was a day--

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.240
he was probably out of
college at this point,

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.520
living in the men's
residence at the YMCA

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:52.038
in Evanston, which is not
the place you want to end up.

00:09:52.038 --> 00:09:53.830
But that's where he
was because he couldn't

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:55.100
hold a job and pay rent.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.690
So he's at the men's residence.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.500
And he comes home and
he's ringing the doorbell,

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.600
and he's ringing the
doorbell, and he's

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.985
calling the house phone, and
he's ringing the doorbell.

00:10:03.985 --> 00:10:06.360
And me and my twin brother,
who were still living at home

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.870
are looking at each other like
anybody gonna answer the door?

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:16.630
And my dad's on the couch,
and he's looking sicker

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.410
through the years
here, and he's starting

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:20.850
to look like a cancer patient.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:25.110
And my dad goes and
answers the doorbell.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:27.570
And Carl's like, I can't
stay at the men's residence.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:28.260
I can't do it.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:28.813
It's cold.

00:10:28.813 --> 00:10:30.480
And just let me come
in the living room.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.640
I swear I'll leave
at know 9:00, just

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:37.590
like in a mania kind of a
thing, like with a desperation.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:41.635
And my dad gets a blanket
and throws it on the porch

00:10:41.635 --> 00:10:43.260
and says, you can
come home when you're

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.900
sober, and closes the door.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:51.660
And me and my twin brother
were like, mmm, that was bad.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:56.040
And I thought of another
story, Jam, in these years.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.652
My twin brother is a DJ.

00:10:57.652 --> 00:10:59.610
And in that basement
where we all used to play,

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:02.580
he would keep these
crates of albums.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.280
One day Carl goes down there,
takes the crates of albums,

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.620
goes to Howard and Western,
pawns them at the thing

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:10.080
and sells them and goes
and gets some drugs.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.490
So my father found
out about this.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.120
He called us together because
of course my twin brother

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:21.320
was like furious, and just
all kinds of anger coming out.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.498
And my dad took it
upon himself to tell us

00:11:23.498 --> 00:11:26.040
this Biblical story, which I'm
going to completely get wrong.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.440
But it was the Cain
and Abel story.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.480
One brother kills
the other brother.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.350
And God says, I am still going
to protect this first brother.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:36.990
And he's telling us the story.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:40.810
In essence he's saying, I don't
care what Carl did to you guys.

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:45.170
He is a Dehnert, and we're
going to love each other.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.070
I was like, OK.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:48.960
And as I think about
those two stories

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.360
together, where you
sparked my thought there,

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.550
I think what I
learned from this,

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.080
and why those
stories stand out, is

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.590
that he was trying to explain
to us you can unconditionally

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:01.550
love somebody at the
same time you put up

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.240
very strong boundaries.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:07.390
Those two things have to
exist at the same time

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:11.050
if we're going to make
it as a family here.

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:15.850
So eventually my dad
dies from cancer.

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:19.710
And I remember at the funeral,
my oldest brother saying

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:22.680
thank god, Dad, you're not in
Room 3951 at Evanston Hospital

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.680
anymore.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:27.600
Thank god, Dad, you're not in
Room 3951 at Evanston Hospital

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.120
anymore.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.560
In other words, I am so
relieved this is over.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.390
This is over.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:35.430
It's been a decade of awful.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:41.370
And Carl, I think, had a
completely different response

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:46.110
when my dad died, which was
falling into utter despair.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:50.400
Because Dad's gone,
he can no longer

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:55.190
change that the last days and
years that my dad was around,

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:58.080
he was an addict
in active addiction

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.700
and with all kinds of crazy--

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.820
he could no longer change
that in my dad's brain.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:12.750
So what that started to look
like over time comes down to--

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.640
this is kind of what it all
added up to over the years.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:19.140
And this is something he wrote
when he was in recovery at one

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:23.130
of the places, his lifetime
treatments for alcohol

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:23.670
and drug.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:28.020
And my dad died in '94, this
little break right here.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.538
So he was trying
to deal with some

00:13:30.538 --> 00:13:32.580
of this stuff in the last
years of my dad's life.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.680
And then my dad
died, and you'll see

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.070
there's a 10-year gap there.

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.220
And I think that's when
he was in active addiction

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:43.020
and just wasn't trying to
deal with any of this stuff.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:48.180
And I have been in many
of those places myself,

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:52.950
dragging him, checking him
in, going to the one week

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:56.190
ceremonies where you celebrate
the sobriety at one week.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.230
And I did that many times.

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:02.520
But also through those years,
there was a lot of anger

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.390
because I think when you
love somebody so much,

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.090
but you haven't done the work
on yourself to be able to put up

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:12.700
the right boundaries, what comes
out is a lot of fucking anger,

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:13.200
right?

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.850
A lot of anger
through those years.

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:19.590
And so one of the things I was
talking about Al-Anon helping

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:21.810
family members, one of
the things we talk about

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.270
is you need to own
your own stuff.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:26.910
You need to deal with
yourself because this really

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:33.392
is your dealing with your own
behaviors can help this person.

00:14:33.392 --> 00:14:35.100
So I want to talk a
little bit about what

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.830
I was feeling and going
through in these years

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:41.040
and stop trying to
put it on my brother.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.810
So one of the things
you do when you're

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:45.570
a family member of somebody
that you love that's struggling

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.460
in this way is you enable them.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:51.930
And enabling them looks
like, in this example here,

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:53.850
my brother coming
to me one year--

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.670
I think it was 2003, which
was the year I joined Google--

00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:00.160
and saying hey, Caroline,
I need some money.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.330
And I knew he needed money.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.130
I knew what he
needed the money for.

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:04.990
But I actually needed a car.

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:06.870
So he's like, I got this car.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:09.690
I'm going to sell you
this car at $5,000.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.610
I'm like, actually, OK.

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:14.160
And you justify your
enabling behavior to yourself

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.530
by saying, well, I'm getting
something out of this, too.

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:18.900
I sort of know what you're
going to do with this money,

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:23.060
but maybe you'll also pay the
rent with that money, too.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:27.230
So in the car is this CD.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:28.873
JAM ALKER: Haven't
seen that in awhile.

00:15:28.873 --> 00:15:31.290
CAROLINE DEHNERT MOYER: This
CD was produced by this man's

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.700
record label right here.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:38.340
And that's how we became
friends because my $5,000 check

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:41.868
basically went to pay for this
CD and my connection to Jam,

00:15:41.868 --> 00:15:44.410
and it was worth every penny
for getting me up on this stage.

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:45.810
Thank you.

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:49.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.690
So it's a great album.

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:53.690
And that's what
enabling looks like.

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:57.367
And the other
behavior, I think--

00:15:57.367 --> 00:15:58.950
I want to say you,
but I'll just speak

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:02.460
for myself, I did a lot
through these years,

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:07.140
is what I want to call thinking
I'm all powerful and almighty.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:10.710
And what that looks like
is you take your brother

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:13.320
and you make an appointment
with his doctor.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.440
And you then go in with
your brother, and you go,

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.820
Hi, Dr. [? Ebehara. ?]
I'm Carl's sister.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.920
And Carl is strung out, and this
doctor is looking at me like,

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.480
why are you here?

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.330
And Carl signs the
HIPAA paperwork.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:31.140
And I go, I'm here to discuss
how you've been treating him.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.360
Please print out
his medical records.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.880
So Dr. [? Ebehara ?]
is like, OK.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.827
And he prints out 63
pages double-sided,

00:16:37.827 --> 00:16:40.410
and I go, please take me through
how you've been treating him.

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:45.450
This doctor was like, I
don't know what woman just

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.280
walked into this room.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:51.460
But I was like, oh,
so he has back issues.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:52.860
OK.

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.660
And you referred him for an MRI.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.010
OK, I don't see
that he got the MRI.

00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:57.510
OK.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:59.850
Another year later,
he's got neck issues.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:00.780
OK.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:02.610
OxyContin.

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:04.710
How many years, Dr.
[? Ebehara, ?] are you

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:08.430
going to prescribe
this OxyContin here?

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:12.940
And here I see it on here
twice in the same damn visit.

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:13.740
OK.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:18.660
So that's what you do when
you think you can actually

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.130
save this person.

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:23.040
You think you have
enough power that I

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.020
am bigger than
his disease, and I

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.020
am going to go fix this
for him because he's not

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.792
capable of doing it himself.

00:17:30.792 --> 00:17:32.250
And by the way,
this doesn't really

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:35.610
work because clearly this
was only one source of where

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:38.310
he was getting these pills
because you could go down

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:41.370
to Howard and Western and get
them today if you wanted to.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:42.960
But I felt victorious.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.250
I was on my own high.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:46.530
I was like, yeah, I saved him.

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:48.340
And clearly that
did not save him.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:53.250
OK, so behavior number
two is I can do this.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:57.590
Behavior number three is when
you realize I actually cannot

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:58.590
save.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:02.640
I actually don't have the
power over this disease

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.960
to save this person.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:08.970
And what that looks like is
you get a text like this.

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:10.920
It says, I think I
need to go to the ER

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.120
or I'm not going
to make it tonight.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.390
And you write back,
you will make it.

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.850
The ER is a good idea
if you need real help.

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:22.010
Love you and talk tomorrow.

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:23.720
Yes.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.600
And you put the phone
down, and you go,

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.900
holy god, please let him make
it through the night tonight.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.480
Please let him make it
through the night tonight.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.133
And he made it
through the night.

00:18:34.133 --> 00:18:36.050
And when I was telling
Jam this story he goes,

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:38.000
you might have saved
him that night.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.060
And I was like, thank you
for saying that because it's

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:44.390
a really scary
place to be, to go I

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:48.110
am powerless over this disease.

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:50.990
And I gotta let
you do it yourself.

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.170
So he made it that night.

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.180
And if you're also
really lucky, you

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:57.520
get a text like
this someday that

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:01.090
says thank you for helping
make me a strong man.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:03.840
And if you were here--

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.650
he's here.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.540
He's at work--

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:10.570
I would say thank you for
helping make me a strong woman

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:15.940
because I know I am much
stronger for having been

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.970
in this family addiction
with you and doing the work

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:22.220
that I need to do to help you.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.675
So that's the end of my story.

00:19:25.675 --> 00:19:27.050
JAM ALKER: This
is making me cry.

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:28.342
CAROLINE DEHNERT MOYER: I know.

00:19:28.342 --> 00:19:29.760
You're supposed to cry.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:36.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:39.970
So before Jam gets
into his story,

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:42.740
there are a lot of
resources we have at Google.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.380
We have an Al-Anon group.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:48.130
There are only 37
people globally

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:50.455
that are a part of
this Al-Anon group,

00:19:50.455 --> 00:19:52.330
and I know there are
more than 37 people that

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:53.650
have family members.

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:58.030
There are also groups
for sober living.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.940
I think there's a lot of
groups for sober living.

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:05.800
So people that don't want to
drink alcohol, or alcoholics,

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.170
we love you guys, too.

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:14.590
Please partake of some of the
Google resources, if you can.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:18.613
Shall we go back in time
with you and your story?

00:20:18.613 --> 00:20:19.780
JAM ALKER: Yes, let's do it.

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:20.280
All right.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.700
I'm going to stand up.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:22.950
CAROLINE DEHNERT MOYER: Do it.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:24.370
JAM ALKER: Easier
for me this way.

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:26.250
Thank you, Caroline, for that.

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:29.380
Was amazing, making
me cry a little bit,

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:33.650
exposing my softiness.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:34.150
All right.

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:39.280
So as Caroline has mentioned,
my name is Jam Alker.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:43.560
And I do these things, and
when you do talks like this,

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.040
you're asked to start with
talking about who you are.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.470
So who am I?

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:57.220
I am a national recovery
advocate, national recovery

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.590
speaker.

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:04.000
I am a national recording
and touring artist, musician.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.290
I have a documentary that's
being filmed about my story.

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:10.390
Some of the guys
are here right now.

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:12.730
I have an album that
is out right now

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:15.160
that you could
download on iTunes,

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.780
you could stream it on Spotify.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.640
You could buy this
album anywhere music is

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.250
sold these days.

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.410
And so I was taught
that that's who I am.

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:26.140
When I started to think
about my first intro,

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.000
those are the first
things that I put down.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.290
Society teaches us that
that is who we are.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:38.013
But for me, what I have to
remember, first and foremost--

00:21:38.013 --> 00:21:39.680
this might not make
sense to everybody--

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.710
but for me, what I
have to remember first

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:47.320
and foremost is that I am a
person in long-term recovery,

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.540
that I am a grateful
recovering addict.

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:53.260
I have to keep that first
because all of the things

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.210
that I listed before--

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:58.120
the accolades, the titles,
any of those things--

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:04.290
those are all just gifts
of my recovery, just gifts

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:06.360
of keeping this recovery first.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:07.920
And if I get this
twisted and I put

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.260
any of those things
ahead of my recovery,

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.000
I know what will happen.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.340
When I speak in front of a
group of people in recovery

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.710
and I say that, anything I
put ahead of my recovery,

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:18.610
what will happen?

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:21.510
They'll all say in
unison, you'll lose it.

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:23.975
And I will say no,
that's not true.

00:22:23.975 --> 00:22:24.850
I don't believe that.

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:26.330
I will not lose it.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:28.550
I will give it away.

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:29.660
I will not lose it.

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:30.650
I will give it away.

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:31.960
I've seen it.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.450
I've done it.

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:38.350
I didn't lose half a million
dollars in a couch cushion

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:40.730
somewhere.

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:46.550
I didn't absentmindedly leave
that record label that Caroline

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:48.528
was talking about,
the recording studio

00:22:48.528 --> 00:22:49.820
where that album was recorded--

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.830
I didn't absentmindedly
leave those things

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:55.040
in the back of the cab one
day when I was in a hurry.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.680
And I didn't misplace some
of my dearest relationships.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.170
I didn't lose those things.

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:02.830
I gave them away.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.730
I gave them away in bars.

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:07.953
I gave them away in
basements, in bathrooms,

00:23:07.953 --> 00:23:10.120
and on the back streets of
the west side of Chicago.

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:15.220
I said that I am a person
in long-term recovery.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.470
I also said that another
way of saying that

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:20.380
is a grateful recovering addict.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.680
When I was sitting in treatment
four and 1/2 years ago,

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.430
I heard for the first
time someone come in

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:26.830
and refer to themselves as a
grateful recovering addict.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.330
Now some people,
when they say that,

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:31.570
they just mean they're living
with an attitude of gratitude.

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:33.340
Other people say
that, and they truly

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.810
mean that they are
grateful for this disease.

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:39.930
They're grateful
for this affliction.

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:41.918
And I am now one
of those people.

00:23:41.918 --> 00:23:43.960
Couldn't have imagined it
four and 1/2 years ago,

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.377
but I could stand
before you today

00:23:45.377 --> 00:23:48.350
and say that I am actually
truly grateful that I

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:51.640
am an addict in recovery, that
I have this affliction, that I

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.710
have this disease,
because for me, it

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:55.990
took getting to those depths.

00:23:55.990 --> 00:24:00.610
For me, it took getting to
that bottom, not being saved.

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:05.200
It took getting there,
to my own personal hell,

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.990
for me to finally
have the strength

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:13.342
and the courage to actually,
truly change my life.

00:24:13.342 --> 00:24:14.300
I do a lot of this now.

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.700
I talk to a lot of
people, and I see

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.992
that most, if not all people
are addicted to something.

00:24:17.992 --> 00:24:21.830
And some of it's maybe
better than others.

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:23.770
But it could be
something like Facebook,

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:26.012
or should I say Google?

00:24:26.012 --> 00:24:27.470
CAROLINE DEHNERT
MOYER: Technology.

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:29.220
JAM ALKER: It could
be-- yeah, technology.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:29.963
It could be porn.

00:24:29.963 --> 00:24:32.380
It could be what's in your
pantry or in your refrigerator.

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:33.010
Could be work.

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:37.030
There might be a few workaholics
in this room right now.

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:39.212
Now my disease of
addiction, as we'll

00:24:39.212 --> 00:24:41.170
talk about a little bit
further, came from some

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:42.212
of the underlying trauma.

00:24:42.212 --> 00:24:42.950
I was miserable.

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:43.690
I grew up miserable.

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.982
There was something inside
of me that just never, ever,

00:24:45.982 --> 00:24:47.530
ever felt right.

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:49.210
The reason why I
say I'm grateful

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:51.017
is that if I wasn't
one of those people,

00:24:51.017 --> 00:24:52.600
if I was instead one
of the people who

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.130
came home at the end
of the day miserable,

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:55.547
and just flipped
on the television

00:24:55.547 --> 00:24:57.160
and zoned out until
I went to bed,

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.260
and did it the next
day and the next day,

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:02.770
I would have gone through my
whole life being miserable,

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:06.160
But not quite miserable
enough to actually change.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:10.820
So I'm grateful.

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.010
I'm grateful that this
thing took me to that place

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:14.280
where I truly changed my life.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.610
And I have truly
changed my life.

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:19.340
So talking about this
journey of recovery,

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:23.120
it started for me four
and 1/2 years ago,

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:27.630
curled up on a plastic
mattress in a detox facility.

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.750
I was shaking.

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:31.460
I was puking.

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.800
My bones were aching.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.330
Dehydrated .

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:40.940
This is what feeling dope sick
is, withdrawing from heroin.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.080
Numb.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:46.750
And I was shitting
myself, not figuratively,

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:50.300
literally shitting myself
laying on this plastic mattress.

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.300
And I remind myself of
that, and I talk about it

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.570
in front of people all the time.

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:55.070
It's important that
I talk about it.

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:57.340
It's important that I
remind myself of that

00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:00.490
because the way this disease
of addiction works is it

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:02.960
makes me want to believe that
I could go back out one more

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:03.460
time.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:08.250
Just-- I'm sure that four and
1/2 years, that's a long time.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:09.790
I could probably be all right.

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:11.830
Just one night of partying.

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:13.660
How bad could that be?

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.180
But I work a program
of recovery now.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:20.980
And because of that, I know that
if I were to do that, at best,

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:24.130
at absolute best, I would end
up back on that plastic mattress

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:25.420
in a detox facility.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:29.410
More likely, I
would end up dead.

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:32.620
I would end up dead leaving
a beautiful, six-year-old

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:35.950
daughter without a father.

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:40.060
And my daughter, she
not only deserves

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:41.710
to have a clean
and sober father.

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:46.557
She deserves to have a
father that is above ground.

00:26:46.557 --> 00:26:48.640
But coming to terms with
that when I was out there

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.120
was not easy.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.300
It was not easy to
concede this battle.

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.280
Coming to terms with
that fact that I

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:58.713
couldn't battle my disease
into submission was not easy.

00:26:58.713 --> 00:27:00.130
So the way I had
to look at it was

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:02.470
like a nation that went to war.

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:04.190
If a nation goes
to war, and they

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:06.092
are fighting against
a superior opponent,

00:27:06.092 --> 00:27:08.050
they can fight, they can
fight, they can fight.

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:11.200
No matter how hard they
fight, they cannot win.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.880
Superior opponent.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.170
Fight and fight, cannot win.

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:16.190
They're left with two options.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:19.140
One is to die.

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:23.610
Two is to surrender.

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:27.320
And that's what finally
had to happen with me.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:30.170
Understanding the
disease of addiction,

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:33.950
understanding that it
was a superior opponent

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:36.620
that I could not beat.

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.030
Die or surrender.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:40.550
Once I finally
surrendered to that,

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:42.230
things finally started
to change for me.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:51.850
When I was 30 years old,
I had the record label.

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:53.080
I had the recording studio.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.970
I had toured the
country, played in front

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:57.940
of thousands of screaming fans.

00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:59.070
I had a lot of money.

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:01.390
Wasn't quite a millionaire,
but I was well on my way.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:04.030
Had all of these things, these
things that people would say

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:05.240
make you very successful.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.110
You're living your dreams.

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.880
That's what I always wanted.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.390
I wanted to be a rock star,
I wanted to have money,

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:09.932
I wanted to have
all of these things.

00:28:09.932 --> 00:28:12.850
And at 30 years old, I
became a heroin addict.

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:15.310
At 30 years old,
I became a junkie

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:18.720
having all of those things.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.120
How does that happen?

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:30.410
All of this material success
and becoming a heroin addict,

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:33.450
it happened because I
was miserable inside.

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.220
I don't want to get into
a lot of the details,

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.115
but there was a lot
of family trauma,

00:28:40.115 --> 00:28:43.040
the horribly
explosive upbringing.

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.050
One of my first memories
in life is my dad

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:49.250
walking towards me wide-eyed,
blood gushing down his face.

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:50.810
Memory I can place
chronologically

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:52.490
directly before
that, one of my mom

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:54.230
smashing a whiskey
bottle over his head

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:55.850
to stop his violent advances.

00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:59.460
The first time I got blackout
drunk I was seven years old.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.010
The first time I
smoked weed was also

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:02.218
the first time I did cocaine.

00:29:02.218 --> 00:29:03.565
I was nine years old.

00:29:03.565 --> 00:29:04.940
By the time I was
in ninth grade,

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:08.450
I had done everything
except for crack and heroin,

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:11.430
by ninth grade.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:12.630
Why did I do these things?

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:16.440
I was numbing myself to
that underlying pain, a pain

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.810
that I didn't know
how to deal with.

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:21.660
And I'd been told by
society that these things,

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.280
these successes on
the outside world,

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.320
were going to be the
things that fixed them.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.440
And they didn't.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.388
But at this point, I
didn't understand it.

00:29:28.388 --> 00:29:30.180
And I dropped deep into
a heroin addiction,

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:32.763
and over the course of the next
five years, I lost everything.

00:29:32.763 --> 00:29:36.040
I lost all the money,
the recording studio,

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:36.780
the record label.

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:38.525
I lost all of these things.

00:29:38.525 --> 00:29:39.900
And at the point
where I was just

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:44.542
about to pawn my guitar, which
was my last worldly possession,

00:29:44.542 --> 00:29:45.750
I decided I needed some help.

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:46.670
I went to my doctor.

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:47.940
He put me on some medication.

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.565
He told me I needed
to go to treatment.

00:29:49.565 --> 00:29:51.300
I said no thank you, Dr. Cook.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.140
I'm not an addict.

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.100
I don't need to go to treatment.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.087
I can figure this out.

00:29:54.087 --> 00:29:55.170
What are my other options?

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:57.090
He said Jam, if you're not
going to go to treatment,

00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:59.507
at least you need to start
going to these 12 step meetings

00:29:59.507 --> 00:30:02.160
that you've heard of.

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.440
To please him and to
please my loved ones,

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.080
I went to a 12 step meeting at
a place called the Mustard Seed

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.750
here in Chicago, a very famous
place where they hold these 12

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:11.340
step fellowship meetings.

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.365
I walked in, sat in
the back of the room,

00:30:13.365 --> 00:30:15.490
stayed away from everybody,
looked around the room.

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:16.830
No, I'm not one of these people.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:17.740
There's no way.

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:20.500
I'm not an addict, no.

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.080
I just need to get
my shit together.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.850
I'll figure this out.

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:26.790
I sat through the meeting
looking for all the differences

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:29.340
rather than the similarities.

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.390
By the end of the meeting,
I convinced myself

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:32.710
I wasn't one of those people.

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:34.440
I left the meeting
and I went back

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:38.100
out for another seven years, the
worst seven years of my life,

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.350
the worst seven years
of active addiction,

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:43.920
the worst seven years
of being a junkie.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.100
Lost everything.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:47.100
Did horrible things.

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:50.580
Lied to people, cheated,
stole, manipulated,

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:54.870
whatever I needed to do
to get that next one.

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:57.110
When I finally
did surrender four

00:30:57.110 --> 00:31:00.400
and 1/2 years ago, checked
myself into a treatment center,

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.260
I still had this
ego inside of me.

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.640
And I sat down
with my counselor.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.515
Her name was Nanette.

00:31:04.515 --> 00:31:09.520
I said, Nanette, I need you
to bottom line this for me.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.190
I know I'm in a unit
with 30 other guys,

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:13.990
but I'm a lot smarter than them.

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:15.560
I'm a lot more
successful than them.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.260
So I just need you to
sit here and bottom line

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:18.718
it for me so I can
get out of here.

00:31:18.718 --> 00:31:20.240
I need you to give
me the secret.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.560
And she kind of laughed
at me, and she said, OK,

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.310
what's the secret that
you're looking for?

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:26.030
I was like, Nanette,
I need the secret.

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:28.030
You just need to tell me
how to stop doing drugs

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:28.947
and I'll be on my way.

00:31:28.947 --> 00:31:31.960
And she laughed at
me, and she said, Jam,

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.360
drugs are not your problem.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.980
Drugs are not your problem.

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:40.942
And I said Nanette, I have just
checked myself into a rehab.

00:31:40.942 --> 00:31:42.650
I've just checked
myself into a treatment

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:43.820
center for drug addiction.

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.590
Of course drugs are my problem.

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:47.420
That is why I'm here.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.030
And she said, Jam, drugs
are not your problem.

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:52.430
Drugs are your solution
to your problem.

00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:57.990
Drugs are not my problem.

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:01.190
Drugs were my solution
to my problem.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:04.920
And thinking back on it, it's
horrible fucking solution

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:05.680
to the problem.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.830
It didn't work.

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:10.530
All evidence was
to the contrary.

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:14.820
But this disease makes
you keep going back there.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:17.100
Now I hear this
all the time now,

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:19.680
being surrounded by recovery,
the drugs are not your problem.

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.040
Drugs are your solution
to your problem.

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.280
But at that time, it was
the first time I heard it.

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:24.760
And it was mind-blowing.

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.520
It was an epiphany
kind of moment.

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.050
Yes.

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:29.290
Drugs are not my problem.

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:31.020
They are the solution
to my problem.

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:34.020
My problem was me.

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:38.060
My problem was
that I kept trying

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:41.210
to solve what was
going on inside of me

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:42.780
with things in
the outside world,

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:49.130
whether it was fame, ego,
money, girls, relationships.

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:50.597
I had this empty
hole inside of me.

00:32:50.597 --> 00:32:52.430
No matter what I did
to try to fill it with,

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:54.555
those outside things, I
always woke up the next day

00:32:54.555 --> 00:32:57.185
with that empty hole.

00:32:57.185 --> 00:32:58.060
And I think about it.

00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.310
You know, this is something
we're conditioned towards,

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:02.417
right, from the
moment as kids we turn

00:33:02.417 --> 00:33:05.000
our attention to the television,
to the internet, to anything,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.060
we are told to buy, buy our
way out of our problems.

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:09.140
We become consumers.

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:11.010
We're told when we're
kids to buy this toy

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:12.177
and life's going to be good.

00:33:12.177 --> 00:33:14.570
Buy this game, things
will be good as teenagers.

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:15.950
Buy these shoes
or these clothes,

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:16.640
you're going to fit in.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.890
As adults, you buy this
house, you get this job,

00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:20.630
you're going to be happy.

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:22.160
This is what we're taught.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:25.100
And for someone like me, I
feel like I never had a chance.

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:26.800
Being as miserable
inside as I was,

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.300
I don't think there's some kind
of big conspiracy out there.

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:32.000
But companies need to
sell their products,

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.382
so they need to tell you
that you're miserable,

00:33:34.382 --> 00:33:36.590
and if you buy their stuff,
you're going to be happy.

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:37.900
And I was miserable.

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:41.032
And I bought into that
time and time again.

00:33:41.032 --> 00:33:42.740
And again, this is
one of the reasons why

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:46.070
I'm so grateful that I
was taken to these depths

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:48.100
because it was in a
place like treatment

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:54.770
where Nanette said to me
that the problem was me, not

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:55.270
the drugs.

00:33:59.313 --> 00:34:00.730
So when I was
there, and I started

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:02.710
to listen to the people
who had what I wanted,

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:05.680
people who were far
smarter than me, finally

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.320
did surrender, and
turned that light

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:12.620
inward rather than shining
it outward for the answers,

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:15.040
my life truly started to change.

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:19.780
I started to heal some of
those underlying traumas.

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:24.190
Recovery is not about
abstaining from drugs,

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:26.650
abstaining from alcohol.

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:31.840
Recovery is about rebuilding
your life, your inner world,

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.940
in a way that you
are happy enough

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:38.389
that you don't need
to numb yourself

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:43.010
through drugs, through alcohol,
through porn, through food,

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:46.159
through work, through gambling,
through any of these things.

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:49.670
That is what recovery is about,
healing that underlying trauma,

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:52.730
whatever it might be, so we
can stop that numbing behavior.

00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:59.410
I'm going to end with this.

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.590
As I said, my life is surrounded
by recovery these days,

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:07.560
so I spend a lot of
time hearing stories

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:11.140
from my brothers and sisters in
recovery of their backgrounds,

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:13.050
their upbringings,
their stories that

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:14.730
brought them to their knees.

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:19.080
And I see or hear about some
horrible, horrible, tragic

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:22.470
things that they've done,
that they've been through,

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:26.040
that they've used to cope with
the hand they've been dealt.

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:31.800
Now my story does not
include any jail time.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.770
My story does not
include any homelessness.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.030
That is the way in which my
story may be a little different

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:43.905
than some of the other
stories you might hear

00:35:43.905 --> 00:35:46.560
told by folks who have been
through similar experiences

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.520
to me and are now in recovery.

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.270
So those are the
ways that my story

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:52.770
might be a little different
than the other ones you'll hear.

00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:54.930
But I have a friend
of mine who is also

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:56.850
in this 12 step
fellowship who taught

00:35:56.850 --> 00:36:00.540
me to find the similarities
and to stay away

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.430
from the differences.

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:06.540
And the way that I am the
same as every other person

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.210
in recovery, the way that I am
the same as every person who

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:11.730
is still in their
active addiction--

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:15.030
the way that we're are the same
is that we have a disease that

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:18.060
wants to kill us.

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:23.660
I have a disease that
wants to kill me.

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:26.000
But because of the
recovery program

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.170
that I work, because I come
and do things like this,

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:33.140
because I keep myself
involved, because I

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:36.260
am of service to others, giving
of myself, asking nothing

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:41.210
in return, I get what we
refer to as a daily reprieve

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:43.970
from the disease of addiction.

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:46.280
And because of that,
I can confidently

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:51.770
say to you and to my disease,
it will not kill me today.

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:52.687
Thanks.

00:36:52.687 --> 00:37:02.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:03.963
CAROLINE DEHNERT
MOYER: All right.

00:37:03.963 --> 00:37:06.380
I don't know if we have any
questions on the Dory, Lauren,

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.150
if you want to
put that up there.

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:10.430
But I could certainly
talk to Jam all day, so I

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:13.460
got a lot of questions myself.

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:15.320
If you do have
questions in the room,

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:17.030
if you could go up
to the mics, that

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:20.840
would be helpful
just for the folks

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:25.290
that are on the Livestream that
wouldn't be able to hear you.

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:26.160
Come on.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.520
Yesterday there were
a million people.

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.210
All right.

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:31.377
AUDIENCE: I'll give you one.

00:37:31.377 --> 00:37:32.275
My name's Peter.

00:37:32.275 --> 00:37:33.150
JAM ALKER: Hi, Peter.

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:37.500
AUDIENCE: And I work a
lot with the mentally ill.

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.810
My brother has schizophrenia.

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:42.480
And as you said, we
all find ourselves

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.850
in addictions of different
things, be it caffeine,

00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:46.800
give it exercise,
whatever it is.

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:56.190
And the world and language likes
to compartmentalize things.

00:37:56.190 --> 00:38:00.630
And you were saved by
this wisdom of this woman.

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:04.620
So my question is,
I still struggle

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:09.720
with helping explain
people addiction,

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:16.670
substance abuse, mental illness,
all of these taglines, disease.

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:22.740
And I started this
path in the late '80s.

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:27.210
And it's changed a lot with
mental illness, schizophrenia,

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:28.680
bipolar, depression.

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.720
I think it's more talked about.

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:34.830
But maybe you could shed
some light on-- both of you--

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:39.480
can shed some light on
the words people put

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:43.912
to these different things
that we all struggle with.

00:38:43.912 --> 00:38:45.120
That would be helpful for me.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:45.620
Thank you.

00:38:47.038 --> 00:38:49.330
CAROLINE DEHNERT MOYER: Peter
is a good friend of mine.

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:51.860
Peter, my first reaction is--

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.370
and I don't know
if this is right--

00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:55.662
but my first reaction is it
doesn't matter what anybody

00:38:55.662 --> 00:38:57.630
else wants to put a label on.

00:38:57.630 --> 00:39:00.450
It matters for you
and your brother how

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:04.370
you guys live in
the family together

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:07.135
and the words that
you use with him.

00:39:07.135 --> 00:39:08.760
I'm going to tell
you something, Peter.

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:12.900
At your wedding, your brother
stood up and spoke for you

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:13.740
at your wedding.

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:18.780
And you said to him, thank you
for making me a gentler man.

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:21.870
And that relationship you have
with your brother, the words

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:25.710
that anybody else wants to
put on his disease, that

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:27.500
doesn't matter.

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:29.760
So that's my first
reaction, and I love you,

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:32.700
and you're a very
good brother to him.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.830
The second thing is--

00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:36.630
and I'm actually
curious your thought

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:38.680
on this-- we were talking
about this yesterday.

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:42.480
Folks were saying,
I am not bipolar.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.140
I am not an addict.

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:47.760
I am somebody who struggles
with this disease.

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.790
You called yourself a junkie.

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:53.640
What do the words mean
for you, and how would you

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:56.947
want somebody to talk to you?

00:39:56.947 --> 00:39:58.530
JAM ALKER: So I think
underlying that,

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:00.630
and underlying
what you're talking

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:09.280
about with the weight that's
put on certain words, what we're

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:13.240
really getting at
here is stigma, right,

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:15.520
because the words
don't necessarily

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:20.050
matter unless there's a
negative connotation behind some

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:22.030
of the words.

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:25.780
So in that sense, I think it's
very important to do everything

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:30.100
that we can to
reduce the stigma.

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:33.970
And we do that by
doing things like this,

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:37.703
coming and putting ourselves out
there, ripping ourselves open

00:40:37.703 --> 00:40:39.370
and being the ones
who are willing to be

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:48.850
vulnerable to show people
we're all essentially the same.

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:52.880
We've all got our damage.

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.520
We've all got our
trauma underneath.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.570
It's manifested differently
for each person.

00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:58.540
Some people, maybe,
are a little bit better

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.150
at hiding it than others.

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:03.910
But we all have that pain
to one degree or another.

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:06.490
So yeah, you are correct.

00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:10.030
Saying I am a person
in long-term recovery,

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:14.380
I am a person who struggles
with issues of addiction,

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:17.770
I am a person with a
substance use disorder

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:22.077
are the politically
correct ways of saying it.

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:26.640
For me, I don't know.

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:31.380
Maybe because I like to be a
dramatic storyteller, to say

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:33.360
I was a junkie.

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:34.110
I was.

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:41.670
But that-- like
anything, my underlying

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:44.520
belief in all of this is that
none of us are bad people.

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.890
We are people who make
bad decisions at times.

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:52.180
And people who are in an
addiction make bad decisions.

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:53.510
They're not bad people.

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:57.910
In active addiction, did I
make a lot of bad decisions?

00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:59.410
Fuck yeah.

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:00.700
A lot.

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:03.700
But I know I'm not a bad person.

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:08.340
So the semantics are less
important to me than maybe

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:09.730
to some other people.

00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:11.657
It's the same thing
with your brother

00:42:11.657 --> 00:42:12.990
who's struggling with the issue.

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:18.390
You know, these are all
behavioral health issues,

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:23.430
whether it's straight up mental
illness or addiction, which

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:30.960
is a form of behavioral or
mental disease, whatever

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.180
wording you want
to put behind it.

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:34.810
But because it's
behavioral, where

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:37.380
there are certain times
of people act out,

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:39.528
it's looked at differently.

00:42:39.528 --> 00:42:41.820
There are people who are
like, it's the same as cancer.

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:43.810
It should be treated
as the same as cancer.

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:45.690
It's true to a degree.

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:47.940
But if you had
cancer, you wouldn't

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:50.940
go out and rob somebody for your
chemotherapy medicine, right?

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:53.610
You wouldn't act
like a fool to be

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:58.823
able to go out and get your
insulin if you're a diabetic.

00:42:58.823 --> 00:43:00.240
So yes, it's the
same in the sense

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.323
that they're all diseases.

00:43:01.323 --> 00:43:05.640
But because this is behavioral,
we can act like assholes.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.840
We could do bad things.

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:13.260
So I just think
that it's important

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:16.290
that what's talked about
is that underlying it,

00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:18.150
we're all good people,
we're human beings,

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:20.730
and we need to be treated
with respect and understanding

00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:25.320
and empathy for what
we're going through.

00:43:28.857 --> 00:43:30.190
CAROLINE DEHNERT MOYER: Gregory?

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:31.360
AUDIENCE: Hey there.

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:33.030
Thanks for being here.

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:34.630
Stories are amazing.

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:36.150
I've learned a lot.

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:38.260
Two-part question.

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:39.420
First part's really simple.

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:40.830
Are you touring?

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:43.290
You're a touring musician now.

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:47.490
How on earth do you do
that with your disease

00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:51.960
because shows, the
grind of being on tour

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.800
and what you're around.

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.440
JAM ALKER: Yeah, it's
a great question.

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:55.620
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:57.960
So please help me understand
how you manage that.

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:02.320
JAM ALKER: So what
you're taught in recovery

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:06.310
is if you are truly working
a program of recovery,

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:09.880
that the obsession to
use should be lifted.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:13.400
The compulsion to
use will be lifted.

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.270
It's one of the things
that's called the promises

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:19.840
within certain fellowships.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:22.180
Would I have toured in the
first year of my recovery?

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:23.860
Absolutely not.

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:26.800
But I am at the
point in my recovery

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:31.900
where I am comfortable being
in a bar, being around alcohol.

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:34.540
Do I allow myself to be
surrounded with drugs?

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:36.470
No, absolutely not.

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:42.190
But people who are doing
drugs or using drugs

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:43.753
can pretty quickly get a vibe.

00:44:43.753 --> 00:44:45.170
When they know
you're in recovery,

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:47.670
they're not about to try to do
those things in front of you.

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:50.500
But as far as being around
weed or being around alcohol,

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:55.400
I'm around it quite a
bit when out on the road.

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.590
But I work a program.

00:44:56.590 --> 00:45:00.520
I really, truly have done
the work to understand.

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:03.910
One of the simple CBT,
cognitive behavioral therapy

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:07.280
things they teach you early
on is play the tape forward.

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.430
It's like what I talked
about, how I would end up

00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:11.890
on that plastic mattress in
a detox facility, or more

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:13.120
likely, dead.

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:17.140
I know where that will lead me.

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:19.190
And I have this
amazing life now.

00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:20.310
And I don't mean that--

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:24.883
I have a lot of amazing
outside things happening.

00:45:24.883 --> 00:45:27.050
Financially, with my music
career, with my speaking,

00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:28.680
these are amazing things.

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.800
But I have this
amazing life because

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:36.830
of what's happened inside of me,
this psychic, spiritual change

00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:39.740
that has occurred inside of
me, turning that light inside.

00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:41.093
I don't want to lose this.

00:45:41.093 --> 00:45:42.260
This is the most important--

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:45.180
I'm happy for the
first time in my life.

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:48.530
And I know where that will
lead me, and it's just--

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:50.270
it's not appealing.

00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:51.950
It's not an answer, right?

00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:53.460
It was not the problem.

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:55.610
It was my shitty
solution to the problem.

00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:56.780
And I know that now.

00:45:56.780 --> 00:46:00.796
I know that at my core.

00:46:00.796 --> 00:46:02.483
Does that make sense?

00:46:02.483 --> 00:46:04.150
CAROLINE DEHNERT
MOYER: I would chime in

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:05.358
with one little thought here.

00:46:05.358 --> 00:46:08.500
I know in my household,
my husband and I,

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:09.640
we drink a lot of wine.

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:12.190
We host Thanksgiving every year.

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:14.025
My brother comes, and
we go around the table

00:46:14.025 --> 00:46:15.550
and we talk about what
we're thankful for.

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:17.530
And his thing that he's
thankful for that day

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:19.120
is that he's sober.

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:22.770
And I often think
with my husband,

00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:24.430
should we be putting
this wine out?

00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:29.703
And I know if he's going to do--

00:46:29.703 --> 00:46:31.120
he could go to
Howard and Western.

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:32.620
I mean, he could
go anywhere, right?

00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:34.370
If he wants to do it,
he's going to do it.

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:36.870
It doesn't matter if I got a
wine bottle on my table or not.

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:40.000
So he's going to make the choice
that day whether he's doing it

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.650
or not.

00:46:41.650 --> 00:46:42.692
AUDIENCE: Thank you both.

00:46:42.692 --> 00:46:44.358
JAM ALKER: And that's
beautiful that you

00:46:44.358 --> 00:46:46.930
say that because that speaks
a lot to the family recovery.

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:49.210
You are no longer trying to
fix, manage, and control.

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:51.490
That idea that
you could save him

00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:53.710
by not having the
wine out that day

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:57.160
is just feeding into the
disease, the co-dependency, all

00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:59.410
of those things that you
learn about in the fellowship

00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:00.640
that you're a part of.

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:03.172
I think that's amazing.

00:47:03.172 --> 00:47:05.130
AUDIENCE: Thank you guys
both for your stories.

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:06.600
Ooh, my heart's beating so fast.

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:07.860
CAROLINE DEHNERT MOYER: Our
hearts are beating fast, too.

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:09.480
So you're in good company.

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:10.530
JAM ALKER: Yes.

00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:12.390
AUDIENCE: I have two
individuals in my life

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:16.470
that are both alcoholics, and
I am expecting my first child.

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:17.550
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:19.050
CAROLINE DEHNERT
MOYER: Please, cry.

00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:21.580
I promised my husband
that I was going to cry.

00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:22.478
So you can do it.

00:47:22.478 --> 00:47:24.270
AUDIENCE: Oh, good,
I'm glad I'm not alone.

00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:27.220
And they very much want to
be a part of our baby's life.

00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:28.770
And we've tried to
help in the past,

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:30.810
and I think we just feel
a bit at a loss of how

00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:33.480
to help them at this
point because they are--

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:36.450
I think they don't accept the
fact that they have a disease,

00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:38.320
and we recognize
that it's a disease.

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:42.240
And we've lost other friends
and family to alcoholism.

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:43.260
But I think--

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:46.740
I would love any sort of advice
with family members or friends

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:49.080
who are suffering
from addiction, how

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.720
to be the most
helpful when I want

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:53.455
them to be a part
of the baby's life

00:47:53.455 --> 00:47:54.580
and our life in the future.

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:58.320
But I don't want the negative
effects of their alcoholism

00:47:58.320 --> 00:47:59.920
to be a part of
the child's life.

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:02.212
So it's something we're
thinking a lot about right now,

00:48:02.212 --> 00:48:05.590
and I'd love any advice you
have on how to be supportive.

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:07.590
CAROLINE DEHNERT MOYER:
Come Wednesdays at 2:00.

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:09.850
We do an Al-Anon
meeting here at Google.

00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:10.690
There's only 37.

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:11.340
AUDIENCE: I will be there.

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:13.007
CAROLINE DEHNERT
MOYER: You could be 38.

00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:20.100
Part of it is you setting
up your own boundaries.

00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:22.320
One of the things I
struggle with with Al-Anon

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:27.000
is we talk about you can't
change this other person.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.150
You are powerless
over their disease.

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:35.070
And I can't totally get with
that 100% because I do think

00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:38.100
some of the things I've done
have certainly enabled him

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:39.700
and prolonged it.

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:43.390
Some of the other things I've
done, like say I love you,

00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:45.870
but I'm not coming to
take you to the ER today

00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:47.610
have also helped him.

00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:51.634
So I think boundaries,
am I right?

00:48:51.634 --> 00:48:53.232
JAM ALKER: Mm-hmm.

00:48:53.232 --> 00:48:54.940
CAROLINE DEHNERT MOYER:
It's really hard.

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:56.790
I feel like if
somebody is not ready,

00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:59.405
you can't be like, why don't
you go to an AA meeting?

00:48:59.405 --> 00:49:01.530
I mean, I can tell you how
many times I tried that.

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:05.150
I would go to an AA
meeting with you, brother.

00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:05.730
And I would.

00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:08.520
Actually, if he
asked me, I would go.

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:13.078
But I'm not going
to drag you there.

00:49:13.078 --> 00:49:13.620
I don't know.

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:14.870
What other advice do you have?

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:18.750
It's tough when the
person is not ready.

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:19.590
JAM ALKER: OK.

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:23.760
This is a great
topic, and each person

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.800
is going to have their
different point of view.

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:30.280
And I look at it, like I do
with addiction, as a spectrum.

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:34.380
There's this idea of tough love
and this idea of soft love,

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:36.210
and there are
consequences to either,

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:42.330
right, that if you
engage in tough love,

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:43.950
you still have these boundaries.

00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:45.780
I love you.

00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:47.200
Come back when you're ready.

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:47.700
All right?

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:50.310
So the potential
consequence to that

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:53.490
is that they could end up
getting lost to their disease.

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:57.158
They could end up dying
as a result of that.

00:49:57.158 --> 00:49:58.950
The other side of the
soft love is you keep

00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:00.750
providing them with things.

00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:04.640
The consequence of that is
it's enabling them, which

00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.240
could end up killing them.

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:09.492
So the common
denominator here is

00:50:09.492 --> 00:50:11.200
they could end up
dying as a result of it

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:13.950
because it's their problem.

00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:18.760
So this is about self-care,
you taking care of yourself,

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:21.970
you deciding what you can live
with, what's best for you,

00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:27.460
and taking care of yourself and
that baby that's inside of you.

00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:30.723
Now my point of view, I
lean-- and most addicts

00:50:30.723 --> 00:50:32.140
and alcoholics who
are in recovery

00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:35.110
lean to the tough
love side of things.

00:50:35.110 --> 00:50:38.840
I wish that I had been
given less enabling.

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:41.560
And the point is, you
tell them, I'm sorry.

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:42.130
I love you.

00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:44.890
I'd love you to be a part
of this child's life.

00:50:44.890 --> 00:50:49.000
When you're done, and you're
ready to be sober in recovery,

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.100
come be a part of their life.

00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:54.617
That could possibly be the thing
that makes them like, shit,

00:50:54.617 --> 00:50:56.450
I do want to be a part
of this child's life.

00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:59.030
I need to do this.

00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:01.390
Maybe not.

00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:03.263
The other side of
it, in your case,

00:51:03.263 --> 00:51:04.930
kind of, from what
I'm hearing from you,

00:51:04.930 --> 00:51:06.808
is you make concessions.

00:51:06.808 --> 00:51:08.350
You let them be a
part of their life.

00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:10.373
What's the downside for them?

00:51:10.373 --> 00:51:12.540
Why would they need to
change their behavior at all?

00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:15.990
They're getting
everything they want.

00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:19.090
Consequence of the tough love,
they might say forget it,

00:51:19.090 --> 00:51:21.850
and they are not involved
in your life from that point

00:51:21.850 --> 00:51:24.020
forward.

00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:27.013
There's no easy answer.

00:51:27.013 --> 00:51:28.430
CAROLINE DEHNERT
MOYER: My brother

00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:30.800
would tell me the worst
thing you could ever

00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:33.320
do for an addict
is give them money.

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.720
In other words, don't enable me.

00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:38.810
I'm going to ask you for money.

00:51:38.810 --> 00:51:40.730
Just don't give it to me.

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:44.180
So that tough love is so hard
as the person that loves them

00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:46.440
because when I sent
that text and I said,

00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:48.260
ER sounds like a good
idea if you need to.

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:48.850
I love you.

00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:49.730
JAM ALKER: So good.

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:52.460
CAROLINE DEHNERT MOYER: I
mean, I was dying inside.

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:54.755
It's like, I hope he makes
it through the night.

00:51:54.755 --> 00:51:57.440
And you don't own whether
that person makes it

00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:58.477
through the night.

00:51:58.477 --> 00:52:00.060
AUDIENCE: This has
been super helpful.

00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:00.685
Thank you guys.

00:52:03.453 --> 00:52:04.870
CAROLINE DEHNERT
MOYER: All right.

00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:05.778
Hi.

00:52:05.778 --> 00:52:06.320
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:07.940
My name is Gabby.

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:10.010
Thank you for
sharing your stories.

00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:12.140
Really, thank you.

00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:15.850
My brother has been addicted
to heroin for about 16 years,

00:52:15.850 --> 00:52:17.900
so half of his life.

00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:20.910
And there's been a lot
of hatred between us

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:24.170
and throughout the siblings
in the larger family.

00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:26.330
And it's been really
hard for not only

00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:30.950
me to show him that I love him,
but to feel any sense of love

00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:32.450
from him.

00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:36.020
So I just wanted to ask,
while you were struggling

00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:41.030
with your addiction, underneath
all of that addiction

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:45.260
and disease, did you still
feel that love for your family?

00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:49.070
And in what ways were you hoping
that they could show you love?

00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:59.500
JAM ALKER: The love, I
don't think, goes away.

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:02.890
But it is absolutely
overridden by shame.

00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:12.400
I felt, and I'm sure your
brother feels, so much shame

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:15.250
for what he's doing
to himself and what

00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:16.420
he's doing to his family.

00:53:18.930 --> 00:53:21.180
I'm sure that the
love is not gone.

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:26.000
I don't believe that it
has the ability to be gone.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.390
Love is eternal.

00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:29.200
Love is infinite.

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.510
It's there.

00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:33.972
It's just buried so
deep behind the shame,

00:53:33.972 --> 00:53:35.430
and oftentimes it's
that shame that

00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:37.555
keeps the cycle of addiction
going because there so

00:53:37.555 --> 00:53:38.920
much pain that goes with that.

00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:42.240
And here's the thing
with, with opiates.

00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:46.110
Opiates are physical
painkillers,

00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:50.460
but they're also
emotional painkillers.

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:55.830
So we start to use opiates,
and that pain goes away.

00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:57.630
Not forever, temporarily.

00:53:57.630 --> 00:54:00.400
And it becomes less
and less as we go on.

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:04.170
But I can't imagine
that it's not there.

00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:06.690
But the conflict, obviously,
from your side of things

00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:08.880
comes from the fact that
you love him so much

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:11.010
and you want what's
best for him.

00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:14.940
And I can't be sure, but
I'd be willing to bet

00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:21.960
that from his side of things,
there is a lot of guilt, shame,

00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:24.780
remorse, self-loathing.

00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:30.420
And so that, I'm sure,
manifests in ways

00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:32.520
that appear as though
the love is gone.

00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:35.460
But I don't I don't think it is.

00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:37.620
So he's in active addiction now?

00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:38.760
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:42.460
JAM ALKER: And is he
interested in getting help?

00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:43.290
AUDIENCE: No.

00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:44.400
JAM ALKER: OK.

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.080
Is he in Chicago?

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:46.820
AUDIENCE: No.

00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:49.290
We're from the Philadelphia
region originally.

00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:50.280
JAM ALKER: OK.

00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:51.900
Is he out by Kensington?

00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:52.710
AUDIENCE: No.

00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:54.060
JAM ALKER: Thank God.

00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:55.567
AUDIENCE: Trenton, New Jersey.

00:54:55.567 --> 00:54:56.150
JAM ALKER: OK.

00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:58.340
Not much better, but yeah.

00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:04.760
That's a lot of opiate
addiction happening out there.

00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:06.900
CAROLINE DEHNERT MOYER:
But Gabby, for you,

00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:10.580
as the sister, what
I would say is--

00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:14.610
I do this-- I think I did it
with my brother even this week.

00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:15.520
I go hey, Carl.

00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:16.770
I know you don't work Mondays.

00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:18.710
You want to come
over for dinner?

00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:21.000
And I actually got a
response, but usually I

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:21.940
don't get a response.

00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:24.730
But I call it trickling love.

00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:28.770
And I don't expect much
back, but I just trickle it

00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:30.840
out there, like I'm still here.

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:32.370
I still love you.

00:55:32.370 --> 00:55:37.380
But you have to be able to know
you might not get stuff back.

00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:40.470
But it feels good to do it
because it feels good for you

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:44.650
to express and reach out.

00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:46.020
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:48.270
CAROLINE DEHNERT MOYER:
There's a question on the Dory

00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:49.660
here from Becky
in San Francisco.

00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:51.715
I'm going to read the
bottom one here, Jam.

00:55:51.715 --> 00:55:53.340
My heart breaks to
hear about the abuse

00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:54.210
you witnessed and suffered.

00:55:54.210 --> 00:55:56.085
Do you still have relation
with your parents?

00:55:56.085 --> 00:55:57.990
Feel free to answer
or not answer.

00:55:57.990 --> 00:56:00.180
I'm mostly interested
in the second question

00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:03.000
here, which is how has this
experience changed or affected

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.120
you as a parent?

00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:05.940
JAM ALKER: That's great.

00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:08.700
Unfortunately,
both of my parents

00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:16.290
passed away when I was in
my active addiction, which

00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:19.732
thank god I have a
program of recovery

00:56:19.732 --> 00:56:20.690
now, including therapy.

00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:22.500
When I start talking about
this program of recovery,

00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:23.160
what does that look like?

00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:24.630
I'm part of the 12
step fellowship.

00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:26.190
I also do therapy.

00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:27.990
I do meditation.

00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:29.670
I make sure that I
work out, do yoga,

00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:32.430
all of the different things.

00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:35.520
Of service to others as much
as possible to have some sort

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.106
of spiritual connection.

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:43.650
Because of that, I've
been able to deal

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:48.150
with the issues of my
parents both passing while I

00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:50.910
was in active addiction.

00:56:50.910 --> 00:57:01.400
As far as how it's changed
or affected me as a parent,

00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:08.050
I make sure that my daughter--

00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:15.670
she's very sensitive as it
is, anyway, but I've never

00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:17.688
raised my voice at her.

00:57:17.688 --> 00:57:19.480
I mean, luckily she's
a real sensitive kid.

00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:22.630
So I can give her a
certain look and she

00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:27.960
knows that she's
making bad decisions.

00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:30.120
That's the other I was
talking about before.

00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:32.028
No bad people,
just bad decisions.

00:57:32.028 --> 00:57:33.820
Talking with my daughter,
one of the things

00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:36.430
that I've taught her with
all this work that I've done,

00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:39.430
is when we're watching
a show, and there's

00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:44.250
a show where there's a bad
guy, it's not a bad guy.

00:57:44.250 --> 00:57:47.010
He's a guy who
makes bad decisions.

00:57:47.010 --> 00:57:48.760
So we'll be watching
a movie or something,

00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:51.340
and that's the bad guy in the
cartoon, and she'll be like,

00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:52.750
is that the bad decision guy?

00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:58.750
CAROLINE DEHNERT MOYER: Do
you remember we were talking--

00:57:58.750 --> 00:58:01.270
because I fear the same
thing with my kids.

00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:04.780
And my husband and I
talk fairly openly.

00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:08.650
My husband has a niece who's
recovering from a heroin

00:58:08.650 --> 00:58:10.150
addiction, is in jail right now.

00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:13.300
And we talk about Aunt
Ashley is in jail,

00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:15.850
and she made some bad decisions
and she punched a police

00:58:15.850 --> 00:58:17.950
officer, and now she has
a felony on her record

00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:19.148
and she's serving her time.

00:58:19.148 --> 00:58:20.940
And we're going to go
visit Ashley in jail.

00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:24.310
And I kind of have
this mode of like,

00:58:24.310 --> 00:58:27.580
I put a little bit too
much information out there

00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:29.710
because I believe
they need to have it.

00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:32.950
I don't put it all out there,
but I put just a little bit out

00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:34.900
there.

00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:38.248
I was walking with my daughter
in downtown Evanston recently,

00:58:38.248 --> 00:58:39.415
and I go, do you smell that?

00:58:39.415 --> 00:58:40.370
And she's like--

00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:41.980
I go, that's marijuana.

00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:43.820
She's like, what's marijuana?

00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:44.990
It's a drug.

00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:47.590
And I mean, I'm pretty--

00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:50.420
and then you have
the conversation.

00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:52.600
But the thing you said
to me that I remember

00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:54.340
when we talked about
this was my kids

00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:56.950
will be drug tested
fairly early on.

00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:57.970
And I was like, really?

00:58:57.970 --> 00:58:58.470
How old?

00:58:58.470 --> 00:59:01.180
How old would you get
your daughter drug tested?

00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:02.555
JAM ALKER: I think
we'll probably

00:59:02.555 --> 00:59:05.332
start once she starts
high school, possibly

00:59:05.332 --> 00:59:06.040
a little earlier.

00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:09.150
I think it depends,
to a certain degree,

00:59:09.150 --> 00:59:10.790
on the behavior of the kids.

00:59:10.790 --> 00:59:14.230
But what we talked
about, my friend

00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:16.220
Jennifer Flory who's here--

00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:19.720
we've talked about this a lot--

00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:26.030
is things that parents
can actually literally do

00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:29.737
with their kids to
help in this situation

00:59:29.737 --> 00:59:31.070
where I'm worried about my kids.

00:59:31.070 --> 00:59:32.830
What can I actually do?

00:59:32.830 --> 00:59:37.670
And one of the things we suggest
is to, when your child just--

00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:41.270
early teens, OK, we
drug test in this house.

00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:42.710
Sometime over the
next six months

00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:44.210
and sometime in
the next six months

00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:45.830
after that, you'll
get a drug test.

00:59:45.830 --> 00:59:47.330
It's just like going
to the dentist.

00:59:47.330 --> 00:59:48.710
I'm not accusing
you of anything.

00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:50.510
It's just something
we do in this family.

00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:51.480
We drug test, right?

00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:52.980
And they have to
remain accountable.

00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:56.132
Then if behavior does start
to happen that's questionable,

00:59:56.132 --> 00:59:58.340
it's not that you're starting
to drug test them then.

00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:00.760
It's like, well, why are you
doing this now, mom, dad?

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:01.260
What's up?

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:02.370
Well, you don't trust me?

01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:04.860
No, this is just
something that we do.

01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:05.630
So yeah.

01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:07.088
There are a lot of
different things

01:00:07.088 --> 01:00:13.250
that my addiction, and
more so my recovery,

01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:15.560
has done to sort of
inform me of the decisions

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:18.370
that I'm making now with
my child at six and will

01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:19.040
moving forward.

01:00:22.647 --> 01:00:24.480
CAROLINE DEHNERT MOYER:
Any other questions?

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:25.800
I don't think there's
anything on the Dory.

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:26.925
If someone's coming-- yeah.

01:00:26.925 --> 01:00:27.540
Please.

01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:32.220
AUDIENCE: So you talked a lot
about accepting the addict.

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:35.700
And I'm pretty
comfortable around that.

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:37.270
My brother's an addict.

01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:40.950
He's pretty active.

01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:44.250
Can you give advice for
talking to family members who

01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:47.850
perhaps enable?

01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:54.190
He's in and out of jail, and my
parents can't let go, you know?

01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:59.260
And they can't move
forward or accept.

01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:01.060
They're very much
in denial about

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:06.340
what's really going on despite
the overwhelming evidence.

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:08.380
How do you bridge
that conversation

01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:12.790
with other family
members who can't seem

01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:17.492
to let go of what's happening?

01:01:17.492 --> 01:01:19.200
CAROLINE DEHNERT MOYER:
It's really hard.

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:22.930
I mean, my mom is
enabler number one.

01:01:22.930 --> 01:01:29.610
And I think I probably took
the last 20 years to figure out

01:01:29.610 --> 01:01:32.610
how to be a sister.

01:01:32.610 --> 01:01:34.822
And I saw something
pop up on my phone.

01:01:34.822 --> 01:01:36.780
It was like, your Porsche
is ready for payment.

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:38.155
I'm like, I don't
have a Porsche.

01:01:38.155 --> 01:01:39.670
I'm like, oh, that's his car.

01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:40.350
OK.

01:01:40.350 --> 01:01:42.150
Why am I on the thing for--

01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:44.310
and I was like, maybe
I should just pay it.

01:01:44.310 --> 01:01:45.480
He needs a car.

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:48.150
So I still struggle with that.

01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:52.170
And as a parent, I think it's
probably exacerbated 10X.

01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:54.420
This is your child.

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:58.170
So I don't know.

01:01:58.170 --> 01:02:03.780
Al-Anon, talking about it,
hearing from other parents

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:06.780
how they accept.

01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:09.570
I mean, think the thing that
really blows my mind as I

01:02:09.570 --> 01:02:12.900
think about it is if we can--

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:15.150
getting back to that
unconditional love,

01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:18.060
we're not saying, mom,
don't love your son.

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:20.290
You will always love
that kid no matter what.

01:02:20.290 --> 01:02:24.330
But you have to set
some boundaries so

01:02:24.330 --> 01:02:28.550
that they can hit that bottom.

01:02:28.550 --> 01:02:32.750
And hopefully they make
it through the night.

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:33.630
It's tough.

01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:35.463
JAM ALKER: Yeah, I think
it's really common,

01:02:35.463 --> 01:02:38.210
what you're talking about, to
be a family member who sees it

01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:39.940
and then see the parents.

01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:40.750
And I can imagine.

01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:43.083
And my daughter-- like you're
saying, how much harder it

01:02:43.083 --> 01:02:45.760
must be for a parent.

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:49.540
I would echo what you said.

01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:52.270
Is there any way that you
could get your parents

01:02:52.270 --> 01:02:56.020
to go to an Al-Anon meeting
or anything like that

01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:58.780
to start talking about it?

01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:01.900
AUDIENCE: It's strange
because his behaviors

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:03.610
are obvious to me.

01:03:03.610 --> 01:03:05.420
But for them, it's denial.

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:08.130
They make excuses after excuse.

01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:11.248
He got arrested
because the cops are--

01:03:11.248 --> 01:03:13.165
CAROLINE DEHNERT MOYER:
After him or whatever.

01:03:13.165 --> 01:03:16.040
AUDIENCE: Right, yeah, and
all of that kind of stuff.

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:20.110
And I see it firsthand.

01:03:20.110 --> 01:03:22.720
He doesn't hide
it as much for me.

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:26.200
He hides it from them.

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:29.920
And I also struggle
with telling them

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:35.680
what I see firsthand because
they're elderly parents.

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:40.000
I don't want them--
and I also don't

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.490
want my brother to
start hiding it from me

01:03:42.490 --> 01:03:44.230
because for some
reason, I feel like me

01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:49.840
knowing what's really going on
is almost useful in many ways.

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:52.750
And there was a long period
where he did hide it from me,

01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:55.420
and steal and all
of those things.

01:03:55.420 --> 01:04:01.960
And I have this conflict of
sharing information with them

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.520
while also trying
to protect them

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:09.040
while also trying
to get them to stop

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:14.110
paying for lawyers to get him
out of jail and all of that.

01:04:14.110 --> 01:04:18.290
So they're really,
really in denial about

01:04:18.290 --> 01:04:19.825
what's really going on.

01:04:19.825 --> 01:04:21.200
And I don't know
whether you have

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:23.870
advice on whether I
should start sharing

01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:27.800
more of what he's really doing.

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.030
You know what I mean?

01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:30.380
I don't want to shock them.

01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:34.700
But at the same time, they're
so oblivious to what's really

01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:39.860
going on and continue to do
things that are probably not

01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:42.180
that helpful to his recovery.

01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:48.480
JAM ALKER: Do you think
they're open to hearing it?

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:50.160
AUDIENCE: I've brought
it up many times.

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.070
JAM ALKER: You
have brought it up.

01:04:51.070 --> 01:04:51.360
AUDIENCE: Yeah, oh yeah.

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:51.510
Absolutely.

01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:52.170
JAM ALKER: And they
just see denial.

01:04:52.170 --> 01:04:54.420
So maybe they don't want
to hear it from you,

01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:56.140
which is why I was asking.

01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:58.140
There are family
groups, parents' groups.

01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:00.130
Like I said, my friend
Jennifer who's here runs

01:05:00.130 --> 01:05:02.580
a parents' and a family group.

01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:05.740
You talk to her about potential
resources of other people

01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:08.190
because maybe it's not
best they hear it from you.

01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:09.870
But do they need to hear it?

01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:10.500
For sure.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.990
But maybe from a peer, somebody
who's going through it.

01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:15.030
So oh, I used to
think my kid was--

01:05:15.030 --> 01:05:16.573
the cops were out for him.

01:05:16.573 --> 01:05:18.240
But then I saw this
and I realized this.

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:19.560
And they're like, oh
yeah, I've seen that.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:20.495
I've realized that.

01:05:20.495 --> 01:05:21.370
You know what I mean?

01:05:21.370 --> 01:05:23.970
There might be defenses
that come up if you say it,

01:05:23.970 --> 01:05:26.522
whereas if they were able to
hear from another parent who's

01:05:26.522 --> 01:05:28.230
going through what
they're going through,

01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:29.888
would they be open to that?

01:05:29.888 --> 01:05:32.430
AUDIENCE: You know, they're very
old school in the sense that

01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:33.660
they don't--

01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:35.700
especially outside people.

01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:38.730
And there's the stigma of it.

01:05:38.730 --> 01:05:40.110
I don't think
they've even talked

01:05:40.110 --> 01:05:42.540
to anyone outside of
our immediate family

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:44.310
about the situation.

01:05:44.310 --> 01:05:47.820
And that's part of why
I've tried to talk to--

01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:51.940
and we've all caught
him red-handed.

01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:54.690
And that's where they
constantly give him

01:05:54.690 --> 01:05:56.250
the benefit of the doubt.

01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:58.390
And then he gets in
trouble with the law.

01:05:58.390 --> 01:06:02.632
And it's very much I've
had this conversation of I

01:06:02.632 --> 01:06:03.840
understand you're the parent.

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:08.910
But it's not helping him to
get out of jail right now.

01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:13.160
But then the flip
side is I can't

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:15.600
go to sleep at night
knowing he's in there

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:18.800
and I have some way of
helping him to get out.

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:21.000
And all those thoughts
go through their head

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.880
of what is happening to him
in jail and all of that.

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.510
So the next day they
call the lawyer.

01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:30.110
You know what I Mean
And I don't know.

01:06:30.110 --> 01:06:31.910
I feel like I'm in
an endless loop.

01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:33.368
CAROLINE DEHNERT
MOYER: This is why

01:06:33.368 --> 01:06:35.960
they call it a family addiction
because so many people are

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:37.040
brought in.

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:39.710
I think it was my therapist
that said to me once,

01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:43.310
it is possible for one person
in the system of the family

01:06:43.310 --> 01:06:47.030
to so radically
put up boundaries

01:06:47.030 --> 01:06:49.490
that you can help change
other people in the family.

01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:53.990
But it's-- I feel you, man.

01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:55.790
I feel you.

01:06:55.790 --> 01:07:00.470
Gabby and me and you, we can
get together, and Jennifer here

01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:03.035
if you want to talk to her
about her family program.

01:07:03.035 --> 01:07:03.660
AUDIENCE: Sure.

01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:04.400
Thanks.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:07.050
JAM ALKER: Thank you.

01:07:07.050 --> 01:07:08.580
CAROLINE DEHNERT
MOYER: Come on up.

01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:10.050
AUDIENCE: I have two questions.

01:07:10.050 --> 01:07:15.470
One, once the addiction
and everything

01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:17.630
that you've masked to cope
with your past trauma,

01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:20.480
once that's gone, you
can you talk a little bit

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:26.638
about the things that you
do to recover from trauma?

01:07:26.638 --> 01:07:27.680
I know you talked about--

01:07:29.767 --> 01:07:31.100
CAROLINE DEHNERT MOYER: It's OK.

01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:35.920
Jam and I have talked about
trauma and that being part

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.410
of the underlying--

01:07:38.410 --> 01:07:42.100
talking about trauma and
talk therapy, I think,

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:44.170
is part of the solution.

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:49.340
AUDIENCE: And then
another question.

01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:50.567
What do you do when--

01:07:50.567 --> 01:07:52.150
JAM ALKER: Can you
go back to the mic?

01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:53.210
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:07:53.210 --> 01:07:54.668
CAROLINE DEHNERT
MOYER: You got it.

01:07:54.668 --> 01:07:56.390
AUDIENCE: What do
you do when your--

01:07:56.390 --> 01:08:01.195
we hear about families who
are a little bit too involved.

01:08:01.195 --> 01:08:03.320
But what do you do when
you have family members who

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:10.327
don't acknowledge,
and kind of ignore?

01:08:10.327 --> 01:08:12.410
CAROLINE DEHNERT MOYER:
My eldest brother is like,

01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:14.390
peace out.

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:17.380
And I have to respect that, too.

01:08:19.162 --> 01:08:21.620
My husband I were talking about
this on the way in the car.

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:25.460
I'm like, goddamn it, why can't
he just-- he is a brother, too.

01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:28.920
Can't he be part
of the solution?

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:31.130
And that's my own
anger, and it's my own

01:08:31.130 --> 01:08:32.660
why can't he do this?

01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:35.399
And you know, they're
going to do it

01:08:35.399 --> 01:08:36.649
or they're not going to do it.

01:08:36.649 --> 01:08:40.550
And they may have their own
reasons for peace-ing out.

01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:45.670
I find for me,
it's just a matter

01:08:45.670 --> 01:08:48.580
of accepting that that's
what they have chosen to do

01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:50.890
for whatever their reasons are.

01:08:54.703 --> 01:08:55.370
JAM ALKER: Yeah.

01:09:02.230 --> 01:09:05.130
The question that you
asked about trauma

01:09:05.130 --> 01:09:08.279
and the way in which you
asked the question, and then

01:09:08.279 --> 01:09:11.490
your sort of visceral
reaction to it,

01:09:11.490 --> 01:09:16.149
makes me want to respond
by saying in 12 minutes,

01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:18.689
could you and I maybe talk
off to the side about it

01:09:18.689 --> 01:09:20.250
a little bit further?

01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:21.399
Would you be OK with that?

01:09:21.399 --> 01:09:21.899
OK.

01:09:21.899 --> 01:09:22.399
Thanks.

01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:25.840
I

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.069
CAROLINE DEHNERT MOYER: I
think that's a good place

01:09:27.069 --> 01:09:28.180
to-- oh, Jenny.

01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:29.180
JAM ALKER: No, one more.

01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:29.950
Come on, Jenny.

01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:32.060
AUDIENCE: 11 minutes.

01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:33.170
[INAUDIBLE] any more.

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:35.020
I'm so short.

01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:39.880
I'm wondering and curious,
just on a broader, I guess,

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:42.399
point of view on the
legalization of marijuana

01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:45.609
and how that could
potentially increase

01:09:45.609 --> 01:09:49.000
the likelihood of
addiction, especially I

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.460
have kids, 13- and 14-year-old.

01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:53.330
All of their
friends are smoking.

01:09:53.330 --> 01:09:54.680
They're smoking on the bus.

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:56.800
They're smoking
waiting for the bus.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.710
Some of them have never
had a sip of alcohol.

01:09:59.710 --> 01:10:01.570
They're just smoking.

01:10:01.570 --> 01:10:06.100
So just the sense of that,
certainly from a parenting

01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:08.080
perspective, but
also your journey

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:11.570
and whether or not marijuana
played a part in that.

01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:16.150
And also just the
correlation between, I guess,

01:10:16.150 --> 01:10:22.320
the illegality of drugs and the
draw, and whether legalization

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:26.998
takes some of it away in terms
of it being fun and exciting.

01:10:26.998 --> 01:10:29.290
JAM ALKER: So this is something
that I'm really, really

01:10:29.290 --> 01:10:31.180
passionate about.

01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:32.920
Caroline mentioned
that I go and speak

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:35.560
at high schools and
middle schools about drug

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:37.130
and alcohol education.

01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:38.980
There's a lot in
what you just said.

01:10:43.290 --> 01:10:44.940
Trying to pull it
apart a little bit,

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:47.340
yes, this is very common
that you're seeing kids

01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:50.730
these days with the vapes.

01:10:50.730 --> 01:10:53.940
And this is not the weed
that we grew up with.

01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:56.220
I know I'm probably the only
one in this room who ever

01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:59.600
smoked a joint back in the day.

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:00.560
I know it's just me.

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:02.280
But if you'd heard
stories about it,

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:05.000
that joint that you smoked
versus what's in these vapes

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.380
is very different.

01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:09.330
The THC content is
so concentrated,

01:11:09.330 --> 01:11:11.890
it's insane, the stuff
that's out there these days.

01:11:11.890 --> 01:11:13.830
But regardless of
that, let's just

01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:16.590
say that it's the
old school ditch

01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:19.110
weed that used to be out
there, or drinking beer.

01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:22.450
The idea in high school
is it's not a big deal.

01:11:22.450 --> 01:11:23.250
It's just weed.

01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:24.780
It's just alcohol.

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:25.978
It's not a big deal.

01:11:25.978 --> 01:11:27.270
The fact of the matter is this.

01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:29.370
The younger you
are when you begin

01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:32.280
experimenting with drugs
and alcohol, the more likely

01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:34.590
you are to become an addict.

01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:36.330
The younger you
are when you begin

01:11:36.330 --> 01:11:39.060
experimenting with drugs
and alcohol, the more likely

01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:40.780
you are to become an addict.

01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:41.370
This is fact.

01:11:41.370 --> 01:11:42.630
This is science.

01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:45.510
I talked about first time I
got blackout drunk I was seven.

01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:47.940
First time I smoked
weed when I was nine.

01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:49.620
Combination of that
and all the trauma--

01:11:52.890 --> 01:11:56.580
everyone's different,
but this is my story.

01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:57.180
OK.

01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:01.590
So should kids be smoking
weed or drinking alcohol?

01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:02.490
Absolutely not.

01:12:02.490 --> 01:12:05.050
Their brains are
not fully developed.

01:12:05.050 --> 01:12:07.080
This is a critical
time, and in that time

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:10.350
and in those teenage years, the
areas of the brain that develop

01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:12.810
are the areas that
include the consequence

01:12:12.810 --> 01:12:15.390
centers of the brain,
things that lead

01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:17.430
towards addictive behavior.

01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:19.710
Some of the ways that you
process these emotions,

01:12:19.710 --> 01:12:22.290
process traumas,
all of these things,

01:12:22.290 --> 01:12:25.380
they're finding more and
more, lead towards addiction

01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:28.290
and are stunted by the use of
drugs and alcohol early on.

01:12:28.290 --> 01:12:29.910
So that speaks to that, right?

01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:30.600
Done.

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:33.960
Now the issue of
legalizing weed or not,

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:37.580
legalizing any drug or not.

01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:41.810
If you are 18, you
are 21, you are not

01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:45.020
an addict or an alcoholic,
do whatever you want.

01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:47.090
Have fun.

01:12:47.090 --> 01:12:50.060
If you can go out there and
smoke crack on the weekend

01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:52.700
and come back and be a
beautiful, loving, supporting

01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:55.495
human being that is involved
in society, I don't care.

01:12:55.495 --> 01:12:56.870
I don't have a
problem with that.

01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:01.290
Same with weed
being legal or not.

01:13:01.290 --> 01:13:03.550
I prefer it being legal.

01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:06.510
It's regulated, it's
taxed, it pays some bills,

01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:08.160
all the rest of that.

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:10.200
For people who are not
like me, who are not

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:12.330
addicts, who have
the ability to handle

01:13:12.330 --> 01:13:14.890
it just like a glass of
wine every once in a while.

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:19.380
Look, addiction is
defined as the inability

01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:23.910
to stop a behavior despite
negative consequences.

01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:26.760
A negative behavior that
you cannot stop that you are

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:30.390
compulsively continuing to
engage in despite negative

01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:31.157
behaviors.

01:13:31.157 --> 01:13:33.240
If you're engaging in a
behavior and there are not

01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:35.930
the negative consequences,
it's not an addiction.

01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:36.480
So cool.

01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:39.860
That's my answer.

01:13:41.523 --> 01:13:42.940
CAROLINE DEHNERT
MOYER: All right.

01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:44.937
Like all good joint
Al-Anon AA meetings,

01:13:44.937 --> 01:13:47.020
we're going to end with
the serenity prayer, which

01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:48.510
I actually had to write down.

01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:49.420
JAM ALKER: I got it memorized.

01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:51.337
CAROLINE DEHNERT MOYER:
He's got it memorized.

01:13:51.337 --> 01:13:53.650
If anybody knows it,
please speak it with us.

01:13:53.650 --> 01:13:58.930
So God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot

01:13:58.930 --> 01:14:02.540
change, the courage to
change the things I can,

01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:06.250
and the wisdom to
know the difference.

01:14:06.250 --> 01:14:06.850
Thanks

01:14:06.850 --> 01:14:11.383
[APPLAUSE]

01:14:11.383 --> 01:14:12.550
JAM ALKER: Thanks, you guys.

01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:14.400
Thank you.
