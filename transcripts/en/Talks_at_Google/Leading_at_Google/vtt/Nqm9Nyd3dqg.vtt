00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:11.510
SCOTT ANTHONY: Thank you, Jane.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.864
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:13.864 --> 00:00:14.905
AUDIENCE: Good afternoon.

00:00:14.905 --> 00:00:16.680
SCOTT ANTHONY: There
was a pregnant pause

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.430
before I said anything there,
so let's try that again.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.510
I am going to try and make
this interactive as we

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.920
go through the materials here.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.440
I will be pulling you
into the conversation,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.670
and I will have time
at the end for Q&amp;A.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.561
So we do need people to
provide cues when I ask for it.

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:31.560
So let's try that again.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.009
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:34.050
AUDIENCE: Good afternoon.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.330
SCOTT ANTHONY: A very
trainable, malleable audience.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.360
I like that a lot.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.430
Well, I am thrilled to be here.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.550
I've been in the innovation
field by my count

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.350
for about 18 years now.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.720
And I've spoken at
a few Google events,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.560
but I've never actually been
inside a Google campus, which

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.280
I find rather astonishing.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.470
So today is my first day.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.000
Thank you for having me.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.680
I am thrilled to
share with you some

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.500
of our thoughts about leadership
lessons from the trenches

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.070
of disruption.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.550
The way I decided to
organize today's remarks

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.050
is in five acts.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.570
Act one is the origin story.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.000
This starts with
contemplating a question

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.130
that I ask people to
think about all the time.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.920
If a young person asked
you, what should I

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.550
do if I want to change the
world, how do you respond?

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.850
I asked you, who came to this
event, to answer this question.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.910
And I've asked now about
2,000 people around the world

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.400
this question over
the last few years.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.200
What kind of responses
do people give?

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.710
Well, the dominant response
today is to start a company.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.740
Almost 40% of the people
that I've asked this

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.290
question to give
that as their answer.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.870
And 50% of you said
the same thing.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.240
That is the perception
that people have.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.820
You do what Steve
Jobs and Steve Wozniak

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.950
and Larry and Sergey
and others did.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.320
You go and create a new company.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.870
Become a teacher is
another popular answer.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.360
Almost 30% of people say that.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.160
Go and join a
not-for-profit comes

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.730
in third in the poll
with 17% of people

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.180
saying this is the path to
go and change the world.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.460
We're left with two at
the bottom of the barrel.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.310
Either join a great big company
or enter public service.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.300
I am sad to report that
public service is the lowest

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.670
ranked response in my survey.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.260
It used to be a
little bit higher,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.320
but it's declined pretty sharply
over the past couple years.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.180
I can't think of
any global events

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.780
that lead to that happening.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.720
But now only 8%
of people say this

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.240
is what you do if you
want to change the world.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.430
But I want to look at this
number for just a second.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.010
Only 9% of people say do
what you have all done.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.570
Google today, of course,
is not a startup company.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.330
It is a great big global giant.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.330
People say this is not the path
that you should follow if you

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.390
want to change the world.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.670
I thought this.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.450
The reason I moved out
to Singapore in 2010

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.610
wasn't to take the
consulting business

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.560
that I'd helped build
in the United States

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.760
and bring it to Southeast Asia.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.300
No, I was going to leave
that part of our business

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.110
behind, where we advise great
big companies on how they can

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.160
navigate disruptive change and
joined a sister company that we

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.550
had set up called Innosight
Ventures, whose intent was

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.650
to invest in and
incubate startup

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.740
companies, because, after all,
I wanted to change the world.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.060
And that's what you do, right?

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.060
You enter the
entrepreneurial ecosystem.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.150
Well, in October 2010
I had a paired set

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.880
of experiences that
showed me I had

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.580
framed the problem incorrectly.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.990
That, in fact, the
best thing to do

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.970
if you want to
change the world is

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.740
to do exactly what you have done
and join a great big company.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.080
I call this the
Parable of Plunify

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.660
and the Might of
the Multinational.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.380
Let me start with Plunify.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.010
Plunify was a startup
company that pitched us

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.160
for funding in October 2010.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.030
The details of
Plunify don't matter.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.150
The important part
of the story is

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.890
it was the first
time we were pitched

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.419
for funding not with a business
plan, but with a business.

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:58.710
What's the difference, you ask?

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.560
Well, a business plan
is facts and figures

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.560
and slides and spreadsheets.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.440
A business is customers.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.080
A business is a website.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.600
A business is actual revenues.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.550
The two kids
pitching for funding

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.420
had done all this,
spending basically $0.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.100
This is what the
world is like today.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.670
You can start a business
spending just about nothing.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.220
What were we looking for when
we were debating whether or not

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.080
to invest in Plunify?

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.000
We were looking for
what the world today now

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.430
calls unicorns,
privately held companies

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.980
worth more than one
billion US dollars.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.770
These are incredibly
sexy creatures.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.820
How sexy, you ask?

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.000
Well, a couple of years
ago, the dating app Tinder,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.580
which I, as a boring married
man with four children,

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.980
have heard about
but never used, they

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.350
released a report that
said, what can you do

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.980
or what occupation can you have
to increase the odds that you

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.840
get a right swipe on Tinder.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.460
Here are the results.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.900
Look at men first.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.700
Number one is pilot.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.220
Tom Cruise, Top Gun,
always been true.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.700
An incredibly sexy profession.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.280
Look at what's number two--

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.620
founder/entrepreneur.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.480
Back when I was in
the dating pool,

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.040
if you were to announce that you
were a founder or entrepreneur.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.930
That's a good way of telling
people that you have no job.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.870
But today, this is an
incredibly desirable profession

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.220
for both men and for women.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.040
So we're out hunting
for unicorns.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.740
We're considering this
investment in Plunify.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.600
A couple weeks later, I see a
very different kind of beast.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.330
I'm now in Durgapur in
the eastern part of India,

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.900
visiting something created
by a massive company.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.080
This is something
created by Medtronic.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.770
If you don't know
Medtronic, it is

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.430
the world's largest standalone
medical device company.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.890
Now, India should have
been its leading market.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.110
India sadly has
more heart disease

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.310
than any country in the world.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.100
One of Medtronics
flagship products

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.490
is the pacemaker, a device that
gets implanted in your chest

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.460
to regulate the flow of
electricity to your heart.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.520
But Medtronic sales in
India were minuscule.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.850
You spend five minutes in
India and you understand.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.030
Most people pay for health
care out of their own pocket.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.940
A $1,000 device is simply
unaffordable to many people

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.070
in India.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.070
Even worse, primary care
doesn't work that well in India.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.500
You might not know that
you need a pacemaker

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.330
even if you could afford it.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.160
Well, Medtronic,
truth in advertising,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.770
working with a consulting
team at Innosight,

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.650
came up with an innovative
way to crack this problem,

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.370
not by inventing new
technology, but by developing

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.000
a new business model called
Healthy Heart For All.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.400
Three key components
to the business model.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.200
First, direct-to-consumer
marketing,

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.450
like the truck
that you see here.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.960
Second, rural diagnostic
catch, where in an afternoon,

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.870
you could test 300
or 400 people to see

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.910
if they needed a pacemaker.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.160
Third and most
critically, the world's

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.850
first loan program for an
implantable medical device.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.690
Think about that for a second.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.990
If you go to a bank and take
out a loan for something

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.740
like a car, if you don't pay
the bank back, what happens?

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.760
What does the bank do?

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.750
They take the car back.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.370
They repossess the asset.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:07.990
If you get a loan
for a device that

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.600
gets implanted in your chest,
and you don't pay the loan

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.790
back, what does the bank do?

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.250
Recollection of repossession
is a little bit more

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.660
challenging in
those circumstances.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.140
But eight years later,
drafting on principles

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.810
proven in micro-finance,
community lending,

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.439
and so on, tens of
thousands of people

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:26.730
have been through this program.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.010
Hundreds of
bottom-of-the-pyramid consumers

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.400
have received loans.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.670
And there had been
virtually zero defaults.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.620
I came back from
Durgapur and thought

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.990
about these two experiences.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.450
When you first hear
the example of Plunify,

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:42.530
if you're inside
a large company,

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.210
you say, what hope do we have?

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.680
If you can start a business for
nothing, how can we compete?

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.060
Here's the challenge.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.040
If you were sitting
in a meeting listening

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.040
to that pitch from Plunify,
what would stop you

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.420
from copying that
idea in the market?

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:57.310
Nothing.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.680
Yes, it's never been
easier to start a business.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.600
But that also means
it's never been easier

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.770
to copy a business, which means
it remains brutally difficult

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.090
to scale one.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.130
Yes, we get the
unicorns that emerge

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.620
out, the Go-Jeks and the
Ubers and the Grabs and so on.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.710
But for every one
that succeeds, there's

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.560
hundreds if not
thousands that fail.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.210
Contrast that to Medtronic.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.240
I could tell you every single
detail of what Medtronic did,

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.460
every single detail, and
what could you do about?

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:26.500
Nothing.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.170
You don't have a
patent on a pacemaker.

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:32.110
You don't have access to
all the doctors in India.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.210
You don't have the
understanding of the market

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.740
that Medtronic does.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.809
There are literally
three companies

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:41.440
in the world that could
do what Medtronic did.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.570
As I reflected on
this, I realized

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.370
I had framed the
problem incorrectly.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.860
That, in fact,
what Medtronic did

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.320
and what other large
companies have done

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.440
is they have followed this
pattern of combining together

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.740
assets of scale with
entrepreneurial energy.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.990
That is the path to
changing the world,

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.900
that, in fact, large
companies that think and act

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.950
in the right way can be
massive agents of change.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.380
They can go and confront
what our co-founder, Clayton

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.740
Christensen, famously called
the innovator's dilemma,

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.510
and they can turn
it, like Medtronic

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:16.660
did, into the
innovator's opportunity.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.790
Act two, the challenge.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.410
It's easier said than done.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.180
I was giving a
speech in Singapore

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.520
a couple months ago
with a number of leaders

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.470
from big retailers
and big consumer

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.990
packaged goods companies,
and I asked them,

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:31.870
give me a word to
describe what makes

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:35.530
it hard to drive innovation and
growth in your organization.

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:39.380
And you can see this beautiful
word cloud that was created.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.460
I want to focus on this
word right here, inertia.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.950
In my mind, this is
the biggest challenge

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.140
for large organizations
that are seeking

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.312
to have impact at scale.

00:09:49.312 --> 00:09:50.770
And let me illustrate
the challenge

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:53.680
by telling you a story
about one of my children.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.984
This is my third child.

00:09:54.984 --> 00:09:56.650
You'll see others of
my children as I go

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:58.130
through the presentation today.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:01.207
This is my lovable
six-year-old goofball, Harry.

00:10:01.207 --> 00:10:03.040
So let me tell you a
little bit about Harry.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.470
Harry has a father, me,
who was born in America.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.340
His mother, my wife
Joanne, was born in the UK.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.630
Harry was fully
manufactured in Singapore.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.050
He was born here in 2011.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.180
You ask Harry where
he is from, he

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.550
is most likely to
respond to Mars.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.170
That's the kind of kid he is.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:22.760
He's a very creative,
very energetic kid.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.460
In fact, if you ask him
to draw a superhero,

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.000
he illustrates himself
as Captain Creative.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.410
Fun, loving kid.

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:31.450
His nickname at
school is Happy Harry.

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.170
Everybody loves him.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:37.420
So imagine our surprise about
18 months ago in Singapore,

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.870
we received a letter from
our condo association

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.690
describing an incident
involving Harry.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:45.580
Here is a copy of the letter.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.550
"As shared, your children were
found vandalizing the flooring

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:52.930
at the multi-play court using
some materials on 16 October

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:54.400
2016."

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.440
This being Singapore,
of course, the action

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.610
was captured in the CCTV
footage as appended below.

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:03.280
What do you think were
the materials that Harry--

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.390
and if you look very
closely at the picture,

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.900
you'll see there are
four fuzzy images there.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.899
Harry has two older
siblings and his father.

00:11:10.899 --> 00:11:12.940
What do you think were
the materials that we were

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.404
using on the multi-play court?

00:11:15.404 --> 00:11:16.070
AUDIENCE: Chalk.

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:17.070
SCOTT ANTHONY: Chalk is correct.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.030
It was a Sunday afternoon.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.654
The kids were bored
out of their minds.

00:11:19.654 --> 00:11:22.730
They said, can we go downstairs
and draw a baseball pitcher

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:25.550
diamond on the multi-play
court in the basketball court.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:26.690
I said, sure, why not?

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:27.530
No harm, no foul.

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:28.580
It's chalk from Smiggle.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.121
It's going to go
away pretty quickly.

00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:31.220
Let's go and do it.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.230
You see on down here,
"It is most fortunate

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:35.069
that our cleaners
have managed to remove

00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:36.110
the stains on the floor."

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.540
What do you think actually
removed the stains

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:39.700
on the floor?

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:40.700
AUDIENCE: Rain.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.890
SCOTT ANTHONY: Does it
ever rain in Singapore?

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:44.070
Every once in a while.

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.040
An hour after we drew
the baseball pitch,

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.120
the skies opened up.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.500
All the chalk was washed away.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.440
Yet still here, we received
this threatening letter

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.120
describing the horrid
behavior of our children.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.010
This is what happens to us.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:58.350
We enter the world
in a natural state.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:01.040
We are curious and
creative when we are born.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.860
And then we go to school, and
we learn there's a right answer,

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.190
and there's a wrong answer.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:06.520
We go to work in organizations.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.270
We learn there's a
right way to do things,

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.220
and there's a wrong
way to do things.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.070
Harry came after this and said,
should I not do that anymore?

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:13.970
Should I not go play?

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:15.050
Should I not experiment?

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:16.317
Should I not draw?

00:12:16.317 --> 00:12:17.900
To which we said,
of course you should

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.070
continue to do these things.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.950
But when you get
inside organizations,

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.120
you have real challenges.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.010
You're an executive like this.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.150
You know the statistics.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:28.130
Google has published
some of these things,

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:30.800
describing the benefits
that come from innovation.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.380
You know your shareholder
returns will go up.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.480
You know psychological
safety will increase

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.680
the performance of teams.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.230
You know these are things
that you want to do.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.840
You dream about being the
innovation super-hero that

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.000
can make all of
these things happen.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.940
But then you deal with
the power of inertia.

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.760
You deal with the existing
processes, your metrics,

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.310
your incentives, your norms,
your decision criteria,

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:56.330
and your strategy, all of which
pull you back to yesterday

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.300
and make it hard for you
to go and create tomorrow.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.400
You're not going to be
an innovation superhero.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.920
The best that you
can do is attempt

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.960
to break out Innovation Man.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.610
Who is Innovation Man?

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.234
Watch the video.

00:13:09.234 --> 00:13:11.222
INNOVATION MAN: I
am Innovation Man.

00:13:11.222 --> 00:13:16.192
I am here to get you all
fired up about innovation.

00:13:16.192 --> 00:13:18.174
Are you fired up?

00:13:18.174 --> 00:13:19.174
SPEAKER 1: I'm fired up.

00:13:19.174 --> 00:13:20.665
INNOVATION MAN:
Are you fired up?

00:13:20.665 --> 00:13:22.156
SPEAKER 1: I'm fired up.

00:13:22.156 --> 00:13:25.635
INNOVATION MAN: I
said are you fired up?

00:13:25.635 --> 00:13:26.629
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:28.617
INNOVATION MAN: Why
are you fired up?

00:13:32.096 --> 00:13:34.581
SPEAKER 1: I don't
have any idea.

00:13:34.581 --> 00:13:37.066
[INNOVATION MAN SCREAMS]

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:41.060
SCOTT ANTHONY: This is an IBM
commercial from 10 years ago

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:44.420
that is on YouTube if you want
to go and see the commercial.

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.860
This is based on a true story.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:49.220
About 12 years ago now, we were
working for a large health care

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.716
company in the United States.

00:13:50.716 --> 00:13:53.090
They said, what does it take
for us to innovate at scale?

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:54.440
We said it's complicated.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.260
There's a bunch of
stuff you got to do.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
You've got to go and
attack all of these things.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.718
You need a new
strategic direction.

00:13:59.718 --> 00:14:01.640
You've got to change
your metrics and so on.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.260
They said that
sounds complicated.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.700
Isn't there an easier answer?

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.340
So they' removed us as
consultant of record

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:09.440
and hired a
creativity consultant.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.180
They gave them a
seemingly simple answer.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.330
The answer they
provided was spandex.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.600
They suggested that everyone
on the top leadership team

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.930
dress up as their favorite
innovation superhero to show

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:24.860
the organization it was a new
day when it came to innovation.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.530
Predictably, this had
absolutely no impact.

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:30.710
Today, the only thing this
company is happy about

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:35.240
is 2006 when this happened
was before ubiquitous camera

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.670
phones, so there's no
photographic evidence

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:38.990
that this actually happened.

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:41.660
There is no innovation
superhero that's

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.220
going to ride to the rescue.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.830
If you are truly to
unleash all the power

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:48.740
inside your organization,
you need a different answer.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.986
Act three, the answer.

00:14:50.986 --> 00:14:53.360
I can't give you a problem
without giving you a solution.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.630
Let me introduce our latest
book, "Dual Transformation,"

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.630
which describes our view
for how you confront

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.800
the dilemmas of disruption.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.340
The answer is basically
in the title of the book.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:08.540
Transformation means a
change in form or substance.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.880
We're not talking about
doing what you are currently

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.840
doing a little better, a little
faster, or a little cheaper.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.840
We're talking about
a fundamental change.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.440
We're talking about
a liquid becoming

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.010
a gas, the organizational
equivalent of the caterpillar

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:23.810
becoming the butterfly.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.080
How do you do that?

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.130
Well, the answer here is
in the dual in the title.

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:31.010
We don't suggest that you
follow a monolithic change

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:33.050
effort where you do one thing.

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:34.730
Instead we suggest
that you follow

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:37.980
two parallel
transformation efforts.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.580
The first is what we call
transformation A, where

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.370
you reposition today's business
to make it more resilient.

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:47.060
I think the clearest global
example of this today

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.380
is Netflix.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.510
I was down in New Zealand
a couple of months ago

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:51.350
giving a talk.

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.270
I asked people, how many of
you subscribe to Netflix?

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.810
75% of hands go up.

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:00.200
Of course, a decade ago, that
would have been unimaginable.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.632
Netflix's business at the
time was delivering DVDs

00:16:03.632 --> 00:16:04.340
through the mail.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.160
Today, of course, most people
who are enjoying Netflix

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.470
are watching streaming
videos over the internet.

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:12.170
Netflix, of course, has
done other things as well,

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.900
moving from packaging other
people's content to selling

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.240
its own content,
allowing it today

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.290
to be one of the biggest
media companies in the world.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:22.530
Now it hasn't
redefined its industry.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:25.220
It's still a media and
entertainment company.

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.730
The end customer is still hiring
Netflix to do the same job

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.200
that it did before.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.210
But the way in
which it has done it

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:34.500
has fundamentally transformed.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.596
That's transformation A.

00:16:36.596 --> 00:16:38.720
Now, I'm taking since you
are at Google that you're

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.980
a pretty smart audience.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.910
Let me ask you the
killer question.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:43.970
If the first part of
dual transformation

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:48.700
is transformation A, what do
you think the second part is?

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.680
Transformation B. We only got
one person to respond to that.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.590
But still, that is
the correct answer.

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:56.890
Transformation B is where
you go and create tomorrow,

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.200
where you go and take
the capabilities that

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.440
make you special and
selectively leverage those

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.990
to go and build a
new growth engine.

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:07.300
Of course, this is what
Google-- as you pull up

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.891
to the alphabet level, this
is what you are trying to do.

00:17:09.891 --> 00:17:11.349
You're trying to
say that we've got

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:13.480
a core business or a
set of core businesses

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.000
that we're going to run as
efficiently, as effectively

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:16.962
as possible.

00:17:16.962 --> 00:17:18.670
And we're going to go
and place some bets

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.770
to bring us into new spaces.

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:22.420
This is the new
growth engine that

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:25.540
has the potential to create
the next wave of growth

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.430
for your organization.

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:30.250
There's one more part to the
dual transformation equation.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:33.100
Transformation A is
repositioning today.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.555
Transformation B is
creating tomorrow.

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:38.320
Note these two circles overlap.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.840
The idea that we offer
in dual transformation

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.480
is not unrelated
diversification.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.780
It's not saying you pick up
cash flow from one business

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.600
and you use it to invest in
a completely disconnected

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.650
business.

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:52.960
Instead we're talking
about wading straight

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.810
into the territory that
Christensen famously called

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:58.690
the innovator's dilemma
and finding a way to very

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:04.060
consciously, very carefully link
A and B together, where you go

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:07.420
and pick up those unique,
precious special assets

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.820
and break free of
that dilemma and use

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:12.940
them to do something that few
other companies in the world

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:13.860
could do.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.270
If the only thing you're
bringing to the equation

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:18.730
is cash flow, it's
a very hard game

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:21.830
to win in today's fiercely
competitive world.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:24.340
There's the basic idea
of transformation.

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:25.960
These are some of
the examples that we

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.030
have in the book and
some of the materials

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:29.350
we've done around the book.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.357
I'm going to give you
one of these examples,

00:18:31.357 --> 00:18:33.190
then I'll ask you to
pick another one for me

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:34.520
to share with you.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.484
So the one I'm going
to share is the one

00:18:36.484 --> 00:18:38.400
that we have in the first
chapter of the book.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:42.338
It is Janssen Anyone
know who Janssen is?

00:18:42.338 --> 00:18:43.730
AUDIENCE: Pharmaceutical.

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:45.050
SCOTT ANTHONY: Pharmaceutical
arm of Johnson &amp; Johnson.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:45.924
That's exactly right.

00:18:45.924 --> 00:18:48.620
So Janssen is a critical
part of Johnson &amp; Johnson.

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:52.640
It's about 30 billion of J&amp;J,
70 billion global dollars--

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.980
global revenue in dollars.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:58.970
So about 10 years ago,
the arm was in decline.

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:00.530
The unit was in decline.

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:02.930
Sales had declined for
two years in a row.

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.780
A number of its important
drugs were coming off patent.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:09.631
A new leader, Joaquin Duato,
launched a dual transformation

00:19:09.631 --> 00:19:10.130
effort.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:12.560
Transformation A was
change in the way

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.590
that Janssen developed
and discovered drugs.

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:18.560
Historically, what Janssen did
is got the best scientists it

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.810
could find, put them
in a laboratory,

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:24.230
and prayed that they would
discover some kind of molecule

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:27.110
that would ultimately lead
to a pharmaceutical drug.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:30.050
They relied on randomness,
hope, and hiring the best people

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:31.410
they could find.

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:33.450
They did two things differently.

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:35.630
The first thing they
did was to focus.

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.090
Rather than have people
work on anything,

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:40.490
they picked a select
few number of diseases

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:42.410
where they would
understand those diseases

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.540
at a very deep
level, so they could

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.760
focus their scientific effort.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:50.160
The second thing they did was
to embrace open innovation.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.610
There's no way Janssen
thought that we could possibly

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:55.440
have all of the best
scientists in the world.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.260
So let's get good, let's
get great at working

00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.960
with scientists
wherever they might

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.990
be, in research labs, in
universities, at startups,

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.980
and so.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.390
At the beginning
of the story, It

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:08.270
had the lowest R&amp;D
productivity in the industry.

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:10.100
Today, it has the highest.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.020
It hasn't redefined
its industry.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.850
It hasn't gone into new
markets as it has done this.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:16.940
But it has fundamentally
changed the way

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:18.360
that it discovers drugs.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.630
That's been its
transformation A.

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.420
Janssen today makes
30 billion US dollars

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:27.300
selling drugs that allow you
to treat and manage disease.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.240
What do you think would
be disruptive to that?

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.550
What do you think is
Janssen's transformation B?

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.500
$30 billion treating
and managing

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.360
diseases,
pharmaceutical products.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.850
What disrupts that business?

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:44.890
Prevention, so if you
never get diseases.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:48.190
They started a program a
few years ago under the name

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:49.510
Disease Interception.

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:53.620
The idea was as we understand
the pathogenesis of disease,

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.230
as we're beginning to have
smart, connected devices that

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:58.510
are giving us in-depth
understanding of humans,

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:01.060
as we decode the
genome, we can create

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.579
the equivalent of a check
engine light for an individual.

00:21:04.579 --> 00:21:06.370
So it can say, Scott,
you think that you're

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.640
a healthy 43-year-old male,
but the light is blinking.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.900
We see diabetes in your future.

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.280
And we've got an answer for you.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:16.330
Not a pill, but a program
that you can follow that

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:20.530
can allow you to intercept this
disease before you ever get it.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:23.020
A hugely disruptive
idea for Janssen,

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.840
but one that has tremendous
growth potential,

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.370
and one that has
the potential to do

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:29.420
a lot of good in the world.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.240
So that's still
transformation at Janssen.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.430
I've got eight other
things on my Brady Bunch.

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:35.680
That's probably a reference
that's lost on most people

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.325
in the audience,
but there you go.

00:21:37.325 --> 00:21:39.310
In my Brady Bunch board
up here, what else

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:40.723
do you want to hear about?

00:21:40.723 --> 00:21:41.473
AUDIENCE: Singtel.

00:21:41.473 --> 00:21:42.431
SCOTT ANTHONY: Singtel.

00:21:42.431 --> 00:21:44.400
So Singtel and
telecommunications in general

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.630
is a pretty simple story.

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:49.450
So transformation A, broadly
speaking, is voice to data.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.110
So what you're using your phone
for is fundamentally different.

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:54.090
That business model and
the operational model

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:55.600
is fundamentally changed.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.690
Transformation B
for Singtel has been

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:00.510
moving into new spaces,
cybersecurity, big data,

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:04.110
analytics, mobile marketing,
over-the-top video, and so on.

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:06.750
These businesses today are
about $1 and 1/2 billion

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.490
of revenue for Singtel.

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:11.460
Still a small part of its
portfolio, but rapidly growing.

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.370
And in each case, Singtel is
bringing something special

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:15.000
to the party.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.916
They're not just saying,
let's go into markets

00:22:16.916 --> 00:22:20.130
where we've got no right to
play other than our cash flow.

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:21.870
Mobile marketing is an example.

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:24.660
They have lots of in-depth
information about who you are

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.154
and what you're doing that
allows them, through purchases

00:22:27.154 --> 00:22:29.820
[INAUDIBLE] and other things, to
do some very interesting things

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.079
in that space.

00:22:31.079 --> 00:22:33.120
I can do that one so
quickly, I'll take one more.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.850
What else do you
want to hear about?

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:35.850
AUDIENCE: Manila Water.

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:36.340
SCOTT ANTHONY: Manila Water.

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.190
So Manila Water is an
interesting example.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:41.300
This is a regulated utility
company in Manila, of course,

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:42.500
in the Philippines.

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.720
Transformation A
for Manila Water

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:48.230
has been moving from providing
regulated utility water

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:50.900
services in the
Metro Manila area

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:54.170
to providing essentially
water utility as a service

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:56.010
to other parts in
the Philippines

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:58.970
and then Indonesia and
Vietnam, the theory being it's

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:02.300
gotten so good operating
in markets like that,

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.700
that it can essentially
create a business model that

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.620
allows it to expand
beyond Manila

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:08.320
and to other territories.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.820
Transformation B is moving
from regulated water

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.710
to other related services.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:15.890
An example of this is
in Metro Manila today,

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:18.170
there's about a $30
million business

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:21.020
where people will go and get
pure water from the Manila

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:22.340
water source.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:24.410
They'll go and run it
through an ionizer, which

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:25.829
does nothing to the water.

00:23:25.829 --> 00:23:27.620
They'll put it in a
big bottle, and they'll

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.170
sell it at about 1,000% markup.

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:31.790
And the target
consumer for this is

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:34.820
someone who lives in a
home that has rusty pipes.

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:37.610
So the water that comes out
of their tap isn't very good.

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:40.520
Manila Water said we can do this
business better than anybody

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.020
else.

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:44.150
It's a very different business,
unregulated, et cetera,

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:46.790
but it allows Manila Water
to take its capabilities

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:48.050
and move it in new directions.

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:48.290
All right.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:48.830
One more.

00:23:51.812 --> 00:23:52.720
AUDIENCE: Adobe.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.970
SCOTT ANTHONY: Say that again?

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:54.796
AUDIENCE: Adobe.

00:23:54.796 --> 00:23:55.670
SCOTT ANTHONY: Adobe.

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:57.510
So Adobe, I think, is
one of the clearest

00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:59.610
and simplest examples
of dual transformation.

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:03.670
10 years ago, again, a business
that was essentially flatlining

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:05.850
had brought this software
to seemingly every person

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:07.350
who might want to use it.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:09.159
Its share price was
stagnant, its sales

00:24:09.159 --> 00:24:10.200
were stagnant, et cetera.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.170
Transformation A, moving
from packaged software

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:14.610
to software as a service.

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:17.400
Still the same software
packages, but delivered,

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.720
of course, all over the cloud.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.430
Very different business model.

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:23.010
Transformation B,
moving from its software

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:25.590
solutions to marketing
services and analytics,

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:28.590
the purchase of Omniture, the
big move in this direction.

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:32.520
Today, marketing services
and analytics is about 45%

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.380
of Adobe's combined revenue.

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:37.860
A stock that had been stagnant
has grown at 20% compound

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.920
annual growth for a decade,
which is pretty impressive

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.575
for a 30-plus-year-old company.

00:24:43.575 --> 00:24:46.200
So we managed to make it through
almost half of the board here.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.366
Again, there's other
descriptions of this on the web

00:24:48.366 --> 00:24:49.710
or in other places.

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:52.940
But that's the basic idea
of dual transformation.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:55.800
Act four, the
leadership implications.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.430
The second half of the book
describes four key behaviors

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:02.190
that leaders need to follow
to successfully manage

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:03.600
transformation.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.790
Let me go through
them pretty quickly.

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:08.430
The first is the
courage to choose.

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:11.530
One of the basic parables in
the change management literature

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:14.410
is if you want to drive
change in an organization,

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:17.100
you need a quote, unquote,
"burning platform."

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:21.150
This is a very bad metaphor,
because if you are literally

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:23.970
standing on a burning
platform, think about what

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:25.860
your strategic choices are.

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:27.750
Either you do
something incredibly

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:30.750
risky by jumping into the
ocean and hoping that someone

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:33.000
will rescue you,
or you stand still

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.740
and get burned to a crisp.

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:36.990
That's not an attractive
set of options.

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:38.790
The best leaders
have the courage

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:42.480
to choose before the
platform is on fire.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:46.080
A great example of this is
Mark Bertolini at Aetna.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.130
Mark Bertolini becomes
the CEO of that

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:51.390
now leading health insurance
company in the United States

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:53.370
near the end of 2010.

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:54.900
There's no burning platform.

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.250
The business is healthy.

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:58.440
Record revenues, record profits.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.960
The Affordable Care Act,
otherwise known as Obamacare,

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.300
had just been passed
in the United States.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:06.120
There are 45 million
customers that Aetna

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.220
has to figure out how to serve.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.590
It would be incredibly
easy for Bertolini

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:14.190
to spend the next five years
executing yesterday's model

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:16.180
and ride off into the sunset.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:17.410
He didn't do that.

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:20.040
Instead he made the decision
to blow the business up.

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.770
His theory was health
insurance as we

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:26.130
know it in the United States
is going to die at some point,

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:28.590
and I'd rather do it when
my business is healthy

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:31.560
and I'm not forced to do it,
because then I've got degrees

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.340
of freedom to act differently.

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:34.920
If you follow that
industry, you know

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:39.090
that that company, Aetna, with
CVS Caremark earlier this year

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:42.480
to create a very distinct,
maybe even disruptive,

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.470
player in the health
care industry.

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:48.120
Behind Bertolini's thinking is
the old John F. Kennedy line,

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.750
the best time to fix your roof
is when the sun is shining.

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:52.650
How do you know?

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:55.962
How do you get the signals that
suggest it's time to change?

00:26:55.962 --> 00:26:58.170
This is something that many
executives struggle with,

00:26:58.170 --> 00:26:59.875
because they say,
these are things

00:26:59.875 --> 00:27:01.500
that are going to
happen in the future.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.800
How do I know what tomorrow's
going to look like today?

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:08.340
You can spot tomorrow today if
you look in the right places.

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.500
Remember the great quote
from William Gibson

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.480
that the future has
already arrived.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.240
It's just not very
evenly distributed.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.800
What can show you
tomorrow today?

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.710
What are places that you need to
look if you want to understand

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:21.840
what the future will look like?

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.900
Where do you go to
go and spot what

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.150
tomorrow's going to look like?

00:27:28.601 --> 00:27:30.660
This is, by the
way, meant not be

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.330
a rhetorical question, but a
question where I hear examples

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:36.090
from you.

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:38.916
What are good signs to show you
what the future will look like?

00:27:38.916 --> 00:27:39.890
AUDIENCE: What kids are doing.

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:40.700
SCOTT ANTHONY: What
kids are doing.

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.367
So I mentioned before
that I've got kids

00:27:42.367 --> 00:27:44.241
and I was going to show
you pictures of them.

00:27:44.241 --> 00:27:45.740
Here's the second child picture.

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.770
There is my 10-year-old
daughter Holly.

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:51.110
Holly is an invaluable
source of guidance to me.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:53.510
I sit locally on the
board of Mediacorp.

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:56.480
If you don't know Mediacorp,
it is the leading media company

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:57.530
in Singapore.

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:00.380
Its dominant business
model is broadcasting

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.830
videos, television channels,
linear television, and so on.

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:05.700
I watch the way
Holly consumes media.

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.810
And of course, you know this
exceedingly well at Google,

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:11.420
and you know that this
model is dying very quickly.

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:14.600
And Mediacorp needs to
change quickly to adapt,

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.010
because Holly will
never sit down and watch

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:17.840
linear television.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:18.680
Never.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.080
Sometimes I will see her on
the couch watching Netflix,

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.820
but I'm much more likely
to see a scene like this.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:25.940
Here's Holly getting
ready to go and watch

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.620
her favorite performer
on YouTube, DanTDM.

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:33.847
Does anyone know who DanTDM is?

00:28:33.847 --> 00:28:34.388
AUDIENCE: No.

00:28:34.388 --> 00:28:35.360
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.580
SCOTT ANTHONY: No--
usually, you are not

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.600
of a demographic that
would watch DanTDM,

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.475
but there are a couple
in the room that might

00:28:41.475 --> 00:28:42.620
have kids who watch DanTDM.

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.570
Well, I'll tell
you who DanTDM is.

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:45.860
He is a YouTube star.

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:48.140
He's got about 20 million
followers on YouTube.

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:50.600
He narrates himself
playing video games,

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.330
most predominantly
himself playing Minecraft.

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:56.280
Now, I played video games
when I was growing up.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.980
I had every video
game system known

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:01.880
to man, the TRS-80, the
Atari 2600, the ColecoVision,

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.670
the Nintendo, Super Nintendo,
Sega Genesis, Sega Dreamcast,

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:05.490
et cetera.

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:07.887
Lots of video game systems,
maybe not so many friends.

00:29:07.887 --> 00:29:09.470
Different conversation,
different day.

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:10.430
So I get playing them.

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:13.340
Watching people narrate them
to me is a little bizarre,

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:15.920
but Holly and her friends
will watch for hours

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.830
when people are doing this.

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:20.560
And again, 20 million followers,
reliable press account,

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.840
say, sponsorship fees of about
20 million British pounds

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:24.830
last year.

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:26.780
This is what media is
going to look like.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.980
Kids are great
signals of the future.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.820
Startups are great
signals of the future.

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:34.730
Hackers and artists are
great signals as well.

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:38.390
The picture here is me onstage
in a conference in Australia

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:40.100
last year with a cyborg.

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:41.630
The cyborg is Neil Harbisson.

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:44.600
He's in the red jacket on the
left side of the screen for me,

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:45.860
right side to you.

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:48.050
He has an implant
in his brain that

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:50.750
allows him to perceive
different parts of the spectrum.

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:53.360
There is an IP
address in the implant

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.310
that allows you to
email pictures to him

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:56.960
that he can perceive.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.480
I was talking to one of his
friends, a fellow cyborg

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.230
at the conference.

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:03.560
This friend had implants in
his ear that went to a plate

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.636
in the back of his head.

00:30:04.636 --> 00:30:07.010
I said, it looks like it's
pretty hard to sleep at night.

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:08.593
He said, yeah, I
don't sleep all that.

00:30:08.593 --> 00:30:10.440
Well, I said, so
what's the benefit?

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.470
He said, well, with
this, I can sense changes

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:14.132
in atmospheric pressure.

00:30:14.132 --> 00:30:15.590
I was not yet sold,
so I asked them

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:16.923
what benefit does that give you.

00:30:16.923 --> 00:30:19.342
He says, well, I know
when it's raining outside.

00:30:19.342 --> 00:30:20.300
I said, well, I do too.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:22.841
I just look out the window, and
I sleep pretty well at night.

00:30:22.841 --> 00:30:24.440
And this seems
kind of weird when

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.250
you see it in its early days.

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:28.550
But, of course, things
that are fringe today

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:30.080
are mainstream tomorrow.

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.900
So you want to, as a
leader, do things like this.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:36.470
Go and spend time at the edge
of the periphery of an industry,

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:39.110
because that will show
you tomorrow today.

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:40.970
Second thing you
need to demonstrate

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:42.930
is the clarity to focus.

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:46.460
This is not planting hundreds
or thousands of flowers in hopes

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:47.810
that some will bloom.

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:50.420
This is going in launching,
yes, a few select,

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.400
strategic moonshots.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.530
This is decided the
things that you will do,

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:58.010
and most critically, the things
that you won't do as well.

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:00.080
Many organizations
tell us, we wish

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.020
that we could do more things
when it relates to innovation,

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:04.580
but we don't have the resources.

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:08.580
We find almost every
organization has the resources.

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:11.720
Many have succumbed to the
plague of the zombie project,

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.400
the walking undead.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.830
The project that, if
you are honest about it,

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:19.790
will not materially move the
growth needle in any major way,

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:23.030
yet it still shuffles on,
sucking all the energy out

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:24.440
of the organization.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:27.440
You need the clarity to focus
on both what you will do

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.120
and what you won't do.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.430
How do you go and actually
make the decision about what

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:32.682
you should and shouldn't do?

00:31:32.682 --> 00:31:34.640
Well, this is where you
face one of the biggest

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.907
challenges of an innovator.

00:31:35.907 --> 00:31:38.240
I've been in the field, as I
mentioned in the beginning,

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.140
for close to 20 years.

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:43.190
In that time, I've seen hundreds
if not thousands of ideas

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:44.180
to innovate.

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:47.060
Every idea in its
early days is the same,

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:50.324
because it's partially
right and partially wrong.

00:31:50.324 --> 00:31:51.740
The challenge you
face when you're

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.720
standing at the first
mile of innovation

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.820
is you don't know
which part is which.

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.370
Now, the way many large
companies go and address

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:01.850
this challenge is they try to
get to truth through analysis.

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:04.550
They go and interview experts,
and they go and commission

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:05.510
market research.

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:08.390
And they come up with
elaborate financial forecasts

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:11.330
in the hopes of coming
up with a perfect plan.

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:13.040
There is no such thing.

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.600
You follow this
approach, you learn

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.840
a life lesson taught by the
great American philosopher,

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:21.740
actor, and occasional boxer
Mike Tyson, who once said,

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:26.480
everybody has a plan until
they get punched in the face.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.280
What you need to
demonstrate as a leader

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.010
is the curiosity to
explore, recognizing

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:32.910
that your ideas are wrong.

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:35.300
And the only way that
you will get to truth

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.520
is through smart,
conscious trial-and-error

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.080
experimentation.

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.570
While doing this, you need
to de-fang one of the biggest

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:45.080
enemies of innovation, something
that's illustrated in a book

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.600
called How Google Works-- so
something that I hope resonates

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:48.950
with at least some of you--

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:51.260
the hippo problem,
where decisions

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.960
are made not by data
and not by experiments,

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:57.030
but by the highest
paid person's opinion.

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:58.610
This is a bad
example here, where

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:00.170
option is replete with data.

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:02.990
Option B has no data, yet
the hippo rules for option

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:06.260
B. It's sometimes even worse
when it comes to innovation,

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.840
because both sides of
the board are blank.

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:12.030
And the hippo has great
intuition about yesterday,

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:14.600
but not great intuition
about tomorrow.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.500
So what do you do to
confront this challenge,

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.160
to deal with the reality
that every idea is partially

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.050
right and partially wrong?

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:24.170
I suggest drawing inspiration
from the Wright brothers.

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:26.690
You go back 120
years ago, the world

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:28.850
was perplexed with the problem.

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:32.120
They had wondered for years,
for generations, for centuries,

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.980
why it was that birds could
fly but humans couldn't.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:37.860
The problem was particularly
acute at this time,

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:40.230
because the machine age,
the Industrial Revolution

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:43.080
was upon us, yet we still
haven't cracked the problem.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:46.290
Most would-be aviators built
versions of their planes,

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:49.080
took them to high
places, and tried to fly.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.580
Those planes crashed.

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:52.554
They couldn't go and try again.

00:33:52.554 --> 00:33:54.720
The Wright brothers framed
the problem fundamentally

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.740
differently.

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:59.340
Before they flew a plane,
they built kites and gliders.

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:02.520
The great thing about kites and
gliders is when they crash--

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.290
and they always do--

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:05.760
nobody gets hurt.

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:09.600
Even more critically, in
1902, the Wright brothers

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:13.440
hacked together bicycle spoke
wire, cardboard box, and a fan

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.989
to create this, a wind tunnel.

00:34:15.989 --> 00:34:17.940
Imagine how it
felt. At that time

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:20.760
everybody else was working
on crazy contraptions that

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.969
were crashing, and the Wright
brothers here were able to,

00:34:23.969 --> 00:34:28.080
in two exhilarating months, to
run more than 200 experiments,

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.090
testing 30 different
wing designs,

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:33.420
getting real data that
ultimately led to breakthroughs

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:35.520
like wing warping that
allowed the Wright

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:38.670
brothers to create the
world's first flying machine.

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:41.699
This is what you need to do
at scale in organizations,

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:44.010
have the ability
to design, execute,

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:46.090
and learn from experiments.

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:49.620
This is easier said than done,
because the problem is kites

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:50.580
still crash.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.500
Wind tunnels still don't work.

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:55.260
There's a lot of failure
on the way to success.

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:57.411
Now, if you talk to
anybody about failure,

00:34:57.411 --> 00:34:59.160
they'll say something
similar to what I'll

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:01.080
show on the video clip here.

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:04.340
This is from an interview I did
with the then-CEO of Procter

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:08.100
&amp; Gamble, A.G. Lafley,
a decade ago, 2008.

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:11.730
When I asked him his view on
failure, this is what he said.

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:14.880
A.G. LAFLEY: You learn far
more from your failures

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.360
than you do from your successes,
far more from your failures.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.540
I can remember every
time I struck out

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.610
in high school baseball.

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:27.795
I can remember every time
I failed, OK, at P&amp;G.

00:35:27.795 --> 00:35:29.760
And I failed a lot.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:33.690
Now, what we're trying to
do now is fail a lot faster,

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:37.430
fail a lot cheaper,
so we fail more

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:42.440
and get on to the next idea
or the next innovation that

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.820
may become a commercial
success, but failure's

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.200
incredibly important,
and learning from failure

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.322
is very important.

00:35:49.322 --> 00:35:50.780
SCOTT ANTHONY:
Again, leaders today

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:52.490
are conditioned to
say things like this.

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:53.360
We love failure.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.380
We encourage failure.

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:55.220
They cite Google.

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:57.260
They cite other examples
in Silicon Valley

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:59.810
about how failure is
almost a badge of honor.

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:01.460
But then you get
the reality, where

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:02.870
you get something like this.

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:04.640
This is Tom Fishburne,
the same cartoonist

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.102
who did the hippo problem.

00:36:06.102 --> 00:36:08.060
If you don't follow Tom,
you absolutely should.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:10.940
He does great illustrations
that bring business challenges

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:11.562
to life.

00:36:11.562 --> 00:36:13.770
What breakthrough idea did
you want to share with me?

00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:16.103
This is what happened to
everyone who failed beforehand.

00:36:16.103 --> 00:36:19.400
This is a huge challenge
in organizations.

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.660
What do you do to combat it?

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:22.610
You make sure that
people recognize

00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:24.830
it's OK to dare to try.

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:26.720
This is a consciously
stolen name.

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.730
This is a high
prestige prize that's

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:32.570
given out by Tata Sons, the
largest conglomerate in India,

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:34.040
every couple years.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.964
There are two and
only two things

00:36:35.964 --> 00:36:37.922
that you need to do to
be eligible for the Dare

00:36:37.922 --> 00:36:38.810
to Try prize.

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:40.010
What do you think they are?

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:41.930
Two things.

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:43.170
You have to have failed.

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:45.860
And this is not a heroic
overcoming an obstacle

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:47.280
and still succeeding.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:50.090
I remember I was talking to
one organization in Singapore,

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:51.590
and I said do you
encourage failure?

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:53.330
They said, we absolutely do.

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:56.270
I said give me one example
of when you've done this.

00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:58.850
They said, well this team
was really struggling.

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:00.620
It was not hitting
any of its deadlines.

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:02.330
It was running over budget.

00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:03.800
And then they
worked really hard,

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:06.890
three months, nights,
weekends, and they delivered.

00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:08.960
I said, there is
no failure in this.

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.000
This is heroically
overcoming obstacles.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.130
Let me give you an
example of failure.

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:15.140
About 10 years ago,
we had an idea.

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:16.700
We would create CD-ROMs.

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.650
This would not be me singing.

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:20.240
Thankfully, again,
we avoid that.

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:23.030
But the idea was to take Clay
Christensen, we'd take me,

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:25.340
we'd take other people
in our organization,

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:27.560
we would create CDs that
had training material,

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:29.810
and people would buy these CDs.

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:32.600
And this would be a new growth
business for our company.

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.120
If anyone would like
a large amount of CDs,

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:37.310
we still have them
in our inventory.

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:39.080
There's no happy
ending to this story.

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:39.830
It didn't work.

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:41.540
We've got Christmas
presents to give out

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:43.127
for years to come still.

00:37:43.127 --> 00:37:44.210
That's the first criteria.

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:45.800
It has to have failed.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.790
What's the second?

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:53.359
The idea must have
failed, but/and

00:37:53.359 --> 00:37:55.150
you have to have learned
something from it.

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:56.627
Because any time
you dare to try,

00:37:56.627 --> 00:37:58.460
there are three good
things that can happen.

00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:00.537
You can learn we should
never do that again.

00:38:00.537 --> 00:38:02.620
And if you learn that in
a resource-effective way,

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:04.486
that's a good, not bad outcome.

00:38:04.486 --> 00:38:05.860
You can learn that
we should only

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:09.310
do this if you've generated a
strategic option that gives you

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:11.230
space to work in the future.

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:13.770
Or most powerfully,
in many organizations,

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:16.210
this is their
entire origin story.

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:17.870
You learn that
instead of doing that,

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:20.142
we should do something
completely different.

00:38:20.142 --> 00:38:21.850
These are all valuable
learnings that you

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:25.600
want to capture and codify
when you go and do new things.

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.910
Final leadership
characteristic-- I'll do this,

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:30.460
then I'll give you my short
version of the fifth act,

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:32.110
then I'll open it
up for questions--

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:33.700
is that conviction to persevere.

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:35.740
My co-author, Clark
Gilbert, second name

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:38.830
you see listed up there, speaks
from firsthand experience

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:40.630
when he says, what
I've described

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:44.620
here is the toughest challenge
a leader will ever face.

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:47.260
He's done this in two very
different organizations,

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:50.010
a media organization
and a university.

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:52.440
And it is indeed
incredibly hard.

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.520
In the eighth chapter of
"Dual Transformation,"

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.610
we lay out some of the
predictable crises that will

00:38:57.610 --> 00:38:59.510
happen as you try to do this.

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:02.000
You won't get this done in
a month or in a quarter.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.610
It's going to be a
multi-year journey.

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:05.440
And in that journey,
you're going

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:07.270
to have crises of
commitment, you're

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:09.280
going to have
crises of conflict,

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.930
the new business
and the old pieces

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:13.860
will fight for resources, you
will have conflict of identity.

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:16.000
It happens every single time.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.100
You need to have as a
leader the conviction

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:21.400
to persevere through these
conflicts or the first time

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.940
you hit one of these crises, all
of your efforts will crumble.

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:27.700
Let's go back to Johnson
&amp; Johnson for a second.

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:30.730
The picture you see here is the
cover of "Dual Transformation"

00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:32.680
in front of the credo.

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:35.970
The credo is etched into granite
in the headquarters of Johnson

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:38.800
&amp; Johnson in New
Brunswick, New Jersey.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.710
You could imagine
people in J&amp;J would say,

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:44.650
disease interception,
that is crazy.

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:48.340
We make $30 billion a
year selling products that

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:50.050
allow people to treat diseases.

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:52.400
Why would we want to
eradicate diseases?

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:55.150
This isn't in our
shareholders' best interests.

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:57.550
Well, at J&amp;J, these are
very short discussions,

00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:59.380
because you point to the credo.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:03.250
The credo starts by saying
our first responsibility is

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:06.010
to the doctors, the nurses,
the patients, the mothers

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:08.830
and fathers, and everybody
else who uses our products

00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:09.960
and services.

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.560
It goes on to say
that we then have

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:12.880
to think about our employees.

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:16.030
We then have to think about the
communities in which we live.

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:19.150
And our final responsibility
is to our shareholders,

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.070
who, if we do all
of these things,

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:23.010
have the right to
get a fair return.

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:24.602
The shareholder isn't first.

00:40:24.602 --> 00:40:26.110
The shareholder is last.

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:28.690
The conviction to
persevere must be

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:32.170
grounded in some kind of
purpose for why you're doing it.

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:35.020
You can find purpose in
just about everything.

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:37.270
There's a great example,
from about 20 years

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:40.180
ago in Singapore about
an organization that had

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:42.190
a seemingly strange problem.

00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:44.210
It had too many
repeat customers.

00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:46.750
And because it had so
many repeat customers,

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:49.510
its employees were very unhappy.

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:51.820
What type of organization
do you think this is?

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.945
Where do you not want
repeat customers?

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:57.310
Say that again?

00:40:57.310 --> 00:40:57.585
AUDIENCE: Prison.

00:40:57.585 --> 00:40:58.960
SCOTT ANTHONY:
Prison is correct.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.150
I sometimes will have
people say health care.

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:04.090
Every once in a while, we'll
have people say funeral homes.

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:05.730
This is not the
zombie apocalypse.

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:08.080
It is indeed prisons.

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.970
So there were high
rates of recidivism,

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:12.470
and because of that, the
guards were very unhappy.

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:15.080
So a new leader comes
in and does many things.

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.810
But one of the things
he does is create

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:18.430
a new statement of purpose.

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:21.850
We are captains in the lives
of people who are temporarily

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:23.140
in our custody.

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:26.230
Our goal is to get them
out as quickly as possible

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:29.020
and have them stay out
for as long as possible.

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:31.780
Today, some of the lowest rates
of recidivism in the world,

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:35.300
some of the highest rates of
job satisfaction in the world.

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:38.260
This is what's required if you
are to drive fundamental change

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:39.920
in organizations.

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:40.510
Fifth act.

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:43.780
Fifth and final act,
the call to action.

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:45.460
This is the greatest
present that I ever

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:47.530
receive from a project
team, a consultant

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:49.270
team that was working for me.

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:52.960
This is a bobblehead doll
affectionately known as Scoda.

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:56.710
This is my head grafted on the
body at the Star Wars character

00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:57.460
Yoda.

00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:00.460
The team told me they were going
to try and hit a deliverable.

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:03.190
And I told them this is not
a try or try not situation.

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:05.590
This is it do or
do not situation.

00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:07.570
If you are to do
any of the things

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:10.450
that we've talked about here,
you have to go and do it.

00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:13.420
By way of metaphor, let me
introduce my third child

00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:14.800
into the discussion.

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.720
My oldest child,
my boy, Charlie,

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.870
a few years ago said he wanted
to learn to ride a bike.

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:21.400
What came next?

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:23.740
We did not discuss the
theory of bike riding.

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:26.920
We did not watch any YouTube
videos about bike riding.

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.900
We created no PowerPoint slides.

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:31.300
We did no spreadsheets
modeling bike riding.

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:34.150
Instead, we put Charlie
on a bike, and he tried.

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:35.410
He pedaled and he fell down.

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:36.670
He got back up.

00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:38.920
He eventually learned
how to ride a bike.

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.900
Today, he is a proficient rider.

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:44.260
He can get from point A to point
B without too much difficulty.

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:46.480
He practices enough, he
can be a skilled rider.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.550
He takes performance
enhancing drugs,

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:50.440
the Tour de France
might be in his future.

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:51.160
Don't do drugs.

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:52.500
They're very bad things.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.460
You've got to do the
same thing to bring

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:56.680
to life many of the
things we talked about

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:58.770
during today's conversation.

00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:01.060
It starts with the
declaration of innovation.

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:03.130
Remember what I said
earlier, we enter

00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:04.810
the world in a natural state.

00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:07.400
Human beings are, by
their very nature,

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:10.510
curious, creative people
that desire to grow.

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:13.090
This is innate inside all of us.

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:15.460
There are seven
specific simple things

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:18.350
that you can do to begin
to make some of the things

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:21.150
I've talked about here
day-to-day habits.

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:23.200
It starts by tripling
the amount of time

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.580
you spend with customers.

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:26.680
However much time
you're spending today,

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.150
it is not enough.

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:30.220
There's no get-out-of-jail-free
card for this.

00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:33.010
You can't say, well, I'm in
an internal support role.

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:34.840
I don't have any customers.

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:37.540
Everybody has people
they're trying to serve.

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:38.650
It might be a colleague.

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:40.330
It might be a coworker.

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:43.750
What your job is is to
identify or understand them

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:46.030
better than they
understand themselves,

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:48.820
so you can spot new
paths to innovation.

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:50.890
Second, triple
the amount of time

00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:52.300
that you spend at the periphery.

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:54.670
Remember, the future
has already arrived.

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:57.190
It's just not very
evenly distributed.

00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:59.110
The more time you
spend at the edges

00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:02.050
with children, with hackers,
with startups, the more

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:05.130
you will be able to
see tomorrow today.

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:08.970
Third, make a regular habit of
asking three simple questions

00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:11.625
that will highlight new
opportunities for innovation--

00:44:11.625 --> 00:44:14.490
why, why not, and what it.

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:17.600
Fourth, prepare yourself to take
those punches from Mike Tyson.

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.510
Run an experiment today.

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:21.040
It doesn't have
to be complicated.

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:23.850
It can be a new route into work
or a change in your morning

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:24.870
routine.

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:27.270
If you're struggling with
an innovation problem,

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:29.610
this is a great way
to condition yourself

00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:33.090
to go and try new experiments
and do new things.

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:35.250
Don't let a lack of
money be an excuse.

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:37.920
Find ways to experiment
without spending anything.

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.540
Think about the wind tunnel.

00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:41.040
Think about those
people who started

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.330
the business at Plunify.

00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:45.300
There is a ton you can
do today without spending

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:47.130
any money at all.

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:49.950
The final two tips remind
you to go to the place

00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:52.560
where innovation
magic always happens.

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.870
This is one of the most
persistent findings you see

00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:56.640
in the innovation literature.

00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:00.120
Magic happens at intersections,
where different mindsets

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.280
and skills collide together.

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.120
A simple way to get
to the intersections

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:07.470
is to read a magazine in a field
you've never thought of before

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:09.420
or go to a trade
show in an industry

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:11.550
that you don't
care at all about.

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:13.650
If you've got an innovation
puzzle in your brain,

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:15.690
you're going to see a
unique way to address it

00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:17.500
if you go and do this.

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:20.730
Finally, call up the weirdest,
most iconoclastic person

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:21.750
you know.

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:25.200
Ask them to introduce you to the
weirdest person that they know.

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.780
If it's you, you've got
a short phone catch up.

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:30.060
But otherwise, you have
diversified your network

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:30.780
for innovation.

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:34.350
You've got new sources to lean
into when the next disruptive

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:36.330
problem arises.

00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:38.250
I end all of this on
a note of optimism

00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:40.290
I showed you pictures
of three of my kids

00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:42.060
as we went through
the discussion.

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:43.410
Here they are live and on stage.

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:45.030
Not quite live and on
stage, but there you go.

00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:46.000
This is not the BBC video.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.250
No one's going to run behind me.

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:48.666
We've got Charlie,
my 12-year-old.

00:45:48.666 --> 00:45:49.890
We've got Holly, now 10.

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:51.200
We've got Harry, who's six.

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.810
Here's the newest addition.

00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:53.410
There's Teddy.

00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:53.909
He's two.

00:45:53.909 --> 00:45:55.410
I don't have any
stories about him

00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:57.030
other than thinking
he's awfully cute,

00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:58.770
so I put them up
on a picture here.

00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:01.200
But what these four
children have taught

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.480
me is this lesson that
I've repeated here,

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.680
that we enter the world as
curious, creative people.

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:09.060
And I now have a firm belief
that the world's biggest

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:12.070
untapped source of
energy isn't in the wind.

00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:13.230
It isn't in the water.

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:14.730
It isn't in the sun.

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:16.890
It's inside our
large organizations

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:20.430
that are filled with human
beings that were once like this

00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:22.470
that are now shackled
and constrained,

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:24.360
not realizing their
full potential

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:27.070
related to curiosity
and creativity.

00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:28.620
This is my life's mission.

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:30.690
I view my job as a
parent to make sure

00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:33.690
that my children never lose
their love of learning.

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:36.630
I view my job as an advisor
to large organizations

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:39.150
to help leaders of these
organizations release,

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:42.780
harness, and amplify the latent
energy that exists within.

00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:45.010
After all, as
Archimedes once said,

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:47.550
you give me a lever long
enough and a platform on which

00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:50.160
to place it, and I
can move the world.

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:53.120
The platform that you
have at your organization,

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:56.470
the platform that people have
at many large organizations,

00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:57.531
is unbelievable.

00:46:57.531 --> 00:46:59.530
It's the sort of thing
that the startups are all

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:01.800
fighting like crazy to create.

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.930
The potential is there.

00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:05.880
I hope the ideas that
I've shared today,

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:08.850
the ideas that are documented
in some of the other writings

00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:10.650
that I and my
colleagues have done,

00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:13.470
I hope they make your leverage
just a little bit stronger.

00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:15.603
The rest, of course,
is up to you.

00:47:15.603 --> 00:47:17.061
Thank you very
much, and good luck.

00:47:17.061 --> 00:47:19.947
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:24.674 --> 00:47:26.590
While the mic is going
to you, I will tell you

00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:28.298
about my favorite
Harvard Business Review

00:47:28.298 --> 00:47:29.570
article from the last year.

00:47:29.570 --> 00:47:31.015
I don't know if you've seen it.

00:47:31.015 --> 00:47:33.136
I'm reflecting the fact
that we're both Scotts.

00:47:33.136 --> 00:47:35.260
There was an article in
the Harvard Business Review

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:39.460
that says you essentially
become what your name is.

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:41.980
So they ran this research
study that showed

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:43.390
people randomized pictures.

00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:46.314
And they were able to, at a
statistically meaningful level,

00:47:46.314 --> 00:47:47.230
guess somebody's name.

00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:48.280
So they'd show four pictures.

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:50.113
They'd say that's a
Scott, and that's a Jay,

00:47:50.113 --> 00:47:51.380
and that's a whatever.

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:52.714
So I know someone who's a Scott.

00:47:52.714 --> 00:47:54.754
I can tell the years that
they were born between,

00:47:54.754 --> 00:47:57.130
because the name went like
this, and I know roughly what

00:47:57.130 --> 00:47:57.920
they're going to look like.

00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:58.753
So anyway, go ahead.

00:47:58.753 --> 00:48:00.750
AUDIENCE: Well, I
was just curious

00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:05.140
to find out the epilogue
to Harry's vandalism story

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:08.950
and what kind of
lessons he learned

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:12.880
and you learned from that and
maybe the condo management

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:13.714
association as well.

00:48:13.714 --> 00:48:15.088
SCOTT ANTHONY:
Yeah, so you know,

00:48:15.088 --> 00:48:16.670
it's an interesting story.

00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:18.556
So I don't fault the
condo, the people

00:48:18.556 --> 00:48:19.930
who sent the
letter, because they

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:22.400
were doing what they thought
they were supposed to do.

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.320
And you get the theory, right?

00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:24.640
It's the broken windows theory.

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.830
So if we stop the small
stuff, the big stuff

00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:27.665
will never happen.

00:48:27.665 --> 00:48:29.290
And what we talked
about with Harry is,

00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:31.877
yes, there are certain
circumstances or certain things

00:48:31.877 --> 00:48:33.710
that you would do that
would be problematic.

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:36.730
So if you spray painted rather
the chalk, if what you wrote

00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:38.909
were religiously
offensive or whatever--

00:48:38.909 --> 00:48:41.200
there are certain sets of
things that you shouldn't do.

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:43.780
But free play by
children with material

00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:46.417
that washes away easily
is not the sort of thing

00:48:46.417 --> 00:48:47.500
we're trying to constrain.

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:50.380
And I've now used this story to
talk to people in the Singapore

00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:52.180
government, because
in my view, this

00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:53.530
is Singapore's biggest problem.

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:55.450
Singapore is a remarkable place.

00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:57.415
You see that which
has been created out

00:48:57.415 --> 00:48:58.930
of basically nothing.

00:48:58.930 --> 00:49:01.600
But all the constraints
that exist in the system

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:04.904
take the human population
and human capabilities

00:49:04.904 --> 00:49:06.820
and really, in today's
quickly changing world,

00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:07.810
I think constrain them.

00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:10.690
So I think Singapore's
challenge/opportunity

00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:11.950
is to go and arrest--

00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:13.690
not arrest, put in jail--

00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:16.510
but to go and fight against
some of the historical legacy

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:18.730
systems that lead to
this being the norm.

00:49:18.730 --> 00:49:22.120
And Harry is as creative and
curious and crazy as ever.

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.070
He now doesn't think
he's from Mars.

00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:25.360
Neptune is his new home.

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:26.987
That's what he
said this morning.

00:49:26.987 --> 00:49:27.820
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:28.653
Thanks for the talk.

00:49:28.653 --> 00:49:29.650
My name's Ignatius.

00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:30.830
I'm not [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:30.830 --> 00:49:34.270
But my question
was if we're meant

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:36.480
to triple the time we
spend with customers

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:40.600
and on the periphery, what would
be your advice as to what we

00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:42.356
should spend less time doing?

00:49:42.356 --> 00:49:44.230
SCOTT ANTHONY: Not coming
to talks like this.

00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:47.960
But the-- I was talking
to Jay about this before.

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:50.260
This gets back to
the idea of inertia

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:52.760
being one of the biggest
enemies that you face,

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:55.060
any organization faces.

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:58.150
I bet you that a large portion
of the meetings that you go to,

00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:00.490
a large portion of
the things that you're

00:50:00.490 --> 00:50:03.520
spending your time on, if you
were to step back and say,

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:06.010
is this something that is
material, has value added,

00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:08.200
and so on, I bet you
the answer would be no.

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:10.540
I bet you that you've
got zombie things that

00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:11.650
are on your calendar.

00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:14.630
And the example I was
sharing was our organization,

00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:16.480
we've got a call every Thursday.

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.160
We call it a
leadership team call.

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:20.500
Our organization
is about 100 people

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:21.850
inside a larger organization.

00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:25.730
But within the 100 people, about
30 of those 100 join the call.

00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:28.850
So it's a pretty big part of
the organization that does it.

00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:31.600
And if you ask people why do
we have this call Thursday

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:34.240
at 8:00 AM Eastern
Time, most people

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.660
would say because it's
always been on the calendar.

00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:38.860
And I was there when
we created the call,

00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:42.202
and I know why we
created it, but it

00:50:42.202 --> 00:50:44.410
was created to solve a
problem that no longer exists.

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:47.170
But we still just dutifully,
religiously go to this meeting

00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:49.469
even if it wastes a
lot of people's time.

00:50:49.469 --> 00:50:51.760
So I would ask, what is the
equivalent of your Thursday

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.850
call that you could get rid of
to go and create the space for?

00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:56.049
And I'm sure it's there.

00:50:56.049 --> 00:50:57.340
Or you should just work harder.

00:50:57.340 --> 00:50:58.534
Either one.

00:50:58.534 --> 00:50:59.200
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.019
My name is George.

00:51:00.019 --> 00:51:01.810
So my question is--
because over the years,

00:51:01.810 --> 00:51:04.410
I think a lot of companies,
the traditional enterprise,

00:51:04.410 --> 00:51:06.125
are talking about
the transformation

00:51:06.125 --> 00:51:09.310
or the dual transformation.

00:51:09.310 --> 00:51:11.350
The concept has been
around for many years.

00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:14.740
And some companies have been
successful the journey, right?

00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:17.150
Some companies are
being not so successful.

00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:19.510
So based on your
observation, so what

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:25.630
are some of the top trait for
those so-called successful

00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:26.980
transformational companies?

00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:29.890
And what are some of the thing
that you think companies are

00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:31.710
not doing so well
in their journeys,

00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:35.840
like potentially people
can learn from them.

00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:37.820
SCOTT ANTHONY: So I
would say read the book.

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:41.110
The book is an effort to
answer that as much as we can.

00:51:41.110 --> 00:51:43.990
But I think if you look at
the most common challenges

00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:48.100
that people run into, one is
they define it too narrowly.

00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:50.200
So they're not looking
at the A and B.

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.580
They're doing an A or a B.

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:54.730
And doing just one of
those is insufficient.

00:51:54.730 --> 00:51:58.330
If all you're doing is A, you're
missing tomorrow's great growth

00:51:58.330 --> 00:51:58.930
businesses.

00:51:58.930 --> 00:52:02.014
If all you're doing is B, you're
leaving your core business

00:52:02.014 --> 00:52:04.180
in a place where someone's
going to come and attack,

00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:05.510
and that's a problem.

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:07.690
So often, we see people
who do it too narrowly.

00:52:07.690 --> 00:52:09.170
That's one challenge.

00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:12.100
The second challenge we see
is this capabilities length

00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:14.110
that I went through
very quickly.

00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:15.320
This is really hard.

00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:16.430
It's very tricky.

00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:17.710
It's very subtle.

00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:20.420
We've got a full chapter
in the book devoted to it.

00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:22.870
We talk a lot about
Clark and his experiences

00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:26.080
at his media organization
and his university.

00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:27.707
Getting that right,
thinking about how

00:52:27.707 --> 00:52:30.620
you very selectively
pick the capabilities

00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:31.810
you want to leverage.

00:52:31.810 --> 00:52:33.700
You make sure you don't
take some things that

00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:35.783
will corrupt your new
business even though they're

00:52:35.783 --> 00:52:38.090
great for your current business.

00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:39.680
That's a really
hard thing to do.

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:41.890
So that's a common
failure mechanism.

00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:44.350
And the third is they don't
recognize it's a journey.

00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:45.940
Rather than viewing
it as a journey,

00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:49.420
they say, OK, this is our
90-day plan to go and transform.

00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:50.630
It doesn't happen.

00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:53.590
We have the metaphor in the
book of a three-year journey.

00:52:53.590 --> 00:52:54.580
It might not be three.

00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:55.720
It might be 18 months.

00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:58.570
But it might be five
years in some cases.

00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:00.880
And the impatience in
organizations I think

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:01.877
is a big challenge.

00:53:01.877 --> 00:53:03.460
There's lots of other
things you could

00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:05.842
talk about, about
strategy and so on,

00:53:05.842 --> 00:53:08.050
but those would be at least
three places that I would

00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:09.508
start, and three
things that we try

00:53:09.508 --> 00:53:11.470
to offer different
answers to in the book.

00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:13.820
AUDIENCE: You know, at
Google, for instance,

00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:16.660
we tend to come in and offer
these sort of point solutions.

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:18.960
And I'm sorry if this
question is a bit leading,

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:21.400
but what is it that
a company like Google

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:24.960
should be doing whenever
we're talking to our customers

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:27.460
rather than just offering them
point solutions whenever they

00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:29.620
are trying to make a change,
a fundamental change,

00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:32.060
in their business and
how they approach things?

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:34.420
SCOTT ANTHONY: So if you
look at that idea of tripling

00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:36.880
the amount of time you spend
with customers, if you know

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:39.570
Innosight, you know Clayton
Christensen and his writings,

00:53:39.570 --> 00:53:41.890
you know one of the
big ideas we focus on

00:53:41.890 --> 00:53:43.870
is the customer's
job to be done.

00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:46.220
What is the problem
they're trying to solve?

00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:48.585
And in a B2B world,
it's pretty simple.

00:53:48.585 --> 00:53:49.870
Well, along said dimension.

00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:51.790
The business of
business is business.

00:53:51.790 --> 00:53:54.550
So what you always want to
do when you're in a service

00:53:54.550 --> 00:53:56.620
provider space, when
you're in a B2B space

00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:59.940
is understand the context in
which your customers operate

00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:03.220
and think not just about how
you deliver a cloud install

00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:05.816
or whatever, but what's
the business context

00:54:05.816 --> 00:54:06.940
in which they're operating.

00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:08.722
What are the challenges
they're facing?

00:54:08.722 --> 00:54:10.180
What are the other
things that need

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:12.310
to happen for them to
increase their ability

00:54:12.310 --> 00:54:14.810
to be competitive,
to engage employees,

00:54:14.810 --> 00:54:16.160
et cetera, et cetera?

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:18.460
So this mindset of
always asking yourself

00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:20.620
what actually is
the customer's job

00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:22.780
to be done and not
just the one who I'm

00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:25.480
having the conversation
with, not just the buyer,

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:28.240
but what's the buyer-- what is
the circumstance in which they

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:30.920
sit, and who are the other
influencers, et cetera,

00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:31.494
et cetera.

00:54:31.494 --> 00:54:33.910
That's, I think, the mindset
that you always need to have.

00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:35.890
And I think it's not
dissimilar to what

00:54:35.890 --> 00:54:38.450
we need to think about to be
good advisors to companies.

00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:40.810
So we might get hired
by an executive who

00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:43.060
says, I need to think about
this new growth business

00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:43.965
or whatever.

00:54:43.965 --> 00:54:45.340
But what they
actually need to do

00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:47.560
is have a story that they
can tell to a shareholder,

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:49.529
or they might have a
board of directors member

00:54:49.529 --> 00:54:51.070
that's causing them
a lot of trouble,

00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:52.529
or they might have
a power struggle

00:54:52.529 --> 00:54:53.528
that they're trying to--

00:54:53.528 --> 00:54:54.130
whatever.

00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:56.350
We need to understand
that, because giving

00:54:56.350 --> 00:54:59.080
the right technical answer
to the question asked

00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:01.180
is typically insufficient
to ultimately

00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:03.190
have impact in your
line of business,

00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:04.889
in our line of business as well.

00:55:04.889 --> 00:55:06.430
AUDIENCE: I'll ask
two more questions

00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:08.620
that were submitted
as part of a survey

00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:11.320
that we provided earlier.

00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:15.880
One of them was, can I
start a business with $0?

00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:17.980
SCOTT ANTHONY: Yeah,
so the Plunify example

00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:19.400
is a perfect example of that.

00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:20.858
And if you looked
at the screen, it

00:55:20.858 --> 00:55:24.160
was the excited space of
cloud-accelerated chip design.

00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:26.552
I do not remember at all
what that is, but whatever.

00:55:26.552 --> 00:55:28.510
It was a business that
we started from nothing.

00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:29.634
And this is the norm today.

00:55:29.634 --> 00:55:31.840
A lot of businesses are
started for nothing.

00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:33.632
And of course, there
are lots of businesses

00:55:33.632 --> 00:55:35.256
that you could do as
an individual that

00:55:35.256 --> 00:55:36.670
require no capital investment.

00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:39.730
Starting a business for nothing
is actually quite trivial

00:55:39.730 --> 00:55:40.600
to do.

00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:43.525
Scaling it, on the other hand,
that still requires capital.

00:55:43.525 --> 00:55:47.290
And this, again, is one
of the great advantages

00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:48.870
a company like Google has.

00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:52.060
You have more capital
than probably any company

00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:53.630
in the Western world.

00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:55.720
So that gives you
advantages over startups

00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:58.900
that are scarce of capital and
have to fight fiercely and have

00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:00.490
to fight against
would-be competitors,

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:01.671
et cetera, et cetera.

00:56:01.671 --> 00:56:03.670
You have the ability to
think and act at a scale

00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:05.530
that few other
organizations can follow.

00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:07.900
So yes, you can start
a business for nothing.

00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:10.730
But remember, so can
everybody else in the room.

00:56:10.730 --> 00:56:12.406
So if you've got
an idea, and you

00:56:12.406 --> 00:56:13.780
start to get some
early traction,

00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:15.940
then everybody else is
going to go and try and do

00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:16.970
the same thing.

00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:21.340
Whereas here, at Google, you've
got unique, hard-earned assets

00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:24.820
that you've built over your
20-plus-year history that are

00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:26.410
really difficult to replicate.

00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:29.120
And think about what you can
do with that as an advantage.

00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:32.290
It's that example or
the idea of having both.

00:56:32.290 --> 00:56:34.330
So you both have
the assets of scale

00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:35.841
and the entrepreneurial energy.

00:56:35.841 --> 00:56:37.840
When you bring the two
of those things together,

00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:40.085
it is a really
powerful combination.

00:56:40.085 --> 00:56:41.710
AUDIENCE: OK, and I
guess that takes me

00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:44.230
into one of the other
questions that was asked.

00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:46.960
For those of us then that
have made that choice

00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:50.000
to join a larger organization
and try to change the world,

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.620
what can we do as individuals
to innovate inside

00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:55.410
of our own roles and companies?

00:56:55.410 --> 00:56:58.330
SCOTT ANTHONY: So the seven
things that I had on-- this

00:56:58.330 --> 00:57:01.840
is from-- the list of seven
things is a slightly modified

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:04.510
version of something that I had
at the end of "The Little Black

00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:08.920
Book of Innovation" called
The Innovator's Pledge.

00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:11.890
Doing those things
repeatedly, spending more time

00:57:11.890 --> 00:57:14.290
with customers, spending
more time at the periphery,

00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:16.380
running experiments,
and so on, you

00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:18.460
don't have to be a
CEO or somebody who's

00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:20.500
got a big budget, who
runs a business, to do it.

00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:22.060
These are day-to-day
habits that you

00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:24.940
can bring into your own
individual behavior,

00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:27.056
to your team's
individual behavior.

00:57:27.056 --> 00:57:28.930
And the thing that I'd
ask you to think about

00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:31.600
if this is a struggle for your
team, group, or department,

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:32.330
is why.

00:57:32.330 --> 00:57:33.940
What are the things,
the blockers,

00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:36.040
that are standing in
the way of success?

00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:38.380
Sometimes it's a norm
that needs to be changed.

00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:40.930
Sometimes it's a system
that needs to be changed.

00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:42.850
Sometimes it's you
as a leader, what

00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:44.920
you need to do differently
in order to role model

00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:46.520
a different behavior.

00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:48.790
But it all starts with
going and recognizing

00:57:48.790 --> 00:57:51.190
that to do something different
that creates value, which

00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:54.590
is how we define innovation,
there are a set of practices,

00:57:54.590 --> 00:57:57.279
there are a set of habits that
increase the odds of success.

00:57:57.279 --> 00:57:58.820
So we've just got
to do those things,

00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:00.010
and we've got to
do them repeatedly.

00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:02.410
And we have to enable other
people in our team, group,

00:58:02.410 --> 00:58:05.006
or department do
those things as well.

00:58:05.006 --> 00:58:07.380
AUDIENCE: Let's have round of
applause for Scott Anthony.

00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:07.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:09.830
SCOTT ANTHONY: Thank you.
