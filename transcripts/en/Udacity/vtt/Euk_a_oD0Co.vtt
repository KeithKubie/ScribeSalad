Those decisions are appropriate in a particular circumstances that is

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.280
dependent upon you know, the system specifications and its major concerns.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.840
The design decisions constrain, what are the possible components and

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.230
interactions and by using. The architectural style.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.460
You get various benefits from it

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.800
on the ultimate system you're you're building and the process of building it.
