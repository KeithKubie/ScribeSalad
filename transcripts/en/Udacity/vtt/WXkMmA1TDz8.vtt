If Amir buys four pencils and

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:07.900
all four pencils cost eight dollars,
how much does each pencil cost?

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:14.370
So, if four times P equals eight,
what is the value of P?

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.558
Enter your answer here.

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:18.570
