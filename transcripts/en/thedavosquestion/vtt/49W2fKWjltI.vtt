00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
&gt;&gt; So it's an interesting question will China
pull us out of the economic crisis and I assume

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.009
by "us" you mean the rest of the world.
Well, without China's participation in the

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.740
quarterly bond options of
the United States, interest rates would be

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.750
much higher, there would be
more illiquidity in our financial market,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.700
so to a great extent China
has been a force of stability throughout the

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:34.250
financial crisis in
providing a buyer for our treasury bonds in

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:43.570
addition to other OECD
countries, Japan and Europe and G7, are major

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.870
buyers of US bonds but
China has also been a significant buyer.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.860
Without that source of liquidity, we would
have been in a much worse

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.210
financial country size.
To the extent that China is -- still has a

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.720
huge trade surplus and the
United States still has a huge trade deficit,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.350
this capital flow or
cycle capital of flows will continue where

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.490
capital surpluses, dollar
surpluses as a result of the trade surplus

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.150
building up in the Chinese
central banks, and commercial banks will continue

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.120
to be invested back
in dollar denominated assets as well as European

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.140
and commodity-based
assets in Africa and Latin America.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.990
So China is a large buyer in the world market
of commodities, both soft

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.010
commodities as well as energy and metals and
that will continue to be

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.880
stimulus in those sectors as well as the financial
stimulus from the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.979
purchase of bonds.
As far as the being a manufacturing center

00:01:51.979 --> 00:02:01.900
China obviously has a lower
labor rate than all the G7 countries.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.970
But there are other countries in southeast
Asia that have -- are

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.030
beginning to compete with China over the last
several years including

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.889
Vietnam, for example, has a very strong software
sector.

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:19.799
And that's clearly small compared to India's
software's sector and the

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:25.299
Chinese software sector is enormous.
They're one of the top five software producers

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:31.790
in the world.
Nusoft is one of the largest software out

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:39.120
sourcing firms in China.
They have major presence here in Dalian.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:49.790
And they work with many Fortune 500 companies,
helping them save money

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.659
in their outsourcing and software development
and maintenance of

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.840
software.
So I think that to the extent that there is

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.419
a lot of economic activity
in China and the growth rate is between 6

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:09.709
and 8 percent depending on
the sector, there will be, continue to be

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:16.599
sector specific stimulus of
corresponding sectors in the world economy.

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.390
But I think it's important to rank these sectors
by order of magnitude

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.139
of stimulus, and recognize that China's both
an importer and an

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:31.840
exporter of capital, and an importer and exporter
of commodities and an

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:40.829
importer and exporter of technology.
For example, solar cells, here in Dalian,

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:50.409
solar EVC is being produced
for the world market at very competitive rates

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.389
here in Dalian.
So I think it's important when you ask such

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.549
a broad question, will
China pull us out of the economic crisis,

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.599
one has to define which
sector, over what timeframe, and what are

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:09.099
the competitive elements
within each sector where China does play a

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:18.650
role either as a buyer or as
a seller to collaborate, to produce increased

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.190
economic benefits for
counterparties.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.300
And so I think this question is very general
and requires more

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:33.940
specificity and let's say corollary questions
in order to come up with

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:41.130
a more scientific answer that's more precise.
I know that some people have said, yes to

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.480
the question and some people
have said no.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.760
Clearly, I think the answer is net yes that
there is a positive

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.980
economic stimulus coming from Asia in general,
because most of the

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:03.090
growth in the world is coming from Asia now.
Of course, Europe and the United States are

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.090
just coming out of
recessions and economic growth is negative

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.100
in certain sectors and
positive in other sectors.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.210
There's still a lot of de-leveraging going
on in the United States

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.490
where there's been a very high savings rate
in China, and they did not

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.470
have the same degree of leverage that the
United States and Europe had

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.600
in their housing sectors and their commercial
real estate sectors and

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.270
in their banking sectors.
It was less -- there was not as much speculative

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.350
excess in China in
their financial markets.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:44.620
So I think that when you survey the economic
landscape of China and

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.622
analyze the sectors that are providing economic
stimulus to the rest of

00:05:50.622 --> 00:05:59.170
the world, it's important to look at the sectors
that have the

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.220
potential of pulling certain sectors out of
the economic crisis.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.260
I don't see China becoming a major buyer of
US real estate in the near

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:13.300
future.
I don't see China exporting a lot of electric

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.090
cars to the United States
in the near future.

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:25.910
I don't see the R&amp;B being devalued at a significant
rate in the near

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:31.740
future.
If it -- if the R&amp;B were devalued that would

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.771
destabilize the United
States.

00:06:35.771 --> 00:06:42.310
It would also destabilize China's portfolio
which is denominated in

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.270
dollars.
So the Chinese have a dilemma in that they

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:52.770
do not want the US dollar to
be destabilized.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.500
They want to continue to buy dollar denominated
assets including

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:04.320
treasury bonds, and they want those asset
values to remain stable as

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:11.610
measured in the dollar R&amp;B exchange rate.
So on balance I would say it's a wonderful

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.970
question because it provokes
a very important debate.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.650
But one needs to disaggregate and deconstruct
this question in order to

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:24.690
have a higher degree of specificity about
what sectors are stimulated

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:29.670
by Chinese economic growth, and also look
the competitive matrix of

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:35.310
each sector globally and see what percentage
China contributes to

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:40.290
imports and exports in each sector.
And to that extent, good luck in that research.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:45.060
A lot of that research has already been done
by thinktanks and

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:50.770
economists focusing on the US/China and US/European,
US/African,

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:56.780
US/Latin American economic bilateral relationship.
And I think that is the good starting point

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:05.700
so to look at large capital
close between China and the world and look

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:12.340
at sector-specific imports
and try to make some deductions.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.630
So good luck in that research and again thank
you for tuning into this

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:17.340
Davos debate.
