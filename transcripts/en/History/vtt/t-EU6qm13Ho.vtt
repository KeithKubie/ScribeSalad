00:00:02.252 --> 00:00:03.503
NARRATOR: What do
ancient Greek prostitutes

00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:05.964
and World War II
soldiers have in common?

00:00:05.964 --> 00:00:07.215
Red lipstick.

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:08.425
That's right.

00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:10.593
Turns out the
iconic bold red lips

00:00:10.593 --> 00:00:17.142
have a surprising history
of sex, power, and war.

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:19.185
Back in ancient
Egypt, lip rouge was

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:23.273
worn by both women and men as
a symbol of status and power.

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:25.483
Cleopatra herself
wore a shade of red

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:28.611
made from a lovely concoction
of crushed insects,

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:31.573
fish scales and beeswax.

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:33.199
Over in ancient
Greece, lip rouge

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.952
was for the less
glamorous side of society,

00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:39.164
seen as something used
exclusively by prostitutes.

00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:42.041
In fact, there was a law
stating that prostitutes had

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:43.918
to wear makeup
when out in public

00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:48.465
as to not deceive men looking
for real relationships.

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:50.091
Fast-forwarding to
the Middle Ages,

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:52.635
lip painting continued
to court controversy,

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:56.473
mostly caused by criticism
from the Catholic Church.

00:00:56.473 --> 00:01:00.226
Lipstick was
portrayed as satanic.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:03.104
Women were even supposed to
speak of their lipstick use

00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:04.689
in confession.

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.109
But when Elizabeth I took
power in England in 1558,

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:11.654
she fully embraced lip rouge,
almost always wearing it

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:14.157
in public and private,
even claiming it contained

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:16.534
mystical healing powers.

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:18.912
Sadly, the lead content
of her lip coloring

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:22.373
may have contributed
to her death.

00:01:22.373 --> 00:01:24.667
Lipstick's popularity
started to fall over

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:27.337
the next couple of centuries,
hitting rock bottom

00:01:27.337 --> 00:01:29.088
during the Victorian era.

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:33.259
Queen Victoria herself
described makeup as impolite.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.262
But in the United States, lip
makeup took on new meaning

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:38.556
during the rise of the
women's suffrage movement.

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:41.726
Suffragettes embraced bright
red lipstick as a symbol

00:01:41.726 --> 00:01:43.520
of feminine resistance.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.147
They were taking decisions
into their own hands,

00:01:46.147 --> 00:01:48.858
the color of their lips,
and the right to vote.

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:52.695
Red lipstick's popularity
exploded and grew even faster

00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:56.950
after the popular swivel stick
design was introduced in 1923.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.870
Cosmetics became one of the
largest industries in the US.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.956
But not everyone loved lipstick.

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.582
Adolf Hitler hated it.

00:02:04.582 --> 00:02:06.167
He banned it
because, in his eyes,

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:09.337
lipstick made otherwise
Aryan women impure,

00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:11.464
and because it was
formulated from animal fat

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:13.341
rescued from sewage.

00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:16.302
So the Allies took advantage
of Hitler's disgust

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:19.055
and made red lipstick a
symbol of feminine power

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:20.807
in the war effort.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:23.768
Companies introduced brand new
wartime shades, like fighting

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:26.104
red and victory red.

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:29.232
Montezuma red, designed by
Elizabeth Arden in reference

00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:31.651
to the US Marine
Corps song, became

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:33.903
part of the official
uniform of the US

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:36.072
Marine Corps' Women's Reserve.

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:38.741
American factories who
employed women during the war

00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:40.827
were required to
keep lipstick stocked

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.745
in their dressing
rooms, allowing women

00:02:42.745 --> 00:02:45.331
to retain a sense of
femininity and continuity

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.584
in uncertain times.

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:50.587
In England, where a variety of
consumer goods were rationed,

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:54.132
Winston Churchill left
lipstick untouched, recognizing

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:55.925
that cosmetics were
an essential part

00:02:55.925 --> 00:03:00.138
of maintaining a feeling of
normalcy among Britain's women.

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:02.390
The Ministry of Supply
stated, "Cosmetics

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.102
are as essential to a woman as
a reasonable supply of tobacco

00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:07.520
is to a man."

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.772
A little out of date,
but you get the point.

00:03:09.772 --> 00:03:13.234
The allies won the war, and red
lipstick continued its journey

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:16.738
through the back half of the
20th century and into the 21st,

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:19.324
and continues to be
an indispensable part

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:21.576
of the cosmetic arsenal.
