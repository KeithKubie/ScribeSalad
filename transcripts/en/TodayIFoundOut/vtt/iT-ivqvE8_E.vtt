00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.179
As the official name of Paris–Bordeaux–Paris
Trail suggests, the idea of this particular

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:18.660
event was to see who could drive from Paris
to Bordeaux and back again in the quickest

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.720
possible time.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:27.270
For reference, this was a distance of 1,178
km or 732 miles on the roads of the day.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.519
So what was so special about this particular
race?

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.650
Well, for the first time in history, a large
group of automobiles would be pitted against

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:42.130
one another in a first to finish-style event,
with said race kicking off on June 11, 1895.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.510
The brainchild of a group of automobile enthusiasts
and journalists keen to promote the then fledgling

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.899
French automobile industry, the race was seen
as a way to both test the limits of cars at

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:59.050
the time as well as test the commercial viability
of motor racing as a spectator sport.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.430
Although, as we’ve previously noted, this
was only a couple decades after an era in

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.250
which competitive walking was one of the world’s
most popular spectator sports, so the competition

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.110
was pretty light.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.770
And, to be perfectly clear- we’re not talking
speed walking- just regular leisurely walking

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.970
for hours and hours on end…

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.420
In fact, certain walking matches were known
to draw tens of thousands of spectators.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.290
Yes, before YouTube, our forebears found watching
people casually walking in circles for sometimes

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.479
days on end without stopping great entertainment,
though to be fair this was probably really

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.170
just an ideal excuse to get together and socialize.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:49.110
To tie it back to cars, in some respects this
is not too dissimilar from NASCAR, but without

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.979
the occasional flaming crashes.

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:58.119
In any event, previous to the Paris–Bordeaux–Paris
Trail others had variously raced individual

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.729
cars against one another, with perhaps the
first such race occurring on August 30, 1867

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.700
where a steam powered car built by Isaac Watt
Boulton, driven by his son, competed in an

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.950
eight mile race against one of Daniel Adamson’s
steam cars, with the driver in the latter

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.160
case not known today.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.069
More significantly, in 1878 in the United
States, the Wisconsin Legislature attempted

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:30.110
to organize a 200 mile race for self propelled
vehicles, but only two vehicles ended up entering.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.420
Slightly more humorously in 1887 in Paris
a two kilometer race was organized by a local

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.170
paper, but only one person, one Georges Bouton
of the De Dion-Bouton Company, entered.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.230
Naturally, he won…

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.980
Moving closer to what we’d today consider
an automobile race was an event that took

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.050
place in Paris in 1894- the Paris-Rouen Rally.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.530
However, while this is sometimes called the
actual first car race, it should be noted

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.250
that, beyond the organizers of the event explicitly
noting it was not a race in a December of

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.209
1893 edition of the Le Petit Journal describing
the event, the winner was not the car that

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.720
crossed the finish line first.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.299
Rather, the winner was decided by a panel
of judges based on the overarching criteria

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:22.260
of which car was closest to “ideal”, with
ideal here referring to the car that was simultaneously

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.400
relatively cheap to purchase and operate,
most reliable, and easiest and safest to drive.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.920
Towards that end, while the order of finishing
the course was considered in determining the

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.480
winner, the car that crossed the finish line
first was not given 1st place as it needed

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.700
a second person to ride along to stoke the
flames to keep it going.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:47.030
Instead, the first prize of 5,000 francs (extremely
roughly between about $30,000 to $400,000

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.970
today depending on what inflation metric you
want to use) was shared between two companies,

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.390
most notable for the story at hand, one of
which being Panhard et Levassor.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.390
This brings us to about a year later and the
Paris-Bordeaux-Paris Trail competition.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.720
In this event, the winning car was intended
to be the one that completed the circuit first,

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.150
with a few stipulations.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.930
First, any winning car was required to have
more than two seats.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.829
Second, while mid-race repairs and maintenance
were allowed, they could only be performed

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.620
with materials stored in the vehicle itself.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.849
On top of this, drivers were allowed to switch
out as often as they liked.

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:29.220
Finally, largely to stop manufacturers flooding
the race with their own vehicles to pad the

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.300
odds in their own favor, it was ruled that
manufactures could only enter one of each

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.720
type of vehicle they produced.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.710
In total, some 23 automobiles entered the
race, only 9 of which would finish the arduous

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.729
journey between the cities, with eight of
those being ICE vehicles (internal combustion

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.250
engine) and the ninth being a seven seater
steam car.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.530
On top of gas and steam powered automobiles,
there was even an all electric car entered-

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.099
yes, contrary to popular perception, electric
cars actually dominated the automobile world

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:00.160
in the earliest days of the industry.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.960
For example, in New York City in 1899 approximately
90% of all taxi cabs were electric cars, mostly

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.830
built by Electric Carriage and Wagon Company
of Philadelphia.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.840
Not only that, but in 1899 and 1900, electric
cars outsold all other types of automobiles.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.900
In 1902 an electric car, the Baker Torpedo,
became the first car to have an aerodynamic

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.470
body that enclosed both the driver and the
platform.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:30.159
This car at one point reached a then astounding
80 mph in a speed test before crashing and

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:31.599
killing two spectators.

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:37.570
It was later clocked as high as 120 mph, but
with spectators not invited this time…

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.969
The popularity of electric vehicles at the
time is easy to understand.

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:47.250
The electric cars had no excessive vibrations
from the engine and were extremely quiet compared

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.250
to its competitors.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:53.409
They also didn’t emit smoke or backfire
frequently as did gas powered cars.

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:57.710
They were also ready to go right when you
sat in the car, unlike gas powered cars that

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:03.520
needed to be cranked by hand to start; this
was not only difficult, but also could be

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.520
dangerous.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.099
Steam powered cars, on the other hand, typically
required a half an hour to an hour to get

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:09.099
going on cold days.

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:11.881
The other large advantage with electric cars
was not having to change gears (once those

00:06:11.881 --> 00:06:16.270
were introduced), which was a hard thing to
do in early incarnations of clutch/gearbox

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.270
systems.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.142
The only real advantage that gas powered cars
had at this time were the long ranges they

00:06:20.142 --> 00:06:25.260
were capable of with larger tanks and the
ability to fill up quickly when the tank was

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.260
empty.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.599
However, because at the time there weren’t
a lot of well developed roads for cars to

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:36.719
drive on safely, most people only drove cars
in cities anyways, so range wasn’t a huge

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:37.719
factor.

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:40.640
(Hybrid cars would soon after be invented
as roads started making long distance automobile

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.240
travel more accessible, but largely thanks
to the likes of Henry Ford and his ultra-cheap

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.219
cars, it would be a long time before major
car companies would circle back around to

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:56.180
mass producing a hybrid or electric vehicle.)

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:05.270
In any event, as a result of the diversity
of power sources in the Paris-Bordeaux-Paris

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.229
race and the extreme length of the course,
it was also seen as a way of judging which

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:14.190
method of powering automobiles might be superior.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.490
Soon after the race began, it became clear
to pretty much everyone involved that the

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:21.649
winner was going to be Émile Levassor’s
Panhard et Levassor car powered by a modified

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:24.780
four horsepower Daimler Phoenix engine.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.959
The car was unique in several ways.

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:31.650
To begin with, it broke from tradition by
having the engine in front of the driver.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:37.270
In experimenting with various positions, Levassor
found this to be superior via lengthening

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:42.550
the wheel base significantly, while also lowering
the center of gravity by having the passenger

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:47.000
not above the engine as was common, but closer
to the ground behind it.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.570
In both cases, this made the car much less
likely to roll over, which was a bit of a

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.779
problem with many early cars, particularly
driving on less than perfect roads.

00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:58.960
His design also sported a unique (for the
time) clutch system allowing Levassor to adjust

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.640
the vehicle’s gears easier on the fly.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.370
It also featured a front mounted water radiator,
massively improving the reliability of the

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:10.250
engine compared to most others that simply
relied on natural air cooling.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:15.130
On top of this, he got rid of the bicycle
style belt drive and went with a crankshaft

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.950
and connecting hardware to the rear differential.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:22.010
This novel layout and general design (front
engine/rear wheel drive), which would soon

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:27.450
be copied by pretty much every car manufacturer
would, ironically, come to be known as the

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:32.030
Systeme Panhard, presumably because Panhard’s
name came first in the pair’s company name,

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:36.279
even though Levassor, not his business partner
Rene Panhard, is generally credited as being

00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:40.000
the one who actually came up with most of
the innovations.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.010
In any event, this general design made Levassor’s
car not only extremely reliable, even over

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:51.280
continuous use for hours at a time, but also
much more agile, giving Levassor a clear edge

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.780
over his opponents.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:56.870
Within an hour, Levassor was easily leading
the race and arrived in Bordeux so far ahead

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:01.310
of his opponents that his co-driver, who was
supposed to drive the second half of the race,

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:03.470
was still asleep in his hostel.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:08.280
In fact, because he had arrived so much sooner
than anyone expected, the officials he needed

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.600
to notify about his arrival were also sleeping.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:16.570
After being unable to discern which hotel
his co-driver was staying in, Levassor decided

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:21.270
to just wake up the race officials so they
could verify he’d been there, then drove

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:27.010
back to Paris on his own, setting off at around
2:30AM after having a short walk and a glass

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:29.680
of champagne and a sandwich.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.690
After driving for 48 hours and 47 minutes
without sleeping, Levassor arrived in Paris,

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:40.150
including stopping time averaging a breakneck
pace of about 15 mph (24.1 km/h).

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:46.610
He noted upon his arrival, “Some 50 km before
Paris I had a rather luxurious snack in a

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.290
restaurant which helped me.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:50.610
But I feel a little tired.”

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:54.820
As such, after officials acknowledge his finish,
he went off to bed.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:59.440
About six hours later, Levassor was awoken
by an official who told him that the person

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.150
in second place, Louis Rigoulot, had finally
arrived.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:07.360
Five hours after this, both men greeted the
man who finished third- Paul Koechlin.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:12.570
Unfortunately for Levassor and Rigoulot, when
scrutinizing the exact wording of the rules,

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:17.110
officials realized that the “two seat”
stipulation was not inclusive as in “two

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:21.460
or more seats” but required that the car
have more than two seats.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:25.910
Because of this, Levassor and Rigoulot were
summarily disqualified as their vehicles only

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:30.500
had two seats- something that perhaps should
have been looked at closer before the racers

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.490
set out.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:37.420
Unsurprisingly, this caused a great deal of
confusion and outrage amongst both automobile

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:42.220
enthusiasts and the many thousands who’d
gathered to watch the race and clearly saw

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.870
Levassor win by a massive margin.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:49.220
As such, the race had the intended effect
for his and Panhard’s company, with Levassor

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:53.640
generally considered the winner by the teeming
masses, even though Koechlin, in his four

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.400
seater car, walked away with the prize.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.720
To avoid a similar controversy in future,
the rules of future races were changed so

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:07.790
that the winner of a race was whomever crossed
the finish line first…

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:12.030
In 1897 Levassor would compete in the Paris-Marseille-Paris
race.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:16.420
Unfortunately for him he not only didn’t
win this race, but he seemingly died because

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.420
of it.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.960
You see, while traveling at high speed down
a hill, a dog ran out in front of his car.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.230
Not wanting to run over the animal, Levassor
swerved, resulting in the vehicle flipping

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.230
over.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.720
He initially survived the event and even attempted
to finish the race, but had to stop, not because

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.700
his car failed him, but his body.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:37.730
Unfortunately a broken rib and internal injuries
saw the 54 year old’s health rapidly decline

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:38.940
over the following months.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:44.010
He died of a coronary embolism while sitting
at his desk trying to design a magnetic clutch

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:47.950
in April of 1897.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:52.030
The Michelin brothers, André and Edouard,
also competed in the Paris-Bordeaux race in

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:53.720
one of their company’s cars.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.120
They did not manage to finish in the 100 hour
timeslot, however.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.620
What makes their entry significant, and somewhat
foreshadowing what their company would soon

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:07.240
be better known for, is that they were running
on pneumatic tires, a rather unique feature

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:12.600
on automobiles of the day, many of which were
more or less just using steel banded wood

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:13.600
wagon wheels.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:18.370
Humorously, the Michelin car, dubbed the Lightning,
was not named such because it was faster than

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:24.120
others per se, but rather because its steering
mechanism was so bad that it ultimately traveled

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:51.350
in something of a zig-zag pattern…
