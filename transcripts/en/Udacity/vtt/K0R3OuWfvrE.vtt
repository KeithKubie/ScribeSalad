00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.640
Now that we have acquired our data, whether the

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.740
informal flat file SQL like relational database, or an API,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.260
you might think we are ready to dive in

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.960
and do some analysis. Alas, I am afraid, we are

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.090
not quite there yet. There can often be problems

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.750
with our data. It might not be in a format

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.010
that allows us to easily perform the desired analysis,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.160
or maybe there's a bunch of bad or missing values.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.620
In this next section, let's discuss how to deal

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.660
with these issues so that we can get to the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.810
exciting part of any project, the analysis. Let's talk briefly

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.640
about sanity checking our data. What does it mean to

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.970
sanity check data? Well, put briefly, if we're sanity checking

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.900
data we want to quickly determine, does the data make

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.330
sense? Is there a problem? Does the data look like

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.240
I expect it to? There's a ton of work you

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.790
can do to sanity check your data. We can

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.570
draw plots to visualize the data. You can run some

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.930
basic analyses and tons of other things. I don't want

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.450
to focus too much on this in this course. If

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.030
you'd like to dive deep into the subject, I'd recommend

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.800
taking you down to these exploratory data and analysis course.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.160
However, to do just the bare amount of sanity checking,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.680
Pandas DataFrames do have a useful method called the Scribe.
