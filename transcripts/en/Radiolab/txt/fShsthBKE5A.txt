Speaker 1:          00:01          Um, well, I love the echo and it's, it's a big echo chamber. We're in. Well, sort of. Yeah. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab, the podcast and uh, we're coming to you on the podcast, not from our usual space, which is the studio in New York now or in La and we're sitting on a stage in Chits Royce Hall and on the campus of UCLA. We're on tour. So we have a show, a live show that we do. We can't here, couldn't get back to do our podcast in the normal way so we can do it right here on stage. Yeah, we here. We wanted to actually just talk a little bit about what's going to be happening next week. Next week we have this awesome show which we call color because that's what it's about. It's about the nature and the peculiarities and the anecdotals and the everything of color ads, right?

Speaker 1:          00:43          We're going to explore all kinds of things about the different colors, race, very greens, yellows and all the shades in between. But we're going to play cool stuff right now because here's the cool thing about this, this show. Um, we, uh, one of the experiments we're doing for this colors podcast is, uh, we are working with a ton of really talented musicians who are going to be playing a lot of color themed songs and tons of tons of great musicians are going to be on this hour including Reggie Watts. You may remember him from a, the curious sounds concert we aired a couple of months ago. Amazing Dude does this whole like acapella looping situation. She has him a Mike in a little box and while we've actually been here, uh, on tour, he was back in New York city standing by, so we kind of, we could kind of miss each other. Can you guys hear me? But we call them up on our cell phones and uh,

So I guess you're going to do the Kermit song light. Yeah, I'm going to attempt screens to, yeah, I'll use those words of it. So, Reggie, what does it mean to be green? Well, ecofriendly environment is very important to me. And the planet really needs help. No. Um, I guess, uh, being being greed. I don't, you know, I don't know. I guess being green is like, it's about being different. So I guess, uh, it isn't easy being green. It's not easy being yourself. Oh, sorry. We can't be there to witness it. Five in person. I'm pretty relatively angry, but uh, it's okay. All right, well thanks Reggie. They're calling for us to go on stage there. Yeah, we gotta we gotta run back on there. Fine. Go do shows.
