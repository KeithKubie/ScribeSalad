Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio. W. N y. S. C. E. N. N. P. E. R. All right. Okay, so let's just do the open. All right. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab and today we're going to be talking, well, let, let's do it this way. Which way I, uh, I was at the 92nd street y in New York City, a big gathering spot for up, uh, cool people with new books and that particular we is Richard Dawkins. Richard,

Speaker 2:          00:32          don't you like him?

Speaker 3:          00:38          Make it so easy for him? I decided to begin. This is a real problem for a lot of people by quoting him to him. Um, you right. I Dunno if it's in this book or some other, the total amount of suffering per year in the natural world is beyond all decent contemplation. During the minute it takes me to compose this sentence. Thousands of animals are being eaten alive. Others are running for their lives, whimpering with fear. Others are slowly being devoured from within, by rasping parasites. Thousands of all kinds are dying of starvation, thirst disease. It must be. So if there's ever a time of plenty, this very fact will automatically lead to an increase in population until the natural state of starvation and misery is restored.

Speaker 4:          01:26          Darwin was worried by the same thing. I mean Darwin recognize the, the total horror of the suffering in nature. It's one of the things that actually made him lose his faith, but he also realized that it's not just a fact that it happens. It's, it's intrinsic to natural selection that it must happen. And when you look at a beautiful animal like a Cheetah that appears to be beautifully designed for something like a cheater is amazingly well designed apparently for catching gazelles and gazelles are amazingly well designed for escaping from, from Cheetahs that they are the end products of a sort of evolutionary arms race in which thousands, millions of animals have died. The, the shaping, the, the carving of the shape of a cheetah or a gazelle has come about through millions of unsuccessful gazelles being caught and the successful ones, um, making it through, only to be caught later probably, but after reproducing and passing on the genes that helped them to escape. So the sheer number of deaths that lie behind the sculpting of, of these beautiful creatures is horrifying. And at the same time it goes, it's got a kind of savage beauty

Speaker 5:          02:48          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:50          um, why do you blame them? This exactly what? Because I was sitting there thinking, I know the cheetahs chasing eat antelopes but wasn't there a nice cheetah ones that went over to the antelope and said, here, have a sandwich together. And maybe something about the Cheetah and the had something to do with an act of kindness. And imagine that you see,

Speaker 4:          03:10          I'm thinking that maybe it's not just meanness that can sculpt, but maybe niceness can sculpt too.

Speaker 1:          03:15          The exact niceness as a, as a [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          03:23          [inaudible] niceness as a scout ball. Ooh, I wouldn't listen to that show. Wait a second. We are that show. We should do it then. Let's do it today on radio lab.

Speaker 7:          03:40          Goodness,

Speaker 4:          03:44          selflessness, altruism. If the world is so cruel, how do you account for it? Yeah, how should we think about it? And when you do see generosity,

Speaker 7:          03:55          how do you know what's really generous?

Speaker 5:          04:03          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          04:06          right? So we're going to start the show, uh, with a story that sort of embodies the last question you asked about a guy named George Price, who is a mathematician we never heard of until our producer Lynn Levy told us about him. She heard about it from an author, Orin Harman, who wrote a book called the price as in George Price of altruistic down, you know, this is a high school photo. So okay, so the people on the radio can't see the picture. So describe what he looks like. Well, I tell you, he looks a bit like sort of a, some kind of Scandinavian prince in the 17th century. Good looking guy. Totally. Um, definitely something about this guy's eyes. His eyes. Yeah. This was described to me by a number of people who knew him. He had a gaze that you sort of walked away from at your own peril.

Speaker 4:          04:51          There was something that, you know, he, he sort of new things. You could start George's story anywhere. But let's start in 1943 today, George graduates from college and he's this very kinetic kind of guy, really athletic. You'd swim in the surf and he did a lot of rock climbing and by all accounts he was incredibly brilliant and right after college he starts to kind of bounce through history. He was all over the place. First place he ends up is the Manhattan project on uranium in Richmond, so he was working as a chemist on the atom bomb when he was done with that. After a couple of years he made a 90 degree turn and started working at bell labs on transistor research. Solved some very basic problems there and then disappeared like a phantom. Started working at a medical center on oncology research, meaning cancer and I remember going to his lab playing hide and seek all these bottles and tips to this time. George had a wife and two kids. You look under the microscope at slides of blood and Kathleen, but he never really saw them that much. Work 56 straight without sleeping on beds.

Speaker 8:          05:59          Can I remember? He was always stuff like that. Gone a lot when the kids are still pretty young. You were like five and six he left his family. Yeah, just left

Speaker 4:          06:13          turn another 90 degree corner and began working on computer aided design. In fact, he invented computer aided design. He was firing in all directions. What do you think was driving him to keep moving from thing to thing? He just wanted to succeed at any cost. It made no difference in what field. And at one point in time he was corresponding with about five Nobel laureates each in a different field. He wanted to have one great discovery that would make his name.

Speaker 8:          06:42          So that's, that's George. Wow. Quite a guy. Very interesting guy. So what happens next? So next what happens is he gets on a boat and he, he goes to London. When was this by the way? It's November, 1967 and uh, in London, that's where things, um, for our purposes start to really happen by what happens in London. Well, he starts looking for this question. He goes from library to library. There are 13 libraries that he would hang out at and the question that he finds for himself, which is weird considering his personal history, um, is

Speaker 4:          07:16          why family?

Speaker 8:          07:18          Like why do people have family? Like, why do families stick together? There are a lot of

Speaker 4:          07:23          sort of dynamics within the family where it would make more sense for an individual to sort of break out.

Speaker 8:          07:28          No, go it alone. I'm like, he had and yet family persists

Speaker 4:          07:33          and there should be a good reason for it.

Speaker 8:          07:35          He even wrote about the question to his daughter, Dear Kathleen, my big paper will be on the evolutionary origin of the human family. In most species, the father just mates with the mother and she does all the childbearing herself. But in the human species, the dominant pattern has involved care by adult males toward their own children. Why did our species evolve this way? Yeah, it just brings back what kind of a father our father was towards us and basically there was kind of this benign neglect. Mm. But this question, why family was only the beginning, uh, why family led him to a bigger question, which is why does anybody help anybody? Huh? Well, what do you mean? If you think about, um, Darwin's ideas, survival of the fittest, think about what that really means. It means if you are a creature, you have two big important jobs, you got to survive and you gotta be fit, right? Whatever that means. Fitness really means how many babies can you make, how many babies are you making? And so if you do some stupid, you know, harebrained thing, that means you can't stay alive and or you can't make babies. That doesn't make any sense. Right? And yet, wherever you look in, you see creatures

Speaker 4:          08:56          doing this from bacteria to insects, birds and and wasps. Fish. I'll give you an example. There's a species of Amoeba called Disco Tealium, discoid, IOM Wa, which usually the Amiibo sort of lives on its own. It's a single celled organism in the forest. But when resources are low, what it does is it sends out this chemical signal and all the other Amoeba who are also single celled, they start sending out signals and they start sort of crawling until they all meet and they become one slug, which is now a single organism.

Speaker 8:          09:31          And the slug begins to sort of move along until it finds a place that's windy and sunny, at which point it stops.

Speaker 4:          09:39          And the top 20% of the slug, the top 20% Amoeba in the head of the slug begin to create out of their own body a star

Speaker 5:          09:55          which hardens

Speaker 8:          09:58          and they die while doing so.

Speaker 4:          10:04          But the stock allows the bottom 80% to climb up the stock and to create an orb at the top of this stock.

Speaker 8:          10:11          And from there all the Amoeba that aren't, you know, dead, they can catch a wind

Speaker 9:          10:17          to better pastures. It's like a dandelion. So what's happened is that the top 20% have really sacrificed themselves for the back 80% and that's an Amoeba. So we figured what the hell is happening here? This was a great mystery to Darwin and Darwin said, this is in fact the greatest mystery and the greatest riddle. And if I can't answer it, then my theory isn't worth anything.

Speaker 8:          10:40          And for a hundred years when people talked about evolution, this thing, altruism is the elephant in the room. So we were curious about this. Sorry, I'm, I'm, how might you take this elephant, this niceness thing that seems to be everywhere and shove it back into the mean old theory of evolution? We, it's gotta be a way. So we called up Carl Zimmer, who's a journalist we have on the show quite often and writes a lot about evolution. And he told us in the 1960s just as George Price was starting to ask these questions, some scientists came up with a [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          11:13          new way of thinking about altruism, a thought experiments, which you ran us through. Okay. So, okay, so, so Robert, do you have siblings? I have a sister. Okay. You have a sister, Sarah. Okay. Let's just imagine that, um, you guys are like home from college. Say Okay. And there's a flood at the crawl away,

Speaker 10:         11:32          which manner and the water flooding around. And you can see that your sister is about to die. If you save your sister's life and die in the process, your jeans, Robert Curology's jeans are gone. Yup. Yup.

Speaker 4:          11:50          Right. This is the problem. Yes. But you, your sister a have the same parents? Yes. Okay. So your sister has 50% of your genes, so if I rescue her, then half my genes survive. Right? 50% move on. Oh No. If you had a sister and a brother and you saved them both lead each have 50% so it's a watch and so it's effectively, it's like it's like saving Robert Kralik in his entirety. Mathematically speaking, mathematically speaking. Right. Can you do this with cousins? Yeah, actually if you step it back to cousins,

Speaker 1:          12:25          what percentages are, that's a quarter. In the case of the grist cousins that is, it's an eight so I have to have eight cut first cousins to equal my full genome. Right? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          12:35          Do you have that money? I have 32 third cousins and that's why I always round them up at a Rodeo every year and done and you place them all together. Your mom, you guys stay here in case something happens to me, but here's what I don't get. Like how does this actually operate? Like Robert's not going to sit there while the manners flooding and be like, well, let's see cousin, it's an eight then a second cousin at the 32nd no, you understand the math has already been done. The math is already, the math has been done by evolution on genes and those are the jeans you got. Oh, so you're saying that the, that evolution has turned the math into an instinct. Yeah. You got it.

Speaker 1:          13:12          I don't think I get it. Like so what is the instinct here? The, I know I want to save my sister. Yeah. Well, so here's how I understand it. Since this has half your genes and since second cousin only has a 32nd theoretically, your instinct to save your cyst should be 16 times stronger than your instincts. No, that's actually roughly proportionally. Correct. But keep in mind, this was just an idea. It's just a thought experiment until our Guy George Price comes along and writes an equation, which shows mathematically how an instinct like

Speaker 4:          13:45          this could evolve. Very powerful. Okay. So, well do you want me to just read the letters? Yeah. What is the equation? What equals what. Okay. Okay, so it's a, uh, w times Delta z equals the covariance of w I come a Z, I plus e, we call it e, w. I, Delta, z. I, no, of course. Yeah. There you go.

Speaker 8:          14:10          Well, complicated. I mean, it was simple a second ago. It, yeah, it sounds a little complicated. He's not just dealing with like a simple setup. It's like he's got a traits and how they affect the different groups and how things change over time. So it's a big, there's a lot going on in there. Okay. Yeah. All right.

Speaker 4:          14:26          Do you understand what you just said? Not so here. This is a really interesting word, or we should read it. When he did write the equation, he walked off the street into the university, University College of the University of London in London. Completely unknown. Why just moved from America. No one knew who, who he was. I went to talk to a professor Smith and actually showed equation to the professor and said, is this new? I felt sure that someone must've discovered it before the professor looked at it and after a very, very short amount of minutes, gave him an honorary professorship keys and the keys to a, to an office.

Speaker 11:         15:08          Great. One of the best genetics departments in the world. So George is sitting in his office, which by the way is on the site of Darwin's old house. Whoa. Yeah. And uh, he's made this big discovery and he's thinking,

Speaker 12:         15:28          thinking,

Speaker 4:          15:28          thinking philosophically that what it all meant.

Speaker 12:         15:32          Thank you.

Speaker 4:          15:34          If I can write a formal mathematical treatment of the evolution of a trait like altruism, what it means about the trade is that that the trait is never really purely altruistic.

Speaker 13:         15:48          Mm.

Speaker 4:          15:50          If making a sacrifice helps me in the end or helps my jeans sorta like selfishness in the skies. Yeah. If that's true, the world is a terrible place.

Speaker 13:         16:02          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          16:03          does. It means that there's no true, there could never be true selflessness in the world. My math means that there cannot ever be true selflessness.

Speaker 13:         16:12          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          16:12          And I can't accept a world like that. Why could he suddenly not accept the world like that? I, yeah, I don't know. Um, or other things it might be because precisely because he had been so selfish for most of his life.

Speaker 13:         16:26          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          16:27          and so he decided in his own life to embark on a program of radical altruism that would prove that there was true selflessness in school and that's what led him to the streets of London in search of homeless people. There are licks down and outs and he began by sort of just walking up to them, introducing himself a little. My name is George, what's your name? How can I help you? It's random people on the street. Yeah, everywhere I go I keep running into down and out alcoholics to whom I give, when I have anything and with whom I sit and drink from their bottle. If they offer me a drink by people's sandwiches or give them a few pounds, whether it's by giving them money, cleaning a filthy kitchen and then God, Lord, bigger job. You started giving out keys to his place, dividing these guys into his home.

Speaker 4:          17:16          People were coming and going. He was giving them food clothes. And after a few months of charity like that, he was out of money. There was one letter that he had written to John Maynard Smith and other great biologist of the era which said, John, I'm down to my last 15 p and I can't wait to get rid of the f the last 15 huh? He thought he was proving his equation wrong. So by getting poorer and poorer and giving away all this stuff, he was somehow negating the thing. His math seemed to say was inevitable. The selfish instincts. Yeah. You know, he had self preservation instinct and he was gonna fight the self preservation instinct and, and he was going to win to sort of beat the mathematics that he himself had written. So he was approaching it almost like a, like a math proof. Yeah. Just the red one that you'd be [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          18:03          When he ran out of money, George moved out of his apartment and into this Bandon house in a part of London called Tomer Square, which one does the volume for my headphone, which is where he met Sylvia. It was rough. They were just cause they were just poles holding the walls up some, some places at balls. She was a young artist also squatting at the time and the buildings are crumbling. You know, people who had made, makes shifts, staircases and George had like a room, well, a few clothes on the floor. Not much, but you could see he was always thinking he would go around asking other people, does anybody have shoes? They don't want so and so needs a pair of shoes. You know, that would be part of it, but it might also be like if somebody was sick, getting them to a doctor because if you didn't, if you were homeless, it's very hard to have a doctor.

Speaker 4:          18:56          But like I said, all this is going on. At the same time, he was getting thinner and thinner. The sin neck and then these clothes, it just hung around him. Hmm. He began writing letters to his daughters, apologizing, weeping. Dear Henri, sorry, I deserted you like that and I'm sorry it was such a poor father to you. Yeah, I've been a terrible father. Looking at your picture now makes me wish I could do it all over again. Maybe where I come into the picture is to leave you. And then he wanted to begin again. She says, George asked her to marry him over and over for us. I thought it was, um, kind of a joke and I was Saint George, we can't get met, you know, she said no each time and that at a certain point he gave up. It's hard to really, really remember, but it was cold or is it as a winter came on? Um,

Speaker 5:          19:55          okay.

Speaker 4:          19:56          You wouldn't see George's often. He became quieter. I think. I just remember, um,

Speaker 4:          20:08          I'm quieter. One morning, this guy that was sharing a squat with George name is Shmuley Katia. He was heading out the door. He found beneath the door. Um, as he was going out of the building, he found beneath the door a letter. And since they were living in a squat, he was afraid that this was some kind of eviction notice or something like that. He didn't read English, he couldn't read English. So he ran up the stairs and knocked on George's door because George was the only one who could read English. And when he knocked the door, sort of kind of went in a bit and he could see in the aperture that, that there was blood all over the linoleum floor. Money had enough of an opening. He could see that George was sitting there with no blood left in his body. He killed himself. Yeah. He took a pair of, um, of scissors and cut through his carotid artery, which is a very, very sort of terrible death.

Speaker 14:         21:07          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          21:11          oh, [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         21:20          thanks to producer Lynn Levy for more on George Price, be sure to read Oren Harmon's book, the price of altruism. And thanks also to Carl Zimmer. His latest is microcosm. We'll be right back.
