one study an Alzheimer's disease and and
 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.720

also had my genetics done so it was just

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
also had my genetics done so it was just
 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.150
also had my genetics done so it was just
as a control and compared to people with

as a control and compared to people with
 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.450
as a control and compared to people with
with Alzheimer's and so it was through

and these are particularly a bad hombres

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840
and these are particularly a bad hombres
 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.530
and these are particularly a bad hombres
and some serial killers etc and I had

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540
and some serial killers etc and I had
 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.330
and some serial killers etc and I had
looked at these been instant analyzed

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340
looked at these been instant analyzed
 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.240
looked at these been instant analyzed
them over the years from the early 1990s

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250
them over the years from the early 1990s
 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.310
them over the years from the early 1990s
onward and in in about the same time

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320
onward and in in about the same time
 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.429
onward and in in about the same time
2005 when I was doing my own scans for

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439
2005 when I was doing my own scans for
 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.069

the South summer study I had got a whole

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079
the South summer study I had got a whole
 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.289
the South summer study I had got a whole
group of these killers and in also

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299
group of these killers and in also
 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.960
group of these killers and in also
Psychopaths and looked at a pattern I

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970
Psychopaths and looked at a pattern I
 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.310
Psychopaths and looked at a pattern I
said my god there's a pattern in the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320
said my god there's a pattern in the
 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.620
said my god there's a pattern in the
brain for these guys and so I started to

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630
brain for these guys and so I started to
 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.649
brain for these guys and so I started to
talk about it give talks and you know in

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659
talk about it give talks and you know in
 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.810
talk about it give talks and you know in

of vet the idea but at the same time I

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049
of vet the idea but at the same time I
 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.679
of vet the idea but at the same time I
got this pile of scans back that

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689
got this pile of scans back that
 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.020
got this pile of scans back that
included my own and these other controls

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030
included my own and these other controls
 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.940
included my own and these other controls
and I was looking through I got to the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950
and I was looking through I got to the
 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.770
and I was looking through I got to the
last scan of that study at the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780
last scan of that study at the
 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.440
last scan of that study at the
Alzheimer's and I I looked at it and I

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450
Alzheimer's and I I looked at it and I
 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.870
Alzheimer's and I I looked at it and I
asked my technician I said you got to

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880
asked my technician I said you got to
 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.280
asked my technician I said you got to
check the machines because this is

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290
check the machines because this is
 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.199
check the machines because this is
obviously one of the killers it's one of

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209
obviously one of the killers it's one of
 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.180
obviously one of the killers it's one of
the mers it looked like a really like a

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190
the mers it looked like a really like a
 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.860
the mers it looked like a really like a
severe case of brain

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870
severe case of brain
 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.649
severe case of brain
main activity lost in a psychopath and

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659
main activity lost in a psychopath and
 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.430
main activity lost in a psychopath and
so when I multiple they said no this is

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440
so when I multiple they said no this is
 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.160
so when I multiple they said no this is
part of its in this control group and I

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170
part of its in this control group and I
 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.680
part of its in this control group and I
had to tear back the the name on it

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690
had to tear back the the name on it
 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.119
had to tear back the the name on it
because I always do anything blind but

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129
because I always do anything blind but
 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.800
because I always do anything blind but
this was like something's really wrong

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810
this was like something's really wrong
 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.289
this was like something's really wrong
and it turned out to me my name so it

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299
and it turned out to me my name so it
 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.789
and it turned out to me my name so it
was like you know Gandalf shows up at

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799
was like you know Gandalf shows up at
 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.399
was like you know Gandalf shows up at
the door in and you're it and so that

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409
the door in and you're it and so that
 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.979
the door in and you're it and so that
started this whole trajectory now at

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989
started this whole trajectory now at
 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.470
started this whole trajectory now at
first I didn't think I laughed at it and

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480
first I didn't think I laughed at it and
 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.649
first I didn't think I laughed at it and
and I just didn't care we were so busy

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659
and I just didn't care we were so busy
 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:43.970
and I just didn't care we were so busy
working on the genetics of Alzheimer's

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980
working on the genetics of Alzheimer's
 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.920
working on the genetics of Alzheimer's
and also schizophrenia and I just

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930
and also schizophrenia and I just
 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.930
and also schizophrenia and I just
started an adult stem cell company and

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940
started an adult stem cell company and
 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.789
started an adult stem cell company and
so I was so busy with stuff I kind of

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799
so I was so busy with stuff I kind of
 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.110
so I was so busy with stuff I kind of
let it go for a couple years really

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120
let it go for a couple years really
 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.849
let it go for a couple years really
there probably year and a half but then

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859
there probably year and a half but then
 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.520
there probably year and a half but then
the genetics came back and I had all the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530
the genetics came back and I had all the
 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.860
the genetics came back and I had all the
genetic alleles the forms of the genes

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870
genetic alleles the forms of the genes
 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.720
genetic alleles the forms of the genes
that are associated with the high

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730
that are associated with the high
 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.390
that are associated with the high
aggression and and of violence

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400
aggression and and of violence
 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.610
aggression and and of violence
psychopathy and a low kind of empathy

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620
psychopathy and a low kind of empathy
 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.220
psychopathy and a low kind of empathy
interpersonal emotional empathy and low

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230
interpersonal emotional empathy and low
 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.119
interpersonal emotional empathy and low
anxiety and in it when I got that back I

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129
anxiety and in it when I got that back I
 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:15.740
anxiety and in it when I got that back I
started to take a little bit of note but

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750
started to take a little bit of note but
 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.879
started to take a little bit of note but
it still didn't care about it and it

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889
it still didn't care about it and it
 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.520
it still didn't care about it and it
wasn't until I ended up giving a talk I

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530
wasn't until I ended up giving a talk I
 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.690
wasn't until I ended up giving a talk I
was asked to give a talk with the ex

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700
was asked to give a talk with the ex
 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.970
was asked to give a talk with the ex
prime minister of Oslo and bipolar

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980
prime minister of Oslo and bipolar
 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.120
prime minister of Oslo and bipolar
disorder and so I went to Oslo to give a

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130
disorder and so I went to Oslo to give a
 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.610
disorder and so I went to Oslo to give a
public talk with him that the clinician

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620
public talk with him that the clinician
 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.830
public talk with him that the clinician
on bipolar

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840
on bipolar
 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.270
on bipolar
you know what's the brain patterns and I

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280
you know what's the brain patterns and I
 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.180
you know what's the brain patterns and I
had to use my own example of how we you

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190
had to use my own example of how we you
 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.369
had to use my own example of how we you
do imaging genetics we take imaging of

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379
do imaging genetics we take imaging of
 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.699
do imaging genetics we take imaging of
the brain

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709

genetics put it together in a

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900
genetics put it together in a
 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.539
