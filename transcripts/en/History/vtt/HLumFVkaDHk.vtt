00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:02.669
lorence Harding in one word,

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.462
I would pick the
word determined.

00:00:04.462 --> 00:00:07.465
She was determined to propel
her husband's career along.

00:00:07.465 --> 00:00:09.676
She was determined to be
an advocate for women.

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:12.345
She was determined to
protect her husband's legacy.

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:14.139
She was fierce in that way.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.517
(upbeat music)

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:20.019
People said had Warren
Harding not met Florence,

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.271
he would have
remained a small-town

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:23.189
newspaper editor his whole life.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.607
- When she married
Warren Harding,

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:27.193
who was the editor
of The Marion Star,

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:28.653
she basically took over.

00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:31.197
He had actually had
a nervous breakdown,

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:34.451
and Florence stepped up,
and ran the newspaper.

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:36.703
She was an extremely
savvy businesswoman.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.830
- Florence Harding saw in Warren

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.624
the ability for him to go
very, very far in politics,

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:45.211
and she pushed him to be
involved in local politics,

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.547
state politics, and
to move up the ladder.

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:50.300
- She really pushed Warren
Harding into the Presidency.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.344
And after he was inaugurated,
she turned to him and said,

00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:54.888
I got you the Presidency,

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:57.182
now what are you
going to do with it?

00:00:57.182 --> 00:00:59.517
- Florence Harding was
different from the First Ladies

00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:00.977
who came before her.

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:03.396
She was the first First Lady
to vote for her husband,

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:04.814
because she's the
first First Lady

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:06.566
after women were
granted suffrage.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.485
And she was certainly
the first First Lady

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:09.986
to state openly and often

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:13.490
that she was not just
pro-suffrage, but a feminist.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.742
She did not wear a wedding ring.

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:18.661
She used her maiden
name on purpose,

00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:20.497
as other First Ladies
would after her.

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:23.666
- She was a very strong
activist in women's rights.

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.835
Little things at
that particular time.

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:27.837
For instance, she
invited divorced women

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:32.383
into various social events,
which broke an unwritten rule.

00:01:32.383 --> 00:01:36.513
She invited scientist Madame
Curie to the White House

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:38.848
to promote education for women.

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:41.392
- She made sure
that women's rights

00:01:41.392 --> 00:01:43.686
stayed on the national agenda.

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:46.189
When Mrs. Harding
became First Lady,

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.690
one of the things
she wanted to do

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.400
was to open the White House
again to all Americans.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.028
Because of Wilson's health
and because of World War I,

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:54.364
the White House had become
closed to Americans.

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:56.282
- Often times she
would come downstairs,

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.451
the public were very
excited when they walk in

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.286
thinking they were
going to see a docent,

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:03.456
and the First Lady would walk
over and show them the house.

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:05.959
The public loved her
because she was so gracious,

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.127
and warm and entertaining.

00:02:09.587 --> 00:02:11.297
- Like many First Ladies,
Florence Harding believed

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:13.633
that she could read people
better than her husband.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:16.594
- She was very opinionated
about his Cabinet.

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:19.138
It was very important
to her that her husband

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:21.933
surround himself with
the right people.

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:25.061
Well, she also surrounded
Warren Harding with men

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:27.647
that he unfortunately
could not control.

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:30.233
It wasn't Warren Harding
himself that was corrupt,

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:34.445
it was his administration,
and that infuriated Florence.

00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:38.074
- He died virtually alone in
a hotel room in California

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:39.993
and when she refused an autopsy,

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:42.120
she kicked off all
sorts of suspicions

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.455
that somehow she had been
complicit in his death,

00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:47.500
which historians believe
is not at all true.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.753
After his death, there were
scandals rising to the surface.

00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:53.423
Mrs. Harding worked
very hard to make sure

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:56.134
that his legacy
was a positive one.

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:57.677
It did not work.

00:02:57.677 --> 00:03:00.013
We don't remember Harding
among our top Presidents.
