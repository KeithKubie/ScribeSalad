00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:11.709
One thing about making commitments of action
is, I keep telling people: don’t make it

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:14.160
cast in stone.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.300
When you go to the field keep asking questions.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:24.450
And I remember I was responding to the children
who were abducted by the Lord’s Resistance

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.450
Army.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.439
I was in northern Uganda and then I just kept
asking questions.

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.930
Then I asked, “What happened to the women
who went through the war?”

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.160
Because there was a lot of, you know, rape,
as a weapon of war.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.879
And the local concert chairman told me okay,
there are 15 women.

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:49.210
So I took a bus to meet these 15 women because
some of them were raped, homeless.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.420
So I just went to meet with them and I just
started asking questions.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.019
First of all I said you are fifteen people,
you have one man in the group.

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:01.259
How is that?

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:05.089
And they told me that this man knows how to
read and write, so that’s why they have

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:06.110
him in the group.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.450
Because when they talk about their issues
and all that there’s somebody who can read

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.450
and write.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.969
So for me, that was already communication—that
the women do not know how to read and write.

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:18.670
So I thanked the gentleman for being part
of the team and I asked them which villages

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.740
they come from.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.090
That’s when I started hearing stories of
homelessness.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.680
One woman told me how her husband was abducted
and then the rebels used him to come and kill

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.330
his own people.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.270
So in retaliation, his people sent her away
with her six daughters.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:46.799
So you can imagine, every night they have
to look for where to sleep, to stay.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.600
And woman after woman told me how they are
homeless.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.109
So then I asked them a question: what does
it take to have a house?

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:00.850
Because those are, you know, grass thatched
houses.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.029
And then they started to tell me it takes
grass, it takes water, it takes this.

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:08.350
I’m like, where can we get those things?

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.310
And then they started to tell me—so it’s
them actually getting their own ideas.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.849
Then I told them, what do we require that
needs money?

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:23.170
So it came to nails, you know, things like
wood to make the doors and stuff like that.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.030
But most of the things, the materials would
come from their own communities.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.989
And for me I remember that day I said okay,
I’ll leave money for two huts—because

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.870
those are the houses.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.030
And I say okay, in which order are we going
to get this housing?

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.910
So they also knew which woman was more desperate.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.180
“Okay, this one who has more children and
this one doesn’t have anything.”

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.420
So they made their own decisions.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.569
And then we started dividing roles:
“Okay, this is the money I have, so who

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:57.569
will keep this money?”

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.020
So we already got an accountant.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.920
We had somebody in charge of water.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.939
We had somebody in charge of cooking food
while the others are building.

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:11.400
And the next weekend —because it was urgent—it
dawned on us that some of the women did not

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.400
have land.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.860
And we said okay, who can we ask for land?

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.890
Who has land in this village?

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.430
And they said oh, there’s a church.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.670
So we went to see the head of the church.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.379
We said okay, we need land.

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:27.159
So great enough so he offered some land for
women who didn’t have.

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:33.879
I started going back over weekends and actually
building the huts and through that mud while

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.080
others are collecting water.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.660
So it was a scene in the village.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.760
And so when the men saw us do that they got
embarrassed, and they would come and join

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.609
us as volunteers.

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.299
As we built we’re talking about issues of
peace.

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.340
We’re talking about issues of HIV Aids,
which were affecting them.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.750
And then through the discussions—because
I wanted to find out: are the children going

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.659
to school, now that we have land?

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:02.680
That’s when it came to my mind that okay,
I’m going to offer to buy an ox plow and

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.040
then we can lend that to people who have the
cows, the cattle.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.159
And then they can also lend us the cows in
turn so that they can pull the ox plow and

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.239
we plow our gardens in turns and collectively.

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.910
So when they do that and then they grow the
crops, so these crops can be sold and money

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.580
used for medicine and taking children to school.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.889
That’s how the Huts for Peace program was
born.

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.660
I didn’t plan it, but at the Clinton Global
Initiative they teach us to be creative.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.180
You meet very many people in this network
and you’re made very inspired.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.889
So that’s how the Huts for Peace program
was born and I’m really happy about that.

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:43.880
Because it is their project.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.290
Even as I sit here they continue building!

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.410
And they build communities and women knowing
that the power is in their hands.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.800
And when women are given sources of responsibility,
before you know it they start campaigning

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.220
in the village and become village leaders.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.819
So that is growth, and you see children going
to school, and you see involvement happening

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:04.060
by the people themselves.
