Adetola Olatunji: We all realized how much
it affected not only the

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.209
people that we knew in the company, but also
our friends, like outside

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.520
the company -- on campus and back home. So
we thought it'd be a good

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.619
idea to use our dance, and the fact that we
already reach out to people

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.700
through our dance to bring the campus together,
to be able to get

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.999
involved and help out and give back.
Brittany Kelleher: You know, I'm very fortunate

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:35.500
to be here in the
United States, here in Princeton, and any

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.080
opportunity to give back and
to help with the catastrophe that happened,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.150
I'm willing to do.
Adam from diSiaC: It's hard sometimes when

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.559
these things happen in the
world and as college students -- it's like

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.879
you're kind of you know, like
"how can I possibly help? what can my contribution

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.711
mean, or how can it
really be significant?"

00:00:53.711 --> 00:00:54.780
Lara Yuan: I thought it was a really great
way to help with the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.180
earthquake. After hearing about it, I wanted
to help in some way, and I

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.830
didn't know what the best way would be; and
what better way than to

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.250
dance, to do what I love?
Kyle Ofori: To be able to put something that

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.610
you uniquely can do
towards a good cause -- it gives you a good

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.820
feeling.
Adetola Olatunji: What it means to me to be

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.740
able to have my dance
company come together and then have other

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.219
dance companies collaborate
with us and be willing to join with us, that's

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:21.310
awesome to see. It
doesn't have to be about what dance company

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.189
you're in, or any of that,
we can just forget about all those divides

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.549
for now and just come
together. It means a lot to see that our campus

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:36.490
can just really unite
for one cause. It's amazing to see that.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:44.389
Kyle: I'm Kyle Ofori. I'm a freshman in Highsteppers.
Brittany: My name is Brittany Kelleher, and

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:45.389
I am the artistic director
for BodyHype.

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:46.389
Lara: [laughs] I'm Lara Yuan, and I'm with
eXpressions.

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:50.609
Adam: My name's Adam, and I'm in diSiaC.
Adetola: I'm Adetola Olatunji and I'm artistic

00:01:50.609 --> 00:02:12.690
director of BAC.
