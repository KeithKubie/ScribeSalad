00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.310
I want to provide you some hints as to
how to go about restructuring this code.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.670
You have already seen all the code
necessary to complete this challenge.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.020
All of the CRUD operations from
lesson one will come in handy here.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.411
You will have to import the modules
you used to do your CRUD commands in

00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:14.061
lesson one.

00:00:14.061 --> 00:00:14.913
Alll of the code for

00:00:14.913 --> 00:00:18.560
these objectives can be written
within your web server.pi file.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.930
You'll need to reconstruct your do_GET
and do_POST methods, such that they

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.980
perform the necessary CRUD operations
to create the desired functionality.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.770
Print statements are simple ways to
see if our code is flowing the way

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:29.710
we expect.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.030
Feel free to use print statements to
see what blocks your code is in, and

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.170
the value of variables,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.570
like I did with the output variable
that showed our HTML code.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.010
Within your browser, you can view source
code, as well as inspect DOM elements,

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.670
to see if you are outputting the HTML
you expect to see from your server code.
