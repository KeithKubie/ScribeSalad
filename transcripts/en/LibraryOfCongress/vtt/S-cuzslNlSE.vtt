00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.530
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford: On
behalf of the Music Division,

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.930
thank you all for coming today.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.350
It may be fair to say that
Doctor Dayton C. Miller,

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.030
a scientist by profession, a
self-described flutist by fate,

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.790
and a collector above all,

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.230
gradually developed the
largest private collection

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.230
of diverse objects ever
assembled pertaining

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.400
to one subject in
the musical arts.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.430
As Miller once wrote,

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.090
"The making collections is
a highly developed fine art,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.640
and a science of
great antiquity.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.150
For many years, the
writers made every effort,

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.610
with the assistance of many
friends in various parts

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.190
of the world, to gather all
available materials relating

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.830
to the flute, always proceeding
systematically and critically

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.010
for the purpose of setting forth
the history and development

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.900
of the modern flute
as an essential factor

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.540
in the fine art of music."

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.040
Recording his collections,
and the collecting

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.690
of his collections
in stunning detail,

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.020
and with steady perseverance,
Miller's self-titled,

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.580
The Dayton C. Miller Collections
Relating to the Flute,

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.960
comprised five separate
collections.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.560
Flutes, books, music, works of
art, portraits, and autographs.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.440
In 1941, the Library of
Congress accepted the gift

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.040
in its entirety.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.580
Miller's bequest exemplifies the
relationship between collectors

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.700
and museums, whereby
the donation

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.850
of a private collector
can educate

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.740
and inspire the public
for perpetuity.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.860
Who was this American collector,
who so strongly believed

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.750
that the history of the art
of music was an essential part

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.300
of civilization that his
flutes should be housed forever

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.600
in a national library?

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.820
Dayton Clarence Miller was born
in Strongsville, Ohio in 1866,

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.620
and lived in Cleveland, Ohio,
along with his wife, Edith,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.580
his flute collection in his
office at the Physics Department

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.640
at Kay School of
Applied Science,

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.020
now called Case Western.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.830
Miller was raised in nearby
Berea, Ohio, where his father,

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.040
Charles, who died in 1918, was
a fife-playing farmer, merchant,

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.960
and banker turned electric
traction executive,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.160
while his mother
Vienna, who died in 1919,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.760
was a church organist, and
his grandfather was a founding

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.070
trustee of Oberlin College.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.400
Dayton Miller as a boy enjoyed
the sport of ladder climbing,

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.310
playing flute and piano,
bookkeeping, and making things

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.600
of tin in the family hardware
store, as well as gardening,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.150
grape-stomping, and tending
the steam-driven sawmill

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.930
on the family farm.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.700
By 1818, Miller's dual
interest in science

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.100
and music had emerged, laying
the foundation by fate,

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.980
apparently, of his burgeoning
collecting obsession.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.990
Now, at 14 years
old, he played flute

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.250
in Berea's Schubert Orchestra,
built several telescopes,

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.380
and started, prophetically,
collecting science catalogs.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.350
For his 1886 commencement
service, Miller gave a lecture

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.550
on the sun, and played
a flute solo.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.250
Soon thereafter, Miller started
chasing comets, and in the span

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.400
of only a few years, his
science career would progress

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.390
with rapid speed as he
attained [inaudible] degrees

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.480
and recognition as America's
most popular scientist.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.070
And, that is true up until 1919.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.430
He was the most popular
scientist, and then,

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.110
of course, Einstein took over.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.130
Miller entered Princeton
University in 1887

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.060
to study astronomy,
distinguishing himself in 1890

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.260
as the only one in his class
to receive a doctor of science.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.250
He earned his degree for his
observations of the orbit

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.620
of the comet 18895, by employing
25 telescopes over the course

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.860
of three weeks, working
14 hours solid per day,

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.880
and logging over 200
pages of logarithms.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.030
Also during this time, he had
returned to Berea in 1888,

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.520
to teach at Baldwin
Wallace College,

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.570
where he received a bachelor
and a master's of arts,

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.860
while also serving as department
chair in the natural sciences.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.220
Miller would later in 1936
become president of the board

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.740
of trustees of Baldwin Wallace.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.730
By 1893, he was married, and
assistant professor of physics

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.090
at Case, and chair by 1895.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.920
While at Case for more
than four decades,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.880
Doctor Miller had a
prolific research career,

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.470
studying the velocity of
light in magnetic fields,

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.240
the photography of bullets in
flight, sound waves, x-rays,

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.040
wireless telegraphy,
and ether drift,

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.910
and enjoyed an eminent
teaching career,

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.880
including departmental posts
in astronomy, mathematics,

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.710
physics, and acoustics.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.010
Doctor Miller the acoustician
was a founding member

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.250
and second president of the
American Society of Acoustics.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.900
He investigated the acoustics
of auditorium design and served

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.850
as an advisor on a number

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.770
of U.S. auditoriums
including the National Academy

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.060
of Sciences, Severance Hall, and
the chapels at Dennison College,

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.040
Bryn Mawr, and Princeton.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.360
The convergence of
his scientific

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.530
and musical inquiries
led him to try

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.510
to identify the tonal
characteristics in qualities

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.620
in musical sounds, resulting

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.130
in his particularly note-worthy
1908 patent of the phonodeik,

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.560
a predecessor to
the oscilloscope.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.620
It was-- the phonodeik
was devised

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.990
to record phonographically the
waves of musical instruments,

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.880
and the voice, among
other things.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.870
Investigations with flutes of
differing material led Miller

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.180
to conclude that gold produced
overtones that were greater

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.550
in number and strength
than those of wood,

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.150
ivory, silver, or crystal.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.850
Miller's studies in music, and
his achievements in acoustics,

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.110
only contributed
partially to the start

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.730
of his flute collection.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.110
Also to blame were his radio
broadcasts on musical acoustics,

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.720
and his sub-career, replete
with his own booking agent,

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.530
on the international lecture
circuit, where he gave

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.570
over 70 lectures on
the topic of x-rays.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:29.870
It is remarkable that in 1896,
his wife took a full-length set

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.470
of x-rays of him, which
he used as material

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.630
in his study and lectures.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.730
According to his records, which
I have over here, his popular,

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.760
entertaining, and enthusiastic
lecture demonstrations,

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.910
of which there were over 500,

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.950
reached a total accumulated
audience of 100,000.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.610
Even as late as 1931,
for example, as president

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.580
of the American Society of
Acoustics, he gave a lecture

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.260
that discussed the history
of the flute, its tone

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.550
and acoustics, and included
demonstrations of his own flute.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.710
Eventually, Miller would
receive much acclaim

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.700
for his scientific endeavors.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.350
And, I have some of
them listed here.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:13.100
These are the honorary
degrees and board members.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.810
Usually he was a
charting member.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.230
And then, on the next page,
you'll see the numerous books,

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:23.040
articles, and these lectures
all provide ample evidence

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.270
of the scope of his
scientific researches and later,

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.190
their connections
and intersections

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.680
with his organological interest.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.720
Organology is the study of the
science in musical instruments.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.360
Dayton C. Miller the
flutist had a pioneering

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.950
and prodigious career.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.020
The early years, about 1880
to 1890, were dedicated

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.200
to the practice and
performance on the flute,

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:54.760
and flute composition
including-- my favorite--

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.320
this piece, which is
called The Audacious Jewel,

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.180
dated February 14th, 1893.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.480
A romantic piece,

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.840
likely involving his
successful marriage proposal

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.220
to his soon-to-be wife.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.720
This is charming because
it has a photograph of her

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.570
in there, and this is 1893.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:17.980
And, there's the
diamond ring I suppose.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.640
That's from the piece.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.180
But, his self-education
went further to the design

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.520
and construction of flutes,
flute theory, acoustic studies

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.210
of the flute, flute
bibliography, and cataloging.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:36.230
Miller's culminating career as a
collector, a natural conclusion

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.850
of all his previous
study, would consume him

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.270
until the day he died.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.340
At some point, Miller turned
from being an amateur flutist

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.680
in his early years, to an
obsessed flute fanatic.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.280
The turning point might have
occurred during Miller's maiden

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.420
voyage to 1896, now
age 30, Miller was set

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.240
to visit not only the
world-renowned German physicist

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.970
Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen,

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.080
but also to the flute
manufacturing firm

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:06.310
of Rudall Carte,
for the delivery

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:08.530
of a flute he had made to order.

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:11.980
And, that is called
Flute Number 4.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.170
And, here it is.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:21.580
In 1896, a couple months later,
he wrote back to Rudall Carte

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.070
that he was playing
the new flute from one

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:25.680
to four hours every day.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:32.030
As a flutist myself,
that was a lot.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.510
He purchased his second
flute from them in 1898.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.810
That's Number 5.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.980
And, when he returned to England
to pick it up from the shop,

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.240
he heard for the first
time, a flute of gold.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.950
It was on this trip in 1900
that his ears were opened

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.250
to a sound he would not forget.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.770
Apparently, Miller's budget in
these years was not sufficient

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.920
for the purchase of a gold
flute, but after appearing

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.240
as an expert witness in a
lawsuit regarding x-rays,

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.370
the fee for his testimony was
sufficient for him to purchase,

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.040
and make, a few flutes
of sliver and gold.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.960
The two extant flutes are
Number 8 and Number 10.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.560
This is Number 8.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.870
This is silver.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.890
This is an E-flat flute, so
it looks a little smaller.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.060
And then, Number 10.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.660
This is a blowout of Number
10, which is a gold flute.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.900
True to the scientist he was, he
documented the hours it took him

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.650
to build this flute,
which was 3 years,

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:51.000
or 206 and a quarter
days, or 1,650 hours.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.970
This is a remarkable instrument,
and I'm going to show it to you.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:08.090
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:10.190
This is the second flute
he built by himself.

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:13.650
This is 22 karat gold,
with 18 karat keys.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:14.970
And, it's in one piece.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.900
If you're a flutist, you
know that's a little unusual.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.850
And, this was used and
borrowed at Severance Hall.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:35.640
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.940
Solid tube.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.970
He bought a few other
tubes before that,

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.840
before he got it right.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.830
By 1917, Miller entered a
new phase of his flute life,

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:49.470
leaving playing, composing,
and building flutes behind,

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.460
as having just turned 50,

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.370
he would spend the next 24
years forging connections

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:57.360
around the world through
his travels as a scientist,

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.400
his growing renown as a flute
collector, and his dedication

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.740
to maintaining correspondence
with acquaintances and dealers

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.690
that would last decades.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:09.820
After 1917, Miller purchased
90% of his collection of flutes,

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.160
music, and books,
adding works of art

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.470
to his collecting scope in 1923.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.880
While his science career
engrossed his days,

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.440
his nights were filled
with a flute hobby

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.110
that would soon turn him
into a serious collector

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.620
with a seriously
large collection,

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.310
all housed in Miller's
Cleveland, Ohio apartment.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:32.220
It was Mrs. Miller's duty,
as her husband once noted,

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:35.730
to keep water jars
filled near the flutes.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:40.330
Fo those people in conservation
here, they will appreciate that.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:45.170
The art and science
of collecting.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:46.810
Dayton C. Miller's
lifelong interest

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:49.240
in collecting wind instruments
may have had its root

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.610
in the playpen.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.030
As during his early
childhood, he found a fife

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:56.560
that his father had played in
the United States Civil War.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.940
Miller's ledger-- and this
is an annotation of it--

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.940
lists this fife fragment
as DCM Number 1.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.020
This is Flute Number
1 in his ledger.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.320
And, I have it right here.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.300
The entry includes a confession
that the battered condition

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.930
of the instrument had little to
do with its military history.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.510
You can see that the end of
the fife is broken off here,

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:22.900
and if you read this,
you can see

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.340
that he used it as a plaything.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:30.240
This ledger entry, the only
truly personal entry Miller ever

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.350
recorded, might shed
light on the beginnings

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:34.650
of the collector in Miller.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.900
Psychological observations by
writers such as Donald Winnicott

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.140
and Werner Muensterberger, the
later expounding particularly

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:47.090
on the psychology and
passions of collectors,

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:50.150
would attribute this specific
childhood memory and object

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.740
as the proverbial
security blanket,

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.810
whereby the fife provided
solace and the first passion

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:59.310
for possession to young
Dayton in the playpen.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:02.130
Later as Dayton's childhood
was filled with organ, piano,

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:06.140
and flute playing, the tangible
object would, figuratively,

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.120
provide increasing value
and comfort, particularly

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.250
when his family, who had
lived in the same Ohio towns

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:15.520
for generations, moved away
to the West Coast in an effort

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.940
to save the life of his sister.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.300
Miller would later confess

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.410
that he thought his life
might also be cut short.

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:25.070
But to the contrary,
he and his sister lived

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.130
for a very long time.

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:32.180
Thus, by 1893, Miller was
left behind to support himself

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.510
with his new career
and his new bride,

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.420
and a fear of dying young.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:39.520
Eventually his flute purchases
likely provided a source

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.590
of satisfaction, thereby
easing the anxiety

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.750
of separation and adulthood.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.370
For sure, anxiety would
not come into play,

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:50.970
even during the Great War, and
Depression years, until the end

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:55.080
of his life when he was unable
to sustain the collection safely

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.940
in his private home, and he was
unable to secure the public home

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.020
that he desired for the flutes.

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:06.580
With further psychoanalytical
probing, it is clear that some

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.090
of MIller's traits were inborn,

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.650
and some were acquired,
or self-taught.

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:12.320
He was from a
multi-generational,

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.940
well-respected Ohio family that
may have contributed a sense

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:19.040
of American pride,
duty, and sentiment.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.910
In this hard-working,
and well-off family,

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:24.070
he learned that stability
and security were earned,

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:27.180
and he was not to
inherit a life of ease.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:30.040
His spending money as a youth
and college student came

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.230
from chores in the
family garden,

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.070
or clerking in the family bank,

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:38.040
and as he later remarked
toward the end of his life,

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:42.490
his adult flute collection
purchases were directly funded

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.320
by his science activities.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.230
Clearly wealth or a
comfortable financial stability

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:50.800
at some level was a constant
in his many years of buying,

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.940
but at least with Miller,

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:56.400
he must have also
required restraint.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.540
Yet, he must have been
slightly obsessed.

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:02.250
The English collector and
bibliographer, William Hazlitt,

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:04.240
in his Confessions
of a Collector,

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.830
found his own obsession
to be "an inborn

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:10.060
and indestructible human trait.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:12.880
A task demanding knowledge,
discretion, and patience

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.160
in order to achieve a
satisfactory result."

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.300
From the psychiatric
perspective, in 1998,

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.520
the term Dayton C.
Miller syndrome was coined

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:26.150
by the clinical psychiatrist
John Braverman Levine to mean

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.260
"an uncontrolled interest

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.430
in the developmental
history of the flute.

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:34.240
The patient becomes preoccupied
both with physical objects,

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.800
and with systems
of categorization.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.800
As the collection
increases in size,

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.640
the conceptual categories
change,

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.340
and the sufferer is compelled
to acquire more items."

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:45.880
Further, in a paper delivered

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.630
to the National Flute
Association annual meeting

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:52.430
in 2002, Levine concluded
Doctor Miller came

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.640
out of the 19th century
tradition of science

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.690
as high class description.

00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:00.170
As an astronomer, he was trained
to make, record, organize,

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:04.460
and classify observations over
very long periods of time.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.370
Levine stated, With this
patient, Doctor Miller,

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:11.240
in collecting obsession
was not a disorder,

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.550
rather it was a necessity.

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:19.310
Ultimately, one must wonder,
after 45 years of collecting,

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:22.520
how much can an obsession cost?

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.450
How much did Miller spend to
amass the staggering number

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:28.360
of items that range
from rare first editions

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.110
and singular works of
art, to a flute made

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:34.860
for Frederick the Great,
to oodles of pan pipes?

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.380
And, with no children--

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:39.530
the likely culprit being
the x-ray machine--

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:42.840
or family left in
Ohio, what would happen

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.220
with Miller's flute collection?

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.910
I'm now going to turn
it over to Paul Runci.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:53.680
By day, Paul works with numbers,
science, and technology.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.730
And at night, he's a flute
player and a flute collector.

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:01.620
&gt;&gt; Paul Runci: [inaudible]

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.970
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Not yet.

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:10.690
&gt;&gt; Paul Runci: Thank
you, Carol Lynn.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:13.720
And, thanks everyone for being
here, and for this opportunity

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.930
to talk with you all today.

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:20.390
I should probably start with
a few words on why I'm here.

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.760
I'm not a professional
musician, or a collector,

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.790
or a librarian, or anything.

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:30.350
But about 8 years ago
now, I was a fellow

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:32.200
in the Senate, working here.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.990
And, stumbled on to the fact

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:36.550
that the Miller Collection
existed here

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:37.900
at the Library of Congress.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.380
As a flute player-- actually
an Irish flute player--

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.360
the reason I play Irish music is

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:46.810
because it's the only way you
can be a mediocre flute player

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:50.290
and still get a free beer.

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:53.540
So, I managed to get in
touch with Carol Lynn,

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.860
and she invited me in.

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.420
and, I saw this collection,

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.980
and thought I'd never seen
a happier place in my life,

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.670
and I need to find
a way to, kind of,

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:02.970
stay in connection to it.

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:07.090
So, I started out on this
project with Carol Lynn,

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.300
which she just described.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:13.010
You know, we started out on
a whim with this question of,

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:15.850
you know, what was the
purchase cost of this?

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:18.410
If we were to put this
in today's dollars,

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:20.580
what did it actually cost
him, and how would you manage

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:25.130
to amass something like
this as a humble professor?

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:29.190
So, anyway, we started down this
rabbit hole of trying to, just,

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:31.680
kind of, establish
the purchase value

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.040
in today's dollars
of the collection.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.290
And, so that's what I'm going

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:39.720
to talk a little bit
about here today.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.790
If you look at the chart
here, let me just, kind of--

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:45.550
I don't know how well you
can see it, but I'll explain.

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:49.800
So, the black line with the
black square dots on it,

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:54.930
is the total purchase
value in 2015 dollars

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.220
of the flutes that he bought.

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.530
The yellow line is the number

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.910
of flutes purchased
in any given year.

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:04.470
So, if you look at the Y
axis on the left-hand side,

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:06.230
that gives the dollars.

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:12.430
The right-hand Y axis gives you
the actual number of flutes.

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:14.880
So, as we began to
think about how

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:19.610
to assess just the purchase
value of this, you know,

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:21.580
you quickly run into
the question of, well,

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.750
how do you adjust the dollars

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:27.570
from whatever the nominal
year was into today's dollars?

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:31.590
And, there are lots of different
metrics for doing that.

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:35.030
Ultimately, we settled on
the Consumer Price Index,

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:38.510
which is a fairly standard
metric for measuring things

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:41.290
that aren't traded across
international boundaries.

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:43.390
You know, if goods are traded,

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:45.940
if you're buying things
a lot overseas, you know,

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:49.610
you'd use market exchange rates,
or purchasing power parities,

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:53.680
or other sorts of currency
deflators like that.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.790
But, since he was buying
things in the U.S. primarily,

00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:00.740
with exceptions, you know,
we went with the CPI.

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.120
So, it's imperfect.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:07.490
He clearly was buying things
internationally, but you know,

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:10.770
it was a reasonable
place to start.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:14.970
So, I guess this is
all just a long way

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:16.490
of caveating what
you're seeing here,

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:21.390
but it gives a reasonable
idea, I think.

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:25.400
The other thing I'd just say up
front is while we started to,

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.300
you know, kind of,
play with this question

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:32.100
of what the purchase cost
was, as we got into this,

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.910
I discovered that that really
is not the interesting story,

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:38.310
or the interesting
question that the,

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:40.770
you know, that the data tell.

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.360
And, anyway, the
question of how he paid

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:45.060
for it is unanswerable, largely.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:49.700
So, what I'd like to do is focus
here on the period starting

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:57.200
in 1919, which is right here,
with the end of World War One.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.640
And, as you can see right there,

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.590
that's a pretty clear
demarcation point in the history

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:05.400
of the collection, because
right after World War One,

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.020
this thing just spikes.

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:10.610
You can just look at any
given year from then on,

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:12.770
and the number of
flutes in yellow,

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:14.620
you know, is astronomical.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.710
And, he was also getting
some values, because you look

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:19.620
at the fact that the amount he
was spending versus the number

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.030
of flutes was fairly low.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:25.290
So, he was clearly
getting some bargains.

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:30.790
To me, and this is speculative,
but when I was compiling this,

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:33.690
I thought of the fact that after
World War One, there was a lot

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:36.790
of dislocation, particularly
in Europe.

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:38.840
Germany, Austria, Italy.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.610
All of which were places that
Miller was collecting, you know,

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.960
a fair number of
flutes in that decade.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:49.460
So, he had dealers in Europe
who, kind of, scouted for him.

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:51.840
And, I can only think
that at this point,

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.090
when you see this large
spike in the number of flutes

00:22:55.090 --> 00:23:00.800
that he was managing to take
advantage of the fact that,

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:04.160
you know, a lot of interesting
instruments were coming

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.910
on the market at that point,
that weren't there before.

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:14.460
So, between 1919 and
1929-- let me-- there we go.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.900
And, I apologize, that red line
should actually be one year

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.620
to the left.

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:23.280
So, just before that
high spike--

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.920
you can see that one
data point there.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.610
Should be just to
the left of that.

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:32.560
Anyway, in that decade, from
1919 to 1929, that accounted

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:36.020
for 56% of the flutes
that he collected.

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:42.080
And, 373 of those were
purchased from European sellers.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:46.900
So-- which is about half of
what he bought in that period.

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.420
So, you can see-- that tells
me that there were bargains.

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.990
And, he wasn't just
buying anything.

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:52.580
We know that he was
a very meticulous

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:53.880
and careful collector.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.180
So, that also tells us

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.080
that there were interesting
things coming on the market,

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.580
and that he was managing to,
you know, to be ready to pounce

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.360
when they became available.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:09.720
So, the other key point here, I
think, is the second red line,

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.970
which should be at that 1929.

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:16.830
And that, of course, coincides
with the crash, you know,

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:19.050
the stock market
crash, and the beginning

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:21.000
of the Great Depression.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.100
I find it particularly
interesting that in the year

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.710
after the stock market crash,
he has both the largest amount

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:32.020
of outlays, and the largest
number of flute purchases.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.620
So, similar pattern
here in the sense

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:38.010
that people's fortunes
had shifted.

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:40.740
Probably a lot of things were
being sold of to finance--

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.620
you know, to keep families
afloat and that sort of thing.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.310
And, Miller was able to
capture a lot of the instruments

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:49.170
that came on the
market, you know, that--

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:51.330
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:54.450
Not only did he not lose too
much money, but I also find,

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:56.970
if you look at how much he was
spending even during the Great

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:59.920
Depression, so in
those subsequent years.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.770
I don't think there were many
people who had, you know,

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:07.190
over $10,000 in any given
year to lay out for their,

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:08.720
you know, for their hobbies.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:12.210
So-- and that kind of brings us
back to the original question

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:13.540
of well, how was he
paying for all this

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.290
on a professor's salary?

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:16.690
You know, it's-- his
salary was somewhere

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:21.090
around $3500, something
like that?

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:22.440
Carol? [inaudible] Yes.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.240
So--

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.210
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:29.410
Yes, there are lots
of, you know,

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:31.710
we know there was
family money as well.

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:35.310
And, you know, he made gifts
of stock later to, you know,

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:36.690
colleges that he
was involved in.

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:38.530
So, there was money around.

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:42.510
But-- clearly, there was a lot
of money around in the family.

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:49.460
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:50.760
Was it 38,000?

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.150
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:53.450
&gt;&gt; Paul Runci: Yes.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:55.330
Maybe even slightly
more than that.

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:56.630
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:57.930
&gt;&gt; Paul Runci: Yes.

00:25:57.930 --> 00:25:59.970
Yes, yes. So, still a
significant share of,

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:04.330
you know, of income.

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:07.190
So, and it was clear that,
you know, he was keeping lots

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:08.650
of feelers out at this time.

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:11.510
He had dealers that he worked
with for years in Europe.

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:14.020
You know, you see in
his ledgers, you know,

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:17.330
the same names of dealers
appearing repeatedly.

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:19.170
He had somebody in England.

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:22.690
There's someone in Italy that
he worked with quite frequently.

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:27.990
And so, you know, so he had his,
kind of, network of, you know,

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:31.930
of cells, so to speak.

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:34.870
So, at the end of that
decade, when, you know,

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:38.740
he'd amassed this, you know,
very impressive collection,

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.940
not only in number, but
in quality very quickly.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:45.040
I think it was at that point
that he began to wonder--

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.010
you know, I think he was
probably tripping over these

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:48.800
in his house at that point.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.100
And--

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.400
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.350
Altogether, it's 1423,
something like that?

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:56.780
Fourteen hundred, twenty-six.

00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:01.420
Yes. So, at that point,
he needed to find a home

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:06.160
for the flutes, it was, I think,
overwhelming his expectations

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.100
and the space that
he had available.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.300
So, I'm going to turn it back
over to Carol Lynn to talk

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.920
about how he went about
searching for a home

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.340
for the collection,
a permanent home.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.640
So. Thank you.

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:28.170
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Again, probably as Paul said,

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:29.990
it was probably an ideal era

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:32.540
for collecting flutes
in America at least.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:35.730
There seemed to be availability,
little competition,

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:38.660
perhaps relatively
affordable prices.

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:48.330
In 1920, he purchased 36
flutes; 1921, 57 flutes;

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:52.440
93 flutes in 1922;
131 flutes in 1930,

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:55.420
just in case you couldn't
see that on the graph.

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:59.240
But then we can turn
to his correspondence,

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.520
and we can also see
that he bought items

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.490
with discretion, and patience.

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:07.800
And, he did restrain and
contain his collecting obsession

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.930
to exactly what he
felt told the history

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:11.790
of the development of the flute.

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:15.130
So, by not purchasing
with extravagant abandon,

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:17.950
or an undiscerning eye,
he was clearly able

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:20.700
to keep his obsession and
spending collection growth

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.300
at manageable amounts.

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:27.020
Here is an image from the
1924 issue of the The Flutist.

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:28.690
This is a want ad.

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:32.840
What I find interesting is that
he would send things to Case.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.070
So, I know he kept
them in his apartment,

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:38.840
but they must have all gone
into the Physics department.

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:45.080
This is a ledger entry
for the Flute Number 4

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.280
that I showed you, his
first flute purchase.

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.630
And, it's also over
on the table there,

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:51.610
because it is hard to see.

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:54.270
I can see it, you might
not be able to see it,

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:55.970
because he wrote in pencil.

00:28:55.970 --> 00:29:01.040
But, what Paul was able to--
how he was able to tally this,

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:06.890
is at the bottom of the ledger,
the top part shows, you know,

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:09.760
Miller describing the
instrument, but at the bottom,

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.460
he wrote where he got
it from, the date,

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:15.090
how much he paid,
and in what currency.

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:20.190
This Flute Number 4,
he paid $165 in 1896.

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:24.210
That was a lot of
money back then.

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:27.450
Miller's scientific and musical
worlds often would converge,

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:31.080
as he embarked upon his
second career in collecting

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.830
and documenting flutes and
flute-related materials.

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:37.250
In the June 1923
issue of The Flutist,

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:40.930
Miller describes his young
collection of music, flutes,

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:44.520
books, that it was by far
the largest collection

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.850
on the subject in existence.

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:50.340
Whether this claim was correct--
and I do believe it to be true--

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.650
overall he likely held
one of the largest

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:54.560
and most important collections.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:59.970
He included a note that "it
is the purpose to preserve all

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:03.090
of this material in
systematic form, for the benefit

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:05.590
of flutists of the
present and the future.

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.530
Probably it will placed in one

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:10.350
of the principal
public museums."

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:13.700
By the time of his
donations in 1941,

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.490
his collections totaled
roughly 100,000 items.

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:18.350
I'm actually still counting.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:21.740
But, nearly 1500 flutes
and other wind instruments,

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.210
thousands of works of art
on paper, photographs,

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:27.400
patent specifications, trade
catalogs, newspaper clippings,

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:31.850
autographs, music
books, statues,

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:35.520
and about 15,000 pages
of correspondence.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.590
It is likely that
Miller must have thought

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:39.190
about every purchase carefully,

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:41.440
so that it would directly
illustrate the history

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:45.300
and development of the flute,
as evidenced through examination

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.970
of his preserved
card index files

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:51.970
and ledgers recording the books,
music, and the art purchases,

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:54.670
along with shipping
receipts, notes on his visits,

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:56.880
and his voluminous
correspondence,

00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:00.190
for the most part containing
incoming and outgoing copies,

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:03.230
all solely related to
flute collection purchases

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:04.700
or enquiries.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.590
The archives of his diverse
science careers are still held

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:09.680
at Case Western.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.960
Each flute purchase was
documented in a ledger format,

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.100
like you see here, that
detailed in a consistent

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:20.300
and rather scientific way the
object's physical description.

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.390
Miller also photographed
the collection

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:25.590
on glass plate negatives, and
the positives, to the delight

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:28.810
of subsequent curators
and conservators.

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:30.480
Considering the other aspects

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.680
of his collections also
meticulously recorded

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.590
and retained in his
vast correspondence

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:37.750
in card index files.

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:41.600
Regarding just the books, likely
still the largest collection

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:45.490
of books on flute history and
organology, Miller stated,

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:48.650
"Every work included is
considered by the collector

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:50.650
to be of importance
in the relation

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:52.180
to the history of the flute.

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:55.500
There are many items which
so far as known do not exist

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.660
in any other collection."

00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:02.190
In 1935, with the number of
titles nearing 3,000 books,

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:04.870
he privately printed an
annotated bibliography,

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:07.170
and that is right here.

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:14.880
And, just to give you an
example, in the entries,

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.590
the annotations, he would do
a full bibliographic citation

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:20.460
here, in the annotation,

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:23.860
and often it would say something
like, "As far as can be traced,

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:27.070
this is a unique work not
found in any other library,

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:29.040
not found in the
British Museum."

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:32.270
So, he was very, very
careful, even with the books,

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:37.180
the collection of his
books that he was seeking.

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:39.710
The works of art
collection includes

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:42.520
at least seven separate
collections that range in date

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:45.230
from the late 15th century
to the early 20th century,

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:50.180
and are in many formats
of-- on paper and statuary.

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:52.620
You can see in here,
the little netsukes,

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:55.710
those all depict a
flute or a fife player.

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:59.430
By the time of his 1941 donation
to the Library of Congress,

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:02.920
the printed music collection,
which I think was the earliest.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.470
He probably started
that in 1887,

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:08.330
since he was a young flutist.

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:11.680
And, the cost analysis has
yet to be done by Paul.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.480
I did it roughly.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:16.530
Over the course of 40
years in 2015 dollars,

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:20.650
I calculated $1,831,495.

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:24.360
And, yes, he must have
been slightly obsessed.

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:28.770
Miller's correspondence between
1894 and 1941 revealed him

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:30.070
to be quite knowledgeable

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:33.130
and polite while negotiating
either reference questions

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:34.980
or acquisitions.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:37.660
The letters also reveal
much about his systematic

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:40.660
and methodical acquisition
style.

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:43.120
Most notably, for
example, as Miller sought

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.540
to represent the history of
the development of the flute,

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:48.740
was careful not to
duplicate acquisitions.

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.860
His purchases of 18
flutes of glass or crystal

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:56.060
by Claude Laurent, surely
his most indulgent pursuits,

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:57.710
were clearly a scientific
survey,

00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:00.410
as he carefully rejected flutes
that might duplicate years

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:03.170
of manufacture, or
number of keys.

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:05.650
Miller was also keenly
aware of his purchases,

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:08.180
such as with his extensive
collection of Native North

00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:12.160
and South American flutes, for
he halted buying from one dealer

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:14.090
when he realized the
dealer was trying

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:16.370
to sell him manufactured
duplicates,

00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:19.130
as if Miller was
a casual tourist.

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:22.690
There are 139 examples from
North and South America.

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:24.530
Three are in this case here.

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:25.830
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:27.130
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:30.010
I don't think so,
but he might have.

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:31.310
I don't know.

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:33.790
He didn't leave that
in his correspondence.

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:36.770
I think he played the modern
flutes, and these, but--

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:40.580
I do want to read you a quick
little excerpt regarding the

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:45.170
Native American flutes that
he wrote to a dealer in 1926.

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:47.990
He said, "I am personally
acquainted with the officers

00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:50.860
of the Department of Ethnology
in Washington, and with those

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:53.890
in charge of the Indian Affairs
with the Canadian government.

00:34:53.890 --> 00:34:55.190
And, I have had dealings

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:58.290
with over 30 houses
specializing in Indian relics.

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:00.040
These specimens which you sent,

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.490
there's very much
sameness in them."

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:03.790
Couple months later.

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:06.100
"It does seem to me
there's a strange similarity

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:09.670
in the general character of
these various Sioux flutes.

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:10.970
They are very new.

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:13.100
Apparently they have
not been used at all,

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:16.490
and the general arrangement,
and even the shape is repeated.

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:19.980
I am just wondering where
these instruments came from."

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:21.470
Couple months later.

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:23.280
"I am sorry to say
I am disappointed

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.990
with the Indian flutes
you're sending me.

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:26.480
They seem to be new instruments

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:30.040
which have been manufactured
as curios."

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:32.070
Then he wrote, "One
might be suspicious

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:36.160
that they were being made
especially to sell to me."

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:39.230
But then, a few years
later, he was still buying

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:40.530
from this collect-- this--

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.830
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:43.130
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Pardon?

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:44.430
Yes, he did return them.

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:45.730
There should be receipts
to show that.

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:48.830
But then, he wrote to this
dealer a few years later.

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:51.940
Apparently the dealer went
from selling him flutes,

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:54.920
the courting flutes that you
see up there, to whistles.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.250
There are a lot of
whistles in the collection.

00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:58.810
This letter was kind
of funny, though.

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:03.670
Miller wrote-- so the dealer
must have been sending him

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:07.350
whistles, and Miller wrote back,
"I would like to mention again

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:10.820
that I am about" quote
"fed up on whistles."

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:15.070
So, that was the end of
the whistle collection.

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:17.740
Miller maintained correspondence
with dealers, donors,

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:21.030
flute aficionados, and
makers often for many years.

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:24.050
Dealers around the world knew
him well, and would send a list

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:28.190
of available items such as
books, music, prints of flutes.

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:30.340
Invariably, Miller would
also send out a list

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:32.280
of what he was looking
for, particularly,

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.690
like with the Frederick
the Great flute.

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:37.020
He was desperately
looking for that flute.

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:40.130
Most purchases were single
items, although a few times,

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:43.580
he bought numerous
items, or lots,

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:45.930
the lots at auction,
a lot of things.

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:48.000
He noted about these
lot purchases,

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.810
he did not like that it meant a
collection was being dispersed

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:54.270
or broken apart.

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:56.740
Much of the correspondence
reveals details rich

00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:58.340
in the provenance
of the objects,

00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:00.290
and also the time it took

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:03.040
to cultivate the
buyer-seller relationship.

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.850
He waited years for some
flutes, either because he waited

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:09.610
for the price to be fair, or
because some owners took time

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:14.180
in the sale, due to a reluctance
to sell or part with the flute.

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:16.490
The sale of a flute made
for President Madison

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:19.870
in 1813 took five years of
back and forth with the owners,

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:23.960
a set of siblings, until
Miller finally persuaded them

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:26.970
with the incentive that the
flute would again be on display

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:30.480
in a public museum,
hopefully the National Museum,

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.890
where it had been in 1903,
and where Miller intended

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:36.050
to donate his flute collection.

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:40.230
The mission of the
Library of Congress,

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:43.030
the nation's first established
cultural institution,

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:45.730
and the largest library in the
world, is to provide Congress,

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:48.630
the federal government, and the
American people with a diverse

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:51.340
and enduring source of
knowledge, to inform,

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:53.440
inspire, and engage them.

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:56.920
In 1815, Congress purchased
Thomas Jefferson's library,

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.130
a rich collection
universal in scope,

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:01.130
knowledge, and creativity.

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:05.400
Jefferson, a keen admirer of
music was also a violinist.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.860
His library collection
held 13 books of music,

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:11.230
on music literature and theory,
thus laying the foundation

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:13.880
for the future Music Division.

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:16.850
By 1896, the Music
Division was established,

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:21.850
and during the years 1924 to
1935, aided by the philanthropy

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:25.050
of two remarkable women,
Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:26.910
and Gertrude Clark Whittall.

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:29.030
The mission of the Music
Division included musical

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:31.500
performances and
music commissions.

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:34.350
The Music Division quickly
became an international center

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:37.210
for the performance and
study of chamber music,

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:39.800
and seemed a viable
institution to establish

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.760
and maintain collections
of musical instruments.

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:46.700
Sparked by the 1935 gift of
five Stradivari instruments

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:49.890
from Mrs. Whittall, the Music
Division has been enriched

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:52.680
by subsequent gifts of
musical instruments.

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:56.190
During the 1920s,
Miller began the search

00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:58.480
for a permanent home
for his collections.

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.930
Throughout his correspondence
during these years,

00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:03.900
he spoke of the collection
heading to the National Museum,

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:06.150
now the Smithsonian Institution,

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:08.550
where he heard they might
establish a department

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:09.850
of fine arts.

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:11.700
And, where they discussed
with him a new building

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.860
to house the collection.

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:16.870
Interestingly, the vision for
these plans were likely modeled

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:20.280
at the 1893 Columbian
exposition in Chicago

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:23.530
to which Dayton Miller
traveled during his honeymoon.

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:26.680
The plan, akin to the White
City design of Daniel Burnham,

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:29.620
was marked by precision
and geometry.

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:32.700
A commission of fine arts
in DC was later established,

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:35.820
and plans were made for a
Smithsonian gallery of art,

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:38.890
but the plans as Miller
understood them to be,

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:40.950
were never carried out.

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:45.190
In 1924, Miller heard from
Charles Greeley Abbot,

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:47.290
assistant secretary
at the Smithsonian,

00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:49.500
that he was glad his
collection would become a part

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:50.930
of the museum.

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:56.090
Between 1924 and 1927, Miller
also wrote to Frances Densmore,

00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:58.930
a member of the museum
staff and an ethnologist,

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:01.410
about the proposed new
fine arts building,

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:04.450
having his flute collection
at the museum, and the hope

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:06.240
that she would be in
charge of his collection.

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:11.330
But, by 1928, he became
anxious, writing to her,

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:15.470
"The collection is now too
large for a private house.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:18.320
I do not see much prospect
of completing arrangements

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:21.950
with the Smithsonian until
a new museum is erected."

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:24.360
Eleven days later he
wrote to her again.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:27.780
"If I present the instruments
to a museum without any cost,

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:31.450
I feel they ought at least to
be assured fine exhibition.

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:33.540
The Library of Congress
has been very interested

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:36.250
in this collection, and
they have definitely stated

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:38.890
that they would be glad to
receive all the collection,

00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:41.810
and would provide
exhibition cases."

00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:45.500
Clearly, Miller was seeking a
public museum or institution

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:46.800
for the final home,

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:50.500
and he wanted his collections
together, in one location.

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:53.330
While loyal to his home
state and its institutions,

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:55.720
it is not clear in
his correspondence

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:58.430
that the Cleveland Museum
of Art, or Oberlin were

00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:01.210
under consideration
to house the flutes.

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:03.360
He was very much impressed
with the German Museum

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.930
of Masterpieces, a museum,

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:08.150
but found it lacked a
great collection of music

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:10.200
to supplement the instruments.

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.800
He thought most highly of
the Metropolitan Museum

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:17.670
of New York-- of Art in New
York, but as stated in his will,

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:19.670
he did not want the
collection to go there

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:21.820
for the following reason.

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:24.790
"I specifically object to
the system of classification

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:28.030
of musical instruments, as it
has been heretofore exhibited

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:31.540
in the Metropolitan Museum
of Art in New York City."

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:34.920
In 1933, Miller wrote to
Carleton Sprague Smith

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.220
at the New York Public Library,

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:38.420
an institution very
much interested

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:40.840
in housing his flute collection.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:43.980
He told Doctor Smith that he
had catalogs of 50 museums

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:47.310
of musical instruments, and
had visited most of them,

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:49.140
as well as many of
the music libraries

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:51.650
in the United States and abroad.

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:54.240
Perhaps Miller and Smith,
who was also a flutist,

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:57.770
held a similar philosophy,
one Miller eventually found

00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:59.680
at the Library of Congress.

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.950
They discussed a
hypothetical music museum,

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:04.970
a unique educational center.

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:08.630
The mission of this music museum
would require an amalgamation

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:12.700
or union of books, instruments,
iconography and sound.

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:15.460
It would appeal to the lay
person, the researcher,

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:17.550
the student, the scholar.

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:19.640
Interesting, I later
found a letter

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.470
from Carleton Sprague
Smith in 1957,

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:25.360
where he did write a proposal
to New York Public Library

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:29.450
to create this library museum
of the performing arts.

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:32.640
In 1931, Miller wrote
to Carl Engel,

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.420
chief of the Music Division
at the Library of Congress,

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:37.900
that the Music Division was
thorough in covering the field

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:41.590
of music, and he felt proud it
was the nation's top library,

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:43.610
complete with concerts.

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:46.990
In 1934, Librarian of
Congress Herbert Putnam

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:49.020
and Carl Engel requested
a catalog

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:50.800
of his book collection,
the one I showed you.

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:54.930
And, for this, he did
prepare that just for them.

00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:57.530
Also in February of that
year, Miller wrote again

00:42:57.530 --> 00:43:01.230
to Frances Densmore, fearing
the collection was so large,

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:03.630
that quote "I have
no place to keep it.

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:05.610
I am seriously beginning
to worry

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:07.340
as to what will become of it.

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:09.390
I fear it will be
destroyed or dispersed,

00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:10.920
and nothing at all will come

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:12.480
of all the trouble
I have put into it."

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:17.630
Around 1934-1935, he reached
his decision, and his will

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:22.230
of 1939 stated that the entire
collection would be given

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:23.950
to the Library of Congress.

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:27.590
It further stipulated that his
collections would be preserved

00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:30.740
intact as a whole
and not subdivided,

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:35.790
so as to illustrate directly
the history of the flute.

00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:39.140
In 1939, Miller wrote to
the Scottish organologist,

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:40.440
Lindsay Langwell
[assumed spelling],

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:44.960
saying "In the year 1938,
38 specimens were added,

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.790
most of these unimportant."

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:49.960
It seemed as if Miller
had exhausted his energy,

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.260
time, and resources.

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:53.980
And, the collection felt
saturated, and the urge

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:55.910
to collect was slowing down.

00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:58.680
This engaged collector
with seemingly no end

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:01.230
to his collecting
energy until this point,

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:03.400
had acquired deep knowledge
about his collection,

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:06.760
and a deep desire to
share his collection.

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:09.700
Perhaps his collection was the
biggest source of his pride,

00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:12.030
at least equivalent to
the quantifiable honors

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:15.050
and decorations of
his scientific life.

00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:18.900
He must have wondered, what
is the legacy of a collector?

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:20.760
What is the legacy
of any collection

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:22.060
of musical instruments?

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:25.010
And, how will it
outlive the collector?

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:28.250
But, in 1941, Miller
still had more plans,

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:30.230
new energy apparently.

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:33.690
He had commenced research on
a definitive book on the flute

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:37.040
through history, starting
with those pan pipes.

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.470
He intended to move with his
collection to the Library

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:43.220
of Congress, and he was to
become its honorary curator.

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:46.700
But, he died suddenly
of myocardial infarction

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:52.290
at his Cleveland home at
age 74, in February of 1941.

00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:53.590
And, his collection of flutes

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:56.410
and flute-related materials
arrived at the Library

00:44:56.410 --> 00:44:59.010
of Congress in May of 1941.

00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:01.950
He was packing up the collection
when he had the heart attack.

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:05.420
But, ultimately,
through his collections,

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:08.960
Dayton C. Miller attained his
dream of educating the public,

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.550
and collecting, documenting,

00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:12.950
and preserving cultural
heritage for all.

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:15.540
And, his collection
has stayed together.

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:17.340
Thank you.

00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:26.450
[ Applause ]

00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:28.980
If there are any questions,
anything I haven't answered--

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:30.280
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:33.320
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
The Met?

00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:37.050
They were exhibiting
in a classified way.

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:43.940
He wanted-- he didn't want
a classification system.

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:46.470
He objected to classifying
flutes.

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:51.960
So that that would mean that
mankind was divided by race.

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:53.260
And, he did not want that.

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:56.530
And, you can see in this case,
there are flutes from all over,

00:45:56.530 --> 00:46:00.060
and there are more
flutes back there.

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:04.470
And, that's what
they did back then.

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:05.770
&gt;&gt; Two quick questions.

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:08.570
The first flute that you
showed, was that made of wood?

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:10.000
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
The fife that he banged around?

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.300
&gt;&gt; No. The dark one.

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:12.600
Number 4, I think you called it.

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:13.900
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Number 4?

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:15.200
Actually that's ebonite.

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.500
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:17.800
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
And, that's a hard rubber.

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.100
And, what's really
interesting about that flute,

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:20.400
for all the money that
he spent, he went home

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:24.390
and actually built
a foot joint for it.

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:26.150
So, he actually went home,

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:29.870
and out of hard rubber
made this foot joint.

00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:32.660
So, he could have more
tonal range in it.

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:33.960
But.

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:35.260
&gt;&gt; Second question.

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:37.000
The gold flute of a single--

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.300
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Single tube, yes.

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:40.290
&gt;&gt; How is it tunable?

00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:41.590
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
One piece.

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:42.890
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:44.190
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Tunes to 435.

00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:45.490
So, you tune to him.

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:46.790
&gt;&gt; Four thirty-five.

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:48.090
Thank you.

00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:49.480
&gt;&gt; How much does it weigh?

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:50.780
[inaudible]

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:52.080
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
You know,

00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.380
that's a really good question.

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:54.680
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:55.980
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
It's practice.

00:46:55.980 --> 00:47:00.570
But, you know, he has a ledger
of all the hours that he took

00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:03.010
to make that flute, so, I
think the weight's in there.

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:04.310
Because I was just
looking through it.

00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:05.970
I mean, he weighed all
the alloys and everything

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:08.860
that he put in there, so we
could probably tally that up.

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:12.040
As an aside, yesterday as I
was putting things together,

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:13.950
I found that unpublished
manuscript

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:15.250
on the history of the flute.

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:17.130
So, guess what my next
project's going to be?

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:20.600
I'm going to be typing
that for him.

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:21.900
Yes?

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:23.200
&gt;&gt; Question.

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.080
The Frederick the Great's
flute that used to be--

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.380
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Right.

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:27.680
&gt;&gt; -- displayed years
ago in the hallway.

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:28.980
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Right.

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:30.280
&gt;&gt; Is that playable?

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.580
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford: You
know, it's made out of ebony.

00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:35.350
And so, that if we were to play
it today with the knowledge

00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:38.040
that we have, would
cause it to crack.

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:39.520
So, we keep it in very stable--

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:40.820
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:42.120
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Pardon?

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:43.420
&gt;&gt; I thought it was
made of crystal.

00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:44.720
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford: No,

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:47.870
Frederick the Great's is a
wood flute, made in about 1730.

00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:50.380
The crystal flute was
President Madison's.

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:51.880
&gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, OK.

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:53.570
I haven't seen it in decades.

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:57.850
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
We can show it to you.

00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:01.090
&gt;&gt; Used to be right outside
the Coolidge Auditorium.

00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:02.390
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford: Yes.

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:03.690
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:04.990
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
I wish I had seen it then.

00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:06.290
But--

00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:07.590
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:08.890
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford: It's
in a very secured temperature

00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:10.570
and humidity to preserve
it, to help--

00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:12.200
&gt;&gt; Is that why they're here now?

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:14.000
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Exactly.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.550
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:17.910
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
The Frederick the Great flute?

00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:19.210
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:20.510
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
The crystal one.

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:22.040
Well, that's an interesting
question.

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:25.860
It is playable, although I
wouldn't recommend doing that.

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:29.180
If you want to hear it
though, there's one on YouTube.

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:31.780
The museum in Barcelona
has a flutist who plays

00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:35.090
on their collection flute,
and you can hear the sound.

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:40.510
It's very soft and pretty.

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:42.770
Yes? Oh, sorry.

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:44.750
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to
comment that we're lucky

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:48.750
that he was a scientist and
a flute player, because all--

00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:51.400
I don't know if I'd
call it an obsession,

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:54.470
his style of documenting
things, because I know a lot

00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:59.600
of scientist friends who are
just obsessed in the labs

00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:02.820
of documenting, recording,
and noting everything.

00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:05.740
So, we're fortunate
that he actually had

00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:08.960
that science gift
that actually trans--

00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:10.260
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:11.830
I think that's exactly
what it was.

00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:15.510
The scientific methodical style.

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:17.910
You should come over
to this table,

00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:19.910
and look at how he
tracked everything.

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:21.210
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:22.510
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Even his book sales.

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:23.810
A second edition
translated book.

00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:26.430
I mean, you know, how
much the stamps cost.

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:27.810
How much he got for
it, you know?

00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:30.020
&gt;&gt; And, I see in my friend
who does that for Johnson

00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:33.330
and Johnson in the same research
stuff that he does, you know,

00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:35.550
for drug manufacturing.

00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:36.880
It's all scientific.

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:38.180
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Right.

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:39.480
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:40.780
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford: So,

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:44.820
I think it totally informed
his ability to collect.

00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:50.050
&gt;&gt; Yes. Which is great.

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:51.350
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford: Yes?

00:49:51.350 --> 00:49:54.810
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] You didn't
really say very much about--

00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:56.860
you talked a lot about
his professional career,

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:59.210
and his career as a
collector and a flutist,

00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:03.430
but not about his
character as a person.

00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:09.300
And, one thing that I think
one might be able to read

00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:15.430
out of your graph,
is that in the wake

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:18.900
of the stock market
crash, and the Depression,

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:21.560
he's actually paying
more per flute.

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:24.130
He's not bottom-feeding.

00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:29.980
He's not taking advantage
of his fellow man who's--

00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:32.390
I mean, maybe I'm reading
to much into this--

00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:36.080
but his fellow man who's
sort of selling items

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:38.460
of great value out
of desperation.

00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:39.760
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
But, I did say that.

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:43.120
That the correspondence
reveals him to be polite.

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:46.890
And, that he waited
until a fair price.

00:50:46.890 --> 00:50:49.170
So, if a dealer said
to him, here's a flute.

00:50:49.170 --> 00:50:50.890
I want $100 for it.

00:50:50.890 --> 00:50:53.210
He would say no, I
think it's worth 80.

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:54.510
And, he would wait.

00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:57.450
Or, likewise, he-- if
someone said here's a flute,

00:50:57.450 --> 00:51:00.080
I only want $2 for it, and
Miller felt it was worth more,

00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:02.030
he would give them
the fair price.

00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:04.060
And, everything that I've read

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:06.410
about Miller was
exactly what I said.

00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:09.750
That they felt he
was very polite.

00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:12.100
And, just very reserved.

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:15.620
I mean, he didn't exuberate, you
know, the collector, whatever.

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:17.640
And, he didn't purchase
luxury things.

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:20.120
I think he was just very calm,

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:22.550
and plodded through
this very carefully.

00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:24.920
But, when I went
to Case Western,

00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:27.510
they said he was just crazy.

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:31.180
And, I was really
upset, because I was used

00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:32.480
to hearing the flute side.

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:36.110
But they, you know-- he had
huge battles with Einstein

00:51:36.110 --> 00:51:39.220
over the ether drift theory,
and theory of relativity.

00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:42.600
And, that's where his passion,
I think, and his argument went.

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:44.430
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:50.780
&gt;&gt; Paul Runci: It's
an interesting point

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:52.080
that you raised there.

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:55.980
And, the one-- you jogged my
memory of one thing I meant

00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:59.440
to mention, just about the year
1930, which was where you saw

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:02.740
that really, kind
of, noteworthy spike.

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:05.870
So, that one year accounts
for 9% of the collection.

00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:09.730
So, in one year he
collected 9% of the flutes.

00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:14.110
And, there is, both the
purchase price and the number

00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:15.700
of flutes kind of
converge there.

00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:17.540
That's another thing
that's noteworthy.

00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:18.950
But, it's an interesting
question.

00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:22.350
At least, I don't know--
I'd have to go back and look

00:52:22.350 --> 00:52:26.330
at the ledgers to see exactly
what flutes he purchased

00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:27.630
that year.

00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:30.170
It certainly looks like
what you're saying is true,

00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:33.880
that you know, he wasn't just
out to shake people down,

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:36.750
and you know, take
Grandma's pearls.

00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:38.050
But--

00:52:38.050 --> 00:52:39.350
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Not at all.

00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:41.290
And then, don't forget
I stated--

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:42.590
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:43.890
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Right?

00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:45.190
Absolutely.

00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:46.490
&gt;&gt; Paul Runci: But, it would
be interesting to look and see

00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:48.730
which flutes actually were
added to the collection.

00:52:48.730 --> 00:52:50.030
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Well,

00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:51.330
the Frederick the
Great's flute was, 1930.

00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:52.630
That was a big purchase.

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:53.930
&gt;&gt; Paul Runci: Oh.

00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:55.230
OK.

00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:56.530
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
But, you know, don't forget,

00:52:56.530 --> 00:52:57.830
I stated in the beginning,
his mother

00:52:57.830 --> 00:52:59.130
and father died in
1918 and 1919.

00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:04.070
So, we're assuming he might have
inherited something from them.

00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:06.240
Because he made it very
clear, quite a few times,

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:09.000
he only bought flutes
from the products

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.020
of his scientific
studies and work.

00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:14.870
So-- but I think he
made a lot of money

00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:17.170
on the lecture circuit
with the x-rays.

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:20.670
There's a tiny little newspaper
article there showing Dayton C.

00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:21.970
Miller and the x-rays
or something.

00:53:21.970 --> 00:53:23.270
But, that was a big thing.

00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:24.920
People were, like,
amazed at this.

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:28.220
And, he went all over the
world talking about x-rays.

00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:29.520
Yes?

00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:30.820
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:32.120
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford: Oh!

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:39.820
Awesome. He was there
for 45 years.

00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:43.800
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] working
on a biography, so--

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.100
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Doctor Fickinger.

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:46.590
He wrote it a couple
of years ago.

00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:50.910
And, it's only the
science side of his life.

00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:54.500
And, I did go out there
and meet Doctor Fickinger.

00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:57.750
And, we talk from time to time.

00:53:57.750 --> 00:54:01.420
And, it's a huge archive
out there of his work.

00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:03.640
&gt;&gt; His reputation
was [inaudible].

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:09.580
He was quite a physicist
in his day.

00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:10.880
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Right.

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:12.180
And, that--

00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:13.480
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:14.780
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford: And,

00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:16.080
what Doctor Fickinger told me
was, you know, Miller walked

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:17.380
in the door at Case Western,
and said can I have a job?

00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:18.970
And, you could hear from
his biography early on,

00:54:18.970 --> 00:54:20.530
they just gave it to him.

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:23.580
And, he did this
self-education too, of--

00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:25.430
so, it's very different.

00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:26.730
But.

00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:28.240
&gt;&gt; At the beginning,
you mentioned something

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:31.540
about he had measured
different materials for flutes.

00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:34.100
And, I don't remember
what material was the one

00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:35.800
that had the most
overtones, or--

00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:37.100
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
The gold.

00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:38.400
The gold did.

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:39.910
And, that's why he went crazy.

00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:42.300
Then he just had to
make a gold flute.

00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:45.720
And, as a flutist myself,
I always remember growing

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:47.950
up with my silver
flutes, you know,

00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:49.340
you have to get a gold flute.

00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:50.840
It's the one that
sounds the best.

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:52.140
And, that's where
this came from.

00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:54.740
He did this study,
and he decided

00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:57.860
that the overtones caused
the greater tone production.

00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:02.140
&gt;&gt; My other question is, since
he was an acoustician also,

00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:05.730
did he contribute anything to
the development of the flute,

00:55:05.730 --> 00:55:08.240
or its tuning, or
things like that?

00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:09.850
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
No, although the flute he made,

00:55:09.850 --> 00:55:12.100
the gold one there, he did work

00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:15.470
on different tunings
and things like that.

00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:18.140
He was most of all known,
though, for, you know,

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:19.710
auditorium design
as I mentioned.

00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:22.800
But, also he took that, and
the government hired him.

00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:25.540
He had to take a year off, and
he even mentioned that, to--

00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:28.460
the government had
him study bullets,

00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:33.510
and the shock sound
from bullets.

00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:36.910
So, he could have probably
had a very huge career

00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:40.390
as an acoustician, had
he not been distracted

00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:42.750
with flutes and Einstein.

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.320
&gt;&gt; What did he think
of the platinum flute?

00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:47.620
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
He tried to make one.

00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:53.620
But then the war in the
early 1917, 1920 time period.

00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:58.380
He actually bought tubes of
platinum to start to make one.

00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:00.540
And, he never commenced that.

00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:04.040
Because he actually stopped
making flutes at that point too.

00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:06.400
But, if anyone has a
platinum flute that they would

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:07.700
like to donate to
the collection,

00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:09.290
we don't have one, still.

00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:10.590
Yes?

00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:15.750
&gt;&gt; I think that most people
that collect seriously realize

00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:19.050
after a time, no matter
how much time you have,

00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:21.850
how much money you have, your
collection is never going

00:56:21.850 --> 00:56:25.200
to be really what you
envisioned it to be.

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:29.540
Is there anything from anything
you've read, Mr. Miller wrote,

00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:31.120
had that same feeling?

00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:32.730
Oh, I wish I had done this.

00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:35.680
I really wish I could have
added this to my collection?

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:39.570
In other words, did he see
any faults in his collection?

00:56:39.570 --> 00:56:41.670
And, if he didn't,
as you look back,

00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:46.090
the whole collection today,
objectively [inaudible] yes,

00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:49.340
he could have been doing
this, but he didn't.

00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:50.770
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
That's a great question.

00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:52.790
I think it goes to
the platinum flute.

00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:54.370
That was a great question,
too, David [assumed spelling].

00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:58.610
I think that would have been
the culminating material

00:56:58.610 --> 00:57:00.250
in his acoustic studies.

00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:03.400
You know, what is the sound
of platinum, because right

00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:05.630
at that time, the early
20th century, you know,

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:08.460
we have Varese composing
a piece, Density 21.5,

00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:11.520
for platinum flute,
and that took off.

00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:13.370
And, it's still pretty popular.

00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:15.750
So, we don't have that material.

00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:17.050
And, he didn't have
that material.

00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:18.350
And, I'm always kind
of curious, like,

00:57:18.350 --> 00:57:20.710
why didn't he just go buy
a platinum flute, you know?

00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:22.160
He could have bought one.

00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:24.610
There was a particularly famous
flutist, Georges Barrere,

00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:25.910
who was playing on
platinum flutes.

00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:31.570
So, that I think, but I never
saw him express that lack.

00:57:31.570 --> 00:57:36.080
I really feel like he felt
like I'm done collecting.

00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:37.510
I am tired.

00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:40.390
My collection's saturated, and
I want to go to the Library

00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:43.090
of Congress and be
that honorary curator.

00:57:43.090 --> 00:57:46.820
And, I feel like he
was on that chapter.

00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:48.120
&gt;&gt; We're out of time.

00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:51.740
So we can maybe thank Carol Lynn
and Paul for their talk today.

00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:54.870
And, you can also check out
materials at the side table.

00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:56.170
Thank you so much.

00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:57.970
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Thank you.

00:57:57.970 --> 00:58:02.970
