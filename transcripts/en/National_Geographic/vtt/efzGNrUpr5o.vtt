00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.200
I have, you know,
been in the back seat

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.100
of an F-15 on a combat mission.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.800
I've been in the
streets of Baghdad.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.834
I've been a moderator
at presidential debates.

00:00:10.834 --> 00:00:13.567
There is nothing that has been
more meaningful in my career

00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:14.900
than this.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.734
When I first met all these
soldiers, and then later

00:00:18.734 --> 00:00:22.533
their spouses, and sat them
down for interviews-- and I'd

00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:23.333
heard the story.

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.232
I was not in the battle.

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:28.433
And the reporters were all so
caught up in covering policy,

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:30.700
or covering where
were the WMDs, where

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.734
was this, that we'd forgotten
there was a war going on.

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:39.100
We were so busy covering the
effects of going into war,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.500
when I heard those
stories about this battle,

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.266
I said, we have to do it.

00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:48.266
Americans have become used
to hearing about casualties.

00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:53.934
They've become used to mass
casualties with our military.

00:00:53.934 --> 00:00:56.065
But this was one of the
first times this had

00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.734
happened to us as Americans.

00:00:57.734 --> 00:01:00.967
If you-- you have to think
back what that was like.

00:01:00.967 --> 00:01:04.934
These soldiers had no clue they
were going to end up in combat.

00:01:04.934 --> 00:01:06.333
No clue at all.

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:07.867
They were fathers, husbands.

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:11.867
Their wives-- that
emotional goodbye.

00:01:11.867 --> 00:01:15.066
They thought they were going
to keep the peace over there.

00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:18.100
If they had really
known what would happen,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.300
that would have been a much,
much, more difficult scene.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.166
I think I was also surprised
because even though all

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:28.767
the actors talk about finding
the essence of the character--

00:01:28.767 --> 00:01:30.232
they don't want
to be exactly what

00:01:30.233 --> 00:01:32.133
the real people were like--

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:35.265
I was surprised
how close they came

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:39.567
to those characters and
the soldiers and the wives

00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:40.699
that I know.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.934
They really did capture
who those people are.

00:01:43.934 --> 00:01:48.000
You cannot look at them recreate
those scenes and recreate those

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.900
characters and not
think of the real

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.166
soldiers and the real families
and what they went through.

00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:57.800
