Hi, my name is Ikai Lan.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.160
Welcome to another edition
of YouTube Developers Live.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.684
Right now, today I'll be
showing you guys some tricks

00:00:15.684 --> 00:00:17.725
that I have when I'm
working with the Player API,

00:00:17.725 --> 00:00:20.100
and I've been trying to
either debug some issues

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.960
or share some code with
some people on my team.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.847
So let's go ahead and
switch over to my laptop.

00:00:25.847 --> 00:00:27.680
Those of you that have
been using Player API

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.060
are probably used to seeing
this reference by now.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.890
This is what I always go to.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.570
This and the JavaScript API,
these are reference docs

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.220
that I'm commonly using when
I'm working with the Player API.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.840
I'm also frequently using
the YouTube player demo,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.746
because this lets me see all the
different options that I have.

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:50.060
But what this
doesn't do very well

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.560
is allow me to
share these options

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.077
and to share customizations as
well as edit them in real time.

00:00:57.077 --> 00:00:58.660
Now, those of you
that have been doing

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.690
web development for a while
know that in Chrome, Firefox

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.840
you can click Inspect Element.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.530
And you have the entire DOM
tree available in these tools.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.760
You can also access everything
via the JavaScript console.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.520
And this is really nice,
because you can run and test

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.030
JavaScript.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.130
Oops, that's invalid
JavaScript code.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.899
And it's a REPL that you
can use to test your code

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:23.690
and make sure things
are working correctly.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.090
Now, I'm going to take
it one step further

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.150
and talk about some of the
tools that we use on the team

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.600
that we think are pretty cool.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.960
And these are online
JavaScript IDEs.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.170
A few of us-- Jeff and I,
in particular-- we really

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.360
like using a tool
called jsFiddle.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.310
Now, jsFiddle, this
is a really cool tool

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.160
that lets you specify HTML as
well as JavaScript to go ahead

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.860
and test and run your code.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.640
So this, we've got a very
basic Flash Player here.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.910
And you'll see that in this code
I've created a link element.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.100
I'm using jQuery.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.140
And you can load jQuery
over, as on the side

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.263
you could say, well, which
JavaScript library do

00:02:00.263 --> 00:02:01.870
I want to auto load?

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.730
I'm saying that once we click,
I want to start the video,

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.747
so I'm going to click
the Test Me link.

00:02:06.747 --> 00:02:08.080
And it starts playing the video.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.300
And that's really cool.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.780
Now, I can't stop
this, unfortunately.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.780
So what I'm going
to do now is I'm

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.150
going to go ahead and-- let
me turn the volume down.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.880
I'm going to go ahead
and click Update

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.970
once I've made
changes to my code.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.460
And now I have a
link that I can copy.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.800
I can right-click, copy, and I
can email this to my coworkers

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.400
or other friends who can just
open that code up and start

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.360
testing it.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.480
And every time you make
a change in this code,

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.420
you can click Update.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.820
Now, this isn't meant to be
a tutorial about jsFiddle.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.280
This is meant to show you some
of the cool tools and tricks

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.990
that we use.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.770
So you can go ahead and search
for a tutorial on jsFiddle

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.340
on your favorite video site.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.657
That is, of course, YouTube.

00:02:50.657 --> 00:02:52.740
When I was looking, I found
several good tutorials

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.370
on jsFiddle.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.880
That's the basics of it.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.430
You can also do things like tidy
up the code, run a JSLinter.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.930
And there's just a lot of
different options that you have

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.346
when you're working
with jsFiddle.

00:03:04.346 --> 00:03:07.870
And of course, everything also
works with the basic console.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.990
If I were to inspect Element
and go to the Console,

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.410
I could have this function
do a console at log.

00:03:16.034 --> 00:03:17.450
I would click Run,
and that's what

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.960
it would do to update
the HTML in JavaScript.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.579
Click Run, and you
would see that it's

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:23.870
logged into JavaScript Console.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.054
So make use of all tools
that are available.

00:03:26.054 --> 00:03:27.720
Now I'm going to
switch over real quick.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.100
That was the Flash player.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.010
I'm going to show you
the IFrame player.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.620
This IFrame player
looks very similar.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.590
This is-- I basically ported
most of this code that's

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.820
on the IFrame API
reference over.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.470
So when I take a look at this
code, it's pretty verbose.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.260
So I've taken the headers.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.510
I've loaded the script source.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.650
Now, the IFrame player reference
loads this asynchronously.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.680
I'm just forcing it
to load synchronously.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.930
I'm creating a div.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.900
And I'm just creating
a test element here.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.700
I'm going to click Test Me.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.260
And that'll start playing the
video, and that's really good.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.390
That's really cool.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.630
So over here, again,
because I load the source,

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.240
I can load on YouTube
IFrame API Ready.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.110
And because I've
also loaded jQuery,

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.950
I can just start using
jQuery's functions

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.320
to make my life easier.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.329
So once I'm done with this code,
if I'm able to reproduce a bug

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.477
here, it's-- especially, if
we're following bugs against

00:04:21.477 --> 00:04:22.560
our public issues tracker.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.059
And if you don't know where
that is, it's at YouTube-- oops.

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:28.080
You search for
YouTube API issues,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.980
it's this link, gdata-issues.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.940
Kind of an old name
for an issues tracker.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.244
But we still use this.

00:04:35.244 --> 00:04:35.910
We look at this.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.310
And this is a good way
for you to file bugs

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.987
and to file what you expect
and what you observe.

00:04:40.987 --> 00:04:43.320
And those are the bug reports
that help us out the most.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.930
So that was all I had
to show you today.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.550
I just wanted to show
you that it was possible.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.470
And if one of the questions we
usually get is, are we hiring?

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.260
The answer is yes.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.489
Check us out at
developers.google.com/jobs.

00:04:56.489 --> 00:04:58.030
That's all I have
for you guys today.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.650
And thank you for
tuning in today.
