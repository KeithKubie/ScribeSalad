00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.210
This lesson is about distributed memory
algorithms for multiplying matrices.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.480
Matrix multiply appears in lots
of applications, from simulations

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.292
in quantum computational chemistry,
to backpropagation in neural networks.

00:00:12.292 --> 00:00:16.420
And when the HPC community ranks
the worlds supercomputers for

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.260
its top 500 list, it does so
using a benchmark that, to first order,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.390
is basically a really
big matrix multiply.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.760
Now that's not the only
reason to study it.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.520
The other one is that it's not so hard
to analyze and that makes it a great

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.540
starting point for practicing
some basic analysis techniques.
