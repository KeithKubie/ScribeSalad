00:00:00.704 --> 00:00:01.596
- [Instructor] In previous videos,

00:00:01.596 --> 00:00:04.955
we have talked about
how Christianity evolved

00:00:04.955 --> 00:00:08.723
and developed under the Roman Empire.

00:00:08.723 --> 00:00:11.122
In particular we saw
that as we entered into

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:14.337
the 4th century, that
Christianity continued

00:00:14.337 --> 00:00:16.797
to be persecuted, in particular by

00:00:16.797 --> 00:00:18.979
the Emperor Diocletian, who had some of

00:00:18.979 --> 00:00:22.851
the worst persecutions of the Christians.

00:00:22.851 --> 00:00:24.967
But over the course of the next century,

00:00:24.967 --> 00:00:28.555
from roughly 300 to 400,
the relationship between

00:00:28.555 --> 00:00:30.477
the Roman Empire and Christianity

00:00:30.477 --> 00:00:34.268
goes completely in the opposite direction.

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:36.611
As Constantine takes over, he becomes

00:00:36.611 --> 00:00:38.331
sympathetic to the Christians and he

00:00:38.331 --> 00:00:41.683
eventually becomes Christian himself.

00:00:41.683 --> 00:00:43.730
Even then, there was a lot of diversity

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.877
within the Christian Church.

00:00:45.877 --> 00:00:47.660
There were debates about the nature of

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.660
Jesus Christ relative to the Father,

00:00:51.517 --> 00:00:53.458
relative to the Holy Spirit.

00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:57.094
There were multiple sects of Christianity.

00:00:57.094 --> 00:01:01.042
And one in particular
started to create a debate.

00:01:01.042 --> 00:01:03.315
There was a priest in Alexandria,

00:01:03.315 --> 00:01:06.693
which was one of the major
cities of the Roman Empire.

00:01:06.693 --> 00:01:08.886
Now remember, by this
point, Rome of course is

00:01:08.886 --> 00:01:11.011
one of the most significant,

00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:13.013
if not the most significant city.

00:01:13.013 --> 00:01:16.747
Now Constantine sets up
a capital at Byzantium,

00:01:16.747 --> 00:01:19.795
which will eventually be
known as Constantinople.

00:01:19.795 --> 00:01:21.891
And Alexandria, which
was originally founded

00:01:21.891 --> 00:01:23.390
by Alexander the Great, is also

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.057
one of the significant
cities of the Empire.

00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:30.411
And in Alexandria there
is a Christian priest

00:01:30.411 --> 00:01:34.244
by the name of Arius,
who has a view on Christ

00:01:35.235 --> 00:01:38.235
that becomes a bit of a controversy.

00:01:39.227 --> 00:01:41.858
And to understand that, here is an account

00:01:41.858 --> 00:01:44.525
of his writings, or his beliefs.

00:01:45.714 --> 00:01:48.523
So this is Arius of Alexandria.

00:01:48.523 --> 00:01:52.546
If the Father begat the
Son, he that was begotten

00:01:52.546 --> 00:01:56.198
had a beginning of existence:
and from this it is evident,

00:01:56.198 --> 00:01:59.941
that there was a time
when the Son was not.

00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:02.972
It therefore necessarily follows that He,

00:02:02.972 --> 00:02:06.305
the Son, had his substance from nothing.

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.662
So, he's drawing a distinction
between the essence

00:02:10.662 --> 00:02:14.829
of the Father and the Son, who's
manifested as Jesus Christ.

00:02:16.571 --> 00:02:19.259
Now this is very
controversial, because even

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:22.386
his own bishop in
Alexandria viewed the Father

00:02:22.386 --> 00:02:25.931
and the Son to be of the same substance.

00:02:25.931 --> 00:02:29.042
Now, today, you might say,
hey, isn't this just word play?

00:02:29.042 --> 00:02:31.911
It feels like it's
semantic, which is really

00:02:31.911 --> 00:02:34.680
debating around the meaning of words.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.268
But, at the end of the Roman Empire

00:02:37.268 --> 00:02:39.037
and as we get into the Middle Ages,

00:02:39.037 --> 00:02:42.144
this was a major issue of philosophical

00:02:42.144 --> 00:02:46.311
and it would sometimes bleed
over into political debate.

00:02:47.471 --> 00:02:50.418
And so Constantine, who we
mentioned has a sympathy

00:02:50.418 --> 00:02:53.626
towards the Christians,
he allows Christianity

00:02:53.626 --> 00:02:57.793
to be tolerated, he does not
like this idea of this debate

00:02:58.803 --> 00:03:02.109
and he wants to help unify the Christians.

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.609
So, in 325 he calls the Council of Nicaea,

00:03:07.101 --> 00:03:10.490
to help resolve this controversy,

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.882
which gets known as the Arian Controversy,

00:03:13.882 --> 00:03:16.162
named after Arius of Alexandria.

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:17.675
Now it's worth mentioning, Arius wasn't

00:03:17.675 --> 00:03:20.019
the first person to make this argument,

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.415
that the Father in some
way was more divine

00:03:22.415 --> 00:03:25.322
than the Son, because He begat the Son,

00:03:25.322 --> 00:03:27.162
He existed before the Son.

00:03:27.162 --> 00:03:30.379
But this controversy really
revolves around Arius,

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:31.821
because he was especially persuasive about

00:03:31.821 --> 00:03:34.891
spreading this view of
the relationship between

00:03:34.891 --> 00:03:38.558
the Father and the Son,
manifested by Jesus.

00:03:42.418 --> 00:03:45.515
And at the Council of
Nicaea, many of the bishops

00:03:45.515 --> 00:03:48.351
throughout Christendom are in attendance,

00:03:48.351 --> 00:03:51.520
it's known as the First
Ecumenical Conference,

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.368
the word ecumenical comes from

00:03:53.368 --> 00:03:55.928
the Greek word for the inhabited Earth.

00:03:55.928 --> 00:03:57.481
So you can view it as the Church leaders

00:03:57.481 --> 00:04:00.384
from the inhabited
Earth, in order to create

00:04:00.384 --> 00:04:05.193
a consensus about what it
means to be a Christian.

00:04:05.193 --> 00:04:07.127
And Arius of Alexandria was there

00:04:07.127 --> 00:04:09.585
to defend his position, but the majority

00:04:09.585 --> 00:04:13.976
of those there did not
like his point of view.

00:04:13.976 --> 00:04:15.897
So they declared Arius' beliefs

00:04:15.897 --> 00:04:18.314
as heresy and they exile him.

00:04:19.224 --> 00:04:22.127
And to be very clear
that they do not believe

00:04:22.127 --> 00:04:24.817
that the Son is of a different substance

00:04:24.817 --> 00:04:28.400
of the Father, they
issue the Nicene Creed.

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:34.155
So what I have here, this is known as

00:04:34.155 --> 00:04:37.155
the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.193
And this is based on the Nicene Creed,

00:04:41.193 --> 00:04:44.015
which was established in
325, which was shorter,

00:04:44.015 --> 00:04:46.631
but then in 381, under
Theodosius, you have

00:04:46.631 --> 00:04:49.408
your Second Ecumenical
Council, which is held

00:04:49.408 --> 00:04:51.983
in Constantinople, to reaffirm

00:04:51.983 --> 00:04:55.316
some of the ideas of the Nicene Council.

00:04:56.327 --> 00:04:58.192
And so as I read this, keep a look out for

00:04:58.192 --> 00:05:00.575
some of these words, which
were really put there

00:05:00.575 --> 00:05:03.825
to try to settle the Arian Controversy,

00:05:04.753 --> 00:05:06.927
to try to ensure that that type

00:05:06.927 --> 00:05:10.168
of belief does not surface again.

00:05:10.168 --> 00:05:13.696
We believe in one God,
the Father Almighty,

00:05:13.696 --> 00:05:15.393
Maker of heaven and earth, and of

00:05:15.393 --> 00:05:18.951
all things visible and invisible.

00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:22.273
And in one Lord Jesus
Christ, the Son of God,

00:05:22.273 --> 00:05:26.440
the Only-begotten, Begotten
of the Father before all ages.

00:05:28.311 --> 00:05:30.383
So, not like Arius was
arguing, that there was a time

00:05:30.383 --> 00:05:34.569
where the Father existed
before the Son existed.

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:36.064
Here it says begotten of the Father,

00:05:36.064 --> 00:05:38.988
but before all ages, so there was

00:05:38.988 --> 00:05:41.416
always a time when there was a Son.

00:05:41.416 --> 00:05:45.583
Light of Light, Very God of
Very God, Begotten, not made;

00:05:46.704 --> 00:05:49.663
of one essence with the Father,

00:05:49.663 --> 00:05:52.335
by whom all things were made.

00:05:52.335 --> 00:05:55.240
So, once again, really addressing
this Arian Controversy,

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.424
the Arian Heresy as it becomes known,

00:05:57.424 --> 00:06:01.400
that the Father and the Son
are of the same essence,

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.230
one is not more divine than the other.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.009
Who for us men and for our salvation

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:09.808
came down from heaven, and was incarnate

00:06:09.808 --> 00:06:13.975
of the Holy Spirit and the
Virgin Mary, and was made man.

00:06:14.936 --> 00:06:18.312
And was crucified also for
us under Pontius Pilate,

00:06:18.312 --> 00:06:21.163
and suffered, and was buried.

00:06:21.163 --> 00:06:23.063
And the third day He rose again,

00:06:23.063 --> 00:06:25.185
according to the Scriptures.

00:06:25.185 --> 00:06:26.936
And ascended into heaven, and sits

00:06:26.936 --> 00:06:29.855
at the right hand of the Father.

00:06:29.855 --> 00:06:31.728
And He shall come again with glory

00:06:31.728 --> 00:06:33.537
to judge the living and the dead,

00:06:33.537 --> 00:06:36.768
Whose kingdom shall have no end.

00:06:36.768 --> 00:06:39.768
And we believe in the
Holy Spirit, the Lord,

00:06:39.768 --> 00:06:43.768
and Giver of Life, Who
proceeds from the Father.

00:06:45.104 --> 00:06:49.568
Now here in brackets I've
written filoque and the son?

00:06:49.568 --> 00:06:51.864
Because even though the official Nicene-

00:06:51.864 --> 00:06:55.137
Constantinopolitan Creed just says

00:06:55.137 --> 00:06:57.806
Who proceeds from the
Father, as we will see

00:06:57.806 --> 00:07:01.009
later on, as the Church starts to become

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:04.137
more and more divided,
in the West, in Latin,

00:07:04.137 --> 00:07:08.362
the term filoque gets added,
which means and the son.

00:07:08.362 --> 00:07:11.040
And, once again, this
is starting to address

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.578
this notion of how does the
Son relate to the Father?

00:07:15.578 --> 00:07:18.416
So, when you add filoque,
you're saying, hey,

00:07:18.416 --> 00:07:20.235
the Holy Spirit is emanating from both

00:07:20.235 --> 00:07:21.847
the Father and the Son, versus just

00:07:21.847 --> 00:07:24.072
the Father, but we'll get into that.

00:07:24.072 --> 00:07:25.768
This was not a matter of debate

00:07:25.768 --> 00:07:29.935
in the 4th century, but it
will become a matter of debate

00:07:29.935 --> 00:07:34.000
as we go into the 6th century and beyond.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.696
And we believe in the
Holy Spirit, the Lord,

00:07:35.696 --> 00:07:38.298
and Giver of Life, Who
proceeds from the Father.

00:07:38.298 --> 00:07:40.809
Who with the Father and the Son together

00:07:40.809 --> 00:07:45.584
is worshiped and glorified,
Who spoke by the Prophets.

00:07:45.584 --> 00:07:47.615
And we believe in one, holy, catholic,

00:07:47.615 --> 00:07:51.191
meaning universal, and apostolic Church.

00:07:51.191 --> 00:07:54.881
We acknowledge one Baptism
for the remission of sins.

00:07:54.881 --> 00:07:57.039
We look for the Resurrection of the dead,

00:07:57.039 --> 00:08:00.206
and the life of the age to come, Amen.

00:08:02.338 --> 00:08:04.351
So this is interesting, because it's,

00:08:04.351 --> 00:08:08.335
you can view it as a
unification of Christendom.

00:08:08.335 --> 00:08:12.057
Now, as we will see,
that unification does not

00:08:12.057 --> 00:08:15.279
hold well over the next
several hundred years.

00:08:15.279 --> 00:08:19.446
Even though Arius is exiled
and he dies shortly thereafter,

00:08:20.474 --> 00:08:23.455
you continue to have sympathetic bishops

00:08:23.455 --> 00:08:27.841
and even Roman Emperors,
to the Arian Doctrine.

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:30.017
You also, this debate between the relation

00:08:30.017 --> 00:08:32.215
of the Father and the Son continues,

00:08:32.215 --> 00:08:34.800
we'll talk about this filoque debate.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.551
But maybe most important
and the biggest cause

00:08:37.551 --> 00:08:40.447
of the eventual divisions
between the Church,

00:08:40.447 --> 00:08:43.183
ones that carry on even to today,

00:08:43.183 --> 00:08:46.100
it's really about a power struggle.

00:08:47.975 --> 00:08:50.312
So, as we've been talking about the late

00:08:50.312 --> 00:08:54.201
Roman Empire and even the
fall of the Western Empire

00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:56.232
and the beginning of the Byzantine Empire,

00:08:56.232 --> 00:08:57.885
you might already notice that there are

00:08:57.885 --> 00:09:00.487
several very powerful actors here.

00:09:00.487 --> 00:09:02.359
With the fall of the Western Roman Empire,

00:09:02.359 --> 00:09:04.591
you have the Byzantine Emperor,

00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:07.063
who considers him, and as we'll see,

00:09:07.063 --> 00:09:09.975
also herself, the Roman Emperor.

00:09:09.975 --> 00:09:12.423
We have the Bishop, the Patriarch, or,

00:09:12.423 --> 00:09:15.671
often known, the Pope of Rome.

00:09:15.671 --> 00:09:18.032
Now Rome is significant,
because according to tradition

00:09:18.032 --> 00:09:21.985
the Church at Rome was
founded by the Apostle Peter,

00:09:21.985 --> 00:09:23.488
who is considered by many to be

00:09:23.488 --> 00:09:26.007
the first amongst the Apostles.

00:09:26.007 --> 00:09:29.173
But of course Rome was the
seat of the Roman Empire

00:09:29.173 --> 00:09:31.951
for a very, very, very long time.

00:09:31.951 --> 00:09:33.344
And so you could imagine the Bishop of

00:09:33.344 --> 00:09:36.376
the Church of Rome, the Pope of Rome

00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:39.250
would be a very powerful figure.

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.447
Now you also have the
Bishop or the Patriarch

00:09:41.447 --> 00:09:44.253
of Constantinople,
which is another capital

00:09:44.253 --> 00:09:48.351
and really the capital
of the Byzantine Empire.

00:09:48.351 --> 00:09:49.551
And so what we're going
to see, over the next

00:09:49.551 --> 00:09:52.768
several hundred years, is
the jockeying for position

00:09:52.768 --> 00:09:54.887
amongst these three, in particular

00:09:54.887 --> 00:09:58.920
the Byzantine Emperor
and the Pope of Rome.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.192
The Pope of Rome starts
to consider themselves

00:10:01.192 --> 00:10:05.213
as really the leader
of all of Christendom.

00:10:05.213 --> 00:10:08.192
The Patriarch of
Constantinople and the bishops

00:10:08.192 --> 00:10:11.585
of the other major
centers of Christianity,

00:10:11.585 --> 00:10:14.874
like Antioch and Jerusalem and Alexandria,

00:10:14.874 --> 00:10:18.275
they view themselves as
all kind of a college of,

00:10:18.275 --> 00:10:22.116
as peers and they will
give extra space for

00:10:22.116 --> 00:10:25.257
the Pope of Rome or the Bishop of Rome,

00:10:25.257 --> 00:10:28.379
because of the importance of
that city and the significance

00:10:28.379 --> 00:10:32.002
of how the Church of Rome was founded.

00:10:32.002 --> 00:10:34.650
And this gets, this jockeying for power

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:36.420
over the next several hundred years

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.904
gets even more complex as the West,

00:10:39.904 --> 00:10:42.306
what was the Western Roman Empire,

00:10:42.306 --> 00:10:44.939
or some of the areas of
the Western Roman Empire,

00:10:44.939 --> 00:10:46.478
start to get consolidated under

00:10:46.478 --> 00:10:49.395
Germanic rule really, Frankish rule

00:10:50.459 --> 00:10:51.971
and you start having this notion of a

00:10:51.971 --> 00:10:54.185
Holy Roman Emperor that we'll talk about

00:10:54.185 --> 00:10:58.265
in a few hundred years down our timeline.

00:10:58.265 --> 00:11:00.413
So, keep a look out for
this power struggle.

00:11:00.413 --> 00:11:02.338
We're going to talk
about particular issues

00:11:02.338 --> 00:11:04.995
of theological doctrine, things like

00:11:04.995 --> 00:11:07.695
the filoque issue, things
like the relationship

00:11:07.695 --> 00:11:09.316
between the Father and the Son,

00:11:09.316 --> 00:11:11.550
whether you should have icons.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.289
But, at the end of the day,

00:11:13.289 --> 00:11:14.727
what's eventually going to lead to

00:11:14.727 --> 00:11:17.265
the Great Schism, in the beginning

00:11:17.265 --> 00:11:21.348
of the Second Millennium,
is this power struggle.
