00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.850
John Green: Hi, I'm John Green and this is
not Crash Course.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.600
Today we're celebrating July 4th here at the
Crash Course studios, which is why I'm wearing

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.679
my Costa Rica shirt.

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.070
To celebrate the United States today, we're
having our annual hot dog eating contest here

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.309
at the Crash Course Indianapolis studios.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.730
Pretty simple contest: How many hot dogs can
you eat in 4 minutes?

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.650
The winner wins the Golden Fork.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.789
But really, it's not about money or the Golden
Fork, or the non-existent cash prize.

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.499
It's about national pride.

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:29.570
John Green: Hi.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.520

Mentalfloss, Vlogbrothers, sometimes the Art

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.520
Assignment.

writer and host of Healthcare Triage.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.920

work on pretty much everything we make here.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.829

I direct the Art Assignment and Mentalfloss.

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.800
Meredith Danko: I'm Meredith Danko, I'm the
head writer of Mentalfloss, and I'm the assistant

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.210
manager of the AFC Wimbly-Womblys.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.550

the video editor for Mentalfloss, Crash Course,

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.550

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.260

the intern here.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.649
Alex: (Sits on chair)

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.470
JG: I'm super confident that I'm not going
to win, but I'm also confident that I am not

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.670
going to be last.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.010
SG: I'm not a professional eater.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.580
I like to eat, but I like to do it slowly.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.050
AC: Nah, I don't think very good.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.050
I'll do better than ninth.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.380
SM: The good old fashion gut pack is long
been a skill that I've had.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.070
MO: What gives me confidence this year is
knowing that no matter who wins, we all actually

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.070
lose together.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.601
MD: My confidence level's very high, even
though I have re-watched last year's and I

00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:33.050
know everyone made fun of me because I said
I was going to do well and I didn't.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.050
Still very high.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.632
BB: I haven't eaten in, like, 20 hours or
so, so I'm pretty hungry, so I think I'll

00:01:38.632 --> 00:01:39.632
do pretty well.

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:41.000
PF: I am pretty positive that I'm going to
lose.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.880
JS: I've been training for this my entire
life.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.980
(Hard to tell who says what due to mouths
full of hot dogs)

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.300
John: Alright
(Laughter, moaning)

00:01:48.300 --> 00:02:07.580
Various : Ewww, Oh my God, I wish I had blinders
that was disgusting,

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:17.840
Gross
JG: You married me

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:40.830
JG Worried about Jack,
We have 3 minutes,

00:02:40.830 --> 00:03:18.200
My jaws are getting tired
First of all these hot dogs taste awesome

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:31.920
SG: He's the competition.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:51.250
I already beat last year
JG: You can do it better, come on you can

00:03:51.250 --> 00:04:01.180
do it
BB I'm starting to get sweaty

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:09.870
It's the lights
John's gonna break his (...)

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:23.669
You ate like a hot dog and a half
What's the reversal of fortune time limit?

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:29.219
Before the four minutes.

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:35.430
Effective immediately?
... for the title

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.380
Ok Meredith?

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.800
One minute left!

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:56.070
At some point you realise you can't possibly
win

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:04.909
Narrator: You have 34 seconds left.

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:18.180
It's what's in your mouth when the timer goes?

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:40.290
I don't know
?: I can't swallow it

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.400
Take it, dad, take it.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.669
Go, daddy, go!

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.900
N: You have 18 seconds left
10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 Timer is done!

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:55.080
JG: Stan, it is my privilege and also my responsibility
to give you the Golden Hot Dog.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.769
(Everyone claps and cheers)
