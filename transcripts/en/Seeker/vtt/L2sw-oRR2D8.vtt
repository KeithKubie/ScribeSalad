00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.900
That was a really good clap.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:03.640
Good job, Amy.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.600
Des que j’ai deux ou trois ans, ma mere
ma parlee en Francais.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.820
Dann im universitet, ich habe fur drei Jahren
Deutsche gelernt… aber Ich benutze es nicht…

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:18.660
In researching bilingual brains, that is,
how brains work when someone speaks more than

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.320
one language fluently, scientists have found
there are differences.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.750
Bilingual brains activate in different ways
depending on the language they’re speaking,

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.600
and and also demonstrate incredible cognitively
flexibility, switching back and forth between

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.589
languages in a phenomenon called code-switching.

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:37.550
And a new study has found an interesting link
between language and time: the language you

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.230
think in can impact the way you perceive time.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.600
Every language has its specific vocabulary
for organizing the world around us, but when

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.440
it comes to time, there are two general categories
this is done: distance, as in crossing an

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.949
area, and volume as in a space being filled.

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.690
Swedish and English both use physical distances
to express a measure of time.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.639
In English we’d say “a short break”
or “a long wedding.”

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:04.070
We use these descriptive terms as though the
passage of time is a measurable distance.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.960
In Greek and Spanish on the other hand, time
is marked with terms that refer to volume.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.330
In Spanish you'd say "a small break" or "a
big wedding."

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.149
So the question the researchers had was whether
people who think about time with distance

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:20.020
or volume measurements have a better sense
of how much time has passed.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.409
To measure this, they had Swedish-Spanish
bilinguals watch a line grow across a screen

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.789
or watch a container being filled, the first
a measure of time as distance and the second

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.539
a measure of time as volume.

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.020
And in each instance the subject was given
a prompt in one of the two languages — 'duración'

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.200
in Spanish or 'tid' in Swedish.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.490
The results showed that subjects perceived
time as it’s measured in the language of

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.640
their prompt.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.159
When given the Spanish prompt, participants
estimated time based on volume, in this case

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.920
how full the containers were.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.719
When they were given the Swedish prompt they
could better estimate time as distance, using

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:53.340
the line’s travel as a marker.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.950
So this might not matter to any of us on a
day to day basis, but it’s interesting to

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.020
have some scientific evidence pointing to
how much language impacts the way we perceive

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.770
something universal, the passage of time.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.659
And we even found this in our office!

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.659
Maybe it’s because I’ve been exposed to
multiple languages.

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.110
When I think of a big wedding I think of a
lot of people and a long night.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.140
But other people in our office only think
about the number of attendees.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.950
Language, it seems, can creep in and affect
our most basic senses, from emotions to perception

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.310
and, apparently, time.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.879
Which means it’s possible that learning
a new language could change the way you experience

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.430
the world… which in itself is wild to think
about.

So this is our human brain, but would the
same thing happen to artificial intelligence?

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.319
We talk about giving computers consciousness
in this episode right here.

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.379
So who out there speaks multiple languages
and is aware of these different cues for understanding

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:59.379
time?
