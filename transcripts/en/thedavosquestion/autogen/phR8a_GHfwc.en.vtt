spend five months up closed ecosystem we

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820
spend five months up closed ecosystem we

had to make our air which actually took

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550
had to make our air which actually took

our urine converted it into water and

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800
our urine converted it into water and
 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.350
our urine converted it into water and
then we would use that as drinking water

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360
then we would use that as drinking water
 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.200
then we would use that as drinking water
we also use the sweat we condense it

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210
we also use the sweat we condense it
 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.750
we also use the sweat we condense it
would use that water split the hydrogen

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760
would use that water split the hydrogen
 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.240
would use that water split the hydrogen
off and we breathe the oxygen from that

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250
off and we breathe the oxygen from that
 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.510
off and we breathe the oxygen from that
h2o so in a very closed ecosystem for

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520
h2o so in a very closed ecosystem for
 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.910

you figure out very quickly that water

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100
you figure out very quickly that water
 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.370
you figure out very quickly that water
is essential and in that closed

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380
is essential and in that closed
 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.500
is essential and in that closed
ecosystem you mess up you get the result

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510
ecosystem you mess up you get the result
 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.500
ecosystem you mess up you get the result
very quickly here on earth you know when

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510
very quickly here on earth you know when
 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.630
very quickly here on earth you know when
looking from space at the earth same

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640
looking from space at the earth same
 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.570
looking from space at the earth same
thing closed ecosystem they mess up our

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580
thing closed ecosystem they mess up our
 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.030
thing closed ecosystem they mess up our
resources down here especially our water

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040
resources down here especially our water
 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.300
resources down here especially our water
fresh water supplies you know we're

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310
fresh water supplies you know we're
 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.670
fresh water supplies you know we're
going to pay the consequences

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680
going to pay the consequences
 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.510
going to pay the consequences
unfortunately on earth it sort of

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520
unfortunately on earth it sort of
 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.569

buffers things out got thousands and

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579
buffers things out got thousands and
 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.190
buffers things out got thousands and
millions of people down here so you

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200
millions of people down here so you
 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.289
millions of people down here so you
don't get it closed ecosystem three

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299
don't get it closed ecosystem three
 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.030
don't get it closed ecosystem three
people you contaminate the water source

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040
people you contaminate the water source
 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.310
people you contaminate the water source
and you find out the next day that

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320
and you find out the next day that
 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.080
and you find out the next day that
you're in trouble so I guess my plane

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090
you're in trouble so I guess my plane
 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.670
