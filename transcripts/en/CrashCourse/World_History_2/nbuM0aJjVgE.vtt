Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
World History and today we’re going talk

00:00:03.809 --> 00:00:07.529
about the Mughal Empire. And we’re also going
to talk about the two most important Mughal

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.800
emperors, Akbar and Aurangzeb and how their
historical reputations were made.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.360
Mr Green, Mr Green? Don’t you mean the Mongol Empire?

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.180
Oh, Me From The Past, that reminds of the

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.230
time that you conflated the word forte with
the word forté - which of course you pronounced

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.960
fort.
But on this occasion you aren’t entirely

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.030
wrong the Mughals were kind of the Mongols.
But we’ll get to that in a minute.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.300
So, the Mughals were Muslims who created an

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.379
empire in India that held power for roughly
200 years between the early 16th and early

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.219
18th centuries, although, technically the
Mughal empire didn’t come to an end until

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.089
after the Indian Rebellion against the British
in 1857.

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:54.969
Now the Mughals weren’t the first Muslims
in India, those would have been merchants,

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.989
and they weren’t even the first Muslims
to rule significant parts of India. That honor

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.649
goes to the Delhi sultanate which began in
1206 in northern India.

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.630
But the Delhi Sultanate didn’t last very
long, and it was replaced by a bunch of regional

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.890
kingdoms, and one of them, the Lodi sultanate
had the misfortune of falling to the founder

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.500
of the Mughal dynasty, Babur in 1526.
Not Babar, although that would have been awesome.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.539
Babur was descended from Timur, the last great
Central Asian conqueror in the Mongol tradition,

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.639
and also from Chinggis Khan, which explains
why Babur and his followers are called the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.180
Mughals; it’s the Persian-Arabic word for
Mongols.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.140
Now I know what you’re saying, something
like 12% of human beings currently living

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.990
in the world are descended from Chinggis Khan,
but Babur got in on the ground floor of it.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.890
Anyway, I think we have some footage of Babur
raiding the Lodi sultanate, don’t we Stan?

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.679
Ehhh… I don’t feel like that was actual
file footage from 1206. I feel like that was

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:52.779
a racist Hercules movie from Italy in the
1950’s.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.640
So the Mughal Empire is really important in
India’s cultural history. I mean, the Taj

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.069
Mahal was built during this time. In architecture
and painting, we see a blending of Indian

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.240
and Persian styles that demonstrate how cosmopolitan
the empire was.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.700
But probably the most important aspect of
the Mughals at least as far as the contemporary

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.240
world is concerned, is that they consolidated
Muslim rule over much of India and they’re

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.580
largely the reason that today there are so
many Indians who are also Muslims.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.650
And the Mughals were also a really interesting
example of like how to build and maintain

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.630
an empire. All right, Let’s go to the Thought
Bubble.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.740
Muslims were a small minority ruling class
vastly outnumbered by Hindus, and like many

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.420
empires they relied on military power and
pursued expansionist policies.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.440
Like most of the Mughal rulers, especially
Akbar and Aurangzeb spent a considerable amount

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.300
of time trying to extend Mughal control over
the entire Indian subcontinent. And they created

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.450
a pretty effective empire. They were able
to incorporate Indian princes into the ruling

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.260
class while still retaining top positions
for Muslims. They reorganized the bureaucracy

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.350
and instituted an effective tax collection
system, which was important because the empire

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.240
was of course very expensive to run - as empires
always are.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.540
This meant that it was important to make accurate
tax assessments and taxes were usually collected

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.660
by local leaders called zamindars. Taxes had
to be paid in cash, and this contributed to

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.200
the growing commercialization of the Mughal
empire. Reliance on zamindars, who were important

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.730
men in their communities, meant that the empire
could collect revenue without being too disruptive

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.270
to local village life. And although almost all
of the revenue came from taxes on agriculture,

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.550
the Mughals also taxed trade.
Another way that the Mughals were a typical

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.040
empire is that their rulers engaged in building
projects to enhance their prestige. From Persepolis

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.870
to Rome to the Forbidden City, building monuments
to one’s greatness is what emperors do,

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.100
and the Mughals were no exception. As Muslims,
many of their building projects were mosques,

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.300
but the Mughals also built forts and, most
spectacularly, mausoleums.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.880
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So, most history classes
that mention the Mughals focus on the contrast

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.160
between Akbar and Aurangzeb. Akbar comes off
as a good ruler, and Aurangzeb is painted

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.750
as the guy who ruined the empire.
The typically positive historians’ view

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.980
of Akbar, who ruled from 1556 until 1605,
can be summed up in this quote from Asher

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.720
and Talbot’s India before Europe:
“Through his reforms of administration and

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.160
taxation Akbar created a sound and enduring
foundation for Mughal governance, while his

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.340
tolerant attitude and inclusive policies toward
Hindus and Jains helped create a state that

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.430
was more Indian in character.”
That tolerance aspect is especially important.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.160
Like Akbar rescinded the jizya – the tax
that non-Muslims had to pay – and in 1580

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.720
he gave all non-Muslims the same rights as
Muslims instituting a policy called sulh-i kul,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.420
which translates to “universal toleration.”
Now in part, this policy was designed to lessen

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.530
the power of Muslim religious scholars, who
might have been disturbed by the way that

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.470
Akbar blended Islamic and Indian ideas of
kingship, especially the idea that he was,

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.040
you know, kind of a little bit divine.
Slightly problematic idea to a lot of Muslim

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.620
scholars given that the foundation of the
Islamic faith is the statement “there is

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.440
no God but God” but.. you know...
In addition to the sulh-i kul, Akbar built

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.680
his reputation for toleration by sponsoring
discussions of religion and philosophy. He

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.480
even commissioned a building for religious
discussions, the Ibadat Khana, where Muslims,

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.480
and Brahmins, and Zoroastrians, Jains, Christians,
all of them could talk theology.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.660
Akbar’s support for intellectual pursuits
are the kinds of things that modern historians

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.120
like, and it’s not all that surprising that
he is remembered so favorably.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.780
Historians are far less kind to Akbar’s grandson,
Aurangzeb who ruled from 1658 until 1707.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.440
This partly due to the work of J.N. Sakar
who promoted the idea that Aurangzeb built

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.160
an Islamic state that discriminated against
Hindus and other non-Muslims.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.100
Which in turn led to a loss of unity across
the Indian sub-continent and eventually the

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.510
decline of the empire.
And it’s true that by the time of Aurangzeb’s

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.690
death in 1707 the Mughals were losing control
of their empire. I mean the stark reality

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:48.620
of that decline came in 1757 when the British
East India Company established itself permanently

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.830
in Bengal and began its inexorable efforts
to colonize all of India.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.550
But that was, you know, 50 years after Aurangzeb
died so maybe he shouldn’t get all the blame.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.460
In fact, whether these guys deserve their
reputations really depends both on what aspects

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.820
of their reign you look at and how you interpret
them. As conquerors Akbar and Aurangzeb had

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.540
a lot in common.
Like Akbar might have sponsored high-minded

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.130
discussion but he was also willing to use
extreme violence to keep his subjects in line.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:20.470
For example, he slaughtered thousands of inhabitants
of the fort at Chittor and ordered his generals

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.220
to pile up the skulls of Indian princes to
frighten them into submission. That’s not

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.330
especially tolerant.
And here’s another detail about Akbar’s

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.490
rule that’s meant to paint him as a modern,
enlightened ruler. Because he was interested

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:37.230
in science, Akbar arranged an experiment.
“… He had infants moved to a special house

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:42.740
where no person was to talk to them, so that
the natural language of mankind might be revealed.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.570
The experiment failed, but it is a reflection
of Akbar’s desire to explore in a scientific

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.730
manner the nature of humans and what he believed
to be their common condition.”

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:56.700
Now you can read that as a leader trying to
understand the underlying connections among

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:02.000
all humans no matter their religious backgrounds.
Or you can read it as horrifying child abuse.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.480
And then we have Aurangzeb was a devout Muslim
and did try to introduce Islamic principles

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:13.300
into Mughal rule, but the trend towards orthodoxy
and away from Akbar’s toleration had begun

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.900
with his predecessor, Shah Jahan.
He is best known for building the Taj Mahal

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:21.100
- good work. Stan, he build it by himself?
Oh, apparently he had some help.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:25.640
But the maintenance of the Taj Mahal took
all the revenue from thirty villages, and

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:31.290
maybe Aurangzeb’s orthodoxy was less important
than his desire to appear to be a sober and

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.670
frugal leader.
Aurangzeb was also accused of destroying temples

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:39.600
in 1669, although in fact they were just damaged,
and this was primarily done to send a political

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:43.010
message to opponents, not as an act of religious
orthodoxy.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:47.210
He also tried to limit expenses at court by
prohibiting the use of gold in men’s garments

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:51.400
and he stopped the traditional practice of
being weighed against gold on his birthday.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.770
Unlike Akbar, who is seen as being a patron
of the arts, Aurangzeb is remembered for getting

00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:00.949
rid of court musicians and poets, but he got
rid of them because of financial constraints.

00:08:00.949 --> 00:08:05.669
Well, and also because of his interpretation
of Islamic law. And that last point interests

00:08:05.669 --> 00:08:10.880
me, for those who want to see him negatively,
Aurangzeb’s orthodox Islam had no room for

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.720
musicians or poets.
But it’s also possible to see that decision

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.440
as a prudent cost saving measure.
Here’s another detail of Aurangzeb’s life

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.860
that has been used to paint him as a zealot.
Aurangzeb, unlike his predecessors, was buried

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:26.380
in a simple, outdoor grave, rather than an
elaborate, and expensive, tomb.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:30.900
You could see that as a symbol of religious
faith, or as a sign of humility or an attempt

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:36.409
by a thoughtful ruler to spare his subjects
the expenses of like keeping up his tomb.

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:41.139
That said, in the long run the Taj Mahal has
done pretty well in terms of generating tourist

00:08:41.139 --> 00:08:44.039
money. Whereas I don’t think anyone is paying
to see Aurangzeb’s grave.

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.940
But the thing is, Aurangzeb needed to save
money.

00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:50.800
If he was a bad ruler, it’s mostly because
he spent so much time and treasure on fighting

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.430
rebellions in the south of his empire, and
then neglected the north, where unrest grew

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.869
as well.
It’s overly simplistic to say that the glory

00:08:57.869 --> 00:09:02.639
days of the Mughal Empire were about tolerance
and the downfall was about intolerance.

00:09:02.639 --> 00:09:07.149
Really, there were lots of factors that played
into the decline of the Mughal Empire including

00:09:07.149 --> 00:09:12.160
growing factionalism at the Mughal court,
the rise of regional powers, and the breakdown

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.779
of the system of governance by local nobles.
Historians are in the business of making claims

00:09:16.779 --> 00:09:21.779
about what happened and supporting those claims
with evidence, and often this evidence provides

00:09:21.779 --> 00:09:25.149
the details that make reading and learning
about history so much fun.

00:09:25.149 --> 00:09:28.649
Now, sometimes the details suggest only one
interpretation, but in many cases they can

00:09:28.649 --> 00:09:32.290
lead us to multiple conclusions.
And the reigns of Akbar and Aurangzeb provide

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:37.009
good examples of why we need to be careful
with our details. It’s possible that Aurangzeb

00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:41.290
was a terrible ruler because he tried to impose
Muslim orthodoxy on a Hindu majority –

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:45.680
and no doubt many Hindus felt so, especially
after he re-instituted the jizya. And he did

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.960
try to introduce sharia law as the governing
principle in the Empire.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.420
But it’s also possible that Aurangzeb’s
bad reputation comes from a contemporary preference

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:57.720
for tolerance over piety in our rulers.
Or from a general feeling that states are

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:02.220
better ruled by secular than religious laws.
Or from the fact that it’s just hard to

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.760
rule a declining empire well.
Ask President Obama.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.399
Our experiences and biases make us more likely
to see the dismissal of court musicians and

00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:15.279
poets as an example of religious fanaticism
than as like a cost saving measure.

00:10:15.279 --> 00:10:19.100
And maybe Akbar, who could be as brutal in
his military conquests as any emperor, comes

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.619
out in a good light because he did advocate
religious toleration.

00:10:22.619 --> 00:10:26.209
But it wasn’t totally, or even primarily,
due to his religious tolerance that Akbar

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:30.029
was able to win most of his wars.
And the many rebellions against his reign

00:10:30.029 --> 00:10:35.050
suggest that he wasn’t as popular with his
subjects as he is today with historians.

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:39.160
One last note about how the way that we look
at the past can shape the present and

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.160
vice-versa.
We need to be particularly careful here, because

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.920
the Mughals continue to play an important
role in how Indians imagine themselves today.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:50.399
One of the roots of contemporary Hindu nationalism
is pride at India’s throwing off the shackles

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:55.329
of imperialism and for many Hindu Nationalists,
that history of imperialism starts not with

00:10:55.329 --> 00:10:59.999
the British, but with the Mughals.
We often use history to define ourselves today,

00:10:59.999 --> 00:11:04.470
and one of the most commons ways to do that
is to make negative claims about the people that

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:07.740
we say we are not.
And so when we look at historical figures

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:13.240
we need to be conscious of the fact that
WE are looking at them. Thanks for watching.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.879
I’ll see you next week.
Crash Course is filmed here in the Chad and

00:11:15.879 --> 00:11:20.209
Stacey Emigholz studio in Indianapolis and
it's made with the help of all of these nice

00:11:20.209 --> 00:11:22.220
people.
And it wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:26.300
the support of our Subbable subscribers. Subbable
