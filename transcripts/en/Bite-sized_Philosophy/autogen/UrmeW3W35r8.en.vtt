00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.439
 
here's an interesting thing so one of

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449
here's an interesting thing so one of
 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:04.789
here's an interesting thing so one of
the postmodernist claims is that

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799
the postmodernist claims is that
 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.430
the postmodernist claims is that
diversity is necessary and they make it

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440
diversity is necessary and they make it
 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.950
diversity is necessary and they make it
racial and they make it sexual they make

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960
racial and they make it sexual they make
 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.200
racial and they make it sexual they make
it ethnic and all of that that's

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210
it ethnic and all of that that's
 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.970
it ethnic and all of that that's
actually technically incorrect by the

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980
actually technically incorrect by the
 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.689
actually technically incorrect by the
way because I study individual

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699
way because I study individual
 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.550
way because I study individual
differences so those are the differences

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560
differences so those are the differences
 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.279
differences so those are the differences
between people and I know the literature

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289
between people and I know the literature
 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.189
between people and I know the literature
so you know about James des Morris memo

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199
so you know about James des Morris memo
 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.230
so you know about James des Morris memo
right from Google he wrote that partly

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240
right from Google he wrote that partly
 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.640
right from Google he wrote that partly
because he was watching my videos which

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650
because he was watching my videos which
 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.550
because he was watching my videos which
is why he wanted me to interview him and

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560
is why he wanted me to interview him and
 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.590
is why he wanted me to interview him and
I'm a believer that there are biological

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600
I'm a believer that there are biological
 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.510
I'm a believer that there are biological
differences in temperament between men

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520
differences in temperament between men
 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.490
differences in temperament between men
and women apart from the other obvious

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500
and women apart from the other obvious
 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.840
and women apart from the other obvious
differences and that they're actually

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850
differences and that they're actually
 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.380
differences and that they're actually
not trivial and that they maximize in

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390
not trivial and that they maximize in
 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.779
not trivial and that they maximize in
the societies that have the most have

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789
the societies that have the most have
 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.060
the societies that have the most have
moved farthest to producing egalitarian

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070
moved farthest to producing egalitarian
 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.060
moved farthest to producing egalitarian
states the Scandinavian countries and

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070
states the Scandinavian countries and
 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.650
states the Scandinavian countries and
that the reason for that is that there's

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660
that the reason for that is that there's
 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.330
that the reason for that is that there's
two reasons why men and women differ in

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340
two reasons why men and women differ in
 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.459
two reasons why men and women differ in
temperament one is biological and the

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469
temperament one is biological and the
 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.709
temperament one is biological and the
other is environmental and if you remove

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719
other is environmental and if you remove
 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.750
other is environmental and if you remove
the environmental variation which you do

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760
the environmental variation which you do
 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.729
the environmental variation which you do
if you make the stadia latarian you

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739
if you make the stadia latarian you
 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.910
if you make the stadia latarian you
maximise the genetic variation and

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920
maximise the genetic variation and
 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.560
maximise the genetic variation and
that's been demonstrated in the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570
that's been demonstrated in the
 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.210
that's been demonstrated in the
scientific literature over about four

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220
scientific literature over about four
 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.520
scientific literature over about four
decades and no one wanted it or hoped

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530
decades and no one wanted it or hoped
 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.410
decades and no one wanted it or hoped
for it and they weren't biased in

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420
for it and they weren't biased in
 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.730
for it and they weren't biased in
looking for it because that was exactly

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740
looking for it because that was exactly
 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.710
looking for it because that was exactly
the opposite of what social scientists

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720
the opposite of what social scientists
 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.780
the opposite of what social scientists
wanted to find because social scientists

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790
wanted to find because social scientists
 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.550
wanted to find because social scientists
lean heavily to the left and what they

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560
lean heavily to the left and what they
 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.499
lean heavily to the left and what they
wanted to find was you flatten out the

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509
wanted to find was you flatten out the
 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.850
wanted to find was you flatten out the
state so that everyone has equal

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860
state so that everyone has equal
 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.710
state so that everyone has equal
opportunity and the differences between

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720
opportunity and the differences between
 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.990
opportunity and the differences between
people disappear that is not what

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000
people disappear that is not what
 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.569
people disappear that is not what
happened the opposite happened that

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579
happened the opposite happened that
 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.480
happened the opposite happened that
wasn't wrong and no one was happy about

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490
wasn't wrong and no one was happy about
 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.999
wasn't wrong and no one was happy about
it and no one's happy about it now you

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
it and no one's happy about it now you
 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.380
it and no one's happy about it now you
can actually tell when you've discovered

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390
can actually tell when you've discovered
 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.600
can actually tell when you've discovered
something in the social science because

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610
something in the social science because
 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.230
something in the social science because
you're not happy about it

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240
 
 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.940
 
but if you take let's say there's a big

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950
but if you take let's say there's a big
 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.319
but if you take let's say there's a big
difference between men and women in

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329
difference between men and women in
 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.740
difference between men and women in
terms of trait agreeableness compassion

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750
terms of trait agreeableness compassion
 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.480
terms of trait agreeableness compassion
and politeness on average women are more

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490
and politeness on average women are more
 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.300
and politeness on average women are more
agreeable than men and the difference is

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310
agreeable than men and the difference is
 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.279
agreeable than men and the difference is
approximately this if you take random

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289
approximately this if you take random
 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:03.749
approximately this if you take random
pairs of men and women out of the

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759
pairs of men and women out of the
 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.249
pairs of men and women out of the
population let's say you had to make a

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259
population let's say you had to make a
 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.919
population let's say you had to make a
bet on who was more agreeable if you bet

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929
bet on who was more agreeable if you bet
 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.870
bet on who was more agreeable if you bet
that it was the woman you'd be right 60%

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880
that it was the woman you'd be right 60%
 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.600
that it was the woman you'd be right 60%
of the time well that's not that much

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610
of the time well that's not that much
 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.180
of the time well that's not that much
means you'd be wrong 40% of the time

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190
means you'd be wrong 40% of the time
 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.030
means you'd be wrong 40% of the time
that's almost 50% of the time so this is

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040
that's almost 50% of the time so this is
 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.009
that's almost 50% of the time so this is
a big difference by social science

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019
a big difference by social science
 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.920
a big difference by social science
standards but that's the magnitude of

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930
standards but that's the magnitude of
 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.000
standards but that's the magnitude of
the difference there are some

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010
the difference there are some
 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.680
the difference there are some
differences that are bigger like the

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690
differences that are bigger like the
 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.000
differences that are bigger like the
difference between men and women's

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010
difference between men and women's
 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.620
difference between men and women's
interest in people versus things is

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630
interest in people versus things is
 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.910
interest in people versus things is
actually bigger than that that's the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920
actually bigger than that that's the
 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.830
actually bigger than that that's the
biggest difference we know but it's a

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840
biggest difference we know but it's a
 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.570
biggest difference we know but it's a
big difference let's say the agreeable

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580
big difference let's say the agreeable
 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.289
big difference let's say the agreeable
this difference but still they the

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299
this difference but still they the
 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.620
this difference but still they the
shared attributes of men and women far

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630
shared attributes of men and women far
 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.600
shared attributes of men and women far
outweigh the attributes that

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610
outweigh the attributes that
 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.390
outweigh the attributes that
differentiate them because you could ask

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400
differentiate them because you could ask
 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.699
differentiate them because you could ask
are there more differences within groups

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709
are there more differences within groups
 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.069
are there more differences within groups
or between them now the postmodern

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079
or between them now the postmodern
 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.550
or between them now the postmodern
answer to that is between them

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560
answer to that is between them
 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.620
answer to that is between them
that's why you need diversity by group

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630
that's why you need diversity by group
 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.000
that's why you need diversity by group
right that's why you need different

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010
right that's why you need different
 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.380
right that's why you need different
races that's why you need different

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390
races that's why you need different
 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.479
races that's why you need different
ethnicities and sexual preferences in

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489
ethnicities and sexual preferences in
 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.710
ethnicities and sexual preferences in
all of that well that's wrong there's

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720
all of that well that's wrong there's
 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.390
all of that well that's wrong there's
more difference within the groups than

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400
more difference within the groups than
 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.090
more difference within the groups than
there is between them you don't get

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100
there is between them you don't get
 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.620
there is between them you don't get
diversity by crossing the groups you get

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630
diversity by crossing the groups you get
 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.870
diversity by crossing the groups you get
diversity by by selecting across

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880
diversity by by selecting across
 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.390
diversity by by selecting across
individuals in fact the idea that there

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400
individuals in fact the idea that there
 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.520
individuals in fact the idea that there
is more differences between groups that

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530
is more differences between groups that
 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.410
is more differences between groups that
there is between individuals is actually

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420
there is between individuals is actually
 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.349
there is between individuals is actually
the fundamental racist idea it's the

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359
the fundamental racist idea it's the
 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.720
the fundamental racist idea it's the
fundamental racist idea which is well

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730
fundamental racist idea which is well
 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.890
fundamental racist idea which is well
let's say you're Asian Oriental to use

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900
let's say you're Asian Oriental to use
 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.680
let's say you're Asian Oriental to use
the old word to discriminate the one

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690
the old word to discriminate the one
 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.770
the old word to discriminate the one
type of Asian say from the other you're

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780
type of Asian say from the other you're
 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.780
type of Asian say from the other you're
so different from me that there's no

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790
so different from me that there's no
 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.449
so different from me that there's no
overlap between our groups and you're

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459
overlap between our groups and you're
 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.340
overlap between our groups and you're
also so different and there's so little

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350
also so different and there's so little
 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.800
also so different and there's so little
difference within your group that now

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810
difference within your group that now
 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.660
difference within your group that now
that I know that you're not me you're

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670
that I know that you're not me you're
 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.099
that I know that you're not me you're
not one of mine I actually know what

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109
not one of mine I actually know what
 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:51.449
not one of mine I actually know what
you're like no technically that's

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459
you're like no technically that's
 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.729
you're like no technically that's
incorrect that's wrong that isn't how

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739
incorrect that's wrong that isn't how
 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.429
incorrect that's wrong that isn't how
you get diversity

00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:58.439
 
 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.050
 
now diversity is actually necessary

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060
now diversity is actually necessary
 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.759
now diversity is actually necessary
because people differ in intelligence

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769
because people differ in intelligence
 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:03.899
because people differ in intelligence
and they different temperament may

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:03.909
and they different temperament may
 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:05.250
and they different temperament may
different skills and so you actually

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260
different skills and so you actually
 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.229
different skills and so you actually
need diversity because otherwise you

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239
need diversity because otherwise you
 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.580
need diversity because otherwise you
can't take advantage of all those

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590
can't take advantage of all those
 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.750
can't take advantage of all those
differences so you need diversity but

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760
differences so you need diversity but
 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.409
differences so you need diversity but
you need genuine diversity and like what

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419
you need genuine diversity and like what
 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.180
you need genuine diversity and like what
would genuine diversity mean if you're

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190
would genuine diversity mean if you're
 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.650
would genuine diversity mean if you're
trying to put together a work team you

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660
trying to put together a work team you
 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.360
trying to put together a work team you
want enough you want people of

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370
want enough you want people of
 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.219
want enough you want people of
sufficient diversity so that they more

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229
sufficient diversity so that they more
 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:27.659
sufficient diversity so that they more
or less so that you gather together the

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669
or less so that you gather together the
 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.400
or less so that you gather together the
appropriate talents to produce the

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410
appropriate talents to produce the
 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.050
appropriate talents to produce the
implement that's necessary to work

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060
implement that's necessary to work
 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.219
implement that's necessary to work
properly in the world

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229
properly in the world
 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.500
properly in the world
that's a competence marker because

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510
that's a competence marker because
 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.879
that's a competence marker because
otherwise your business is going to fail

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889
otherwise your business is going to fail
 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.180
otherwise your business is going to fail
and so the proper diversity with regards

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190
and so the proper diversity with regards
 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.870
and so the proper diversity with regards
to employment is the diversity that

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880
to employment is the diversity that
 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.670
to employment is the diversity that
meets the the requirements of the

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680
meets the the requirements of the
 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.240
meets the the requirements of the
business essentially obviously that's

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250
business essentially obviously that's
 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.760
business essentially obviously that's
why you try to hire people carefully and

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770
why you try to hire people carefully and
 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.690
why you try to hire people carefully and
not randomly let's say
