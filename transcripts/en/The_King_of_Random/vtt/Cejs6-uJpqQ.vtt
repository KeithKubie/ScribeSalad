00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.660
[Captions by Judy V. at Y Translator]
In this video,
we're going to be showing you

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.180
how to make some magical
solar-powered lights.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.120
They're quick to make,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.819
cost less than three dollars a piece,

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:07.819
and there are decoration

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:09.600
that can really give
your party a magical pop.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:17.440
[Music]

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.900
To get started making these
magical outdoors solar lights,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.580
there's three main things
that you need to grab.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.400
One is some small mason jars.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.500
The second is some solar stake lights,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.080
and the third is some
clear cellophane plastic.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.800
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.000
A solar stake light will be dismantled,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.140
and some of the important pieces

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.320
will be glued to the inside
of a mason jar and its lid.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.399
Some crumpled colored cellophane
will be added to give the lights

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.620
a magical otherworldly effect.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.579
Decorative elements can
then be added to the lid

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.360
to give your lights a bit more style.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.700
Little mason jars are
available in lots of places,

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:49.480
and I got these specific
ones at Hobby Lobby

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.260
because I really like the short design
and the square sides that it has.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.560
There are also multiple
different sizes of lids,

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.980
and you want to make sure
that you have the ones

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.649
that fit nicely with your solar lights.

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.720
These little stake lights cost a dollar.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.960
They have a stake at the bottom,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.560
and you can stab them into the ground
and making a nice lining your path.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.640
Well, we're not going to be
using all of the equipment,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.020
and certainly not the stakes,

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.240
but we are going to
disassemble these for parts.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.820
These solar stakes are
fairly easy to disassemble,

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.100
and the only tool we're going to need
to get all the parts that we need

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.920
is a simple Phillips-head screwdriver.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.920
[Music]

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.820
These right here are the
two pieces that we're going for.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.280
This has a solar panel,
a sensor to see how much light there is,

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.640
and on the bottom,
there's an LED bulb.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.280
This tag here on the side prevents
the battery from connecting to the bulb

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.409
while it's still in the store.

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.200
But once we pull that out,
it should light up

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.280
when we've got the
solar panel blocked off.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.040
It's a pretty straightforward design.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.880
The solar panel on top charges
a 1.2 volt battery inside,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.540
and there's an ambient
light detector in the lid,

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.880
so that when it's too dark,
the light turns on automatically.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.340
We want these two pieces,

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.300
and the rest of the
stake can be discarded.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.880
This shiny little piece
sits down below the lightbulb,

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.110
and it's a reflector
to make sure you get the most

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.760
out of your one LED bulb.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.040
With the mason jars, I talked about
the lid fitting onto the top of the lantern,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.619
and if you have the right size,
you'll have an incredibly close fit

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.900
that barely has any space on the sides.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.680
The inner lid of our mason jar,
like the rest of the stake,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.840
can be discarded.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.900
Once we've got these
four pieces separated,

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.100
it's time to use a hot glue gun
to start assembling them.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.720
This small chrome piece
is still going to be a reflector,

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.180
the same way it was before,
just in a different place.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.800
We want to glue this onto the
center bottom of our mason jar.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.880
[Music]

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.200
Next, we want to take the
top portion of the lantern,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.080
fit it just slightly
inside the mason jar lid,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.620
and then glue it in place.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.560
If you need to,
you can glue it from the outside.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.020
But it's going
to look a little sloppy.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.940
So I really like to try and get all
of the glue on the interior of the lid.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:03:03.220
[Music]

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.460
It's daylight out here,

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.420
so it's pretty hard to see how
much it does or does not light up.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.599
Let's put this jar inside
of a darkened block

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.200
so we can get a better sense for it.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.840
The white light and
unobscured walls of the glass

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.080
means we are still losing
a fair amount of the light out the sides.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.080
To keep it more visible,

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.360
and of course, to add a little bit
of sparkling magical looking color,

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.319
that's where the cellophane comes in.

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.240
This whole roll,
which has quite a bit on it,

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.439
was only about two dollars,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.100
and we're not going to be
using anywhere near a whole roll.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.840
Not even the tenth probably.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.620
We want to cut a piece of cellophane,

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.280
and wrinkled it in sort
of a circle around the reflector.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.780
We don't want to obscure
the path of light

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.340
from the LED down to the
reflector at the bottom.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.620
But we want all the way around the
sides to be covered in our cellophane.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.560
[Music]

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.520
Now, this piece is maybe 8 inches tall,
and a little over a foot wide.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.380
It's not necessarily going to
matter exactly what size you get.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.580
I'm just kind of going
to crumple this up,

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.500
and then push it into the jar,

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.620
in sort of a loop around
the reflector at the bottom.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.420
[Music]

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.180
With the cellophane added,
we can now screw the lantern light lid

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.460
down onto the jar.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:15.360
[Music]

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.380
The cellophane comes
in several different colors.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.220
And if you aren't a big fan
of the look of a mason jar,

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.760
especially with its gold or silver lid,

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.650
here's plenty of ways
you can decorate those.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.360
Ribbon, twine, or paint all work great.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:05:05.700
[Music]

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.220
By combining colors of cellophane,

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.020
you can get some interesting
blends that look even more exotic.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:16.960
[Music]

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.090
Guys, that's not all.
We've got more for you to see.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.731
That box up at the top of will
transport directly to our last video,

00:05:21.731 --> 00:05:22.830
and you should go check that out.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.540
The box at the bottom will
show you what YouTube thinks

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.520
you need to be watching next,

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.560
and this bomb in the middle
will subscribe you to the channel,

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.320
that way you never miss out on a video.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.360
Don't forget to ring that bell
and we'll see you in the next one.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.180
Talk to you then.
