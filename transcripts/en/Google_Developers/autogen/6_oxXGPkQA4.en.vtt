00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:26.749
Marcia our other competitors gonna be
around for was like it isn't a new thing

00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:26.759
around for was like it isn't a new thing
 

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:28.519
around for was like it isn't a new thing
like you can see so now that you're

00:07:28.519 --> 00:07:28.529
like you can see so now that you're
 

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:29.809
like you can see so now that you're
gonna say everybody with the computer

00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:29.819
gonna say everybody with the computer
 

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:31.640
gonna say everybody with the computer
you can see everybody do to doing the

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:31.650
you can see everybody do to doing the
 

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.559
you can see everybody do to doing the
coding it's like I like to have my

00:07:33.559 --> 00:07:33.569
coding it's like I like to have my
 

00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:36.110
coding it's like I like to have my
sphere everybody around me is like smart

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120
sphere everybody around me is like smart
 

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.709
sphere everybody around me is like smart
intelligent bright I like them so do any

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:39.719
intelligent bright I like them so do any

of you have any final thoughts I think
 

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:43.610
of you have any final thoughts I think
like actually speak to your peers out

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:43.620
like actually speak to your peers out
 

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.409
like actually speak to your peers out
their students may be other schools like

00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:45.419
their students may be other schools like
 

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:48.589
their students may be other schools like
like why you think they should get

00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599
like why you think they should get
 

00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:50.390
like why you think they should get
involved in something like this yeah I

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400
involved in something like this yeah I
 

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.559
involved in something like this yeah I
think everybody should be a part of

00:07:51.559 --> 00:07:51.569
think everybody should be a part of
 

00:07:51.569 --> 00:07:52.909
think everybody should be a part of
coding because it's going to be like the

00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919
coding because it's going to be like the
 

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:55.040
coding because it's going to be like the
future like I think everybody's going to

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:55.050
future like I think everybody's going to
 

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.190
future like I think everybody's going to
code mostly like you should do this

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:58.200
code mostly like you should do this
 

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.220
code mostly like you should do this
it's available I'm gonna say like try

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:01.230
it's available I'm gonna say like try
 

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.080
