00:00:00.888 --> 00:00:04.270
Voiceover: These are questions
from the Independent in the UK.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.933
The first question is how does
he, I'm assuming that's me Sal,

00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:12.302
how does he see the development
in video conferencing?

00:00:12.302 --> 00:00:14.664
Particularly new services
like Google Hangouts

00:00:14.664 --> 00:00:17.598
as affecting the provision
of distance learning.

00:00:17.598 --> 00:00:22.650
Is that something that he sees
the Khan Academy using and
in what kind of time frame?

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.452
Interesting question, so
there's a couple of layers here.

00:00:25.452 --> 00:00:28.922
First of all, just kind of
the idea of distance learning

00:00:28.922 --> 00:00:31.999
and this is where I think right now
everything that's online learning

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:35.448
kind of gets grouped to into
distance learning and online learning

00:00:35.448 --> 00:00:36.719
and all the same.

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.983
Most people kind of don't really
differentiate between what they are.

00:00:39.983 --> 00:00:42.323
Right now, what's happening
with distance learning

00:00:42.323 --> 00:00:44.259
is that they are for the most part

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:46.978
very similar what happens
in physical classes.

00:00:46.978 --> 00:00:48.866
It's just the people
aren't in the same room.

00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:52.225
Distance learning fundamentally,
they still involve

00:00:52.225 --> 00:00:57.857
when someone is participating in the
learning there is a live professor

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:59.659
or teacher on the other side of that,

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.123
and they still are kind
of signing up for courses.

00:01:02.123 --> 00:01:05.949
They still meet at a certain
time to do their courses

00:01:05.949 --> 00:01:07.324
or to do their interactions.

00:01:07.324 --> 00:01:10.657
I would call it much more in the
domain a synchronous learning

00:01:10.657 --> 00:01:13.387
which means that all the parties
have to be there at the same time

00:01:13.387 --> 00:01:17.191
and that all the students are also
kind of moving along at the same pace.

00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:19.653
It really is exactly
as the physical model,

00:01:19.653 --> 00:01:22.590
it's just they've taken the idea that
you have to be in the same place.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.256
Khan Academy isn't the
only version of this

00:01:26.256 --> 00:01:29.284
but Khan Academy, we kind of view
it as more of asynchronous model.

00:01:29.284 --> 00:01:31.994
Asynchronous which really just means

00:01:31.994 --> 00:01:34.066
that things aren't necessarily
happening at the same place.

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:37.068
Which is the idea that I can
record this video right now

00:01:37.068 --> 00:01:39.479
and you don't have to be
listening to it right now.

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.336
You might listen to this video an hour
later or a day later, or a year later.

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:46.001
You can really go through
things at your own pace.

00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:53.308
We don't view video conferencing as
maybe our main delivery mechanism

00:01:53.308 --> 00:01:57.315
although distance learning,
vendors or companies or schools

00:01:57.315 --> 00:02:00.533
might view video conferencing as
their main way to get to people.

00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:04.671
We think, we can record videos, people
can consume those at their own pace

00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:07.068
and we can give people
exercises and feedbacks

00:02:07.068 --> 00:02:08.934
that they can do at their own pace.

00:02:08.934 --> 00:02:11.538
Where we do think video
conferencing could be

00:02:11.538 --> 00:02:16.365
really, really, really interesting, this
is something that we have not done yet.

00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:17.946
We've kind of thrown around the idea

00:02:17.946 --> 00:02:20.029
and we just really have to get
the bandwidth to address it,

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:26.192
is I think video conferencing
is an amazing way to have
peer to peer interactions.

00:02:26.192 --> 00:02:30.697
Peer to peer, I'll just do the
acronym, peer to peer interactions.

00:02:30.697 --> 00:02:34.860
Right now in a lot of the classrooms
that are piloting Khan Academy

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.409
or even the ones doing it on their own,
and this is what we really advocate

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.402
is every student works at their own pace

00:02:40.402 --> 00:02:42.469
but when they're stuck either
this teacher intervenes

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:44.135
based on the data the teacher sees

00:02:44.135 --> 00:02:46.870
or even better a student
intervenes and helps their peer.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.533
There's no reason why that has to
be sit just in a physical classroom

00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:53.462
but you can actually
transcend a physical classroom

00:02:53.462 --> 00:02:56.529
and that's where something like video
conferencing could be really valuable.

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:59.796
If two people could share a blackboard
that looks very similar like this

00:02:59.796 --> 00:03:03.686
and they have either a
tablet device or a pen tablet

00:03:03.686 --> 00:03:07.352
like what I'm using right now, they can
run a tutoring session with each other.

00:03:07.352 --> 00:03:09.730
Would even be cool if they could
record it and they could be archived

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.599
for other people to use it in the future.

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.594
That is really powerful and that's
mainly in the tutoring space,

00:03:16.594 --> 00:03:19.197
so that you can have
peer to peer tutoring.

00:03:20.182 --> 00:03:22.812
Tutoring or really
teaching or mentoring even.

00:03:22.812 --> 00:03:26.118
The other interesting place where peer
to peer actions could be interesting,

00:03:26.118 --> 00:03:30.011
I think this is completely untapped,
is the whole idea of assessment.

00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:34.069
Right now, Khan Academy the
assessment piece happens,

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.484
you're doing exercises, it
keeps track of how you're doing.

00:03:36.484 --> 00:03:40.938
In a traditional classroom assessments
are some form of paper exam.

00:03:40.938 --> 00:03:43.905
It could be multiple choice, it could
be free answer, it could be essay exam

00:03:43.905 --> 00:03:48.627
but I think what most of us have
always realized is that the most,

00:03:48.627 --> 00:03:51.800
the highest form of assessment is
either the practical assessment

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.353
or the oral assessment.

00:03:53.353 --> 00:03:57.278
Practical would literally mean
if you're studying to be a nurse

00:03:57.278 --> 00:04:03.132
someone observes you while you're trying
to insert an IV into someones arm.

00:04:03.132 --> 00:04:06.111
Oral examination, and this
is really the goal standard

00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:07.533
for what we see in the academia.

00:04:07.533 --> 00:04:09.693
Is when you're going to your qualifiers,

00:04:09.693 --> 00:04:11.771
there's an oral part of that examination

00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:15.532
and then essentially you'll sit in
front of a room full of faculty members

00:04:15.532 --> 00:04:19.027
and they'll grill you on and make sure
you really, really, really do understand

00:04:19.027 --> 00:04:20.726
a concept deeply.

00:04:20.726 --> 00:04:24.961
What we think we could do, we're on the
peer to peer side is eventually have -

00:04:24.961 --> 00:04:28.261
not only just a kind of assessment that
we already have in place of Khan Academy

00:04:28.261 --> 00:04:29.963
but maybe an oral assessment.

00:04:29.963 --> 00:04:33.876
Where right now maybe you are a,
we don't have the proper words for,

00:04:33.876 --> 00:04:39.460
but maybe you are a level one in
Trigonometry or level one in Algebra

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.665
and you want to become
level two in Trigonometry.

00:04:43.665 --> 00:04:46.091
You want to get into this,
like a smaller circle,

00:04:46.091 --> 00:04:47.466
there's more a lead circle of people

00:04:47.466 --> 00:04:49.335
who've gotten to this deep
level of trigonometry.

00:04:49.335 --> 00:04:51.963
To do that, maybe at a
baseline you have to do some,

00:04:51.963 --> 00:04:55.949
you have to show that you've
done something kind of
the traditional exercises

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:59.601
on Khan Academy at your own
pace and you've been able
to prove competency there.

00:04:59.601 --> 00:05:02.615
But to really make it, then you
would have an oral examination

00:05:02.615 --> 00:05:05.487
with maybe five people from level two.

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:11.741
If maybe four of the five say
that you are ready for level two

00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:13.591
then you will be bumped up to level two.

00:05:13.591 --> 00:05:15.929
Then one of your responsibilities
as someone in level two

00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:20.944
is assess future people from
level one, coming from level one.

00:05:20.944 --> 00:05:24.204
Then of course your next
aspiration is to go to level three

00:05:24.204 --> 00:05:26.608
or going to become a
master of all of the Math

00:05:26.608 --> 00:05:27.997
or whatever you might want to say.

00:05:27.997 --> 00:05:30.609
I think peer to peer interactions
could be really, really powerful

00:05:30.609 --> 00:05:33.062
when it comes to the assessment part.

00:05:33.062 --> 00:05:37.039
I'd be hard pressed to see
how this isn't more rigorous

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:38.783
than really all the
assessment that has in place.

00:05:38.783 --> 00:05:42.086
Because you're not just being
assessed by arbitrary peers,

00:05:42.086 --> 00:05:45.672
you're being assessed by peers who've
already really proven themselves

00:05:45.672 --> 00:05:48.073
to really deeply understand the concept.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.882
The other things when you say,

00:05:51.882 --> 00:05:56.492
is that something he sees the Khan
Academy using and what kind of time frame?

00:05:56.492 --> 00:05:59.725
Once again we do see ourselves using
it but we don't know the time frame,

00:05:59.725 --> 00:06:00.864
it's just a bandwidth issue.

00:06:00.864 --> 00:06:03.388
That reminds me, so the other
area I think video conferencing

00:06:03.388 --> 00:06:06.280
could be really powerful is in
the idea of foreign language.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.135
Once again the goal standard in
foreign language is really immersion

00:06:10.135 --> 00:06:15.239
but that's obviously not always
possible or economically possible.

00:06:15.239 --> 00:06:18.770
The second best thing to immersion
is actually having live interactions

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.459
with people on the other side of the world

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:22.482
or maybe even not on the
other side of the world.

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:24.786
One thing I want to do with
my two and a half year old

00:06:24.786 --> 00:06:28.367
is maybe get him a Skype or maybe
a Google+ buddy or whatever it is

00:06:28.367 --> 00:06:31.382
in different countries so that
he can start chatting with kids

00:06:31.382 --> 00:06:33.119
maybe his own age or little
older, little younger.

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:36.278
They can just start to at least get
the basics of each others languages

00:06:36.278 --> 00:06:37.928
and start to teach each other.

00:06:37.928 --> 00:06:41.233
I think it can have a lot to
be done, not full immersion

00:06:41.233 --> 00:06:45.748
but some immersion for
foreign language learning.

00:06:45.748 --> 00:06:48.198
Then a lot of the core
for the foreign language

00:06:48.198 --> 00:06:52.574
like the vocabulary and the grammar, we
could probably do our exercise platform

00:06:52.574 --> 00:06:55.235
but this is really what gives you
that deeper understanding of it.

00:06:55.235 --> 00:06:59.163
The next question is, is
there a possibility of Khan
Academy's qualifications,

00:06:59.163 --> 00:07:01.577
achievements being externally
validated at some point

00:07:01.577 --> 00:07:03.520
such that they're
recognized internationally

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.272
as a measure of academic achievement?

00:07:05.272 --> 00:07:07.587
There definitely is a possibility

00:07:07.587 --> 00:07:12.592
and we are exploring to
see how can we validate

00:07:12.592 --> 00:07:14.224
that when someone does
something on Khan Academy,

00:07:14.224 --> 00:07:15.362
that it is really coming from them.

00:07:15.362 --> 00:07:16.585
We think there are ways to do it.

00:07:16.585 --> 00:07:20.192
We could even have places where you
could go and you could show your ID

00:07:20.192 --> 00:07:21.978
or whatever and say,
"Hey look this is me."

00:07:21.978 --> 00:07:24.223
"I'm not going to do
the Khan Academy there."

00:07:24.223 --> 00:07:27.281
Then we could validate that yes this
was definitely the person who did that.

00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:32.660
Then once you do that, we could
give badges or validations

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.583
that "Look this person really
does know that information."

00:07:34.583 --> 00:07:38.869
Then it's a matter of making sure
that they are accepted broadly.

00:07:38.869 --> 00:07:41.895
I think this actually touches
a generalized problem.

00:07:41.895 --> 00:07:45.235
In that right now you and I have
talked about this in other videos,

00:07:45.235 --> 00:07:46.633
in other lectures.

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:51.140
Right now education is kind of a
mixture of you have the learning part,

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:54.847
you have the credentialing part,

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:59.947
and then you have a little
bit of a socialization part.

00:08:02.162 --> 00:08:03.726
You have a little bit of socialization.

00:08:03.726 --> 00:08:06.526
When you go to a university
and you pay the big tuition

00:08:06.526 --> 00:08:10.305
you're kind of getting all of these
stuff and depending who you ask,

00:08:10.305 --> 00:08:12.932
different people think they're paying
for or providing different things.

00:08:12.932 --> 00:08:15.221
If you ask most students
at most universities,

00:08:15.221 --> 00:08:17.734
they're probably most
focused on the credential.

00:08:17.734 --> 00:08:20.026
But if you ask most of the universities

00:08:20.026 --> 00:08:23.113
they'll say, "Hey no, all of our resources
are going to this right over here."

00:08:23.113 --> 00:08:26.984
"The credential is just to make sure
that people are learning the things,"

00:08:26.984 --> 00:08:29.039
"but actually spending
the resources over here."

00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:32.268
That question I think about whether
Khan Academy can get credentials,

00:08:32.268 --> 00:08:34.110
so frankly where the third
party can get credentials

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.367
I think is just the whole
issue of can we decouple this?

00:08:37.367 --> 00:08:41.178
Can we separate, can we
create a line of separation

00:08:41.178 --> 00:08:44.214
between the learning side of
education and the credentialing side?

00:08:44.214 --> 00:08:47.367
I think if you do that generally
something really powerful happens.

00:08:47.367 --> 00:08:50.710
If we can create, and it doesn't
have to come from Khan Academy.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.416
It can come from a government,
it can come from NGOs,

00:08:52.416 --> 00:08:54.153
it can come from who
knows where it comes from.

00:08:54.153 --> 00:09:00.590
If there is an internationally recognized
battery of examinations, assessments

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:03.014
and deep assessments they can
be practical, they can be oral,

00:09:03.014 --> 00:09:04.590
they can be paper based, all of the above.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.162
If you have something like this
that is internationally recognized

00:09:08.162 --> 00:09:11.789
then all of a sudden the
rest of the education world

00:09:11.789 --> 00:09:13.478
will compete right over here

00:09:13.478 --> 00:09:16.295
and then there students will just try
to get this thing right over here.

00:09:16.295 --> 00:09:18.169
What's exciting about something like that

00:09:18.169 --> 00:09:21.008
is then Khan Academy could
compete on equal footing.

00:09:21.008 --> 00:09:25.205
Because if students who choose to
go through Khan academy for free,

00:09:25.205 --> 00:09:27.738
perform just as well on that as a student

00:09:27.738 --> 00:09:30.208
who's spending tens of
thousands of dollars

00:09:30.208 --> 00:09:33.735
or maybe certain students who say, "We
know this just works better for me."

00:09:33.735 --> 00:09:36.069
Or maybe some students
will just learn on the job

00:09:36.069 --> 00:09:39.156
or they'll learn from textbooks

00:09:39.156 --> 00:09:41.190
but allows students to
learn the best way they can,

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:44.155
the best way that fits their career
and even their economic situation.

00:09:44.155 --> 00:09:46.784
The other good thing is, this
is internationally recognized

00:09:46.784 --> 00:09:51.157
it solves the problem that right
now there are some big name schools

00:09:51.157 --> 00:09:54.134
that if you're lucky enough
to attend one of those schools

00:09:54.134 --> 00:09:55.688
you do have something on your resume

00:09:55.688 --> 00:09:57.835
that anywhere in the world
or anywhere in the country

00:09:57.835 --> 00:09:59.234
someone might recognize it.

00:09:59.234 --> 00:10:03.030
The problem is most universities
aren't internationally recognized

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.466
or aren't recognized
broadly beyond one region,

00:10:05.466 --> 00:10:09.474
and so you have students who are doing
this really, really well right now.

00:10:09.474 --> 00:10:12.267
They're learning or they're
potentially learning really well

00:10:12.267 --> 00:10:15.558
maybe at their regional university
or their community college

00:10:15.558 --> 00:10:17.226
and then they get this credential.

00:10:17.226 --> 00:10:19.337
Then they get this
credential right over here

00:10:19.337 --> 00:10:22.232
but this credential is not
universally recognized.

00:10:22.232 --> 00:10:24.835
It's not the goal of the neighboring
state or the neighboring country

00:10:24.835 --> 00:10:27.072
and people don't know how
to assess that credential.

00:10:27.072 --> 00:10:30.255
This way those students who really
do learn their material well

00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:33.858
will be able to take this
external assessments and prove

00:10:33.858 --> 00:10:36.993
that they know just as well as the
student who went to Oxford or Harvard.
