00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:03.520
Hello, I'm Hank Green; welcome to Crash Course
Chemistry.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.890
Today, we're talking about the most important
table ever.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.639
Not the table where they signed the Declaration
of Independence,

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:16.679
nor any table of contents, nor this table
right here, nor the stone table of Aslan,

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:17.199
NAY!

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.550
It is the periodic table of elements, a concise,

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.650
information-dense catalog of all of the different
sorts of atoms in the universe.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.400
Today I want to talk a little bit about the
creation of this table,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.430
which is, to be clear, one of the crowning
achievements of human thought.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.500
To start out, though, let's close our eyes
and pretend.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:45.620
[Theme Music]

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.570
Imagine you're in Siberia. And you're a thirteen-year-old
boy.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.300
And your father, who was a professor but had
gone blind,

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.079
leaving your family of more than ten brothers and sisters destitute, has just died. I know, downer.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.440
Your mom, to support the family, has re-opened an abandoned glassmaking factory in the small town where you live,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.520
largely because she wants to make enough money
to send you to school someday.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.040
A year passes - the factory burns down.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.410
But your mom, she sees your potential;

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.220
she knows that you have a keen scientific
mind and will not see that squandered.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:25.040
So, with your siblings out of the house and on their own, she packs up your belongings, straps them to a horse,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:32.280
and with you in tow, rides 1200 miles through the Ural Mountains on horseback to a university in Moscow.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.840
There, on your behalf, she pleads earnestly
and effectively, and they reject you.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.060
So together, you ride another 400 miles to
St. Petersburg,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.860
to the school where your father had graduated
as a scientist,

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:52.020
and as luck, or extreme, insane, undeniably Russian persistence, would have it, they accept you,

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.280
and your saddle-worn butt, as a pupil. Your mother, having completed her mission, promptly dies.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.920
If you're doing your imagining as I told you,
you might feel a tremendous debt to your mother,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.700
and a very deep desire to ensure that you achieve something on par with the sacrifices she made for you.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.460
And maybe that's one reason why Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev became the crown jewel of Russian science,

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.540
and a theorist who revolutionized how we see
the world.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.720
Mendeleev spent a great deal of time in laboratories as a student, studying the burgeoning new field of chemistry.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.379
He worked with all the elements that you could
work with at the time,

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.890
and his knowledge gave him unique insights
into their properties.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.920
Those insights would come in handy.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.340
Let's all imagine we're Mendeleev again - I like doing that - and that we know a bunch of stuff about chemistry -

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.829
which, you know, we don't, yet - but we're
imagining.

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.140
So it's the 1860s, and about 60 elements are
known to mankind,

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.909
and their atomic weights are mostly known
as well.

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:50.640
So the simplest thing was just to sort them
in order of their atomic weights.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.560
But interestingly, you, because you're a cleverpants,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.540
realized that the most significant relationships
seem to have nothing to do with the atomic weight.

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:03.120
Lithium, sodium, potassium, and rubidium were
all extremely prone to reacting with chlorine,

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.569
fluorine, iodine, and bromine;

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.150
beryllium, magnesium, calcium, and strontium
were all similar, but less reactive.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.450
But with a quick inspection, you, and to be
fair, a number of other chemists,

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.459
realize that there was a relationship between
atomic weights, but it's periodic.

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.129
At the beginning of the list of elements,
characteristics repeat every seven elements.

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.499
On the side here, we now know that it's every
eight elements,

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:26.889
but in the 1860s, elements were studies based
on their reactivity,

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:32.400
so the non-reactive noble gases had not yet
been discovered, so the period occurred every

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.400
As the mass of the elements increases, the
repetition starts to get a little less periodic,

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.950
although it's certainly still there; it just
isn't perfect.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.099
Some of your colleagues, they're saying: "Well,
such is life."

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.189
It was perfect repetition early on, but later
in the list it gets a little fuzzier.

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:52.079
But not you; you become obsessed. Obsessed
with the perfection of the periodicity.

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.169
You write out the names and weights and properties
of elements on cards;

00:03:55.169 --> 00:04:02.289
you lay them across your desk, shuffle them, tear them to pieces in frustration, until one day, you realize:

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.230
that you're simply missing cards.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.609
The numbers aren't working, not because there's
something wrong with your ideas,

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.810
but because some elements simply haven't been
discovered yet.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.220
Armed with this insight, you insert gaps into the table, and things suddenly fall perfectly into place.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.720
Seven-element periods for the first two rows,
with hydrogen in its own category,

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.360
eighteen-element periods for the next two
rows.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.960
You're so certain that you predict the properties
of these missing elements.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.420
And when a French scientist comes along and says that he has, in fact, discovered one of them,

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.260
you argue with him, saying that you discovered
it first in your mind.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.170
And when you see his data, and it doesn't
match yours,

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.410
you publish a paper saying his data for the
new element he discovered is wrong.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.420
That's how certain you are of yourself of this beautiful new theoretical framework you've created.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.890
And you know what the really crazy thing is?
You're right! That French guy's data was wrong!

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:59.240
You, never having examined the element he
discovered, knew more about it than he did,

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.070
because you are Mendeleev, Master of the Elements.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.850
Okay, we're done imagining for the episode;
that was fun though.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.750
Different groups Mendeleev had identified are a lot of the same groups that we study today.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.820
Starting at the left, we have the soft, shiny,
extremely reactive alkali metals,

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.220
so reactive, in fact, that they have to be
stored in inert gases or oil, to prevent them

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.110
from reacting with the atmosphere.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.480
Alkali metals want nothing more than to dump off an electron and form a positive ion, or cation.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.260
And they're always jonesing to hook up with
a hottie from the other side of the table.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.700
So of course, seeing as they're so reactive, you don't find hunks of them lying around in nature;

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.020
instead, chemists must extract them from compounds
containing them.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.580
Next, you have the alkaline earth metals - reactive metals, but not as reactive as the alkali metals,

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.280
forming cations with two positive charges
instead of just one.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.500
Calcium, shown here, undergoes a very similar
reaction to sodium with water,

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.520
just a little more slowly, producing a little
less heat.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.420
The middle body area of the table is made up of a nice, solid rectangle of transition metals,

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.120
these are the metals you think of as metal,
with iron, and nickel, and gold, and platinum.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.670
The majority of elements are metals - they're
fairly unreactive, great conductors of heat,

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.980
but more importantly for us, good conductors
of electricity.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.820
They're malleable, and can be bent and formed
and hammered into sheets,

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.050
and they're extremely important in chemistry
but overall surprisingly similar to each other.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.170
On the far right, just over from the noble
gases,

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:27.680
the halogens make up a set of extremely reactive
gases that form negative ions, or anions,

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.760
with one negative charge, and love to react
with the alkali and alkaline earth metals.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.790
The rectangle between the halogens and the
transition metals contain a peculiar scatter

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.460
shot of metals, metalloids, gases, and nonmetals;

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.540
these guys don't end up as ions unless you take extreme action and start shooting other ions at them,

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:50.350
so generally a bit boring over here, though
lots of interesting covalent organic chemistry

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:51.520
(we'll get to that).

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.130
Down below, in their own little island, are
the lanthanides and actinides,

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.540
metals that were largely undiscovered in Mendeleev's
day

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.590
because they're so similar that it's next
to impossible to separate them from each other.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:06.790
And finally, on the far, far right, also undiscovered
when Mendeleev built his chart,

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.650
the completely unreactive noble gases.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.220
Like a lot of other obsessive scientists, Mendeleev never thought he was done with his table,

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.660
so he held it back for quite a while, only
publishing it as part of a new chemistry textbook

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.980
he was working on as a way to make some quick
cash that he needed.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:27.200
And, as with many other scientific revelations, there were a number of other people hot on this discovery's trail.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:32.220
As many as six people published on the periodicity
of elements at roughly the same time as Mendeleev,

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.160
but a few things set him apart.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.120
1. He was obsessive.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.240
He knew the data better than anyone else,

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.240
and had spent a ton of time working on a theory that many people thought was just an interesting little quirk.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:49.820
And 2. he realized in a way no one else did that the idea of periodicity had far-reaching consequences.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:54.400
It seems as if he had a deep belief in the
cosmic importance of what he was doing,

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.420
almost of religious fascination.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:57.970
Mendeleev believed in God

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:03.220
but also he believed that organized religions were false paths to the unknowable nature of God.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:07.710
I like to believe that he thought he saw some
divine pattern in his tables,

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:12.660
and Mendeleev felt as if he was coming to
know God in a way that no other man had.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.040
To be clear, this is pure conjecture.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.850
And as we now know, the periodicity of elements
is a physical phenomenon.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:24.520
It's a function of electrons, which are in some ways pretty dang peculiar, but certainly not at all mystical.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.820
But we'll get to that peculiar physical reality
in the next episode.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:34.089
The periodic table that we know and love - I
love it anyway - if a representation of reality;

00:08:34.089 --> 00:08:37.990
a way of understanding and sorting the universe
as it exists.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:41.169
But that form of the table is not by any means
set in stone;

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:46.339
indeed, a contemporary of Mendeleev envisioned
the table set onto a screw, or cylinder,

00:08:46.339 --> 00:08:48.879
with the elements wrapping around from one
side to another.

00:08:48.879 --> 00:08:52.209
While Mendeleev's table looks more like a
map up on a wall,

00:08:52.209 --> 00:08:55.300
de Chancourtois, a geologist, envisioned more
of a globe.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:01.160
Unfortunately for de Chancourtois, no publisher could figure out how to print his cylindrical 3D table,

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:06.680
and so he published his paper without a graphical representation of his Periodic Cylinder of the Elements,

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.139
and it was largely ignored.

00:09:08.139 --> 00:09:10.259
I guess they didn't have paper craft back
then.

00:09:10.259 --> 00:09:14.970
I am a huge fan of this cut-and-tape model
of the periodic table;

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.120
you can make your own - there's a link in
the description -

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.029
and there are also a ton of other designs
for periodic tables

00:09:20.029 --> 00:09:23.259
that have various advantages over the one
that we're all familiar with.

00:09:23.259 --> 00:09:27.060
Our periodic table, as it stands, it really
a little bit unhappy with itself, frankly;

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:31.680
the lanthanides and actinides really should
be part of the table, but we separate them out,

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.740
because it's hard to fit that on a piece of paper;
really, this is what it should look like.

00:09:35.749 --> 00:09:38.350
And really, it would be best if it wrapped
around into a circle,

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:44.060
so that fluorine, and neon, and sodium were all next to each other, instead of being on opposite sides of the map,

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.870
because they're just one proton away!

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:49.740
Mendeleev's contribution, nonetheless, is
more powerful than at first it seemed.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.639
He ended up forming a guide to help future
chemists understand things that wouldn't be

00:09:53.639 --> 00:09:56.579
discovered for 25, 50, even 100 years.

00:09:56.579 --> 00:10:00.319
Indeed, after Mendeleev's theories were published
and accepted,

00:10:00.319 --> 00:10:06.769
the overwhelming cry form the scientific community
was "Why? Why? Why?"

00:10:06.769 --> 00:10:09.189
And although Mendeleev was not himself concerned
with this stuff,

00:10:09.189 --> 00:10:14.420
he actually denied the existence of atoms, or indeed anything he couldn't see with his own eyes.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.580
It turned out that the answer to the first
"Why", was the electron.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:25.320
That sneaky little electron; Mendeleev, if he'd been around to see their discovery, he would have hated them.

00:10:25.329 --> 00:10:28.629
But you, you will have a healthy respect for
them,

00:10:28.629 --> 00:10:32.680
after you learn all about them on the next
episode of Crash Course Chemistry.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.760
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash Course Chemistry. If you were paying attention, you now know:

00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:40.339
The terrible, beautiful, and wonderful story
of Dmitri Mendeleev;

00:10:40.339 --> 00:10:42.870
How he organized the elements into the periodic
table;

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.860
Some of the basics of the relationships in
that table;

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.370
Why Mendeleev stood out from his colleagues;

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.540
and how the table as we know it today could
stand some improvement.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.519
This episode of Crash Course Chemistry was
written by myself,

00:10:54.519 --> 00:10:58.579
