what year this photos from no 40s so

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060
what year this photos from no 40s so
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.960
what year this photos from no 40s so
that's so it's a computer punch card

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970
that's so it's a computer punch card
 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.250
that's so it's a computer punch card
from the 40s and so that's obviously not

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260
from the 40s and so that's obviously not
 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.080
from the 40s and so that's obviously not
the most frictionless and intuitive way

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090
the most frictionless and intuitive way
 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.179
the most frictionless and intuitive way
of interacting with the computer I think

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189
of interacting with the computer I think
 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.789
of interacting with the computer I think
you're all agree with that and so I

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799
you're all agree with that and so I
 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.740
you're all agree with that and so I
think it's fair to say that smartphones

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750
think it's fair to say that smartphones
 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.109
think it's fair to say that smartphones
were truly the first breakthrough in

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119
were truly the first breakthrough in
 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.859

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.810
terms of have innovation and interfaces
and accessibility with computers and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
and accessibility with computers and
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.590
and accessibility with computers and
what they can do and still the level of

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600
what they can do and still the level of
 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.020
what they can do and still the level of
abstraction remains right so when you

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030
abstraction remains right so when you
 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.300
abstraction remains right so when you
call a friend on your phone you don't

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310
call a friend on your phone you don't
 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.590
call a friend on your phone you don't
really see them like you see them in

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600
really see them like you see them in
 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.170

real life you see this flat lifeless

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180
real life you see this flat lifeless
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.520
real life you see this flat lifeless
version of them on the screen and

restaurant your phone doesn't really
 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.270
restaurant your phone doesn't really
walk you to the restaurant you still

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280
walk you to the restaurant you still
 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.580
walk you to the restaurant you still
have to look at your phone and see this

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590
have to look at your phone and see this
 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.200
have to look at your phone and see this
blue dots and then find a way of

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210
blue dots and then find a way of
 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.020
blue dots and then find a way of
navigating there it's not ideal it's

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030
navigating there it's not ideal it's
 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.999
navigating there it's not ideal it's
getting better but it's not ideal so

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009
getting better but it's not ideal so
 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.490
getting better but it's not ideal so
with the massive computing we're saying

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500
with the massive computing we're saying
 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.950
with the massive computing we're saying
that instead of staring at our screens

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960
that instead of staring at our screens
 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.680
that instead of staring at our screens
and constantly checking our phones we'll

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690
and constantly checking our phones we'll
 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.809
and constantly checking our phones we'll
be able to interact with the world and

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819
be able to interact with the world and
 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.380
be able to interact with the world and
computers

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390

more natural way we'll be able to hold

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090
more natural way we'll be able to hold
 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.720
more natural way we'll be able to hold
up our heads to the real and virtual

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730
up our heads to the real and virtual
 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.280
up our heads to the real and virtual
worlds around us okay that's kind of the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290
worlds around us okay that's kind of the
 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.170
worlds around us okay that's kind of the
high-level philosophy as to how we think

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180
high-level philosophy as to how we think
 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.940
high-level philosophy as to how we think
about this so what is the immersive

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950
about this so what is the immersive
 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.080
about this so what is the immersive
computing so the way we think of this is

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090
computing so the way we think of this is
 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.680
computing so the way we think of this is
really as a spectrum with a R and D are

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690
really as a spectrum with a R and D are
 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.640
really as a spectrum with a R and D are
as two points on it so on the very right

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650
as two points on it so on the very right
 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.229
as two points on it so on the very right
you have virtual reality which is fully

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239
you have virtual reality which is fully
 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.110
you have virtual reality which is fully
computer-generated and the very left you

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120
computer-generated and the very left you
 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.120
computer-generated and the very left you
have reality or you can call it a real

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130
have reality or you can call it a real
 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.690
have reality or you can call it a real
reality as what we're taking part in

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700
reality as what we're taking part in
 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.210
reality as what we're taking part in
right here and in the middle the sort of

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220
right here and in the middle the sort of
 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.720
right here and in the middle the sort of
the middle part is augmented reality and

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730
the middle part is augmented reality and
 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.360
the middle part is augmented reality and
this layer of computer-generated reality

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370
this layer of computer-generated reality
 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.660
this layer of computer-generated reality
that comes on top of our real world

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670
 
 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.060
 
another way to put it is virtual reality

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070
another way to put it is virtual reality
 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.699
another way to put it is virtual reality
can take you anywhere as this beautiful

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709
can take you anywhere as this beautiful
 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.870
can take you anywhere as this beautiful
image shows and augmented reality can

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880
image shows and augmented reality can
 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.289
image shows and augmented reality can
bring anything to you so this is all

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299
bring anything to you so this is all
 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.970
bring anything to you so this is all
kind of intuitive so let's take a look

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980
kind of intuitive so let's take a look
 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.380
kind of intuitive so let's take a look
at some of the efforts and the latest

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390
at some of the efforts and the latest
 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.870
at some of the efforts and the latest
things that we've done in the augmented

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880
things that we've done in the augmented
 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.590
things that we've done in the augmented
reality space so if you think back 10

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600
reality space so if you think back 10
 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.830
reality space so if you think back 10
years ago that was one of the first

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840
years ago that was one of the first
 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.569
years ago that was one of the first
Android devices computers so computers

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579
Android devices computers so computers
 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.069
Android devices computers so computers
as phones have become a lot more

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079
as phones have become a lot more
 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.370
as phones have become a lot more
powerful and sort of interesting in

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380
powerful and sort of interesting in
 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.870
powerful and sort of interesting in
terms of what they can do yet their

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880
terms of what they can do yet their
 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.670
terms of what they can do yet their
understanding contextual understanding

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680
understanding contextual understanding
 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.430
understanding contextual understanding
of the world around them has become

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440
of the world around them has become
 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.440
of the world around them has become
pretty limited with AR this equation

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450
pretty limited with AR this equation
 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.750
pretty limited with AR this equation
will be changed dramatically

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760
will be changed dramatically
 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.240
will be changed dramatically
this will really bring the next big

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250
this will really bring the next big
 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.710
this will really bring the next big
shift in terms of computers

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720
shift in terms of computers
 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.449
shift in terms of computers
understanding the world around them in a

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459
understanding the world around them in a
 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.020
understanding the world around them in a
completely different way so at the most

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030
completely different way so at the most
 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.660
completely different way so at the most
basic fundamental level this is about

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670
basic fundamental level this is about
 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.140
basic fundamental level this is about
providing timely and relevant digital

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150
providing timely and relevant digital
 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.390
providing timely and relevant digital
information in the context of the real

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400
information in the context of the real
 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.520
information in the context of the real
world so here you've got an example of

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530
world so here you've got an example of
 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.130
world so here you've got an example of
da Vinci's lady with the ermine where

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140
da Vinci's lady with the ermine where
 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.320
da Vinci's lady with the ermine where
the very first version of the painting

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330
the very first version of the painting
 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.060
the very first version of the painting

we've all heard the term mixed reality
 

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:16.250
we've all heard the term mixed reality
and so let's see what shape that takes

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:16.260
and so let's see what shape that takes
 

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.380
and so let's see what shape that takes
most likely in form of devices that will

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:18.390
most likely in form of devices that will
 

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:21.920
most likely in form of devices that will
combine both AR and ER in one and so

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:21.930
combine both AR and ER in one and so
 

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:25.670
combine both AR and ER in one and so
immersive computing and its future and
