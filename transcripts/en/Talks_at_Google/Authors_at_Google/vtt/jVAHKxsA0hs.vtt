00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.070
&gt;&gt; So I would like to introduce Alan Pearsall
who did the mural we have in our game room,

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.201
which is a Fenway mural with sort of a squished
perspective of the Boston skyline behind it.

00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:21.110
For those of you on VC or watching this on
video, I think you can see a picture of the

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.930
mural in progress on the GoBoston website.
It's also in Alan's website. I'll let him

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.500
say what that is.
&gt;&gt; PEARSALL: All right.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.520
&gt;&gt; He's going to talk about his book about
Ipswich, which I guess started when he agreed

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.120
to do a mural for them, which took about three
years to do, and so the book in total has

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.360
been a five year work in progress. I'll hand
it over to you.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:54.850
&gt;&gt; PEARSALL: Thank you very much. All right,
well, the book, the inspiration for the book

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.120
was the mural, and so I'll start with that.
I'll tell you about the making of the mural

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.030
and then give you a few stories of the reason
why picked the history theme in Ipswich because

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.670
it's one of the earliest towns of America
and it was an Indian village for thousands

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.000
of years. But if you turn to page seven-—you
guys all have your books, so-—you can see

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.740
what the mural looks like in its finished
state. It's 2,700 square feet and it took

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:29.149
me three summers to paint. Each summer I did
about a third of it, and I could paint from

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:35.090
about May till about the end of October. And
the weather has to be at least 50 degrees

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:43.069
or higher for the paint to cure so, you have
to do it in pieces. So, like I said, that

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:47.889
high point there where the sculpture is, that's
37 feet high to give you an idea. And that

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:52.369
front, those three arches are 60 feet wide.
And the folks in the front are life-sized,

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:58.249
just to give you an idea of the scale. And
so what happened was I went in and they gave

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:03.179
me the contract. I showed them my art work.
That's usually how I do it. And they wanted

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:09.970
to do a large picture of a lobster--that was
their idea--and I thought that was okay, but

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.540
Diego Rivera being my hero as a mural painter,
I said, well, let me try a little historical

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.260
idea, and I went to EBSCO with the sketches.
If you to page 191 and 190, you can see the

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.840
pencil sketch. This is the first sketch I
presented. Well, it's kind of the second version

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.959
of it, but--and you can see the little squares,
as I do my sketches, an inch equals a foot,

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.230
so that kind of gives you a kind of an idea
of the scale when it's all done, so. So, once

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.410
I got this approved, I went to the historical
society and the old ladies there, they looked

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.129
at it and they actually had a couple of changes,
you know. I really did my research. And if

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:52.650
you turn the page, you can see the color version
of the same sketch. Then I get that approved.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.709
And I do this for every mural because—-the
same that I did for the Fenway mural here—-because

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.109
it's a way, you know, not only do I use it
as my guide to paint it so I'm not deciding

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:06.469
on colors while I'm at the wall-–it's hard
enough blowing the thing up--and, you know,

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:10.470
you just basically just grid the wall and
repaint it, put the one foot squares on the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:17.359
wall and then I paint it. And on this particular
mural, I did that first archway to the left

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:23.450
with that Chief [INDISTINCT] there. And he
went there because the president of EBSCO

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.510
was a little nervous about how it would look
on the lumpy old brick. His building was built

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.871
in 1826, so it had bolts sticking out of it
and there's a big line going across it. If

00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:39.739
you look at the final mural, because I hide
all the blemishes with fake ivy which I use

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.079
a lot in the, you know, sculpture. So, a lot
of the times, we see the ivy everywhere. It's

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.650
like it's covering up some horrible tar or
blemish on the building, but it's a good way

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:57.519
to, you know, also it kind of makes it look
more real with the ivy. So, once I started

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:04.299
painting, like I said, it took me three summers.
In the middle of the—-in 2006, we had the

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.700
floods. I don't know if any of you guys live
on the north shore, but we had massive floods

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.740
in all the rivers. And on my mural when--it's
right, probably, a hundred feet from the river's

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.620
edge--the idea of the mural is there's a river
walk with a nice little bridge over the Ipswich

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.699
River and the mural is the centerpiece on
the other side. Well, the water went up to

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:29.280
six feet on my mural almost, so, pretty much
up to the necks of my people, so I had to

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.590
repaint everything, because I hadn't sealed
it yet. I was only, like, in the middle of

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.610
it. So, you know, I still hadn't finished
it, so I didn't put any, you know, protective

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.240
coating on or anything. So I had to go and
paint that all over again. But, you know.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.819
That's quite a--well, it was the--I'm so much
faster at painting now from doing such a large

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:53.720
project. This was by far the largest mural
I've ever done to date, and you just get really

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.860
fast at it. I mean, my arm was like this one's
gigantic and this one was like skinny and,

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:04.639
you know, this one's like a tyrannosaurus
rex. But, you know, it's tiring though, you

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.360
know, so I finally, like, learned to paint
with my left hand even. I would paint, when

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.000
I had a big color field, you know, I figured,
you know, [INDISTINCT], because it's really

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.330
large. The pictures, you know, the things,
the spaces in between things, they're a lot

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.810
larger than you think. Like, I spent a whole
day painting a pillar, you know, like, just

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.330
because, you know, just even doing the primer
was--it was quite a task 'cause I had to--I

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.699
mean, you can see the edges are very detailed
and everything and because I kept the natural

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:33.950
grid showing through. So, I had to do that
with the primer, paint it exactly in the shape.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.509
And, you know, you get lost in there in the
grid, you know. I've numbered it and lettered

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:42.750
it, so I'm, like, I'm at, you know, 64, you
know, H, hopefully, you know, I think, you

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.160
know, [INDISTINCT] where I've gone one down
by accident and then, you know, one of the

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.370
guys, you know, he cut up a foot out of his
legs. But I have an assistant working with

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.690
me and he helped a lot. He was an arts student.
And they gave me this big crane. It was the

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.611
greatest thing. I looked like a cherry picker.
And I could sit in the middle of the mural

00:05:59.611 --> 00:06:03.720
and almost get to the whole mural from this
thing, but, you know, I'd be up there painting

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:11.659
and you lose track of time. And, you know,
when you paint--that's my lawyer, I'm not

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:15.349
here. But I was, you know, I was 30 feet in
the air and, you know, I dropped my paint

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:20.370
brush, it goes, you know. Plus, they were
building the river walk while I was painting

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.370
this whole thing, so I had a cement truck
behind me some days. I mean, one day, I'm

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.340
sitting there and he's sitting right next
to me. I mean, if you've ever been next to

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.349
a cement truck, it's deafening. I couldn't
hear the radio next to me on the scaffold.

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:34.750
I go down to the guy. He's not doing anything.
I told him, "What are you doing?" He's, like,

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.289
"Well, I was just watching you paint." I'm,
like, "Can you park the truck over here and

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:44.889
then sit and watch me, you know?" But, you
know--and it was fun. As the river walk started

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:49.229
to be built, I get the same kind of, you know,
what I call my customers going by everyday,

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:54.479
you know, the people of Ipswich doing their
jogs or walking their babies. And, you know,

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:59.610
I used a lot of them as my models, so, every
model in the mural is either a family member

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:05.509
of mine because I don't have to ask permission,
I just put them in, and the EBSCO employees

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:11.069
or Ipswich townies, and I did that on purpose.
I tried to like I have--in the strike scene,

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:13.671
there's three cops and they're all really
Ipswich cops, but you know, they're really

00:07:13.671 --> 00:07:17.900
dressed in the times, so, you know, they had
people getting a kick out of it and kind of

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.650
have a personal attachment to the mural. There's
over a hundred and twelve different portraits

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.189
I did. And if you don't use real people, it
looks real fake. It looks like comic book

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:31.389
art, you know, kind of--not comic book, but,
you know, the faces start to all look sort

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:36.970
of the same if you don't use real models.
It makes it more authentic. What's that, Eric?

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:43.580
Yes, actually, I did. You know, I had a lot
of baby kids in strollers going by. So, if

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:48.520
you notice on the mural, all the cats are
kind of at that lower level so that when they're

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.720
strolling along, kids who aren't interested
in history, there are at least--there's like

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.780
26 cats in there or something, so, you can
count the cats if you want. Guess, you're

00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:02.110
probably looking at a nice picture of Lucy
or Otis who are very--and theme-wise I did,

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:09.289
you can see the seasons change as I went through,
and so it could kind of give you Ipswich in

00:08:09.289 --> 00:08:16.500
every season. And the sculpture represents
the wildlife around Ipswich and stuff, which

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:21.370
has changed a lot over the years. Back in
the day, there used to be timber wolves running

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:25.600
around and bears and, you know, but since
we've been built up, of course, those animals

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.449
aren't there anymore. I'll give you a little
update about the history of Ipswich. The reason

00:08:30.449 --> 00:08:36.350
why we chose, you know, Ipswich is one of
the oldest towns. It's only a few years older

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:40.530
than Plymouth. In fact, even the—when they
were on the Mayflower, they sat out in front

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:46.720
of the Cape and they're, like, "Well, where
shall we land?" you know. And by that time,

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:53.710
a disease had knocked off about 90 percent
of the Indian population and that's why the

00:08:53.710 --> 00:09:01.060
English were able to land without very much
trouble, because they were empty. You know,

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:06.920
Agawam, which was Ipswich, had 3,000 people
in it before the disease, and by the end of

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.800
the disease they had around 400 villagers.
So, they really, you know, there were eradicated

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.500
towns and Clement is actually an Indian town
called Pawtuxet that was just completely--a

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:20.500
hundred percent of people died there. You
know, they had these fields already plowed

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:24.830
because these were agricultural people, they
grew corn. And, I think, a lot of people think

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:29.350
the Indians around here were nomadic because
they would move in the summer--they lived

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:33.480
on the beaches in the summer and then the
woods in the winter because for the warmth

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.220
of the trees and whatnot. It's a lot like
us now because people have the beach house.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:43.600
You know, it's the same thing. So, Agawam
was ruled by Maskanamet [ph], and the Indians

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:50.330
have been living in this area for about 11,000
years. The oldest artifacts found in New England,

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:54.720
for Paleo-Indians is actually from Ipswich
there in a place called Bolbrook (ph). I mean,

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:59.820
this was just after the glaciers had left
and the coast was a lot close, like, in by

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:04.870
another 10 miles. There was a big, huge fishing
hole [INDISTINCT] they found hundreds of these

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.590
Paleo arrowheads, which, you know, the next
oldest, you have to go to South America so.

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:15.690
People have loved this place of Ipswich for
such a long time. That's what's funny. You

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:20.730
know, the English in American history, theirs
is only a few hundred years old. They just

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:31.120
have their 375th anniversary of the town last
weekend. And if you go to page 10, you can

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:39.690
the mural image of the town, old Agawa. Now,
Agawam, [INDISTINCT] territory is pretty much

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:46.090
Essex County. It's the same shape, the same
borders, except at Salem and–-because Salem

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:50.880
was a different Sagamore territory. But the
rest of Essex County was Agawam. And when

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:56.060
they bought Ipswich, Ipswich was that whole
territory. And now there's, you know, Topfield,

00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:03.141
Middleton, Andover are now all split off from
Ipswich. But Agawam the village was the town

00:11:03.141 --> 00:11:07.080
of Ipswich, sort of like the capital of Agawam
was Agawam City sort of like, think of it

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:12.570
that way, and, mainly, because the river ran
through there and the woods were like a wilderness.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:18.040
There was Indian paths, but--like they still
use today where 1A was an old Indian path

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.130
that they just kept widening and widening
and widening, but that's been a road ever

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:26.240
since, you know, for thousands of years, that
was then the coastal road. And-–but, mostly,

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.020
they used the rivers as their transportation.
Same with the English did, too. They didn't

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:35.420
have horses here on a regular basis until
into the 1700s. So, they basically took a

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:42.190
boat or walked for the longest time. And,
like I said, the disease came and pretty much

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:50.100
wiped Agawam, and they kind of moved their
community down into Essex, which was part

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:55.090
of Ipswich for the longest time. They didn't
break off until the 1720s. But when Winthrop,

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:59.210
John Winthrop, governor of Massachusetts Bay
Colony first came, he meets with Maskanamet

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:05.040
[(ph)] on his boat, and it's probably with
the early part of dealing with--buying the

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:13.670
land of Ipswich. In 1634, they made the deal
and they bought the--they bought Agawam and

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:17.690
that's when they first started calling it
Ipswich. And then Newbury came the year after

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:24.520
that. And if you go to page 14, you can see
how old Agawam looked. And the great thing

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:31.340
about this is it's still a lot a park land.
So, on that page that's where the chief lived

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:35.120
on that beautiful island that's kind of in
the haze in the background. And I painted

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:41.250
that as well. This book I did many illustrations
and paintings for it. I did the maps. I did

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:48.360
the graphic design and I wrote it, so it's
a one-man band sort of thing. So, I like to

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:57.150
think of it as like Bowie's Diamond Dogs album.
There are Bowie fans out there. OK. Now, this

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:02.160
book is like my masterpiece because I really
did--they were going to have someone else

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.170
write it and I said, "Hey, let me try it.
I just researched this town for the last two

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:11.060
and a half years, you know. And, you know,
so it's all in my mind. And I looked at the

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:15.020
town, when I walk through the streets, I see
the past. You know, I can see-–it's great

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:19.880
because they were very poor during the revolutionary
era so people didn't rebuild all the houses.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:24.240
So there's a ton of old--most in the county
of these first period houses, so you can go

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.940
there and a lot of the streets, it doesn't
really look that different if you take the

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:37.010
power lines down, you know. It's the beautiful
thing about Ipswich. So, by the time the English

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:43.580
got here, like I said, it was very few Indians
left, and Maskanamet (ph) sold the land. He

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:47.400
actually still lived here, though. And the
rulers back then were like--the Indians were

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:53.600
allowed to still hunt on the land that they
sold so there was no real friction between

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.420
the Native Americans who lived right in this
area. And if you read old books, they always

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:01.220
say, "Our Indians," and then "The Indians."
The "Our Indians" were the ones that actually

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:05.660
lived with them. The Indians they had trouble
with were like the New Yorkers. The Boston

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:10.110
against the New Yorkers has been going on
for thousands of years. The Iriquoi against

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:18.550
the Algonquin. They were [INDISTINCT] till
recently. That's a funny comment I've made.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.890
One of my Indians is Johnny Damon (ph). If
you look close at the mural, he's the guy

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:25.800
right in the corner next to the pillar, it's
Johnny Damon (ph) because he looks sort like

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:30.380
a Native American to me. I'm sure he like
Italian or something, but that was before

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:35.760
he defected. You know, his hair is long, I
had no idea he was going to quit the team.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:42.420
But if you go to page 58, I did an illustration
of Ipswich in the 1650s. And you can kind

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:49.270
of see what kind of a little town it was.
And I took a map from 1915, and I have old

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:54.020
maps that are hand-drawn and things and tells
me all the locks and stuff. And the great

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:58.860
thing is, you can look at this overhead view
of the modern map, there's actually still

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:04.730
several of the houses still existing from
this era, but also the plots have only been

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:09.570
split or quartered, you know, but they're
still the same land plots that were originally

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:13.730
divvied out by the governor's son who was
the founder of Ipswich, John Winthrop, Jr.

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:22.220
And the governor himself went to Ipswich's
first year [INDISTINCT] his son had his grandson,

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:27.440
so the governor walked from Boston to Ipswich
because, of course, there was no-–he didn't

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.570
have any horses, so he walked. You know, when
I was trying to get the governor to come to

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:34.610
the thing this weekend, I said, "I'm telling
you, you could take a car, the first governor

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:42.410
walked here." You know, it didn't work though.
He didn't come. All right, Ipswich has a reputation

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:45.870
they like to brag about called "The Birth
of American Independence." And the reason

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:52.470
why they say they that is in 1660, a bunch
of the town members had a meeting before they

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:57.480
got this new tax levy--this was almost a hundred
years before the revolution--and they didn't

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.600
like it. Ipswich was one of the most prosperous
towns. They had the only other courthouse

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:07.680
besides Boston and jailhouse. And so they
were like at, in their heyday in the early

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:19.570
1700s and 1600s. So, when they--it was 1698-–'89
rather, sorry, losing my memory. They had--they

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:24.860
signed a petition to the king telling him
that they didn't want to pay this tax, said,

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:29.720
you know, what basically happened was in England,
they had the fire that burned down all of

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:34.110
London and they just for 60 years just left
the colonies on their own and didn't really

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:40.320
bother them and just let them do their thing.
And so for almost three generations, they--clearing

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:44.720
land and making roads and building houses
and then, you know, Charles II comes in and

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.260
says, "Now, I'd like to have a quarter of
all the money you make, just send it on back

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:54.450
because you're English servants." And the
Americans, very independent, they were already

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:59.100
voting for their own magistrates and stuff,
which was not typically English, but John

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:04.010
Winthrop learned early on that all these guys
who are risking their whole lives to live

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:08.660
in the wilderness being given their way, they
got pretty upset. So they started taking the,

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.669
you know, advice of the freemen. That's what
they call them. You signed an oath and that

00:17:12.669 --> 00:17:18.760
made you a freeman and you're going to have
a vote, the first democratic voting in the

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:25.610
area. So, after the king got the petition,
he sent Andros (ph) down. He had him take

00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:32.409
over the whole New England. They threw out
the Charter, which they had since they landed,

00:17:32.409 --> 00:17:37.279
and arrested all the people from Ipswich who
were involved in it, but it's—-so it was

00:17:37.279 --> 00:17:43.850
like all the selectmen, all the freeman, the
preachers, all the main important men of the

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:47.450
town were arrested and had to go before the
king and write an apology. And they all did

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:53.140
but Sam Appleton, who was 68 at that time
and he refused to do it and he was jailed

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:59.470
until Andros (ph) was finally thrown out and
then William and Mary took over. In England,

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:03.590
there was a new government, so they stopped
chasing after their colonies for a little

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:10.000
while until before the revolution when they
started doing it again and the whole country

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:17.639
got involved. I have another good story that
I want share with you. Abolition and the anti-slavery

00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:22.740
was started early in Massachusetts. And I
think sometimes people think Boston is very

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:27.700
racist. We get that kind of a bad rap about
that sometimes, but some of the earliest things,

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:31.909
it's the first free state. When John Adams
wrote the Massachusetts Constitution, which

00:18:31.909 --> 00:18:37.080
was the U.S. Constitution, a lot of it was
based on it, he said all men were born free.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:44.279
And then in that time as of 1780, a lot of
people—-slaves sued the government. If you

00:18:44.279 --> 00:18:52.020
go to page 86, this is a centerpiece of the
mural. I'm sorry, yes, page 86. You can see

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:56.620
that woman in red getting paid by the man
in green there, that's John Appleton, and

00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:01.549
that's Jenny Slew. 1780 she sues at the court
in Ipswich for her freedom. She said, "Well,

00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:07.750
my mom was a slave, but I was just born in
America. So, I'm not a slave according to

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.889
the constitution of Massachusetts." Well,
the Ipswich court didn't want anything to

00:19:09.889 --> 00:19:12.940
do with that. They sent it up to the higher
court in Boston and she actually won. They

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:18.549
guy had to pay for her self and for the work
that she'd already done for him, so. And that

00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:22.820
was 1780. It's pretty amazing. And the guy
in the green coat is my father. Thank you

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.039
very much.
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]

00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:33.899
&gt;&gt; PEARSALL: Yeah, I could make him a slave
owner and he's not going to get mad at me.

00:19:33.899 --> 00:19:40.190
So after the revolution, Ipswich, of course,
had a lot of men in the revolution. And after

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:44.679
the revolution, Washington visited Ipswich
in a kind of a thank you tour he did of New

00:19:44.679 --> 00:19:50.879
England to—-and, but after that, when by
the time Jefferson was President, Ipswich

00:19:50.879 --> 00:19:57.009
was on a decline in a lot of the industry
which from the—-the war of 1812 they blockaded

00:19:57.009 --> 00:20:00.660
the shipping which was Ipswich's main thing.
They hated Jefferson in Ipswich. He was not

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:08.299
their favorite guy. So Ipswich had to change
businesses. And then by the early 19th century,

00:20:08.299 --> 00:20:12.399
they started doing cotton, and then using
mills, cotton mills, and that's when the great

00:20:12.399 --> 00:20:16.169
mills were built there. If you go to page
116, you can see the first mills were made

00:20:16.169 --> 00:20:24.000
of stone and, eventually, were rebuilt into
the mills that I painted the mural on--they—-in

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.580
1826, but they started out with cotton. And,
again, the Abolitionist movement was strong

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:32.840
in Ipswich, especially in the Methodist Church.
The church split in half, so then the Methodists

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:37.279
had two churches because one-half didn't want
to deal with it because a lot of their people

00:20:37.279 --> 00:20:42.990
worked for the cotton mills. And this is when
the first immigrants started coming in. These

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:48.720
were Irish, mostly Irish, Scottish, and English
immigrants. And then the town was about 20

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:56.509
percent--I mean, 17 to 20 percent immigrants,
as the mills grew. And the owner of the mills

00:20:56.509 --> 00:21:00.820
was Ambrose Lawrence (ph). He's the guy who
built the brick mills, and replaced the old

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:04.870
cotton mills and they got into more hosiery.
They did socks for the Civil War and things

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:10.940
like that, and the long underwear, things
like that. And he is an interesting character

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:16.130
because, you know, the name Lawrence, you
probably recognize it. The town of Lawrence

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:21.279
in Massachusetts is named after his dad who
did shoes there and had some, you know, the

00:21:21.279 --> 00:21:25.450
factories along the river there at the Merrimack.
And along the Ipswich River, they worked on

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:32.630
stockings and cotton socks. And he is named
for the Kansas—-Lawrence, Kansas. And the

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:38.629
college down there is also named for him because
he spent a lot of money at the time when he

00:21:38.629 --> 00:21:43.659
was building his mills, they were having a—-this
is the precursor to the revolution, this was—-they

00:21:43.659 --> 00:21:48.389
were deciding whether it going to be a free
slave state, so people on both sides were

00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:51.749
giving money to them and he's—-that's why
they named Lawrence, Kansas. He gave them

00:21:51.749 --> 00:21:55.420
so much money to—-that was his—-sort of
his settlement. And he's also of the guys

00:21:55.420 --> 00:22:00.759
that financed John Brown. Meanwhile, he has
a mill that uses cotton. So, he's an interesting

00:22:00.759 --> 00:22:06.320
character because he knew of—-he abolished
slavery, his cotton prices go way up. So he

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:10.169
must have been a pretty interesting guy, you
know, knowing that that was going to hurt

00:22:10.169 --> 00:22:15.659
his business, but the morality of it made
him of course to still be one of, you know,

00:22:15.659 --> 00:22:26.340
pretty important abolitionists of his time.
All right. Let's fast-forward to 1911. If

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:33.409
you turn to page 154, there was a mill strike
in Ipswich. Now, this is—-by this time they're

00:22:33.409 --> 00:22:39.649
the greatest hosiery producer in the world,
stockings, you know, back in the day with

00:22:39.649 --> 00:22:47.769
the line, you know, down the back. And by
this time a lot of new immigrants had come,

00:22:47.769 --> 00:22:52.510
a new wave of immigrants. And these were Italian,
Greek, more of the Slavic immigrants, but

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:58.610
still more Irish. And the reason why the strike
came about--this followed closely to a strike

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:03.821
in Lawrence where they—-it was the immigrants
against the, you know, the newcomers, if you

00:23:03.821 --> 00:23:09.779
will, against the Yankees as they called the
Americans. They were paid differently. They

00:23:09.779 --> 00:23:14.159
were paid about almost half as much as the
Americans doing the same job. And the strike--believe

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:18.299
it or not, they weren't asking for equal pay.
They said, "Can we just make a little bit

00:23:18.299 --> 00:23:23.049
more? Like, can we make, you know, three quarters
of what they make?" So it's even when you

00:23:23.049 --> 00:23:28.840
think about it, it's crazy, but they weren't
even asking for the whole thing. So, and in

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:33.550
kind of a stupid move, the mill hired a lot
of the American employees there to be strike

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:38.879
guards. So there—-it's like they have a
vested interest in—-they didn't like, they

00:23:38.879 --> 00:23:42.950
were paid fine. They didn't even—-didn't
support the foreign-born people. And by now

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:47.230
Ipswich was almost 40 percent foreigners now,
so. Well, they weren't foreigner anymore.

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:51.570
They lived there, but that's the way they
looked at it. And there was a real difference

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:55.369
between rich and poor there. Like, along the
beaches now, that's now the big mansions were

00:23:55.369 --> 00:24:00.380
being built and the money--money who--from
making the money at the mills, the top hats,

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:03.499
you know, is building all these mansions.
Meanwhile, they had mill town where the mill

00:24:03.499 --> 00:24:07.830
actually built there whole city. There's all
these little houses now and it still exist

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:11.799
now in Ipswich where--you know, they were
called Mill Towns where all the new people

00:24:11.799 --> 00:24:20.490
would live. And so when they had the mill
strike, they—-one night things got out of

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:25.480
hand and, you know, a woman got shot and killed.
She didn't even work at the mill. She worked

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.820
at in another factory down the road, but heard
all the commotion and wanted to see what was

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:34.240
going on and a stray policeman's bullet hit
her--hit her and killed her. So, it was a

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:39.740
pretty serious deal. And in the end, the mill--the
strike went on even after that. There was

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:47.160
a trial and the strikers were found innocent
because it was a policeman who actually killed

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:53.460
the woman. And--but the last straw, end of
September, the management says to the guys,

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:58.470
get back on the line or you're all fired.
And they still didn't. And a hundred families

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:02.240
were not only fired, he threw them out of
Mill Town, too. So you got fired and they

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:07.230
took your house away. So it was a pretty,
you know, that was back when, you know, management

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:13.980
had all the cards, I guess. So, it was a pretty
serious thing back in the day. All right.

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:23.149
After the mill closed in '26, it eventually
was Sylvania. And then during World War II,

00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:28.129
they made the proximity fuse which is the
second most secretive project next to the

00:25:28.129 --> 00:25:35.460
atom bomb. And, you know, they said the conveyor
belts never stopped except for one time when

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:39.600
they announced that D-Day was happening because
you know, all these women working on the line—-it

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:43.070
was mostly, almost all women because the parts
were really small, it was easier for them

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:47.779
with smaller hands. But also the men were,
out of the 4,000 people in Ipswich, a thousand

00:25:47.779 --> 00:25:52.510
went off to war. I mean, that shows you--I
mean, it changes the whole color of the town.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:56.450
But they say—-that's what they said, the
only time the conveyor ever stopped is when

00:25:56.450 --> 00:26:01.269
they announced that 'cause the women got,
you know, worried about their sons and, you

00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:08.700
know, nephews, and husbands over in the war.
And now, today, Ipswich is a wonderful place

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:17.589
to visit. So, that's about it. Is there any
question anybody might have?

00:26:17.589 --> 00:26:22.330
&gt;&gt; [INDISITINCT]
&gt;&gt; PEARSALL: Oh, right, I'm sorry I forgot

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.340
about that.
&gt;&gt; Hello?

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:28.570
&gt;&gt; So when the mills left in the 1920s, where
did they go?

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:31.580
&gt;&gt; PEARSALL: With who?
&gt;&gt; When the mills--when the mill closed in

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:35.649
1920, where did that business go?
&gt;&gt; PEARSALL: The mills just kind of lay dormant

00:26:35.649 --> 00:26:40.360
there. Where did they start doing hosiery
and stuff? I think a lot of it went over to

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:44.440
Slavic countries. That's where they sold all
their equipment, was to these places in Russia

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:49.720
and stuff. But the mills lay dormant until
Slovenia in 1940s like another--they were

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:55.600
probably empty for like ten years until when
Sylvania took over. And, now, those are the

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.679
buildings that EBSCO house and the guys who
published my book and who would--the mural

00:26:59.679 --> 00:27:04.130
is actually on that building so. But that
place was always a hopping place for business

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:11.049
even back in the day when the Grist--Town
Grist Mill (ph) was there and each generation,

00:27:11.049 --> 00:27:26.370
the new, you know, the water power for the
water power. Yes?

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:30.369
&gt;&gt; So, the mural includes that picture we
saw earlier, plus two other sides of it?

00:27:30.369 --> 00:27:35.340
&gt;&gt; PEARSALL: That's--yes, that is just a way
to that this, you know, this side of tower

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:39.539
and this is the front of the tower and this
is the flipside. And also, if you look at

00:27:39.539 --> 00:27:45.890
some of these last pictures, this is like
in this, but these windows after I did the

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:50.989
whole mural, they wanted me to do a little
bit more, so, like this is like the west side

00:27:50.989 --> 00:27:55.029
of the mural. I can see the last side of the
tower, and then these little windows. And

00:27:55.029 --> 00:28:01.850
the two statues were something I added on
later. and those represent the mill site history

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:07.860
more specifically just to that site and for
EBSCO and, you know, the different, like I

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:15.139
said, Sylvania and some other places.
&gt;&gt; Having dealt with--well, having visited

00:28:15.139 --> 00:28:21.549
regularly Temple Square and BTA station with
its now kind of decrepit musical artwork,

00:28:21.549 --> 00:28:27.500
how does maintenance work? Do they have photographs,
so they can touch it up, or have you touch

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.190
it up?
&gt;&gt; PEARSALL: I touch my own stuff up whenever

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:34.769
I can because it's like my baby when I go
there. I don't want some other artists, you

00:28:34.769 --> 00:28:35.769
know...
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]

00:28:35.769 --> 00:28:41.200
&gt;&gt; ...putting diapers on like, you know, Michaelangelo
or whatever. And, you know, I do a lot of

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:47.280
odes to my heroes, that road to the river,
I got one of those in there and, you know,

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:52.169
Heironymous Bosch, one of my themes looks
sort of like one of his paintings. And I put

00:28:52.169 --> 00:28:58.450
Diego Rivera in the murals because he's my
hero. But I have--what I do at the end is

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:03.549
I coat it with an acrylic that was basically
the same consistently as the acrylic paint,

00:29:03.549 --> 00:29:10.980
just no pigment. And then I do a graffiti
coat, which is removable varnish. So, the

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:14.639
idea is that the paint sits on that varnish,
you wipe it off. But I found on the brick,

00:29:14.639 --> 00:29:19.269
I just have to paint it over because it's
so porous, like I've done eleven murals in

00:29:19.269 --> 00:29:24.010
Havril ((ph)) too, and those were all on boards
and that's--it works great on that. But I

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:31.630
haven't--this is the only mural I've had any
graffiti on. There's this one guy who made

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:36.923
a giant tag on it like whoever GQA is, I'd
like to punch him in the face, but, no, he

00:29:36.923 --> 00:29:40.139
does it in the school bathrooms, too, so they
know when the kid is around, you know. I said,

00:29:40.139 --> 00:29:45.440
"Whoever gets that kid, just give me his address."
But, you know, and like I said so some one

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:49.080
time, someone put Hitler mustaches on all
the main characters in the front, I had to

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:52.230
go in and, I don't know what you call this
little thing between your nose and your lip,

00:29:52.230 --> 00:30:00.149
but I had to repaint those in on [INDISTINCT].
Yes, the Hitler mustache on Washington, I

00:30:00.149 --> 00:30:08.230
mean, that is just, almost--that's sacrilegious
and so wrong in so many different levels.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:16.850
It's sad, you know. EBSCO is giving me a ton
of work, so, I don't, you know, it hasn't

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:22.720
been that, like I said, it happens very rarely
and for them I just do it because, you know,

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:27.899
they published a book of mine, and, you know,
I actually went eight months over the time,

00:30:27.899 --> 00:30:32.059
I said that was going to save me and he just
kept paying my pay check instead of this thing.

00:30:32.059 --> 00:30:37.869
So Tim has been really great. And he was into
that, the mill strike scene that the boss

00:30:37.869 --> 00:30:44.840
is in there. He didn't want to be in the mural,
but I have to go, [INDISTINCT]. It's kind

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:49.440
of like Hitchcock; I stick myself in there
in the distance somewhere. This one it was

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:53.669
hard. Like, you could probably see in the
back, there's a page with all the little squares,

00:30:53.669 --> 00:30:57.950
that's all the different models who I used
and you'll notice there's a lot of Pearsalls.

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:05.299
Those are my family. So I'd have to take a
picture of them and a lot of people I used

00:31:05.299 --> 00:31:09.580
who just walked by, my chief Maskanamet was
this guy who worked at the catering place.

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:15.789
And he just walked by everyday, and I hated
the face I used and finally I just asked him,

00:31:15.789 --> 00:31:19.580
you know, it's kind of weird like, I said,
"Can I take a picture of you?" you know. You

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:24.880
know, a big manly guy [INDISTINCT] thinks
I'm crazy. So, like, you know, I had to be

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:28.940
careful how I asked, but, you know, most people
enjoy it and like to be in it. So, one woman

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:37.250
offered me a thousand dollars to be in the
mural, but I can't [INDISTINCT]. I sort of

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:40.460
feel like it's like you're casting for a movie,
you know. That's the way I look at it, so,

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:44.470
I knew like a friend, oh he would be perfect
for this part, you know. It's kind of like

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:52.269
that, you know. Like one of these giant statues,
it's my brother Ross, 16 feet high, you know,

00:31:52.269 --> 00:31:55.730
[INDISTICT].
&gt;&gt; So, who did you use for the models for

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:58.260
the Fenway mural?
&gt;&gt; PEARSALL: Well, most of the Fenway people

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:03.840
are famous people. So, it's like Tom Brady
(ph) and [INDISTINCT]. I put, you know, Phil

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:10.999
Wheatley I think and--I get a lot of them
in there so. Yeah, [INDISTINCT] born in Somerville.

00:32:10.999 --> 00:32:21.399
I think Diana Ross is in there, people who
were born in and around Boston or have good

00:32:21.399 --> 00:32:26.590
Boston roots [INDISTINCT]. But mostly now
I do historical murals. Because this mural,

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:31.789
it's got me a lot of work doing that and it's--they're
nice because you get in the paper. You know,

00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:37.210
it's a community type thing. And I do a lot
with the schools where I'll go in and paint

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:40.650
with the kids and like they help me paint
a big mural. And it's, you know, it's fun

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:47.220
because they can go back out and see it in
public. We did one on this restaurant with

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:50.389
a boxing theme and on the ropes I put the
little kids' names, you know, so, they can

00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:54.380
go out and see this, you know, this real piece
of, you know, it's public art, it's so cool

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:57.360
or something. It's given me a lot of opportunity,
and, hopefully, someone, another town will

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:08.279
have me do a book and I'd really enjoy the
writing of it as well. It's my first [INDISTINCT].

00:33:08.279 --> 00:33:11.780
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; PEARSALL: Right, see, that's what I think

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:16.059
is good, too, because it uses, this is good,
but that's a thing. I haven't really gotten

00:33:16.059 --> 00:33:21.330
that much. I've done probably 15 large murals
now in different places, a lot of them in

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:25.919
an office or lobby or something. But I don't
get a lot of stuff on the public [INDISTINCT]

00:33:25.919 --> 00:33:31.590
because I think the graffiti artists sort
of think of me as like a highly skilled graffiti

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:37.109
artist, you know. That why I'm always shocked
like "here you are trying to show off" when

00:33:37.109 --> 00:33:42.489
you're painting another piece of art work.
Like, it doesn't make any sense. What are

00:33:42.489 --> 00:33:47.659
you going to do? Stupid silly [INDISTINCT].
It's crazy. That stuff is so much harder than

00:33:47.659 --> 00:33:52.200
the paint to get off. It's like who knows
what that stuff is made of.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:56.460
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; PEARSALL: It's like, it fuses--right, if

00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:00.639
you don't get it the first day, it like fuses
and becomes part of the, you know, the structure,

00:34:00.639 --> 00:34:05.850
you know. It's like who knows what that stuff
is made of. I mean, it's like the Play Dough

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:11.300
of our era now. It's like pure chemicals.
&gt;&gt; I'm so wondering, you know, what would

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:21.490
be sort of like your dream project, like unlimited
funds, unlimited time, any place you could

00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:24.310
paint, where and...?
&gt;&gt; PEARSALL: Well, this was a dream project.

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:30.030
I mean, I was out on the river bank up on
this jack, I don't have to climb things, climbing

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:33.320
staging is one of the worst things I do in
the murals, like it tires me out so I can--it

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:38.030
makes me paint about tow hours less than a
day because I was climbing up and down. But

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:42.730
this was my best job so far. I mean, I don't
know what could make it better. I mean, [INDISTINCT],

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:48.179
but it was like--and the sea breeze out there,
I mean, it gets pretty hot, but once the sun

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:54.020
went over the edge of the building at about
one o'clock, painting for eight hours straight,

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:59.150
that was like Michaelangelo. It was the greatest
thing ever, you know. I guess my next project

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:05.290
is--I'm doing the Department of Revenue lobby
in the Hampshires, Concord New Hampshire.

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:08.310
So, it's a big kind of, love the wainscoting,
you know. I look really forward to it. It's

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:15.520
nice and big, you know, 700 square feet, but
compared to this one, this was 2700 square

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:20.510
feet. I mean, it's just, you know, it's amazing.
If you flip a few pages back on--let's see,

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:25.340
I'll give it to you. I just love the picture
over the mural with nothing on it on the wall

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:30.310
on page 188. You can see the wall before I
started and you can see what I mean with the

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:34.860
big black marks on it and, you know, how I
had to hide all that stuff. But that's, you

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:38.790
know, once I convinced them to let me do it,
I mean, I walk out there I'm, like, "Oh, my

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:44.800
God, now I got to do this thing?" you know.
Like I said, it's probably four times the

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:49.280
size of anything I did before that time. So
it was--but, you know, you plan it out, so,

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:56.650
you know, just like anything, just a big painting,
don't be scared. You know, just you use the

00:35:56.650 --> 00:36:00.680
same thing. I do an under-painting like all
in brown first just like I would paint a canvass

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:10.180
like Rembrandt. I follow the masters' suggestions,
so. But I like the writing aspect of it, too.

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:13.100
I mean, this was a great project because I
got to, you know, kind of flex all my creative

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:18.450
skills in one project, you know, and I really
enjoy history, too, so it's fun. I enjoyed

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:22.990
doing the research. Kind of a fun thing of
being an illustrator and a muralist is each

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:27.010
job, you get a different, you know, one week
I'm doing Fenway Park and then, you know,

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:30.870
something that's so totally, it just gives
you a good variety and, you know, that makes

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:41.550
it fun. All right, thanks for having me.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
