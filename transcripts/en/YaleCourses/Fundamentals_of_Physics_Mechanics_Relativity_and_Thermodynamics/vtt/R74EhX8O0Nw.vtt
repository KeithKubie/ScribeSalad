00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.010
If you've got a function f of x,

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.990
you know the value at some point and you wanted to go to the neighboring point

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.220
or distance delta x away you ask how much does the function change

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.930
and the answer it is the change in the function felt that f is the deliver to of

5
00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:23.610
the function at the starting point times the distance you move.

6
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.950
This is not any quality unless f happens to be a straight line.

7
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.310
It's an approximation and that our connections to this,

8
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.310
that's what all the dots mean.
Corrections are proportional,
the delta x squared,

9
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.010
x cubed and so on,
but if delta x is tiny,
this will do.
That's it.

10
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.240
But today we are going to move the whole work energy DRM and the law of

11
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:52.290
conservation of energy to two dimensions.
So when you go to two dimensions,

12
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.250
you've got to ask yourself,
what am I looking for?
Well,

13
00:00:56.251 --> 00:01:01.251
in the end I'm hoping I will get some relation like k one plus you one his kid

14
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:06.060
too,
plus you to assuming that there's no friction.

15
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.150
Youtube is going to be my new potential energy.

16
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.660
Then if it's a potential energy and the particles moving into two dimensions,

17
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.560
it's got to be a function of two variables,
x and y.

18
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.640
So I have to make sure that you guys know enough about functions of more than

19
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:24.474
one variable.

20
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.300
So this is again crash course on reminding you of the main points that are not

21
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:32.910
that many.
By the time I get here,
I'll be done.

22
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.670
So how do visualize the function of two variables function.
One variable,

23
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.750
you know you plot x this way in the function along why if it's two variables,

24
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.200
you products here and why here and the function itself is shown by drawing some

25
00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:51.210
surface on pop of the x,

26
00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:55.800
y plane so that if you take a point and you go right up until he hit the

27
00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:59.310
surface,
that's the value of the function at that point.
X,
Y,

28
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.890
it's like a canopy on top of the x,
y plane and how high you got to go.

29
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.830
It's the function.
For example,
starting with the floor,
I can ask her,

30
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.530
why do I have to go until I hit the ceiling?

31
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.660
That function varies that Benson Bimble dimples and was so on.

32
00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:20.400
So the function Betty's with x,
y now that example of a function of x and y,

33
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.021
x and y,

34
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:24.360
it could be coordinates in the United States and the function could be the

35
00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:27.570
temperature at that point.
So your product on top of that,

36
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.270
each point you plot the temperature at that point.

37
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.050
So once you got the notion of a function of two variables,

38
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.150
if you're going to do calculus,

39
00:02:36.151 --> 00:02:39.420
the next thing is what about the date of it is are the function,

40
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.500
how does it change?

41
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.040
But in the old days it was dependent on x and I changed the ex and I found the

42
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:51.810
change in the function divided by the change in accident took the limit and that

43
00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:56.310
became my dinner.
Now I was sitting in the x,

44
00:02:56.311 --> 00:03:00.730
y plane.
So he had this accent here.
This is why I'm here.

45
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.630
The function is coming out of the blackboard.
So imagine something measured out.

46
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:09.190
But I'm sitting here now I want to move and ask how the function changes.

47
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.060
But now I have a lot of options.
In fact,
I'm infinite number of options.

48
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:17.050
I can move along X.
I can move along.
Why I can load some intermediate angle.

49
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.390
Do you have to ask what do you want me to do when it comes to time to take

50
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:27.391
derivatives so it turns out and you will see it proven amply as we go along that

51
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:31.870
you just have to think about derivatives on two principle directions which I

52
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:33.100
will choose to be x and y.

53
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.170
So we're going to define one date of active which is defined as follows.

54
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.460
You start at the point x,

55
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:44.461
y you go to the point x plus Delta x same way and subtract the function at the

56
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:51.190
starting point.
They by Delta x and take all the limits.

57
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.150
Delta x goes to zero.
That means you go from here to here,

58
00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.300
you move a distance,
Delta x,
you'd find the change of the function.

59
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.730
You take the derivative as you move horizontally,

60
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.980
you notice you don't do anything to why,

61
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.040
why will be left fixed at whatever.
Why you had x will be changed by Delta x.

62
00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:12.751
You find the change,

63
00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:16.930
you take the debt of active and take the limit that has been altered by the

64
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:20.530
symbol,
the FDX.

65
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.480
So this curly d instead of the straight D is to tell you it's called a partial

66
00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:26.314
derivative.

67
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.820
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

68
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.320
<v 0>Some people may want to make it very explicit by saying this is the derivative</v>

69
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.400
with subscripted,
why that means why is being held constant,

70
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:40.234
but next is buried.

71
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.680
But we don't have to write that because we know we got to coordinates.

72
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.730
If I'm changing one,
the other guy,
his wife.
So we won't be one right that

73
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.360
that's the partial a little bit.
So you can also move from here to here,

74
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.770
up and down and see how the function changes.
So I won't write the details.

75
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.220
You can define obviously a DFD why.

76
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.740
So one tells you how the function changes with X.
I should move along.

77
00:05:09.741 --> 00:05:12.740
X other tells you how it changes it.
Why as you move along.
Why?

78
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.640
So let's get some practice.
So I'm going to write some function.

79
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.570
F equals x cubed y square.

80
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.110
That's a function of x and y.
You can write any.

81
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.990
Let's make a little more interesting.
Less why otherwise square.

82
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.290
That's some function of x and y.

83
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.100
So when I say the FDX,

84
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.100
the rule is find out how it varies with x keeping.
Why constant.

85
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.540
That means really treated like a constant.
Number five,
what will you do?

86
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.100
You have why was equal to five this will be 25 and it's not part of taking

87
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.750
derivatives because it's not changing.

88
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.750
And here it'll be just standing in front doing nothing.

89
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.260
We just take the [inaudible] treating Ysa construct.

90
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:02.280
You're supposed to do that here.
This is a bit of a two,
three x square.
Why?

91
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:03.530
So that's the extent of it too.

92
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.830
<v 2>Okay.</v>

93
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.240
<v 0>Maybe we can take the why part.
Why Square?
Yes,
thank you.</v>

94
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.490
Then I can take DFD why?
So then I look for wide changes.

95
00:06:15.491 --> 00:06:19.420
This is too wide here.
So two x cubed,

96
00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:21.940
y plus two y.

97
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.990
So that's the extent of it have been a partial white elevated.
Okay.

98
00:06:28.991 --> 00:06:32.200
So then you can now take higher derivatives.

99
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.800
We know that from Calculus at one variable you can take the derivative of the

100
00:06:35.801 --> 00:06:36.634
derivative.

101
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.910
So one thing you can think about is the two f the x square.

102
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.980
That really means take the d by the x off the d by Dx.

103
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.020
That's what it means.
First,

104
00:06:50.021 --> 00:06:52.360
take a deliberative and take the deliberative off the date of it.

105
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.650
So let's see what I get here.
I already took the FDX.

106
00:06:56.651 --> 00:07:01.000
I want to take that a bit too,
right?
That never would have x squared is two x.

107
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.180
So I get six x y square.

108
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.180
Then I can take the white delivered two of the white it.

109
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:16.350
You need to have the white square,
let's d by d y of DFT.

110
00:07:16.351 --> 00:07:18.270
Why?
If you take the white that ever lived there,

111
00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:22.800
you guys should keep an eye out for me when I do this,
I get this.

112
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.530
But now we have an interesting possibility you didn't have in one dimension,

113
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:35.370
which is to take the extent of it off the white end of it.

114
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.880
So I wanted to take d by d x off the FD.

115
00:07:42.041 --> 00:07:47.041
Why that is written as d two f the XD.

116
00:07:47.111 --> 00:07:49.630
Why?
Let's see what I get.

117
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.610
So I want the x derivative off the white end of it.

118
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:59.560
I go to this guy and take an extra two,
I get three x squared from there.

119
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.180
So I get six x squared y and that's it.

120
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.770
So it makes sure that the,
I got the proper x to have this.

121
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.380
I think that's fine.

122
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:19.700
Then I can also take d two f the YDX.

123
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:26.280
That means take the why derivative of the externalities.
Well,

124
00:08:26.281 --> 00:08:28.710
here's the extra derivative.
Take the way that they were with that,

125
00:08:28.711 --> 00:08:32.640
put it to why there and I get six x squared y.

126
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.360
So you're supposed to notice something.
If you wanted to know this,

127
00:08:41.361 --> 00:08:44.960
you're not surprise.
You have never seen this before.

128
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:49.990
You will notice that the cross derivative wife followed by x and x followed by

129
00:08:50.151 --> 00:08:52.610
why come up being equal.

130
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.810
That's a dental property of any reasonable function.
But it is never,

131
00:08:59.811 --> 00:09:03.900
I mean you cannot call the mathematician straight help because they will always

132
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.020
find something where this one work.
Okay?

133
00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:11.280
But if you write down any function that you are capable of writing down with

134
00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:14.040
powers of aix and power,
so why and science and coastlines,

135
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.330
it'll always be true that you can take the cross state over those in either

136
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.230
order,
we'd get the same answer.

137
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:25.110
I'd like to give you a little bit of a feeling for why that is true.
It's true,

138
00:09:25.111 --> 00:09:29.970
but it's helpful to know why it's true.
So let's ask the following question.

139
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:33.780
Let's take a function and

140
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.480
let's ask how much the function changes when I go from

141
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:46.200
some point x.
Y do another point.
X Plus Delta,

142
00:09:46.201 --> 00:09:48.630
x,
y Plus Delta.
Why

143
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.930
I wanted to find the change in the function.

144
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:53.980
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

145
00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:58.450
<v 0>so I'm asking you what is f of x Plus Delta x,</v>

146
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:03.670
y Plus Delta,
y minus F of x,

147
00:10:03.671 --> 00:10:08.440
Y for small values and Delta x and Delta y,
the neighboring points.

148
00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:12.700
What's the change?
So we are going to do it in two stages.

149
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.160
We introduced an intermediate point here who was coordinating this x Plus Delta,

150
00:10:18.161 --> 00:10:19.690
x and Y

151
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:26.060
and I'm going to add and subtract the value of the function here.

152
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.950
Adding,
subtracting is three.
It doesn't cost anything,
so let's do that.

153
00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.600
Then what do I get?
I get F of x Plus Delta,
x,
y Plus Delta,

154
00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:39.560
y minus F of x Plus Delta,
x,

155
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:44.240
y
plus

156
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:48.320
F of x Plus

157
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.720
Delta X.
Come on.
Y minus F of X.
Y.

158
00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:58.463
<v 2>Okay.</v>

159
00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.820
<v 0>I'm just saying the change of that guy might not.</v>

160
00:11:04.821 --> 00:11:08.430
This guy is the same as that minus this plus this minus that

161
00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.030
trivial substitution,

162
00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:15.530
but at write it this way because I look at the first entity here,

163
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.840
it looks like I'm just changing why I'm not changing x.

164
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.160
You agree?
So what will this be?

165
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:31.060
This is going to be the rate of change of the function with respect to x times

166
00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:37.290
delta x and this,
yeah,
I'm sorry I got it wrong,

167
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.540
but the Spec to y times Delta y,

168
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:51.200
this one is the f x times built a x for change in the function.

169
00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:55.870
If I add it all up,

170
00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:01.500
I get the FDX Delta x list,

171
00:12:02.571 --> 00:12:05.470
the FD.
Why Delta y,

172
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.760
what do you feel?
Pedantic,

173
00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:14.860
you will notice this is something had to be real careful about what do you think

174
00:12:14.861 --> 00:12:19.650
I'm referring to
in my notation?
Yes.

175
00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:23.010
<v 3>Uh,
meaning</v>

176
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.690
but

177
00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.460
<v 0>oh,
but this is nothing to do dimension.</v>

178
00:12:29.461 --> 00:12:31.380
You see it's one number minus another number.

179
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:37.250
I put another number in between and in this function it's a function only have

180
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:44.490
uh,
here,
let me see.
X is not changing at all in why it's changing.

181
00:12:44.491 --> 00:12:45.960
So it is DFD why Delta,

182
00:12:45.961 --> 00:12:50.961
why I meant something else that is in fact a good approximation.

183
00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:53.010
But that is one thing you should be careful about,

184
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.280
which has to do with where the debt of it.
Those are really taken

185
00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.310
for the term here.

186
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.090
X Plus Delta x minus y minus F of X.

187
00:13:03.091 --> 00:13:06.900
Y I took the deliberative at my starting point.
If you want,

188
00:13:06.901 --> 00:13:09.240
I will say that the starting point x,
y

189
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.800
the second one when I came here and I want to move up,

190
00:13:13.801 --> 00:13:17.370
I'm taking the derivative with respect to why are the new point,
the new point,

191
00:13:17.371 --> 00:13:21.750
it's an x plus Delta x.
Come on.
Why so ever?

192
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:23.820
It is or not quite taken at the same point.

193
00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:30.600
So you got to fix that.
And how do you fix that part?
You argue that,
well,

194
00:13:30.601 --> 00:13:34.470
the derivative with respect to why is just another function of y,

195
00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:36.563
<v 3>right?</v>

196
00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.740
<v 0>F as a function of why it's delivered as a function of x and y.</v>

197
00:13:39.741 --> 00:13:43.610
Everything is a function of x and y and we are saying this deliberate and it has

198
00:13:43.611 --> 00:13:46.880
been computed at x plus delta x instead of x.

199
00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:51.890
So it is going to be DFD why at x,

200
00:13:51.891 --> 00:13:56.891
y plus the two FDX The y times a delta x.

201
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.620
In other words I'm saying they did ever do,

202
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:08.240
but this location is to deliver to that location plus the rate of change of the

203
00:14:08.241 --> 00:14:09.910
derivative time to change next.

204
00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.590
Now there was the deliberative itself is changing.
So if you put that together,

205
00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:19.580
you find it is the FDX Delta x.

206
00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:25.760
Let's DFD why Delta y where'd if I don't put any bars at anything,

207
00:14:25.761 --> 00:14:27.260
it means at the starting point x,

208
00:14:27.261 --> 00:14:31.610
y Plus d to f the x,

209
00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.430
the y,
Delta x,

210
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:36.473
<v 3>Delta y.</v>

211
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:46.610
<v 0>Now you've got to realize that when you're doing this calculus problems,
Delta x,</v>

212
00:14:46.611 --> 00:14:50.690
it's a tiny number of Delta where it's a tiny number.
Delta x,
Delta y is tiny,

213
00:14:50.691 --> 00:14:53.660
tiny,
tiny,
so normally we don't care about it.

214
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.880
I'd be done if you want it to be more accurate.

215
00:14:55.881 --> 00:14:59.180
Of course you should keep that term in the first approximation,

216
00:14:59.181 --> 00:15:00.920
but he worked work the first part of everything.

217
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:05.510
This will be your Delta f but if a little more ambitious,

218
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.540
but you keep track of the fact that derivative itself is changing.

219
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:09.860
You will keep that term,

220
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:17.330
but now that person comes along and says,
you know what?
I wanted to go like this.

221
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:22.100
I want to introduce as my new point intermediate point.
The one here,

222
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.480
it has a different value of y in the same accent.
Then I went horizontally.

223
00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:28.100
Then I keep track of the changes.

224
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.930
What do you think that person will calculate for the change in the function?

225
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.710
That person will get exactly this part,

226
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.930
but the extra term that person will get will look like d two f,
D Why d?

227
00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.110
X,
Delta,
Y,
Delta x.

228
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.300
If you just do the whole thing in your head,

229
00:15:50.301 --> 00:15:53.240
you can see that I'm just exchanging the x and y roles,

230
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.400
so everything that happened with x and y here,

231
00:15:55.401 --> 00:15:57.260
we'll come backwards why you're next,

232
00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:01.160
but then the change between these two points that the change between these two

233
00:16:01.161 --> 00:16:01.551
points,

234
00:16:01.551 --> 00:16:05.540
then it doesn't matter whether they introduced an intermediate point here on an

235
00:16:05.541 --> 00:16:10.190
intermediate point there.
Therefore these changes have to be equal.
This part,

236
00:16:10.191 --> 00:16:14.390
if it's of course equal,
therefore you want that part to be equal.
Delta x,

237
00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:16.580
Delta y is clearly delta y,
Delta x.

238
00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.960
The consequence of that is need to FTX.

239
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:24.020
D Y is equal to d to f.
D why DX?

240
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.670
That's the reason it turns out when you take cross derivatives,

241
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:32.930
you get the same answer.
It comes from the fact.
If you say,

242
00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.220
where does that result coming from?

243
00:16:34.221 --> 00:16:38.780
It comes from the fact if you start at some point and you go to another point

244
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:40.730
and you asked for the change of the function,

245
00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.250
the changes accumulating as you move,

246
00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.250
you can move horizontally and vertically or we can move vertically and then

247
00:16:46.251 --> 00:16:49.150
horizontally the chain of the function is a change in the function.

248
00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:52.580
Got To get the same answer to both ways.
That's the reason.

249
00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.280
That's the requirement that leads to this requirement.

250
00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:01.370
No,
I will not be keeping track of functions to this accuracy.

251
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:06.110
In everything we do today we'll be keeping the leading powers in Delta x and

252
00:17:06.111 --> 00:17:11.111
Delta y so you should bear in mind that if you make a movement in the x,

253
00:17:11.241 --> 00:17:14.480
y plane,
which is delta x horizontally Delta,

254
00:17:14.481 --> 00:17:17.180
why vertically then the chain of the function

255
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:18.583
<v 3>is this</v>

256
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.860
<v 0>Dropbox it on debt because that's going to be,</v>

257
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:29.900
this is just the naive generalization to two dimensions of what you know.

258
00:17:29.901 --> 00:17:32.330
In one dimension you are saying,
look,

259
00:17:32.331 --> 00:17:35.930
the function is changing because the independent variables x and y are changing

260
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:40.700
and the change in the function is one part which I blame on the attending
accent.

261
00:17:40.701 --> 00:17:42.980
A second part with the blame on the changing.
Why an ad.

262
00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.570
So you're worried about the fact that we are moving in the plane and the
vectors,

263
00:17:47.571 --> 00:17:49.710
that's all correct.
But F is not a vector.

264
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:52.890
If it's just a number and it's changed has got two parts.

265
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:55.561
Okay.

266
00:17:55.561 --> 00:18:00.561
So this is the basically all the mat we will need to do what I want to do today.

267
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.300
So let's now go back to our original goal,

268
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:10.621
which was the,

269
00:18:10.621 --> 00:18:15.621
did I have something like the law of conservation of energy in two dimensions

270
00:18:16.021 --> 00:18:19.950
instead of one?
So you remember what I did last time?

271
00:18:19.951 --> 00:18:22.380
So I will remind you one more time what the trick was,

272
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:28.430
we found out that the change in the kinetic energy of some object is equal to

273
00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:33.790
the work done by a force some f times Delta X.

274
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:39.490
And then if you add all the changes or whatever,

275
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:41.820
not the infinitesimal displacement,

276
00:18:41.821 --> 00:18:46.050
but a macroscopic displacement that was given by f times DX.

277
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.560
And the FDA is dx from x one x two if f is a functional,

278
00:18:50.561 --> 00:18:54.510
only have x from the rules of calculus can be written as a difference of a

279
00:18:54.511 --> 00:18:59.511
function or this limit minus that limit and that was you have x one minus you

280
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.020
affects where you is.
That function.

281
00:19:04.021 --> 00:19:07.500
Who's is [inaudible] with a minus sign is f.

282
00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.970
That's what we did.
Then it's very simple.
Now to take the,

283
00:19:14.971 --> 00:19:16.440
you wanted the left hand side,

284
00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:22.160
let me see k one to the right hand side and you to the left hand side to get k

285
00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:25.500
two plus two is Kayvon plus you want it.
That's conservation of energy.

286
00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:31.330
You want to try the same thing in two dimensions.
That's your goal.

287
00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.960
So first question is what should I use for the work done?

288
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:44.560
What expression should I use for the work done in two dimensions?

289
00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.850
Because the force now is the vector forces,
not one number.

290
00:19:48.851 --> 00:19:50.470
It's got an ex parte and the white part.

291
00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:55.390
My displacement is also got an export in a white part and I can worry about what

292
00:19:55.391 --> 00:19:56.530
I should use.

293
00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:02.440
So I'm going to deduce the quantity I want to use for Delta w namely the tiny

294
00:20:02.441 --> 00:20:04.420
work done,
which is an extension of this.

295
00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.800
I'm going to demand that since I'm looking for a work energy Theorem,

296
00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:13.630
I'm going to demand that you remember it in one dimension.

297
00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:17.140
Delta,
k,
F Delta x.

298
00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.960
If we divide by the time over which this happens,

299
00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:24.880
I find DKD t is equal to force times velocity.

300
00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:30.880
I'm going to demand that.
That's the power for stem.

301
00:20:30.881 --> 00:20:33.040
For the last [inaudible] is what I call the power.

302
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:40.180
I'm going to look for dk d t in two dimensions of a body that's moving.

303
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:42.081
What's the day to day?

304
00:20:42.081 --> 00:20:44.710
What's going to dig into these changing when a body is moving for that,

305
00:20:44.711 --> 00:20:49.510
I need a formula for candidate energy formula for Kennedy Energy is going to be

306
00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:51.820
again,
one half Mv Square.

307
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.860
I want that to be the same entity.
So I will choose it to be that,

308
00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:02.190
but we square has got now we x squared plus y squared because you know whenever

309
00:21:03.491 --> 00:21:08.491
you take a vector d Dennis length is the square root of the next parts where it

310
00:21:10.901 --> 00:21:12.010
was a white patch where

311
00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:17.483
<v 3>any questions?</v>

312
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.210
<v 0>Okay,
so let's take the rate of change of this.</v>

313
00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:27.770
G K det again,
do you have to know your calculus?

314
00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:31.220
What's the time?
Did it have it to a VX square?

315
00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:37.400
Then the rule from is first take the database will be x squared with respect vx

316
00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:42.410
just to Vieques.
Then take the deliver to Vieques with respect of time.

317
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:47.630
So you do the same thing for the second term to be y,

318
00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:52.680
e y e d t and that gives me the tools.

319
00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:57.730
Cancel gives me M Dvx,

320
00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.410
v t times V,

321
00:22:00.411 --> 00:22:04.270
x plus m VB.
Why d?

322
00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.620
T t y.

323
00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.520
This is the rate at which the kinetic energy of a body's changing.

324
00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.630
So what's my next step?

325
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:20.463
<v 3>Yes,</v>

326
00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:25.300
<v 0>the half got canceled by the two here.</v>

327
00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:27.403
<v 3>Yes,</v>

328
00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:35.863
that's correct.

329
00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:40.360
<v 0>So what do we want to do is to recognize this,
this ama in the x direction,</v>

330
00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:44.460
because am times DVD,
t DVX,

331
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:47.650
dts Aix in this m times a y.

332
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:52.340
Therefore they're the forces in the x and y directions play,
right?
Fx,
VX,

333
00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:55.840
let's y fee.
Why?

334
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:58.423
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

335
00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:01.670
<v 0>so the power,
when you go to two dimensions,</v>

336
00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:04.850
not very different from one dimension.
In one dimension,

337
00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.390
you had only one force and you had only one velocity in two dimensions,

338
00:23:08.391 --> 00:23:11.840
you've got an x and y components for each one and it becomes this.

339
00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:18.200
So this is what I will define to be the power.

340
00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:23.120
When a body is moving and the forces acting on it,

341
00:23:23.121 --> 00:23:25.610
the forced us to components of velocity is two components.

342
00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:28.040
This combination shall be called power,

343
00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:35.280
but now let's multiply both sides by Delta t and write the change in kinetic

344
00:23:35.641 --> 00:23:37.630
energy is equal to ethics.

345
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:42.330
You guys think about what happens when I multiply the x by Delta.

346
00:23:42.331 --> 00:23:47.331
T VX is DXDT multi plank with Delta t just gives me the distance traveled and

347
00:23:49.191 --> 00:23:52.970
the aesthetician let's f y Times d y.

348
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:59.770
So this is the plenty I'm want to work done by a force and a generalizes.

349
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:07.630
What we had here were done is forced time to delta x in two dimensions is Fx d x

350
00:24:09.211 --> 00:24:11.930
plus y the y.
It's not a hard to guess that,

351
00:24:11.931 --> 00:24:15.620
but the beauty is this combination.
Now you can say,
you know what,

352
00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:16.900
I didn't have to do all this.

353
00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:20.480
I could have always guessed that in two dimensions when you had an x and a y,

354
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.860
you obviously got add.
No,

355
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:27.260
there's nothing very obvious about it because this combination is no guaranteed

356
00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:31.010
to have the property that if I call this the work done than it has.

357
00:24:31.011 --> 00:24:34.430
The advantage that the work done is in fact the chain than Kennedy.
Kennedy.

358
00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.770
I want to define work so that it's effect on kinetic energy is the same as in

359
00:24:39.771 --> 00:24:42.350
one B.
Namely work done should be equal.

360
00:24:42.351 --> 00:24:45.740
The change in Canada energy and the engineered that by taking the change and

361
00:24:45.741 --> 00:24:50.440
kinetic energy,
seeing whatever it came out to and calling that the work.
Now,

362
00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:51.590
I cannot go wrong,

363
00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:56.690
but nobody noticed something repeating itself all the time,

364
00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.420
which is that I had a vector ef,

365
00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:05.170
which again write this I times Fx plus j times f y I had a vector of velocity

366
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:10.700
which is I times VX plus j Times v y.

367
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:14.720
Then I had a tiny distance mode by the particle,

368
00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:18.880
which is eight times Dx plus j Times d y

369
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:23.300
the political moves from one point to another point.

370
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:27.020
The vector describing his location changes by this tiny vector.

371
00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.090
It is just the step in the x direction time,

372
00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:31.400
but a step in the way that extra times Jay,

373
00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.870
so what you're finding is the fallen combination,

374
00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:41.520
the excomm pointed at f times x component of V plus the white competitive f

375
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:46.570
names at white component of e r f component of x times the business moved in x

376
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.880
plus y competitive f times the displacement and why?

377
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:55.340
So we are running into the following combinations.

378
00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:01.310
We are saying that seemed to be in all these problems,
two vectors.

379
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:05.990
I times x this day at time.
Say why a,
for example,

380
00:26:05.991 --> 00:26:09.320
it could be the force that I'm talking about.
There's another vector B,

381
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:14.210
which is eight times bx plus deer times buy,

382
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:24.190
right?
For example,
this guy could be standing in port [inaudible].

383
00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.060
This could be standing in for the v.

384
00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:31.420
The combination that seems to appear very naturally is the combination a x,

385
00:26:33.111 --> 00:26:33.950
B,
x.

386
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:35.560
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

387
00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.860
<v 0>let's say B.
Why</v>

388
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:45.000
it appears to many times,
so I take it seriously.
Give that a name.

389
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:50.360
That name will be called the dot product of a B,

390
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.470
and this written like this.

391
00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:59.700
Whenever something appears all the time,
you give it a name.
This is a dot B,

392
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:05.970
so for any two vectors,
a and B,
that will be the definition of a dot.
B.

393
00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:11.240
Then the work done by a force F that displaces the particle by a tiny vector.

394
00:27:12.391 --> 00:27:14.200
D R is f.
Dot.
D

395
00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:20.790
particles moving in the x y plane from one incident at the next.

396
00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:24.360
It can move from here to there.

397
00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.340
That little guy is the Ar.

398
00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:31.140
It's got a little bit horizontal and has got a little bit vertical.

399
00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:35.820
That's why you build the are the force itself is some force,

400
00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.970
which at that point need not pointed.
The direction in which you're moving.

401
00:27:38.971 --> 00:27:43.260
It's some direction.
At each point,
the forest could have whatever value it likes.

402
00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.280
So the dark product,
you know,

403
00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:48.630
sometimes you learn the dark product as they expect me to say.

404
00:27:48.631 --> 00:27:51.540
Why be why you can ask who thought about it?

405
00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:53.810
Why is it an asset of quantity?

406
00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:57.780
So here's one way you can understand why somebody would think of this particular

407
00:27:57.781 --> 00:28:01.230
combination.
So once you've got the dot product,

408
00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:03.270
you got to get a feeling for what it is.

409
00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:08.490
First thing we realize is that if you take a dot product of a with itself,

410
00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:14.010
then there's a x x plus a y,
a y,
which is x squared plus a white square,

411
00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:16.020
which is the length of the vector a,

412
00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:20.520
which you can either do or this way I'll just write it without an arrow.

413
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:25.170
So a dollar a day is a positive number that measures the length squared of the

414
00:28:25.171 --> 00:28:29.400
victory.
Likewise B.
Dot.
B.
Now we have to ask ourselves,

415
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:30.540
what is a dot B?

416
00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:31.993
<v 2>Okay,</v>

417
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:40.060
<v 0>so somebody know what eight I'd be is.</v>

418
00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:42.813
<v 2>Yep.</v>

419
00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.610
<v 0>Okay,
so how do we know that?</v>

420
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.590
How do we know its length of eight times length of B times costs and of the

421
00:28:51.591 --> 00:28:54.650
angle you should follow from.
Is that an independent definition?

422
00:28:54.651 --> 00:28:56.060
Notice that a consequence of this?

423
00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.850
<v 2>Yup.
You're right.
Using the wrong person.</v>

424
00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:00.360
<v 0>Yes.</v>

425
00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:04.680
He said we can did bit using the law of course science and that's what I will
do.

426
00:29:04.681 --> 00:29:06.150
Now,
in other words,

427
00:29:06.151 --> 00:29:10.410
that definition would you may have learned about first is not independent of

428
00:29:10.411 --> 00:29:12.600
this definition.
It's a consequence of this definition.

429
00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:17.310
So let's see why that's true.
So let's draw two vectors here.

430
00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:22.150
Yeah.
This air
and hear this beat,

431
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.330
it's got a length air.

432
00:29:24.331 --> 00:29:29.331
It's got a link be this makes an angle data sub a with the x axis and that makes

433
00:29:30.331 --> 00:29:32.970
an angle.
Data's a B with the x axis.

434
00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.500
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

435
00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:39.940
<v 0>no.
Do you guys agree that the x component of a,</v>

436
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:45.630
what's the horizontal part of a just Aiko sign data times a,

437
00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.890
you must have seen lots of examples of that,

438
00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:52.910
but then you did all the fours calculation in a y is equal to the length of a

439
00:29:53.631 --> 00:29:57.730
time sign they disobey.
And likewise for B,
I don't feel like writing.

440
00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:01.120
If you do that then A.

441
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:06.120
Dot B will be length of a length of B times go sign up date and time,

442
00:30:07.191 --> 00:30:09.070
say course annotated times B,

443
00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:11.323
<v 3>uh,</v>

444
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:16.150
<v 0>plus sign data,
a sign and date of birth.</v>

445
00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:19.480
No.

446
00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:24.290
Have you got to go back to your good old trig and it'll tell you this cost cost

447
00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:27.000
plus sign sign is constipated a minus data B.

448
00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:33.080
So you find it has length a length of B [inaudible] of data a minus data B.

449
00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:40.580
Often people simply say that it's ab consigned data where it's understood that

450
00:30:40.651 --> 00:30:42.630
data is the angle between the two vectors.

451
00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:48.810
So the dot product that you learned,
you might,

452
00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:50.650
I don't know which way it was introduced to you first,

453
00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:56.230
but these are two equivalent definitions that dark product in one of them.

454
00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:00.070
If you're thinking more in terms of the components to be a pat of numbers for a

455
00:31:00.071 --> 00:31:04.090
and a pattern of numbers,
but B,
this definition of the dark product is very nice

456
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.130
if you're thinking of them as two little arrows pointing in different directions

457
00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.540
than the other definition in which the lengths and the angle between them

458
00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:15.790
appears.
That's more natural,
but numerically they are equal.

459
00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:23.730
An important property of the dot product,
which you can check either way.

460
00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:29.090
The dark product a with B plus c is proud product of a with B flat dark product

461
00:31:31.601 --> 00:31:32.670
of a with c.

462
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.050
That just means you can open up the brackets with dot products as you can with

463
00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:38.640
ordinary products.

464
00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:46.030
No,
that's a very important property of the dark products,

465
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:52.080
so maybe I can ask somebody,
do you know one property,

466
00:31:52.081 --> 00:31:53.950
significant property of the dot product?

467
00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:55.533
<v 3>Wow.</v>

468
00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.260
<v 0>Oh,
okay.
That's an interesting,
I didn't think about it.
Yes.</v>

469
00:32:01.261 --> 00:32:03.450
One thing is if two vectors are perpendicular,

470
00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:07.020
the dark product is zero because cost sign of 90 zero

471
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:12.360
but what I had in mind,
of course,
it's hard for me.
It's not fair.

472
00:32:12.361 --> 00:32:15.120
I asked you some questions without saying what I'm looking for.

473
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.770
What can you say if you use a different set of axes?

474
00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:22.173
<v 3>Yep.</v>

475
00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:28.340
<v 0>If you go to the rotated axes,
the components of the vector day will change.</v>

476
00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:31.940
We have done that,
the homework,
but and then the class components,

477
00:32:31.941 --> 00:32:34.130
a B will also change.
Everything will get a prime,

478
00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:40.570
but the combination x B experts Ayby when evaluated before or after.

479
00:32:40.971 --> 00:32:45.971
We'll give the same answer because it's not so obvious when you write it this

480
00:32:46.041 --> 00:32:46.874
way.

481
00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:51.290
There's very obvious when you write it this way because it's clear to us if you

482
00:32:51.291 --> 00:32:53.600
stand on your head or do you rotate the whole axes.

483
00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.100
What you're looking for is the length of a,

484
00:32:56.101 --> 00:33:00.050
which certainly doesn't change on your orientation or the length of B or the

485
00:33:00.051 --> 00:33:00.884
angle between them.

486
00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:07.010
The Angle Theta Aa will change with anger with the new x axis one be the same

487
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:10.760
angle,
but the new y axis one be the same.
Likewise for B,

488
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:14.000
but the angle between the vectors which an invariant properties,

489
00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:16.700
something intrinsic to the two vectors doesn't change.

490
00:33:16.701 --> 00:33:20.300
The dot product is an invasion.
This is a bit important notion.

491
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:22.790
When you learned a little city,
you will find,

492
00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:26.750
you have one observers saying something and other observers saying something,

493
00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:28.280
they will disagree on a lot of things,

494
00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.500
but there are a few things they will all agree on.

495
00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.830
Those few things will be analog of a dot.
B.

496
00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:38.360
So it's very good to have this part of it very clear in your head.

497
00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:42.560
That's part of elementary vector analysis should be clear in your head.

498
00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:49.470
Okay,
so
any,

499
00:33:49.471 --> 00:33:50.850
any questions about this?

500
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000
So if you want geometrically the work done by a force when it moves the body or

501
00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:03.560
distance the are a vector.
Dr Is the full length of the force.

502
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:08.690
The distance traveled times the core sine of the angle between the force and the

503
00:34:08.691 --> 00:34:09.590
displacement vector.

504
00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:17.430
Okay,
I'm almost ready for business because what is my goal?

505
00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:23.370
I find out that in a tiny displacement f.

506
00:34:23.371 --> 00:34:27.840
Dot.
D R,
I start from somewhere.
I go to a neighboring place at distance.

507
00:34:27.841 --> 00:34:31.230
The auto way,
the change in Kennedy,
Kennedy is F.
Dot.

508
00:34:31.231 --> 00:34:34.140
D are so let me make a big trip.
Okay.

509
00:34:34.141 --> 00:34:38.430
Let me make a trip in the x y plane made up of a whole bunch of little segments

510
00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:43.470
in each one of which I calculate this
and to add them all up

511
00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:48.210
on the left hand side,
the Delta case,

512
00:34:49.410 --> 00:34:53.130
this whole thing was defined so that it's equal to Delta K,
right?

513
00:34:53.131 --> 00:34:57.180
Delta K was equally this.
That's equal to all that.
If you add all the delta case,

514
00:34:57.181 --> 00:34:58.500
it's very clear what you will get.

515
00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.950
You will get the kinetic energy at the end minus Kennedy gonna do at the

516
00:35:01.951 --> 00:35:06.150
beginning.
On the right hand side you are told to add f.
Dot.

517
00:35:06.151 --> 00:35:07.830
D are for every tiny segment.

518
00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:14.450
Well that is different written symbolically as this is the notation we use

519
00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:16.853
calculus.

520
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:21.330
That just means if you want to go from a to B along some path,

521
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:26.100
you chop up the path of the tiny pieces.
Each tiny segment,

522
00:35:26.101 --> 00:35:30.990
if it's small enough to be approximated by a tiny vector d are then take the dot

523
00:35:30.991 --> 00:35:35.280
product off that Little d r with the force at that point,

524
00:35:35.281 --> 00:35:37.920
which means length of half time,
the length of the segment,

525
00:35:37.921 --> 00:35:42.240
times cosine of the angle,
add them all up.
Then,

526
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.270
uh,
somebody will say,
well,

527
00:35:44.271 --> 00:35:47.760
your segments are not short enough for me to chop it up some water and chop it

528
00:35:47.761 --> 00:35:50.610
up some more.
Chop it up till your worst critic has been silenced.

529
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:54.840
That's the limit in which you can write the answer as this integral.

530
00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:58.950
Just like in Calculus,
when you integrate a function,
you take,

531
00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.730
you take tiny intervals.
Dell tags multiplay f by Dell tax,

532
00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:06.720
but then you make the intro once more and more numerous and less and less widen.

533
00:36:06.721 --> 00:36:10.110
The limit of that is the area under the graph and that's called integral.

534
00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:12.700
You do the same thing now into dementia.

535
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:17.503
<v 3>So</v>

536
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:22.440
<v 0>now maybe it will be true just like in one dimension that the integral of this</v>

537
00:36:22.441 --> 00:36:26.430
function,
would it be something that depends on the end point?

538
00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:28.350
I'm just going to call it you.

539
00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:34.210
One Lane is youtube or some function you just like it wasn't one dimension.

540
00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:36.960
<v 3>Okay.</v>

541
00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:41.960
<v 0>If that is true then my job is done because then I have cared one plus you want</v>

542
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:44.340
his kid to plus youth too.

543
00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:46.443
<v 3>Okay,</v>

544
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:56.010
<v 0>so then when I'm,
when I'm looking for the law of conservation of energy,</v>

545
00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:00.390
I got to go to some calculus book and I got asked the calculus book look in one

546
00:37:00.391 --> 00:37:05.391
dimension you told me the integral of f from start to end is really the

547
00:37:06.211 --> 00:37:06.700
difference.

548
00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:11.070
Another function g at the end minus to start with g is that function was

549
00:37:11.071 --> 00:37:15.090
delivered was f maybe that is going to be some other magic function.

550
00:37:15.091 --> 00:37:19.350
You in two dimensions related to f in some way so that this integral is again

551
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:22.680
given by a difference of something there minus something here.

552
00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:26.040
If that is the case,
then you can rearrange it and get this,

553
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:32.250
what you will find that it's not meant to be that simple.

554
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:39.200
So again,
has anybody heard rumors about why it may not be that simple?

555
00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:43.250
What could go wrong?

556
00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:49.450
Okay,
so you,
yes.

557
00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.233
<v 3>Uh,</v>

558
00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:54.020
<v 0>okay.
That's probably correct.</v>

559
00:37:54.021 --> 00:37:56.810
But say it in terms of what we know what can go wrong.

560
00:37:56.811 --> 00:38:00.950
I'm saying in one day and I did an integral integral was the difference of two

561
00:38:00.951 --> 00:38:04.990
numbers,
right?
And therefore I got CarePlus use capable.

562
00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:08.030
So something should go wrong somewhere here.

563
00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:11.180
When I say this integral from start to finish is a difference.

564
00:38:11.181 --> 00:38:13.850
The only of the ending point minus the starting point.

565
00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:18.530
Is that reasonable or could imagine that depending on something else,
yes.

566
00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:21.290
<v 3>Wait,
we'll say you have one of your courses,</v>

567
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.710
you take a certain path from 0.1 to 0.2,
it should,
um,

568
00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:29.620
you should have like the same kinetic and potential energy.

569
00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:32.890
But if you take a longer tap and there's friction involved with that,
again,

570
00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:37.990
<v 0>absolutely correct.
It's true that if you've got friction,</v>

571
00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:42.010
this is not going to work.
It doesn't even work in one day,
in one day.

572
00:38:42.011 --> 00:38:44.920
If I start here and end here and why do you about friction?

573
00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:47.650
Fed went straight from here to here to some amount of friction.

574
00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:52.870
If I just went back and forth 97 times and then I ended up that is 97 times more

575
00:38:52.871 --> 00:38:56.380
friction.
So we agreed that if it's friction,
this is not going to work.

576
00:38:56.470 --> 00:39:00.550
But the trouble is friction was the force was not function,
only have x and y.

577
00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:02.770
It depended on the direction of motion.

578
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:07.570
But now I grant you that the force is not a function of velocity.

579
00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:11.080
It's only a function of where you are.
Again,
something still be wrong.

580
00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:17.990
Well,
let me ask you the following question.

581
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:21.650
Now that person does this.

582
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:22.583
<v 2>Yes.</v>

583
00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:27.290
<v 0>You think that person should do the same amount of work</v>

584
00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:31.640
because the forest is now integrated on a longer path.

585
00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:35.960
So you've seen one dimension.

586
00:39:35.961 --> 00:39:39.710
There's only one way to go from here to there this go,
right?

587
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:42.010
That's why I have a new light and integrally,
right?

588
00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:44.600
The lower limit and the upper limit and you don't say any more because there's

589
00:39:44.601 --> 00:39:46.910
only one way in one day to go from x one,

590
00:39:46.911 --> 00:39:51.310
two x two in two dimensions that are thousands of ways to go from one point to

591
00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:51.861
another point.

592
00:39:51.861 --> 00:39:56.861
You can wander all over the place and you end up here that for this integral,

593
00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:02.840
even if I say the starting point is our one ending point is our two at this odd

594
00:40:02.841 --> 00:40:07.040
one,
that's art too.
It's not adequate.

595
00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:09.440
What do you think I should attach to this integration?

596
00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:13.940
What other information should they give?
What more should I specify?

597
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:19.550
Yep.
Along those,
no,
it's not a closed path.
I'm going from one to two.

598
00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:24.770
What more should I tell you before you can even find the work done?

599
00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:29.640
Yes,
you're going,
yep.

600
00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:33.220
See which path you're going in because you can,

601
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:38.170
you feel only have two points,
one and two then that is a work done,

602
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:42.160
but it depends on the path.
The work depends on the path.

603
00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:46.360
Then the answer cannot be a function of you on mine minus you cannot just be one

604
00:40:46.361 --> 00:40:48.990
way you want minus you to say is tell me about your wedding.

605
00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:50.080
Tell me where you start.

606
00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:53.110
And that difference of some function you between those two points,

607
00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:55.330
is the work done?
In other words,

608
00:40:55.331 --> 00:40:59.140
I'm asking you to think critically about whether this equality really could be

609
00:40:59.141 --> 00:40:59.974
true.

610
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:05.560
This is some function u in the x y plane evaluated at one point minus the other

611
00:41:05.561 --> 00:41:09.580
point.
This is on a path of joining those two points.

612
00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:13.450
But I have not told you which path and I can draw any path they're like with

613
00:41:13.451 --> 00:41:14.530
those same end points.

614
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:18.220
And you got to realize that it's very unreasonable to expect that no matter

615
00:41:18.221 --> 00:41:20.140
which path you take,
you will get the same answer.

616
00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:23.723
<v 2>Okay?</v>

617
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:28.500
<v 0>So you might think that I'm creating a straw man because it's going to turn out</v>

618
00:41:28.501 --> 00:41:31.530
by some magic that no matter what force you take,

619
00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.310
somehow the due the magic of mathematics,

620
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:39.110
the integrator will depend only on the end points.
Uh,
but that's not the case.

621
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:43.700
Generally.
That won't happen.
So I have to show you that.

622
00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:49.340
So I'm going to start by asking you for a,
give me a number from one to three.

623
00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:55.050
Two.
Okay.
Two.
Then I want a few more numbers.
Uh,

624
00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:58.760
now that number
from one to three.

625
00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:03.620
Okay.
All right then two more

626
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:10.550
mark.
You pick a number.
Good,
thank you.
Then I need one more.

627
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:13.483
<v 3>Yes.</v>

628
00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:19.350
<v 0>One,
two,
three,
a number from one to three.
Two.
Very good.</v>

629
00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:21.900
Okay,
so you pick these numbers randomly.

630
00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:28.010
I'm going to take a force which looks like I times x squared y cubed,

631
00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:33.180
let j times x,
y squared.
Okay.

632
00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:36.330
I put the powers based on what you guys give.

633
00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:39.930
So we pick the force in two dimensions out of a hat.

634
00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:42.871
Now let's ask,

635
00:42:42.871 --> 00:42:46.320
is that true for this force that the work done and going from one point to

636
00:42:46.321 --> 00:42:50.190
another depends only on the path or does it depend?

637
00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:53.250
I mean it depends only on endpoints that does it depend in detail on how you go

638
00:42:53.251 --> 00:42:53.970
from the end point?

639
00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:54.803
<v 3>Yes.</v>

640
00:42:56.620 --> 00:43:00.340
<v 0>You all have to understand before you copy anything down where we are going with</v>

641
00:43:00.341 --> 00:43:02.140
this,
what's the game plan?

642
00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:05.710
So let me tell you one more time because you can copy this all you want.

643
00:43:05.711 --> 00:43:09.940
It will get you nowhere.
You should feel that you know where I'm going,

644
00:43:09.941 --> 00:43:13.060
but the details remain to be shown what you should have an idea of what's

645
00:43:13.061 --> 00:43:18.061
happening if you try to generalize the work energy theorem to two dimensions.

646
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:20.650
This is what happened so far.

647
00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:25.120
You found the definition of work which has the property that the work done is

648
00:43:25.121 --> 00:43:26.380
the change in Kennedy Energy.

649
00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:31.000
Then you added up all the changes of Kennedy Energy and added up all the work

650
00:43:31.001 --> 00:43:35.380
done and you said k two minus k one is integral of f.
Dot.

651
00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:39.850
Dr That's guaranteed to be true.
That won't that just based on Newton's laws.

652
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:45.010
What is tricky is the second equality that that integral is the difference in a

653
00:43:45.011 --> 00:43:48.220
function calculated at one end point minus the other end point.

654
00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:50.710
If that was true,

655
00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:54.730
if the integral dependent only on the end points,

656
00:43:54.731 --> 00:43:58.600
then it cannot depend on the path that you take.
If it depends on the path.

657
00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:01.840
Every path you take within the same two end points will give different numbers.

658
00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:06.550
So the answer cannot simply be you one minus youtube first time trying to

659
00:44:06.551 --> 00:44:09.820
convince you through an example that I selected randomly that if you took a

660
00:44:09.821 --> 00:44:13.450
random force and found the work done along one path or another path,

661
00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:16.870
you will in fact get two different answers.
Okay?

662
00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:20.410
That's the first thing to appreciate that that's a problem.

663
00:44:20.411 --> 00:44:24.490
So generally took at random force,
not a frictional force.

664
00:44:24.491 --> 00:44:27.070
The force depends only on location,
not velocity.

665
00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:32.370
It will not be possible to define a potential energy nod when it'd be possible

666
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:34.830
to find a care plus you so that it doesn't change.

667
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:40.800
So it's got to take a very special force for with the answer depends only on the

668
00:44:40.801 --> 00:44:45.330
starting and ending point and not have the path to show you that such as that's

669
00:44:45.331 --> 00:44:48.270
a special situation.
I'm taking a genetic situation,

670
00:44:48.271 --> 00:44:53.271
namely a force manufactured by this class without any prior consultation with me

671
00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:54.990
and I will show you that for that.
For us,

672
00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:57.120
the answer is going to depend on how you go.

673
00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:01.980
So let's take that force and let's find the work done and going from the origin.

674
00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:03.480
The 0.11

675
00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:09.000
so I'm going to take two paths.
One path.

676
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:13.020
I'm going to go horizontally tell I'm below the point that I'm going straight
up.

677
00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.930
So let's find the work done.
Then I go this way.

678
00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:27.170
So you again,
you should be thinking all the time.
You should say,

679
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:29.480
if this guy got struck by lightning,

680
00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:32.960
can I do anything or am I just going to say,
well,

681
00:45:32.961 --> 00:45:35.180
I don't know what he was planning to do.
You got to have some idea.

682
00:45:35.181 --> 00:45:37.820
What I'm going to do,
and we're going to integrate F.
Dot.

683
00:45:37.821 --> 00:45:40.100
D are first on the horizontal segment.

684
00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:44.930
Then on the vertical segment for some vector you give me at the point x and Y,

685
00:45:44.931 --> 00:45:47.930
I'll plug in some numbers.
I'll get something times I him,

686
00:45:47.931 --> 00:45:50.450
something times Jay maybe pointing like that.

687
00:45:50.451 --> 00:45:55.310
At this point that's f that's given,
but now when I'm moving horizontally,

688
00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:59.900
my displacement,
Dr has only got a dx part.

689
00:45:59.901 --> 00:46:04.460
I hope you see that every step I move,
there's no DUI in it.

690
00:46:04.461 --> 00:46:08.000
It's all horizontal.
So f.
Dot.
Dr

691
00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:13.790
Just becomes Fx Dx

692
00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:19.370
because there is no DUI when you move horizontally.
So when they do the integral,

693
00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:23.830
you have FX dx.
Fx happens to be x squared,
y cube,

694
00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:27.470
dx x going from zero to one.

695
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:31.970
Now what do I do with White Cube?

696
00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:35.420
You all know how to integrate the function of x times DX.

697
00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:39.440
What do I do with White Cube?
What do you think it means?

698
00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:44.030
What me?
What should they do with why

699
00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:49.610
you evaluate why on that path at that point?
Well,

700
00:46:49.611 --> 00:46:53.390
it turns out throughout this horizontal segment,
why is zero

701
00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:59.780
so this has gone basically the point is very simple.
When you move horizontally,

702
00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:03.590
you're working against the [inaudible] forces doing work,

703
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:07.520
but on the x axis and Y is zero.
That is no horizontal force that way.

704
00:47:07.521 --> 00:47:10.760
There's nothing to do.
Now you're coming to this segment,

705
00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:14.750
I think you all agree the distance traveled is j Times d y.

706
00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:19.220
So I have to have another segment.
The second part of my trip,

707
00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:24.540
which is f y Times d,
Y,
and why he goes from zero to one and a,

708
00:47:24.541 --> 00:47:28.630
the white component is x,
Y,
z squared.
D why or why?

709
00:47:28.631 --> 00:47:33.631
It goes from to one but now on the entire line that I'm moving up and down x is

710
00:47:36.491 --> 00:47:37.180
equal to one.

711
00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:42.180
Do you see that x is a constant on the line so you could replace x by one and y

712
00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:48.220
Square d why is white cube over three and the work done is therefore one third

713
00:47:48.221 --> 00:47:49.054
Jews.

714
00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:54.850
So the work done in going first to the right and then to the top is one third.

715
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:06.030
You can also go straight up and then horizontally by a similar trick.

716
00:48:06.911 --> 00:48:07.631
I won't do that.

717
00:48:07.631 --> 00:48:10.180
Nobody cause I want to show you something else that's useful for you.

718
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:15.220
I'm going to pick another path which is not just made up of x and y segments.

719
00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:18.130
Then it's very easy to do this.
I'm going to pick another,

720
00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:22.150
another way to go from zero zero two one one which is on this curve.

721
00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:25.530
This is the curve y equals a x wave.

722
00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.550
First of all,
you got to understand the curve way.

723
00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:35.430
Collect square goes through the two points I'm interested in.
Okay.

724
00:48:35.431 --> 00:48:37.770
If a good way equal to five x squared,
it doesn't work.

725
00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:39.450
But this guy goes through zero,

726
00:48:39.451 --> 00:48:43.860
zero and goes through one one and I'm asking you if I did the work done by the

727
00:48:43.861 --> 00:48:48.300
force along that segment,
what is the integral of f.
Dot.
D are,

728
00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:54.630
so let's take a tiny portion of that looks like this,

729
00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:55.763
right?

730
00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:00.570
That's Dr misguided dx and there's got to d y.

731
00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:01.663
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

732
00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:09.600
<v 0>Now you notice that as this segment because very small d y over dx is a slope</v>

733
00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:12.443
for

734
00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:17.950
the y will be the y divided by DX times.
DX.

735
00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:24.190
In other words,
DX and dys,
not independent.

736
00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:25.780
If you're moving in a particular direction,

737
00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:28.480
I hope you understand that you want to fall a certain curve.

738
00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:30.340
If you step to the right by some amount,

739
00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:34.150
you've got to step vertically by certain amounts of you're moving on that curve.

740
00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:38.620
That's why when you do the calculate the work done dx and dy,

741
00:49:38.621 --> 00:49:42.520
why are not independent?
So what do you really want is f x,

742
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:46.330
Dx,
let's f y,
t y,

743
00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:51.280
but for Dui I'm going to use the Y,
dx times.
DX.

744
00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:58.650
In other words,
every segment Delta y that you have is related to the delta x.

745
00:49:58.651 --> 00:50:01.210
You took horizontally so that you stay on that curve.

746
00:50:01.930 --> 00:50:03.910
So everything depends only on Dex,

747
00:50:04.450 --> 00:50:08.920
but what am I putting inside integral?
Let's take FX.

748
00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:12.340
The x component is x squared y cubed

749
00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:17.470
on this curve.
Why is to x squared?

750
00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:21.430
So you really write x squared and Y is equal to x squared.

751
00:50:21.431 --> 00:50:22.540
That is extra this sixth.

752
00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:28.850
This x cubed is really white written in terms of x.

753
00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:37.740
Then I have to write f y which is x times y squared,

754
00:50:38.051 --> 00:50:42.100
which is extra.
The fourth time's DYD x.
We just do x.

755
00:50:45.970 --> 00:50:50.320
So I get here from all of this extra,

756
00:50:50.321 --> 00:50:53.980
the eighth plus two extra.
The five.

757
00:50:56.890 --> 00:51:00.790
Yeah.
Did I make a mistake somewhere?
One mean,

758
00:51:04.410 --> 00:51:08.060
<v 3>did I hear
here?</v>

759
00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:10.903
Oh here.

760
00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:17.330
<v 0>Oh,
extra the sixth tonight.
Thank you.
I was that.
Thanks for wanting that.</v>

761
00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:21.800
You have to watch it.
Uh,
so now what do I get extra?

762
00:51:21.801 --> 00:51:25.680
The eighth integral is actually the nine over nine that gives me one nine

763
00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:29.000
because x is going from zero to one.
The next thing is extra.

764
00:51:29.001 --> 00:51:31.790
The seven over seven which is two times.

765
00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:33.403
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

766
00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:35.591
<v 0>Well,</v>

767
00:51:35.591 --> 00:51:38.500
I'm not paying too much attention to this because I know it's not one third.

768
00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:43.290
Okay.
There's no way this guy's going to be one third.
That's all I cared about.

769
00:51:46.090 --> 00:51:48.340
So I'm showing you that if we took a random force,

770
00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:52.180
the work done is dependent on the path for this force.

771
00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:56.830
You cannot define a potential energy in one dimension.

772
00:51:56.831 --> 00:51:58.330
Any force that was not friction.

773
00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:00.690
I'll overdo to define a potential energy and higher dimension.

774
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:02.530
You just cannot do that.
That's the main point.

775
00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:09.940
So if you're looking for a conservative fiscal conservative force is a force for

776
00:52:09.941 --> 00:52:11.440
which you can define a potential energy.

777
00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:16.930
It has the property that the work done and going from a to B or wanted to is

778
00:52:16.931 --> 00:52:20.260
independent or have you got from one to two and the f the One force that the

779
00:52:20.261 --> 00:52:24.850
class generated pretty much randomly is not a conservative force because the

780
00:52:24.851 --> 00:52:26.550
work done was pat dependent.

781
00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:32.190
So what we have learnt,
in fact,
I'll keep this portion here,

782
00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:38.420
if you're looking for a conservative force,
a force was answer,

783
00:52:38.421 --> 00:52:41.220
does not depend on how you went from start to finish

784
00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:43.193
<v 3>then.</v>

785
00:52:44.850 --> 00:52:45.100
<v 0>Yep.</v>

786
00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:49.680
To some our dream up some force so that if you did this Integro the answer does

787
00:52:49.681 --> 00:52:52.290
not depend on the path you realize.

788
00:52:52.291 --> 00:52:56.950
That looks at really miraculous because we just wrote down her arbitrary forced

789
00:52:56.951 --> 00:52:59.190
that we all cooked up together with these exponents.

790
00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:00.960
And the answer depends on the path.

791
00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:05.310
And I guarantee you if we just arbitrarily write down some force,
it won't work.

792
00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:10.770
So maybe there is no law of conservation of energy in more than one dimension.

793
00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:18.470
So how am I going to search for the force that will do the job?

794
00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:21.410
Are that at least some forces for which this will be true?

795
00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:22.643
<v 3>Yes.</v>

796
00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:27.600
<v 0>No,
but see,</v>

797
00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:31.850
the point is you got to first write down a force next white plain.

798
00:53:32.450 --> 00:53:36.740
Then I should be free to pick any two points and connect them anywhere like,

799
00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:39.170
and the answer shouldn't depend on how I connected them.

800
00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:41.690
Only then you can have conservation of energy.

801
00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:44.000
I hope you all understand that fact,

802
00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:49.700
so I'm seeing a genetic force on the x.
Y plane doesn't do that.
Then we ask,

803
00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:52.760
can that ever be an answer?
It is so demanding.
Yes.

804
00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:54.253
<v 3>Right,</v>

805
00:53:56.350 --> 00:53:57.340
<v 0>right.
So he's saying,</v>

806
00:53:57.370 --> 00:54:01.540
I know force the force of gravity in fact happens to have the property that the

807
00:54:01.541 --> 00:54:04.360
work done by the force of gravity does not depend on the path.

808
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:05.740
We will see why that is true,

809
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:12.000
but you see what I want this to ask instead of math instead of machine that'll

810
00:54:12.401 --> 00:54:16.930
manufactured conservative forces and I'm going to tell you that is I would show

811
00:54:16.931 --> 00:54:21.010
you a machine that'll produce a large number of infinite number of conservative

812
00:54:21.011 --> 00:54:25.900
forces and I'll show you how to produce them.
Here is the trick.

813
00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:31.930
The trick is instead of taking a force and finding if there's a potential that

814
00:54:31.931 --> 00:54:35.860
will come from it by doing integrations,
let me assume that it's a potential.

815
00:54:38.170 --> 00:54:42.730
Then I will ask what force I can associate with the potential and here's the

816
00:54:42.731 --> 00:54:45.790
answer.
Answer this.
Step one,

817
00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:49.990
pick any you have accent,
why

818
00:54:52.770 --> 00:54:57.280
you pick the function first.
That function is going to be your potential energy.

819
00:54:57.970 --> 00:55:00.520
It's been anointed even before we do anything.

820
00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:06.520
But then from the potential I want you to manufacture the following force.

821
00:55:06.521 --> 00:55:11.521
I want you to find the I want the force that I'm going to find is going to be

822
00:55:11.891 --> 00:55:16.540
having an x component which the deliver to a view with respect to x and it's

823
00:55:16.541 --> 00:55:19.960
going to have a white component with the delivered to with you with respect to

824
00:55:19.961 --> 00:55:24.290
why
that is.

825
00:55:24.291 --> 00:55:26.540
Step two in fact,

826
00:55:26.541 --> 00:55:30.080
the claim now is this force is going to be a conservative force

827
00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:34.970
and in fact this potential energy associated with it will be the function you

828
00:55:34.971 --> 00:55:35.804
use started.

829
00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.970
So how do I know that?
So for example,

830
00:55:40.971 --> 00:55:45.971
I'm saying suppose you equal do Xyq then FX is equal to minus d you DX,

831
00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:54.400
which is equal to minus white cube and F Y which this minus the u d y would be

832
00:55:55.671 --> 00:55:57.350
minus three x y square.

833
00:55:58.970 --> 00:56:01.940
The claim is if you put i-times FX and daytime safe,
why?

834
00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.840
The answer will not depend on how have you gone from start to finish.

835
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:10.600
So let me prove that to you.
Here's the proof,

836
00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:16.570
the change in the function u in the x y plane,

837
00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:22.200
you guys remember I might telling you is dod x Times Dx Plus U D Times d y.

838
00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:30.250
That's the old thing of mathematical preliminaries,
which was done somewhere.

839
00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:35.170
I forgot.
Here it says see a Delta Alpha Delta F del Tech's time,

840
00:56:35.171 --> 00:56:39.940
Delta x,
Delta,
Delta,
Delta.
Why I played to the function you,

841
00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:44.260
but who is this?
You know what?
This is what's going on here.

842
00:56:45.370 --> 00:56:49.720
The U Dx Dx.
This is FX with the minus sign.

843
00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:52.240
That's Fyi,
the minus sign.

844
00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:55.990
Therefore this is equal to minus F.
Dot.

845
00:56:56.730 --> 00:57:01.730
D.

846
00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:05.700
R.
Right,
because we agreed the force that I want to manufactured.

847
00:57:05.701 --> 00:57:07.260
Is it related to you in this fashion?

848
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:14.040
If you add all the changes,
right?

849
00:57:14.041 --> 00:57:16.110
10 side becomes the integral of F.
Dot.

850
00:57:16.111 --> 00:57:19.670
D R and the left hand side becomes the summer fall.

851
00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:22.350
The delta use with a minus sign.

852
00:57:24.130 --> 00:57:24.360
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

853
00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:25.111
<v 0>add all the delta.</v>

854
00:57:25.111 --> 00:57:30.090
Use the minus sign that it just become you at 1 million as you were too.

855
00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:38.610
It is cooked up so that f.
Dot.

856
00:57:38.611 --> 00:57:43.380
D R is actually at the change in the function in you that the,
if you say,

857
00:57:43.381 --> 00:57:44.730
what was the trick that you did?

858
00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:48.690
I cooked up a force by design so that F.
Dot.

859
00:57:48.691 --> 00:57:53.370
D R was a change in a certain function.
You if added all the F.
Dot.
D ours.

860
00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:55.980
I'm going to get a change in the function.
You from start to finish.

861
00:57:56.310 --> 00:57:58.470
It's gotta be you one minus Youtube.

862
00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:03.670
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

863
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:08.170
<v 0>so I don't know how else I can say this.
Maybe the way to think about it is,</v>

864
00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:16.320
wait,
do this,
wait a certain integros not depend on how you took the path.
Right.

865
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:19.320
Let me ask you a different question.
Forget about integros.

866
00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:24.270
You are on top of some hilly mountain.
We have a starting point.

867
00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:26.070
You have an ending point.
Okay.

868
00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:29.580
I started at the starting point and I walked to the ending point.

869
00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:34.770
Every portion of my walk,
I keep track of how many feet I'm claiming.

870
00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:40.350
That's like my delta.
You.
I add them all up.
At the end of the day,

871
00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:43.890
the height change will be the top of the mountain minus bottom of the mountain

872
00:58:44.350 --> 00:58:47.190
height of the mountain.
You go on a different path.

873
00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:48.480
You don't go straight for the summit,

874
00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:51.150
you loop around and you coil and you wind down,
you go up,

875
00:58:51.151 --> 00:58:53.550
you do this and you also end up at the summit.

876
00:58:54.930 --> 00:58:57.720
If you kept track of how long you walked,
it won't be the same as me,

877
00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:01.860
but if you also kept track of how many feet you claimed you added them all up,

878
00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:04.560
what answered will you get will get the same answer I got.

879
00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:07.493
Therefore,

880
00:59:07.770 --> 00:59:11.700
if what you were keeping track of as the height change in a function than the

881
00:59:11.701 --> 00:59:14.610
sum of all the height changes will be simply the total high chain,

882
00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:16.800
which is the height at the end minus height at the beginning.

883
00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:20.970
Therefore starting with the height function by taking his,

884
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:23.660
if you manufacture to force,

885
00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:27.950
this will be none other than the fact of adding up the changes.

886
00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:30.481
Okay.

887
00:59:30.481 --> 00:59:35.481
And that's why this will be kid do minus k one and then you would get k one plus

888
00:59:36.681 --> 00:59:37.980
you want this kid to plus you too.

889
00:59:39.590 --> 00:59:44.270
I hope you understand how conservative forces are not impossible to get.
In fact,

890
00:59:44.271 --> 00:59:46.760
for every function you have x and y you can think of,

891
00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:48.950
you can manufacture that kind of separate of course.

892
00:59:51.290 --> 00:59:55.810
So you may ask Pauline question maybe that are other ways to manufacture the

893
00:59:55.820 --> 01:00:00.590
conservative force and you just thought of one and the answer is no.

894
01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:04.520
Not only is this a machine that generates conservative forces,

895
01:00:04.521 --> 01:00:07.520
my two step algorithm,
because you and take his directives,

896
01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:13.330
every conservative force you get is necessarily obtained by taking derivatives

897
01:00:13.551 --> 01:00:17.780
with respect to x and y have some function you and that you will be the

898
01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:21.480
potential energy associated with that force.
So they've been,

899
01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:23.210
that force alone acts on a body,

900
01:00:23.570 --> 01:00:25.850
that candidate plus that potential will not change.

901
01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:31.850
Finally,
you remember that,
uh,

902
01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.690
when the class pick a certain force,
we tie rod here.

903
01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:40.520
I went on a limb and I said,

904
01:00:40.521 --> 01:00:45.050
I'm going to do the integral of this force along this path and that path and I'm

905
01:00:45.051 --> 01:00:47.210
going to get different answers and show you we have a problem.

906
01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.710
What if the force he had given me was actually a conservative force?

907
01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:58.510
Then I would be embarrassed because then I will find after all the work,

908
01:00:58.511 --> 01:00:59.980
this will turn out to be again,
one third,

909
01:01:00.550 --> 01:01:03.190
so I had to make sure right away that the force is not conservative.

910
01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:06.700
And how can you tell?

911
01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:14.080
One way to say it is ask yourself could that be some function?

912
01:01:14.081 --> 01:01:18.640
You who's exited with two have this was this and who's why that we do is that

913
01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:21.400
you can probably convince yourself,

914
01:01:21.401 --> 01:01:24.520
no function's going to do it for you because if you look at next date of it,

915
01:01:24.521 --> 01:01:26.170
they should have lost a part of x here.

916
01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:30.190
That means if you just took the wind out of active to go here,

917
01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.480
you should have more powers of xls,
powers of white,

918
01:01:32.490 --> 01:01:36.520
but this is just the opposite way.
So we know this couldn't have come from you,

919
01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:42.010
but that is a better test.
Instead of building all that instead of saying,

920
01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:46.540
I'm satisfied that this doesn't come from taking [inaudible] for you by looking

921
01:01:46.541 --> 01:01:50.590
at possible use and not being satisfied because maybe I'm not clever enough.

922
01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:56.020
That is the mechanical way to tell mechanical way to tell is the following.

923
01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:00.040
Um,
maybe I want you guys think for a second about what the recipe,

924
01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:05.050
maybe if air force came from a function you by taking directive as written up

925
01:02:06.521 --> 01:02:07.354
there,

926
01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:12.430
what can you say about the components of that force from the fact yes.

927
01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:20.130
Right,
so that we know that for every function you the cross at equal,

928
01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:26.240
but the ordinary derivatives are just the f x and f y then for d two you over d

929
01:02:28.171 --> 01:02:33.171
why d x is really d by d y of ethics and I want that to be equal to the by the x

930
01:02:36.811 --> 01:02:38.360
of f y good.

931
01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:42.330
That would then be d to You over the d y.

932
01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:46.350
In other words,
if the four satisfies this condition,

933
01:02:47.970 --> 01:02:50.970
the white data at Fx is the extent of it,
of f y,

934
01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:55.830
then it has the right pedigree to be a conservative force.

935
01:02:55.831 --> 01:02:58.890
Because if a force came from a function you by taking derivatives,

936
01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:03.960
the simple acquirement that across data does that equal for any function you

937
01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:09.330
tells me.
See if I take the white that ever affects,
I'm taking d two You DX,

938
01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:13.740
d y and he had taking d two [inaudible] d why d x?
And they must be equal.

939
01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:19.320
So that's the diagnostic.
If I give you a force and I asked you,

940
01:03:19.321 --> 01:03:20.220
is it conservative,

941
01:03:20.550 --> 01:03:24.330
you simply take the way that avoidable affects and the exit of Fyi.

942
01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.270
And if they match,
you don't as conservative.

943
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:31.860
So I got to summarize by saying the following thing in two dimensions.

944
01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:35.790
There are indeed many,
many forces for which a potential energy can be defined,

945
01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:40.950
but every one of them has an ancestor,
which is simply a function,

946
01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:41.731
not a vector,

947
01:03:41.731 --> 01:03:46.410
but a scalar function on ordinary function of x and y in the forest is obtained

948
01:03:46.411 --> 01:03:48.720
by taking x and y databases of their function.

949
01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:51.270
The exited Ebitda with a minus sign is called ethics.

950
01:03:51.271 --> 01:03:55.760
And the way that I would have is called F y.
Okay?

951
01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:59.720
So let's take the most popular example is the force of gravity near the surface

952
01:03:59.721 --> 01:04:03.440
of the earth.
The force of gravity.

953
01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:07.100
We know it's minus M G G

954
01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:13.250
it says gay conservative.
Yes,
because exited with this vanishes.

955
01:04:14.310 --> 01:04:14.750
<v 2>Okay.</v>

956
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:16.010
<v 0>And the way that it would have effects,</v>

957
01:04:16.011 --> 01:04:19.460
you don't even have to worry because that is no FX,
just clearly conservative.

958
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:24.320
Then you can ask what is the potential you that led to this?
Well,

959
01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:29.920
the U D Y with a minus sign had to be minus AMG and the UDX had to be zero.

960
01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:37.140
So the function that will do the job.
Yes,
AMG,

961
01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:42.160
why you can also have empty why plus 96 we will not add those constants because

962
01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:45.830
in the end and the law of Conservation of energy,

963
01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:50.420
k one plus you want his kid to please you to adding a 96 to both sides doesn't

964
01:04:50.421 --> 01:04:51.254
do anything.

965
01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:55.730
So this means when a body is moving in the gravitational field,

966
01:04:56.270 --> 01:05:01.270
one half MV squared plus m g y before it's the same as one half MV squared plus

967
01:05:05.211 --> 01:05:07.070
AMG.
Why after?

968
01:05:11.410 --> 01:05:12.243
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

969
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:16.250
<v 0>no,
you knew this already when you're moving up and down the white direction.</v>

970
01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:18.880
But what I'm telling you is this is true in two dimensions.

971
01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:22.840
So I'll give you a final example so you guys can go home and think about it.

972
01:05:23.410 --> 01:05:27.410
That is the roller coaster.
So yes,
the roller coaster,
it has a,

973
01:05:27.411 --> 01:05:31.240
it looks like this.
This is x.

974
01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:34.780
This is the height of the roller coaster,

975
01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:39.430
but at every excess a certain heights or why is the function of x,

976
01:05:39.431 --> 01:05:41.920
and it looks like this,
it just the profile of the rollercoaster,

977
01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:46.300
but that is also the potential energy you,

978
01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:51.400
because for multiply this by AMG rally to scale the graph AMD it looks the same.

979
01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:57.320
So take a photograph of a roller coaster multiplied the height in meters by Amg

980
01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:59.480
is going to still look the look like the rollercoaster.

981
01:06:00.110 --> 01:06:02.750
That is my potential energy for this problem.

982
01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:07.430
And the claim is that Kennedy plus potential will not change.

983
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:12.830
So k plus u is a constant,
let's call the constant e.

984
01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:18.890
So if a trolley begins here at the top,

985
01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:25.370
what does historical energy,
he's got potential energy equal with the height.

986
01:06:25.850 --> 01:06:28.640
It's got no kinetic energy,
total energy.
In fact,

987
01:06:28.641 --> 01:06:33.440
it's just as height and total energy cannot change as a trolley goes up and
down,

988
01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:37.610
so you draw a line at that height and call it the total energy.

989
01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:41.540
You started this guy off of that energy.
That energy was always be the same.

990
01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:48.140
What that means is if you're somewhere here,
since that is your potential energy,

991
01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:52.640
that is your kinetic energy's very nicely read off from this graph to read the

992
01:06:52.641 --> 01:06:53.474
same total.

993
01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:54.890
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

994
01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:59.430
<v 0>Plus you oscillate up and down.
You gain and lose kinetic and potential.</v>

995
01:06:59.431 --> 01:07:03.060
When you come here,
your potential energy is almost your whole energy,

996
01:07:03.061 --> 01:07:04.740
but it got a little bit of candidate energy.

997
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:06.750
That means your rollercoaster is still moving.

998
01:07:07.050 --> 01:07:09.180
When it comes here with the remaining kinetic energy,

999
01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:13.840
you can have a roller coaster who's energy is like,

1000
01:07:13.841 --> 01:07:16.480
this is a release from rest here.

1001
01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:19.030
If it's really from rest here,

1002
01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:22.930
that's the total energy and historical energy lion looks like this.

1003
01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:29.340
That means if you released it here,
it'll come down,
pick up speed,
slow down,

1004
01:07:29.341 --> 01:07:31.170
pick up speed again and come to this point.

1005
01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:36.200
It must stop and turn it around because at that point the potential energy is

1006
01:07:37.261 --> 01:07:40.290
equal,
the total energy and there is no Kennedy,
Kennedy.
That means you stopped.

1007
01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.990
That means you're turning it on.
It'll rattle back and forth.

1008
01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:49.150
By the way,
according to the laws of quantum mechanics,
it can do something else.

1009
01:07:49.330 --> 01:07:53.650
Maybe you guys know,
you know what else it can do if it starts here,
yes,

1010
01:07:55.270 --> 01:07:56.920
it can suddenly find yourself here

1011
01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:01.780
and that's not allowed by classical mechanics because to do that,

1012
01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:02.980
it has to go over the hump.

1013
01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:07.360
Look what's happening at the hump and it got more kinetic energy than I have

1014
01:08:07.361 --> 01:08:09.640
total energy.
I'm sorry,

1015
01:08:09.641 --> 01:08:13.420
I've got more potential energy than I have total energy that miss kinetic energy

1016
01:08:13.421 --> 01:08:13.960
is negative.

1017
01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:16.850
That's not possible because one half MV squared can never be negative.

1018
01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:21.020
So quantum theory allows those forbidden processes and it's called tunneling,

1019
01:08:21.290 --> 01:08:24.140
but for us,
the roller coaster problem,
you would just turn it on.

1020
01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:28.040
There's one thing I want you to think about before you go.

1021
01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:32.150
You should not have simply accepted the law of conservation of energy in this

1022
01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:35.960
problem because gravity is not the only force acting on this.

1023
01:08:36.830 --> 01:08:40.940
What else is acting on this roller coaster?
Pardon me.

1024
01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:45.320
No friction than what you normally the force of the track.
Look,

1025
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:47.450
if I didn't want to have anything but gravity.

1026
01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:50.930
Here's the roller coaster ride you guys will love.
Just push you over the edge.

1027
01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:52.313
Okay?

1028
01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:56.870
That conserves energy and it's got no track and he's got the only gravitation

1029
01:08:56.871 --> 01:09:00.620
forces.
You can happily use this formula.
Why am I paying all this money?

1030
01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:03.860
Because there's another force acting on it.
But that force,

1031
01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:05.060
if it's not frictional,

1032
01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:09.140
isn't necessarily perpendicular to the motion of the trolley and the

1033
01:09:09.141 --> 01:09:12.890
displacement of the trolleys along the track.
So f.
Dot.
D are vanishes.

1034
01:09:12.891 --> 01:09:16.790
So I'll conclude by telling you the correct thing to do would be to say k two

1035
01:09:16.791 --> 01:09:18.970
minus k one is the integral level.

1036
01:09:18.971 --> 01:09:23.971
All the forces divided into force due to the track and the force due to gravity.

1037
01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:25.553
<v 2>Yes,</v>

1038
01:09:26.310 --> 01:09:29.250
<v 0>Fort Stewart,
the track is zero.
I mean it's not zero,</v>

1039
01:09:29.251 --> 01:09:33.570
but that would dot product with the Arctic zero because FMD are perpendicular

1040
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.950
for that reason.

1041
01:09:35.010 --> 01:09:39.660
You drop that and the force of gravity is cooked up so that it becomes you one

1042
01:09:39.661 --> 01:09:41.550
minus youth too.
And that's what we used.

1043
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:50.650
Okay.
One challenge.
You guys can go home and do this.

1044
01:09:51.610 --> 01:09:55.090
Take any force in two dimensions.
F

1045
01:09:58.950 --> 01:09:59.430
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1046
01:09:59.430 --> 01:10:03.090
<v 0>It is padded a little to the direction where you are measured from the origin</v>

1047
01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:05.610
times.
Any function of the distance from the audits.

1048
01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:08.680
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1049
01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:08.951
<v 0>sure.</v>

1050
01:10:08.951 --> 01:10:13.060
We convince yourself that this force is a conservative force by applying the

1051
01:10:13.061 --> 01:10:17.260
test I gave you and the trick is to use x and y instead of our,

1052
01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:20.140
take this force,
write it down in terms of x and y.

1053
01:10:20.141 --> 01:10:22.990
Take the cross derivatives and you can see it's conservative.

1054
01:10:22.991 --> 01:10:27.850
So any radial force.
Yep.
Oh,

1055
01:10:29.470 --> 01:10:33.100
here.
This is the force which you should try your thing.

1056
01:10:33.101 --> 01:10:34.960
And gravity is a special example of this.

1057
01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:41.683
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1058
01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:46.960
<v 0>Judging from the class reaction and the stunned and shocked.
Look,</v>

1059
01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:52.090
a lot of few people,
maybe this material is new,
so you should think about it.

1060
01:10:52.091 --> 01:10:54.680
Talk about it.
Go to discussion section a,

1061
01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:58.660
but this is the level at which you should understand energy conservation in the

1062
01:10:58.661 --> 01:10:59.530
course.
Like this.
