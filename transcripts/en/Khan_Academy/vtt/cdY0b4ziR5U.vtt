00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.280
Which of the following graphs
represents the solutions

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:10.170
to the system of equations x
is equal to 2 minus y and y

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.010
is equal to x squared minus 4.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.170
So essentially, we
want to find the graphs

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.500
that represent
these two equations,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.710
and where they intersect
represent the solutions.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.180
So, let's see. y equals
x squared minus 4.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.690
That's going to be
an upward opening

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.000
parabola with a
y-intercept of negative 4,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.340
and we see that is the case.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.189
Or I should say the
y-coordinate of its vertex

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.950
would be negative 4 right
over there, and also

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.080
the y-intercept.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.304
So that looks like this
one right over here.

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:40.220
And this is the only one
that opens like that,

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.178
so we can immediately
say that this is probably

00:00:42.178 --> 00:00:44.710
going to be the red
one right over here.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:51.260
But we can verify that this line
right over here is 2 minus x.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.090
So if I were to write this in
traditional slope intercept

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.500
form, I could rewrite this
as x is equal to 2 minus y.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.680
Add y to both sides.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.040
We have y plus x
is equal to 2, or y

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.380
is equal to negative x plus 2.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.190
So we see the y-intercept is
2, and its slope is negative 1.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.410
So that's indeed this line,
and so the solutions here

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.470
are going to be that point and
that point right over here.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.230
Red is what represents
the solutions

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.945
to this non-linear
system of equations.
