00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.250
There's one more case of
partial fraction expansion

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.960
or decomposition problems
that you might see, so I

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.100
thought I would cover it.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.960
And that's the situation where
you have a repeated factor

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.790
in the denominator.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.060
So let's see, I've constructed
a little problem here.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.540
It's 6x squared.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.790
Let me make sure
my pen is right.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:27.460
6x squared minus 19x plus 15.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.880
All of that over x minus 1
times-- and this is the

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.640
thing that makes this one
especially interesting--

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.500
x minus 2 squared.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.560
So you might say, gee, this
is a little bit different.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.660
Because what do I do here?

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.840
I have this first degree
factor, but it shows up twice.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.860
It doesn't make sense,
for example, it wouldn't

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.020
make sense to do this.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:59.240
A over x minus 1 plus B over x
minus 2 plus C over x minus 2.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.610
Because if you did this, the
B and the C would just add

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.670
together, because they have
the same denominator.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.690
You could just view
them as one variable.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.670
You wouldn't have to have two
separate variables here.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.940
So this wouldn't make sense
as a partial fraction

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.160
expansion of this.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.820
You might want to maybe square
this and view it as a second

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.420
degree term, and do it like you
did in the previous example.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.540
But then you wouldn't have
fully decomposed this problem.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.900
And so the answer here-- and
I'll just show you how to do

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.830
it, I'll maybe leave it to you
a little bit to think about why

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.700
it works-- is to decompose it
almost like this, but instead

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.180
of having C over x minus
2, you're going to have C

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.005
over x minus 2 squared.

00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:36.720
And I'll try to give
you a little intuition

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.150
about why that happens.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.490
So the decomposition here is
going to be A over x minus 1

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:53.430
plus B over x minus 2 plus
C over x minus 2 squared.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.890
And the intuition here is
that if you were to-- let's

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.270
ignore this term right here.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.790
But if you were to add these
two terms right there, you

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:07.790
would get a rational function
that would end up having

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.200
something times x
plus something.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.390
And so it would be consistent
with what we did in the second

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.960
partial fraction video, where
if you would have a second

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.360
degree term on the bottom, and
the numerator, when you add

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.300
just these two parts-- let
me clarify what I'm saying.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.750
And this is just for intuition.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.990
If you were to add just these
two parts here, you would get

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.680
something times x plus
something, all of that

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.710
over x minus 2 squared.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.110
And that's consistent with what
we did in the previous video,

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.030
where we said if we have a
second degree term in the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.610
denominator-- which this really
is if you were to expand this--

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.930
you should have a first degree
term in the numerator.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:49.830
So I'll leave that there.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.570
That's a little bit of a
nuance, and it's good to

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.570
think about why this works.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.500
But with that said, let's
just solve this problem.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.890
Let me erase some of this
stuff that I've written.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.860
Let me erase all of that.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:07.980
All right.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.590
Ready to work on this problem.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.640
So given that this is the
expansion, now we just have

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.630
to solve for A, B, and C.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.820
So if we were to add these
three fractions, the common

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:27.380
denominator is x minus 1
times x minus 2 squared.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.860
This is a factor of that, so
the least common multiple of

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.290
this and this is just this.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.320
So it's just x minus 2 squared
there, and that's why we

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.200
just did this to begin with.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.920
And the numerator is going
to be-- let me do it in

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.646
a different color-- A.

00:03:45.646 --> 00:03:47.460
What do we have to
multiply A by?

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.860
A times x minus 2
squared, right?

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.330
If we canceled these out,
you're just left with

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.440
A over x minus 1.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:02.400
Plus B times x minus
1 times x minus 2.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.620
Right?

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.670
If we cancel out the x minus
1's and one of these x minus

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.890
2's from down here, you're just
left with B over x minus 2.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.650
Plus C times x minus 1.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.260
If that cancels with that,
we're left with C over

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.850
x minus 2 squared.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.360
And all of this is going to be
equal to-- that up there in

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.410
blue is going to be equal to--
I have to write it smaller-- 6x

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:36.440
squared minus 19x plus 15,
all of that over x minus 1

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.390
times x minus 2 squared.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.370
And like we've done in
every problem so far, the

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.060
denominators are the same, so
we can just set the numerators

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.480
equal to each other and try to
solve for A, B, and C.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.450
Let me write that.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.070
And I'm really just
rewriting it.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:05:00.550
A times x minus 2 squared plus
B times x minus 1 times x minus

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:07.160
2 plus C times x minus 1
is going to be equal to 6x

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.260
squared minus 19x plus 15.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.140
There you go.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.530
And now we have to
solve for them.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.730
And we can do it just the way
we done the previous problems.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.610
We can pick choices for x that
make things cancel out nicely.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.660
So if we wanted to solve
for A, we want to make the

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.380
B and the C cancel out.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.270
We just have to pick
x is equal to 1.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.910
Because if x is equal
to 1, this becomes

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.840
0, so C disappears.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.230
This becomes 0, so this whole
term disappears, and we're

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.360
just left with this and this.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.450
So let's do that.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:39.420
So when x is equal to 1, we
get-- let me pick another

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:47.560
color-- A times, 1 minus 2 is
minus 1, squared is just 1.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.430
So it's A times 1.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.920
So we can just
leave the A there.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.400
This becomes 0, because
this term right here

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.030
will be 0 if x is 1.

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.540
This become 0, because
that term would be 0

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.710
if x is equal to 1.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:05.010
So A is equal to 6 times
1-- so 6-- minus 19 times

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.200
1-- minus 19-- plus 15.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.850
And what is that?

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:16.210
Minus 19 plus 15, that's minus
4, plus 6, that is equal to 2.

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.390
There you go.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.890
Now let's try to solve for--
let's see, what can we do?

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.830
If we make x equal to 2,
the A will disappear.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.760
This whole term will disappear,
because this would be 0.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.220
So we could use that
to solve for C.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:36.560
So if we say that x is equal
to 2, then we get this term

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.270
would be 0, because that's 0.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.930
This whole expression is 0,
because x minus 2 would be 0.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.660
And we're just left with C
times 2 minus 1, so that's

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:51.040
just 1-- so C is equal
to 6 times 4, right?

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.180
2 squared.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:07:00.910
So it's 24, minus 38--
19 times 2-- plus 15.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:07.340
Let's see, 24 plus 15 is 39,
minus 38, that is equal to 1.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.250
We're in the home stretch.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.430
And now for B, there's no
obvious way to make the other

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.600
two cancel out without
making the B cancel out.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.570
But we've solved for everything
else, so we can really just

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.790
pick an arbitrary value for x
that'll make things

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.200
easy to compute.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.870
So if we just pick x is equal
to 0, that's always something

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.760
that can clear out a lot of
the hairiness of an algebra

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.980
problem. x is equal
to 0, not 3.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.760
x is equal to 0.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.630
Let me do that in a
different color.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.690
If x is equal to 0,
then what do we have?

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.350
We have A, but A is 2, right?

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.570
2 times 0 minus 2 squared.

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:46.050
So that's minus 2 squared,
so that's 2 times 4.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:50.690
Plus B-- that's what we're
trying to solve for; we already

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:54.200
solved for everything--
B times minus 1, right?

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.140
0 minus 1 is minus 1.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:03.620
Times minus 2, plus C times
minus 1 is equal to-- well,

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:08.660
if x is 0, then this is 0,
this is 0, is equal to 15.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.190
Then we just solve for B.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:16.240
We get 8 plus 2B, right?

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.280
Minus 1 times minus
2 is plus 2.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.770
Oh, and we shouldn't have
written the C here,

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:22.560
we know what C is.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.580
C is 1.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:24.960
So this is just a 1.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:30.260
So 1 times minus 1 is
minus 1, is equal to 15.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:36.990
And let's see, we have 2B is
equal to, lets see, 16 is

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:41.760
equal to 8, B is equal to 4,
dividing both sides by 2.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.080
So we're done.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.580
So the partial fraction
decomposition of this right

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:54.490
here is A, which we've
solved for, which is 2.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:09:03.440
So it equals 2 over x minus 1
plus B, which is 4-- plus 4

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:12.820
over x minus 2, plus C, which
is 1, over x minus 2 squared.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.780
And what we did in this with
the repeated factor is

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.690
true if we went to a
higher degree term.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:22.970
So if we had blah blah blah,
some polynomial there, and it

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:27.770
was all over x minus-- I
don't know, some number.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:31.420
x minus a to the 10th power.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.770
Well, to the--
well, yeah, sure.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:34.980
To the 10th power.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:40.300
If we wanted to decompose this
partial fraction, or expand it,

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:45.630
it would be A over x minus
a-- it's a different a.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:46.930
I'm just showing this.

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:51.210
Plus B times x minus a
squared, plus, and you

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.220
go blah blah blah.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.270
You'd have 10 terms, plus-- I
don't know what the 10th letter

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.150
of the alphabet is; maybe
it's H or I or something.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:00.510
Maybe it's J.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:05.160
J over x minus a to the 10th.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.550
So you can use that property in
general, though you'll very

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:09.960
seldom see something like this,
because computationally

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.950
it would take you
forever to do it.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:14.440
The hairiest problem that you
might see with three variables

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.290
on an actual exam is probably
something like I showed you in

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.120
the previous example, or what
I just showed you right now.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.950
Anything hairier than
that, you'd probably end

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:23.720
up using a computer.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.270
But you should know how to do
it, because if you have a

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.530
computer and you're solving a
real world problem that is a

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:30.490
lot more complicated than this,
you should know how to do it.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:34.170
Anyway, hope you found
that a bit helpful.
