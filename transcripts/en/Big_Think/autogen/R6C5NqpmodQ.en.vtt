genius is an amorphous term to be sure

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.040
genius is an amorphous term to be sure
 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.680
genius is an amorphous term to be sure
and I actually try to stay away from it

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.690
and I actually try to stay away from it
 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.950
and I actually try to stay away from it
in the book the what I what I talk about

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960
in the book the what I what I talk about
 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.589
in the book the what I what I talk about
in the book mostly is this idea of high

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:19.599
in the book mostly is this idea of high
 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:21.900
in the book mostly is this idea of high
achievement so people becoming great at

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910
achievement so people becoming great at
 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.429
achievement so people becoming great at
stuff becoming really really good at

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439
stuff becoming really really good at
 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.050
stuff becoming really really good at
stuff I don't think it's really

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060
stuff I don't think it's really
 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.260
stuff I don't think it's really
important to make a dividing line some

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270
important to make a dividing line some
 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.819
important to make a dividing line some
to try to figure out you know when

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:29.829
to try to figure out you know when
 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.159
to try to figure out you know when
you've crossed over into into genius the

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169
you've crossed over into into genius the
 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.819
you've crossed over into into genius the
point is gathering your resources doing

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829
point is gathering your resources doing
 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:38.280
point is gathering your resources doing
the best you can pursuing whatever it is

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290
the best you can pursuing whatever it is
 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.150
the best you can pursuing whatever it is
you love to do with with an intensity

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160
you love to do with with an intensity
 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.830
you love to do with with an intensity
and a resilience and a passion and and

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840
and a resilience and a passion and and
 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.400
and a resilience and a passion and and
just going as far as you can possibly go

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410
 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.349
we've been living with this myth for

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359
we've been living with this myth for
 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.060
we've been living with this myth for
about a hundred hundred and fifty years

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070
about a hundred hundred and fifty years
 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.349
about a hundred hundred and fifty years
going back to the time of Darwin

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359
going back to the time of Darwin
 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:59.740
going back to the time of Darwin
although I'm not blaming Darwin for this

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750
although I'm not blaming Darwin for this
 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.389
although I'm not blaming Darwin for this
all they've if the blame resides

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399
all they've if the blame resides
 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.590
all they've if the blame resides
anywhere it's really with Darwin's

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600
anywhere it's really with Darwin's
 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.420
anywhere it's really with Darwin's
cousin Francis Galton and we can get

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430
cousin Francis Galton and we can get
 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.660
cousin Francis Galton and we can get
into that if you like but so the idea is

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670
into that if you like but so the idea is
 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.200
into that if you like but so the idea is
that we we think that its nature versus

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210
that we we think that its nature versus
 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.560
that we we think that its nature versus
nurture that there's there's genes that

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570
nurture that there's there's genes that
 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.170
nurture that there's there's genes that
that have all this information that kind

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180
that have all this information that kind
 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.219
that have all this information that kind
of want to push us in a certain

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229
of want to push us in a certain
 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.779
of want to push us in a certain
direction and then there's the

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789
direction and then there's the
 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:23.480
direction and then there's the
environment which is nurture which is

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490
environment which is nurture which is
 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.090
environment which is nurture which is
which is obviously different and kind of

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100
which is obviously different and kind of
 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.690
which is obviously different and kind of
an opposing force and and it's kind of

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700
an opposing force and and it's kind of
 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.340
an opposing force and and it's kind of
either/or and there's all these studies

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350
either/or and there's all these studies
 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.630
either/or and there's all these studies
that are constantly trying to figure out

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640
that are constantly trying to figure out
 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.359
that are constantly trying to figure out
well how much is nature and then add on

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369
well how much is nature and then add on
 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.130
well how much is nature and then add on
to the nurture you know is it 60-percent

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140
to the nurture you know is it 60-percent
 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.080
to the nurture you know is it 60-percent
nature and 40% nurture depending on what

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090
nature and 40% nurture depending on what
 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.149
nature and 40% nurture depending on what
trait you're talking about well it turns

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159
trait you're talking about well it turns
 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.460
trait you're talking about well it turns
out that genes don't work that way genes

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470
out that genes don't work that way genes
 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.410
out that genes don't work that way genes
don't get you part of the way they're

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420
don't get you part of the way they're
 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.809
don't get you part of the way they're
you know to the point you're born or the

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819
you know to the point you're born or the
 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:49.309
you know to the point you're born or the
point shortly after that or before that

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319
point shortly after that or before that
 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:51.889
point shortly after that or before that
genes are always interacting with the

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899
genes are always interacting with the
 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.020
genes are always interacting with the
environment so the new way to think

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030
environment so the new way to think
 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.569
environment so the new way to think
about this is that it's not nature plus

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579
about this is that it's not nature plus
 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.219
about this is that it's not nature plus
nurture or nascent nature versus nurture

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229
nurture or nascent nature versus nurture
 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.100
nurture or nascent nature versus nurture
if anything its nature interacting with

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110
if anything its nature interacting with
 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.330
if anything its nature interacting with
nurture if you have to use those words

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340
nurture if you have to use those words
 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.370
nurture if you have to use those words
so one of the phrases that scientists

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380
so one of the phrases that scientists
 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.310
so one of the phrases that scientists
are using now is G times e that is

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320
are using now is G times e that is
 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.150
are using now is G times e that is
genetics times environment as opposed to

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160
genetics times environment as opposed to
 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.000
genetics times environment as opposed to
G + E ISM that they call it an additive

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010
G + E ISM that they call it an additive
 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.069
G + E ISM that they call it an additive
model the additive model as well you

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079
model the additive model as well you
 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:17.870
model the additive model as well you
have so much inborn intelligence and

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880
have so much inborn intelligence and
 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.460
have so much inborn intelligence and
then plus what you get in the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470
then plus what you get in the
 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.780
then plus what you get in the
environment that would be you know the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790
environment that would be you know the
 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.699
environment that would be you know the
nature of plus nurture the new the new

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709
nature of plus nurture the new the new
 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.640
nature of plus nurture the new the new
model is you can't separate them you

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650
model is you can't separate them you
 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.920
model is you can't separate them you
just absolutely cannot separate the

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930
just absolutely cannot separate the
 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.310
just absolutely cannot separate the
effects of genes from the effects of the

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320
effects of genes from the effects of the
 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.810
effects of genes from the effects of the
environment so all we can do of course

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820
environment so all we can do of course
 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.289
environment so all we can do of course
is to identify the resources that we

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299
is to identify the resources that we
 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.030
is to identify the resources that we
have in our environments and and

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040
have in our environments and and
 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.790
have in our environments and and
maximize them as best as best we can

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800
 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.300
one of the studies is goes back to 1957

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310
one of the studies is goes back to 1957
 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.970
one of the studies is goes back to 1957
or 58 where these two guys were looking

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980
or 58 where these two guys were looking
 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.390
or 58 where these two guys were looking
at at rats that had been genetically

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400
at at rats that had been genetically
 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.840
at at rats that had been genetically
designed the genetically bred that is to

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850
designed the genetically bred that is to
 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.590
designed the genetically bred that is to
be intelligent and in generation after

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600
be intelligent and in generation after
 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.000
be intelligent and in generation after
intelligent they were incredibly

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010
intelligent they were incredibly
 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.250
intelligent they were incredibly
intelligent in you know is seen in mazes

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260
intelligent in you know is seen in mazes
 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.800
intelligent in you know is seen in mazes
and things like that so then they wanted

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810
and things like that so then they wanted
 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.540
and things like that so then they wanted
to see well what if you subject them to

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550
to see well what if you subject them to
 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.220
to see well what if you subject them to
different environments extreme

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230
different environments extreme
 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.800
different environments extreme
environments like sensory deprivation

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810
environments like sensory deprivation
 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.680
environments like sensory deprivation
kind of thing or extra treats and you

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690
kind of thing or extra treats and you
 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.720
kind of thing or extra treats and you
know so-called intellectual stimulation

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730
know so-called intellectual stimulation
 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.280
know so-called intellectual stimulation
for rats if you can imagine what that is

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290
for rats if you can imagine what that is
 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.930
for rats if you can imagine what that is
basically it's lots of toys and

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940
basically it's lots of toys and
 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.150
basically it's lots of toys and
different textures and sounds and sights

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160
different textures and sounds and sights
 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.670
different textures and sounds and sights
and colors and things like that and they

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680
and colors and things like that and they
 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.800
and colors and things like that and they
wanted to see well what's the additive

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810
wanted to see well what's the additive
 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.200
wanted to see well what's the additive
difference of the environment if you

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210
difference of the environment if you
 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.660
difference of the environment if you
take these these these mice that have

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670
take these these these mice that have
 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.910
take these these these mice that have
been bred to be smart compared to these

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920
been bred to be smart compared to these
 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.920
been bred to be smart compared to these
mice that have been bred to be not so

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930
mice that have been bred to be not so
 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.320
mice that have been bred to be not so
smart well turns out that when you

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330
smart well turns out that when you
 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.970
smart well turns out that when you
subject them to these different

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980
subject them to these different
 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.830
subject them to these different
environments actually the mice that are

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840
environments actually the mice that are
 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.650
environments actually the mice that are
that have have been supposedly bred to

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660
that have have been supposedly bred to
 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.850
that have have been supposedly bred to
be unintelligent quite often intersect

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860
be unintelligent quite often intersect
 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.930
be unintelligent quite often intersect
with the the intelligence the

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940
with the the intelligence the
 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.640
with the the intelligence the
performance of the mice that have been

that you're getting these interactions

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150
that you're getting these interactions
 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.450
that you're getting these interactions
which you couldn't have predicted if you

were looking at the old additive model
 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.150
were looking at the old additive model
of G + E so so that was one of the very

early clues that we're looking at a
whole new model of genes and environment

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910
whole new model of genes and environment
