[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.917
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:19.000
BARON DAVIS: That's right.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.780
Go Bruins.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.555
Don't be afraid.

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:23.305
SACHIT EGAN: Thanks
for being here, Baron.

00:00:23.305 --> 00:00:23.837
BARON DAVIS: Thank you, man.

00:00:23.837 --> 00:00:24.250
I appreciate it.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.070
SACHIT EGAN: You weren't
in Oakland too long ago.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.153
I saw that with Big Three.

00:00:27.153 --> 00:00:30.062
BARON DAVIS: Yeah, we were
here maybe three weeks ago.

00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:31.020
SACHIT EGAN: Very cool.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.732
How was that?

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:33.440
BARON DAVIS: I hit
the game winning shot.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.980
It couldn't get much
better than that.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.000
Right?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.210
Against Al Harrington.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.340
They was up.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.640
And he was like, oh yeah,
we about to win this.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.019
And I got lucky, man.

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:43.560
SACHIT EGAN: I'm
sure it wasn't luck.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.600
BARON DAVIS: Brought back a
lot of nostalgia, you know?

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.790
SACHIT EGAN: Yeah, do you
have favorite memories

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.305
from your time
with the Warriors?

00:00:49.305 --> 00:00:52.590
BARON DAVIS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.460
For me, it was like I didn't
want to come here, right?

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.378
SACHIT EGAN: Really?

00:00:57.378 --> 00:00:59.673
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:00.544 --> 00:01:02.460
BARON DAVIS: Now, everybody
want to come here.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.751
But I didn't want to come here.

00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:05.820
I was getting traded
to New Orleans.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.411
And it was Golden State,
Minnesota, and somebody else.

00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:11.910
And they were like,
all right, we're

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.368
going to trade you
to Golden State.

00:01:13.368 --> 00:01:14.360
I was like, hell no.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.746
I'm not going there.

00:01:15.746 --> 00:01:17.143
They're terrible.

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:19.120
They are horrible.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.760
What am I going
to do over there?

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.160
And then the trade
deadline was approaching.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.467
And it was like five
minutes, two minutes--

00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:27.550
I was like, fuck it, dude.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.482
Just trade me to Golden State.

00:01:28.482 --> 00:01:29.266
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.770
SACHIT EGAN: Get me out of here.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.970
BARON DAVIS: When I
got here, no lie, I

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.200
used to always describe it
like it was just the most

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.790
depressed thing I'd ever--

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.930
it was like basketball
was dead, dude.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:42.550
SACHIT EGAN: You're looking--

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.350
BARON DAVIS: You
know what I mean?

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.670
J. Rich was hurt.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.550
Troy Murphy would walk into
practice like this every day.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.710
Mike Dunleavy was just working.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.080
He was like the only
dude that was working out

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.700
but was frustrated.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.580
And then they had
lost so many games,

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.610
I didn't even know what
the record was, right?

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.740
So I got to the team, I was
like, man, what's going on?

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.620
And the coach, Mike
Montgomery, who was not

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.640
the brightest basketball mind.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.350
But he did coach at Stanford,
so he should be intelligent.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.150
Go Bruins.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.830
Go Bruins.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.960
[INAUDIBLE] Man, it
was just dead in there.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.590
And I was like, damn, dude.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.870
What am I going to do here?

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.570
When I first got there--

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.280
when I started playing, we
won 10 of the last 11 games.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.440
And we had won like
eight in a row.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.290
No, we won nine in a row.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.717
And I was player of
the week for two weeks.

00:02:50.717 --> 00:02:51.550
It was like, "boom!"

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.690
And I was like, damn, dude.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.560
It was like 20,000
plus in their arena.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.540
But they was there
when I got there.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.050
I was like, this is probably
going to be an amazing place.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.160
And then we play San
Antonio Spurs the next game.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.510
And I went to the baseball game.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.120
I was hanging out.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.744
I was like, man, we
won eight in a row.

00:03:09.744 --> 00:03:10.920
That's enough.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.700
Don't want to give
them too much.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.710
And the next year, we sucked.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.880
And then we got the trade
with Stephen Jackson.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.350
And then that was the
whole "we believe" thing.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.870
So for me, it was just like--

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.360
you know, you coming into
a city, and you don't know.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.010
Being from LA, I've always had--

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.157
we beef a lot.

00:03:31.157 --> 00:03:32.490
I don't know if y'all know that.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.420
It was like on all levels--

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.320
tag, basketball,
content, just style.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.010
So I didn't really know how
the Bay Area would receive me

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.480
or how much I would like it.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.345
Man, I fell in love.

00:03:44.345 --> 00:03:45.220
You know what I mean?

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.110
The only time that
I wanted to leave

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.390
was during the summertime.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.780
Because the most coldest
winter I've ever had

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.770
was a day of summer
in San Francisco.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:55.750
SACHIT EGAN: Of course,
in San Francisco.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.380
Very cool.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.700
Talk about getting traded.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.460
I think Wikipedia, where I did
some of my research yesterday,

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.787
[LAUGHTER] said that
you were thrilled

00:04:02.787 --> 00:04:04.870
to come to Golden State,
because you always wanted

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.130
to come back to California.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.930
And that's not so.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:07.190
So--

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.870
BARON DAVIS: Well, no.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.530
You know what?

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.330
When I thought about
it, I was like, damn.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.500
I could be in Minnesota.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.230
Like that's freezing.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.150
Nah, you know what?

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.260
Send me to Oakland, dude.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.810
At least they got good weather.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.829
And I didn't really know
anything about the Bay Area.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.030
Like in all ignorance, all I
knew was like Cal, Stanford--

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.830
I didn't know anything.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.740
And so it was almost like an
enlightening moment for me

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.960
to come in, innocent,
not knowing anything.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.850
So I just kind of
absorbed the culture

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.110
and the culture absorbed me.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.070
SACHIT EGAN: Very cool.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.260
What do you remember about
that culture that really stuck

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.480
with you-- about the area, the
people, the culture, anything

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.979
specific?

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.230
BARON DAVIS: Everybody
was so friendly.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.810
And I think that's
why, ultimately, it's

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.660
easy to come here and
be a basketball star.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.040
Because people see
you on the street,

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.280
they say what's up, give
you daps, keep it pushing.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.460
They take a picture.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.800
It was more like your peers.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.630
It was like you going to work.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.670
You just seeing people.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.410
And people are super cool.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.700
Share ideas.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.390
People are more
interested in all

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.280
the other things
that I was doing

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.460
or the things that
I was interested in.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.030
And so, for me, I live
right in south of Market,

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.450
by like Harlin, John Collins--

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.850
you know, all the clubs.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.240
Just to stay on
top of everything.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.492
But you know--

00:05:33.492 --> 00:05:35.752
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:39.310
But it was a cool
community of people.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.560
And then that's when I really
started getting into tech.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.300
And I wanted to use my
brand to find people

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.410
to leverage what I could
do to, one, give back,

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:52.280
first and foremost.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.130
SACHIT EGAN: We've
been looking forward

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.732
to having you for weeks, now.

00:05:54.732 --> 00:05:56.690
Talking to people-- hey,
Baron Davis is coming.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.440
Baron Davis is coming.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.580
I keep hearing two things.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.330
One, he's my favorite
Warrior of all time.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.288
BARON DAVIS: Thank you.

00:06:01.288 --> 00:06:02.200
Appreciate that.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.766
[CHEERING]

00:06:02.766 --> 00:06:03.799
SACHIT EGAN: And two--

00:06:03.799 --> 00:06:06.048
BARON DAVIS: Probably like
four people are like, yeah.

00:06:06.048 --> 00:06:08.438
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:09.394 --> 00:06:11.110
SACHIT EGAN: And
two, I keep hearing

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.920
when he came to the town,
he really sparked something.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.400
That's carried the Warriors
into this new era--

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.452
three championships.

00:06:18.452 --> 00:06:20.160
Do you feel that
transition like you guys

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.201
really sparked something?

00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:25.570
BARON DAVIS: Yeah, I think
that it's belief, right?

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.180
When I got here, like I
said, it was dead, dude.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.296
I was like, shit, dude.

00:06:29.296 --> 00:06:30.940
Like damn-- flat-line.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:31.440
Seriously.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.481
SACHIT EGAN: That was us.

00:06:32.481 --> 00:06:35.420
BARON DAVIS: And I
was just like, man, it

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.100
started with belief.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.310
So you got to--

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.030
it can't just be the
dudes on the team.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.060
You got to figure out what
the assistants are doing,

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.230
what the team manager--

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.050
like what's the story?

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.710
So for me, it was just
really digging down deep

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.190
and finding out what the
story was, what we could do,

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.360
and what we could really
give back to the team.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:05.270
And so once we figured that
out, it became easier to put on.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.570
And to walk in that
arena and know,

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.370
all right, this
is how we're going

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.870
to turn this thing around.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.510
So it was all with
the belief in people.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.030
And then, when we got Stephen
Jackson and Al Harrington,

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.590
it was just like, all right.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.402
We got to believe in ourselves.

00:07:19.402 --> 00:07:20.860
And I don't know
if y'all remember,

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.010
but when they first
came, we sucked.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.200
And then I got hurt.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.060
And Nellie kind of gave up.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.420
And pretty much everybody
else on the team gave up, too.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.940
And I never forget.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.410
I was like, I'm coming back.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:36.550
And they were like, why
are you coming back?

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.270
Season's over.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:41.290
I was like, dude, because we
can have something special.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.530
If we can just
change our mentality

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.460
from partying in the club
to partying on the court--

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:49.837
let's make this the party.

00:07:49.837 --> 00:07:50.920
Let's make this the party.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.150
Like dog, ain't 20,000 people
showing up in the club.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:55.340
There is like 500 people.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.250
Sometimes it's hot.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.400
Sometimes it's not.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.020
But it's 20,000
people in the arena.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:05.680
If we make this our party,
and we party hard here,

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.740
and we have as much fun,
then anything is possible.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.230
And that's when the
"we believe" happened.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:15.100
I think that kind of sparked the
community to be like, hold on.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.400
We've been waiting for this.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.967
We're the best at fandom.

00:08:19.967 --> 00:08:21.550
We're the best at
supporting our team.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.200
We got the rocking arena.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.140
And when that shit turned
up, dude, it was phenomenal.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.640
It was like you walking into the
arena already at an advantage,

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.505
like a super hero.

00:08:31.505 --> 00:08:32.380
You know what I mean?

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.450
You pulling into
the parking lot.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:37.510
And you don't even
care who you play.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:39.970
You see people barbecuing
and shouting you out.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:43.610
You like, man, whoever it
is, we about to smoke them.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:51.130
[LAUGHTER] So we were kind of
like catalysts to the belief.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.730
And then when the new regime
of ownership-- and you know,

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:57.130
you've got to have
something to build on.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:00.190
And I think that belief and
that whole "we believe" thing

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:02.325
is something that
people never forget.

00:09:02.325 --> 00:09:04.450
SACHIT EGAN: I like your
answer, because I remember

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.040
thinking that it was both.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.360
It was two ways.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.166
It always looked like you
were one of the catalysts, one

00:09:10.166 --> 00:09:12.040
of the emotional cores
of the team, inspiring

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.270
people to believe.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.130
But it looked like you
fed off of it, too.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:16.110
Was it two ways?

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.110
BARON DAVIS: Absolutely.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.770
Absolutely.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.460
I think the whole
team fed off of it.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.945
Because at that point, we
were not in the playoffs.

00:09:23.945 --> 00:09:25.570
We were not going to
make the playoffs.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:29.830
We needed to win
like 20 or 25 games.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:31.720
I think we won like 21 or 22.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.680
I don't even know.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.230
Something like that.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.920
I was like, yo dog, imagine
if we got to the playoffs.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.820
That's like winning
a championship here.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.750
Imagine what that
party would be like.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.950
I was like, if we make
it to the playoffs,

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.130
I'm throwing the biggest
party in San Francisco,

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:50.800
because my birthday is
at the end of the season.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.576
And we made the
playoffs in Portland.

00:09:53.576 --> 00:09:55.450
And then our last game
was against Minnesota.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:56.680
I had a birthday party.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.480
Dude, it was like 7,000 people.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.040
I don't know where
that shit was.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.220
It was like a warehouse.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.610
And it was booming!

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:08.410
[LAUGHTER] But it was just
like, man, if we keep going,

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.530
anything and
everything is possible.

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:14.860
But it was like all odds
were stacked against us.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.960
And we kind of came together.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.160
And when we started
coming together

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.780
and we started winning, the
city started coming together.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.610
And the fans started
coming together.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:27.820
And then we start hanging out--

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.029
Harlot, John Collins--
you know, with our peers.

00:10:31.029 --> 00:10:32.320
But it was like they were fans.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.350
But as soon as we walked off the
court, we were regular people.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:40.930
And I think that's what gave us
the confidence to keep going.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:44.560
SACHIT EGAN: And look, I
think, at the time, the first

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.570
and maybe the only number eight
seed to topple a number one

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:52.150
seed with the MVP, Dirk
Nowitzki, Dallas Mavericks--

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.641
first time that happened
in the seven game format

00:10:54.641 --> 00:10:56.140
for the first round
of the playoffs.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.481
And then there's the dunk.

00:10:57.481 --> 00:10:59.980
I don't know how often you talk
about the dunk on Kirilenko.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.905
BARON DAVIS: Everybody
talk about it every day.

00:11:02.905 --> 00:11:04.780
People talk about it
every day like it's new.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.897
SACHIT EGAN: How many people in
this room screamed at their TV,

00:11:07.897 --> 00:11:09.730
took their shirt off,
ran out in the street?

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.105
BARON DAVIS: I
took my shirt off.

00:11:11.105 --> 00:11:12.246
SACHIT EGAN: We saw that!

00:11:12.246 --> 00:11:14.349
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:14.349 --> 00:11:16.140
Do you want to talk
about what was it like?

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.586
What was your mentality
leading up to that moment?

00:11:18.586 --> 00:11:20.220
BARON DAVIS: I
always say I knew I

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.737
was going to dunk on him,
because he winked at me.

00:11:23.737 --> 00:11:24.570
SACHIT EGAN: He did?

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:25.070
OK.

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:27.120
BARON DAVIS: Yeah, he
literally winked at me.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.900
And if you watch
the play before--

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.770
I think it was
two plays before--

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.890
I went to the hole,
and he was there.

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:36.060
And I laid it up.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.459
And he was like, OK.

00:11:37.459 --> 00:11:38.250
Excuse my language.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.374
He was like, all right,
mother fucker, do it again.

00:11:40.374 --> 00:11:41.590
You know what I mean?

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:44.520
I know y'all loving
having a good time.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.300
Don't play me.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.340
You know Kirilenko-- you
don't play Kirilenko.

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.290
He's going to block it.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:52.259
So I was like, OK.

00:11:52.259 --> 00:11:53.550
It was like an acknowledgement.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:54.570
He was like, all right.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:55.450
I got you.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:56.850
Dog, don't do that again.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:58.570
I was like, hey, man.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:59.140
Don't trip.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.082
My fault. I ain't
going to rub it in.

00:12:01.082 --> 00:12:02.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:05.910
And so I was like,
yo, I'm about to-- he

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.680
was on the other
side of the basket.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.220
So I did the same move.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:15.895
And when I saw him, I was
like, oh, shit, I got him.

00:12:15.895 --> 00:12:16.770
I was like I got him.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:18.830
Because I got off
the floor before him.

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.260
And so when I did
it, when I dunked,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.090
I was like, dude, if I
make this shit, dude--

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:25.850
I don't even know what happened.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.950
I was like, yo, if I make this
shit, dude, I'm telling you.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.710
And that's what was
happening all in the moment.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:36.145
And so when I looked up, I see
my teammates running over like,

00:12:36.145 --> 00:12:36.975
oh, shit.

00:12:36.975 --> 00:12:38.380
And so I'm like, oh.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.270
And I just pulled
my shirt up like ah!

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:43.390
I didn't know what
the fuck I was doing.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:47.415
Then I went back to being cool.

00:12:47.415 --> 00:12:48.820
Like oh, that wasn't nothing.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.012
And I'm seeing dudes
like oh, my god.

00:12:51.012 --> 00:12:51.970
What the fuck happened?

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.280
And I'm like, yo.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.780
I was like, shit.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.400
But it was one of
those things like--

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:56.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:57.675
No, seriously.

00:12:57.675 --> 00:12:58.800
It was one of those things.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.600
I was thinking
about all this shit.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.220
And I was like, damn, dude.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.130
But if I do--

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:06.780
Stephen Jackson wiping me down--

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:07.680
I'm like, shit, dude.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.580
Did I just fuck myself
and become the dude who's

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.390
only known for dunking on--

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:19.720
this is going to be the most
defining moment in my career.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.280
And I like--

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.110
SACHIT EGAN: You're having
these thoughts on the floor?

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.250
BARON DAVIS: The whole thing.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.020
I was like, damn, dude.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:24.930
SACHIT EGAN: You
missed that free throw.

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:25.980
You realize that, right?

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.438
BARON DAVIS: Yeah,
I'm telling you.

00:13:27.438 --> 00:13:28.410
I'm sure I did, dude.

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:31.470
This is all the stuff
that's going in my head.

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:32.230
I'm like, damn.

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:34.650
I'm a better player
than this fucking dunk.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.587
But this dunk was epic.

00:13:36.587 --> 00:13:38.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.280
And so it's like--

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.710
that's what haunts my life.

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:45.760
It keeps me alive and
keeps me relevant.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.140
But at the same time,
it's like, hey, man.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.070
I see you dunk on Kirilenko.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:54.740
And I was like, damn, that
shit was like 20 years ago.

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.642
Sounds pretty good,
too, but fuck it.

00:13:56.642 --> 00:13:58.350
SACHIT EGAN: So we're
learning something.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:00.710
If you dunk on Andre Kirilenko,
game three of the West

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.750
semifinals, it's going to haunt
you for the rest of your life.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:03.916
BARON DAVIS: Oh, it's gonna.

00:14:03.916 --> 00:14:05.927
Yeah, basically.

00:14:05.927 --> 00:14:07.010
SACHIT EGAN: I have here--

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:10.240
I was going to ask you, was
that your defining moment?

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.420
[LAUGHTER] I have it here.

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.170
I think we're going
to skip that question.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:21.160
All right, let's change
it up for a sec, here.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.010
Something that I always really
loved about you and admired

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:26.510
is when you went to
Cleveland, you wore number 85.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:31.420
I wore 85 as a receiver for the
Bellarmine Bells in San Jose.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.580
You're an athlete who
always remembers your roots,

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.331
growing up on 85th
street in the LA area.

00:14:36.331 --> 00:14:38.830
What was the toughest part about
getting from there to being

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.656
a two-time NBA All-Star.

00:14:41.656 --> 00:14:44.920
BARON DAVIS: Survival.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:50.210
So I say, as a kid, you
should never have to survive.

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:54.180
And so when you're
waking up every morning,

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:57.370
you're not thinking
about where you're going.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.250
You're thinking about
how to get to sleep

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.090
to wake up the next day.

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.600
And so I think that
was the hardest part.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.350
As a kid, it's like
you're seeing people

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:11.020
every day surviving.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:12.730
They're living for the next day.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.280
They're living to the next week.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.800
And there's not a
lot of resources

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.860
that are opportunities
that's building

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:24.340
any kind of enlightenment
or anything.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.970
Anything that happens-- if
something positive happened,

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:31.810
you best believe something--
two or three negative things.

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:35.530
And so, for me, it was
like looking at that,

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:40.940
looking at my grandmother
and my grandfather.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:46.390
Looking at how they were
able to just live and be.

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:51.940
And create a foundation
where it was up to you if you

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.655
wanted to survive or not.

00:15:53.655 --> 00:15:54.530
You know what I mean?

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:56.590
It was like you don't
have to survive.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:57.970
You can have a nice home.

00:15:57.970 --> 00:15:59.396
You can have great rules.

00:15:59.396 --> 00:16:00.270
You know what I mean?

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:04.810
And I watched my parents'
generation and uncle's--

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:08.560
I watched them not
really respect that.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.410
And so their lives took a turn.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:13.510
So for me, as a kid,
I saw everything.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:14.405
You know I mean?

00:16:14.405 --> 00:16:17.926
SACHIT EGAN: If I may, your
grandparents opened up the idea

00:16:17.926 --> 00:16:20.425
that you could have something
beyond that-- beyond survival?

00:16:20.425 --> 00:16:25.420
BARON DAVIS: Yeah, it was
just like even though you

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.730
live in the hood and
you live in the house,

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.640
make sure your house clean.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.920
Make sure it's spic and span.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:36.010
Make sure you are presentable.

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:36.850
You are a gentleman.

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:37.870
You clean cut.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.900
Everything that my grandmother
taught me and my grandfather

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:45.400
taught me was in preparation
to be the person that I'm

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.350
supposed to be.

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.890
And so society is
telling me I ain't shit.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:55.090
Well, my grandparents is
telling me you're incredible.

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:58.330
And all you got
to do is take care

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.390
of these fundamental
things, as well as

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:05.300
have these life qualities.

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:12.190
The professionalism and
a gentleman's etiquette--

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:15.318
that's going to propel you
past all of the bullshit.

00:17:15.318 --> 00:17:16.359
SACHIT EGAN: I like that.

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:20.020
I don't think I've read before,
what about your grandparents

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.314
made them that way-- made
them teach you that stuff?

00:17:22.314 --> 00:17:27.530
BARON DAVIS: I think, for them,
they struggled through a lot.

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:30.100
They struggled through
raising their kids

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.410
and having their kids on drugs.

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:35.140
Some kids get locked
up for life in prison.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.820
So they lived it.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:42.010
And so I think that
religion was the thing that

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:43.610
kept them together.

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.940
And it kept them moving on.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.300
It kept them moving
forward and forward.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:54.220
But seeing their kids,
now that I have kids,

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.710
it's like seeing
your kids as adults

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:01.180
and then feeling there's
some sense of failure

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.550
and accountability on both ends.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:07.530
And as the grandkid,
seeing this relationship

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:11.020
and trying to figure out
what it means to them

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:14.080
and what it means
to my parents--

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.790
it was confusing.

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:20.320
But my grandparents
always made it safe.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.610
So you knew you
had a safe place.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:23.880
You had a clean place.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.480
You had food on your table.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.690
You had to do your homework.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:27.730
You got to go to school.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:29.530
You got to do all
the other stuff.

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:32.440
But when you're with your
parents, it's like, shit,

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.720
you don't know what's going on.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.020
You don't know if you
going to school for a week,

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:41.700
or you may just be
hanging out at the park.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.620
I remember a lot of times--

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:48.030
and this is why people say,
damn, you never sleep--

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:55.540
when I was a kid, I used
to be there in the group.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:59.460
And you'd be at the park from
12:00 to 4:00 in the morning.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:03.550
And it's like three
or four other kids.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:06.160
So you live with those things.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.300
You remember those things.

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:08.230
You see those things.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.810
But you're dying to get
back to your grandparents.

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:12.430
And that's the foundation.

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:14.744
They build the safe havens
where we can always go to.

00:19:14.744 --> 00:19:15.910
SACHIT EGAN: That's amazing.

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:16.750
You have two kids?

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:18.412
BARON DAVIS: I got two kids.

00:19:18.412 --> 00:19:20.870
SACHIT EGAN: I was looking at
your Instagram the other day.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:23.818
BARON DAVIS: I'm waiting
for a picture to come up.

00:19:23.818 --> 00:19:24.762
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:24.762 --> 00:19:26.178
SACHIT EGAN: Not today, man.

00:19:26.178 --> 00:19:27.122
I'm sorry.

00:19:27.122 --> 00:19:28.030
I'm sorry.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:31.980
BARON DAVIS: They're great.

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:32.580
They're great.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:35.750
SACHIT EGAN: Yeah, I haven't
seen too many athletes--

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:37.250
frankly, especially,
male athletes--

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:39.050
who have so many
pictures of their kids.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:40.570
Obviously, parenthood
is super important.

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:42.111
Fatherhood is super
important to you.

00:19:42.111 --> 00:19:43.700
What's it been like being a dad?

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.116
BARON DAVIS: It's
been everything.

00:19:45.116 --> 00:19:48.894
I tell you, like Instagram,
people are like, damn, dude.

00:19:48.894 --> 00:19:49.810
I always see your kid.

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:51.080
I'm like, shit.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.420
How do people see my kid?

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:54.912
And I remember every
time I'm getting

00:19:54.912 --> 00:19:56.870
ready to post something
on Instagram, I'm like,

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.250
damn, I need to post.

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:00.070
I only have pictures of my kids.

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:03.110
So I just post pictures
of my kid, and I forget.

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:08.930
But for me, I've learned
so much through my kids.

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:13.720
It's given me freedom
to be a kid again.

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:18.680
It's given me the freedom to
learn, and listen, and explore.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:23.000
And that's probably
the best thing

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.012
that I've ever done in
my life or will ever do.

00:20:27.012 --> 00:20:28.970
SACHIT EGAN: Better than
the dunk on Kirilenko?

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:31.850
BARON DAVIS: Man, way better
than the dunk on Kirilenko.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:32.350
Way better.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:34.891
SACHIT EGAN: And I just laugh,
because I think everybody here

00:20:34.891 --> 00:20:35.420
would agree.

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.010
We always thought
of you and continue

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.050
to think of you as somebody
who was fun loving,

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.840
wasn't afraid to ask
questions, to listen to people,

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:42.640
to be a kid.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.390
So it must be pretty
amazing to now relive

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:45.320
that with your own kids.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.361
BARON DAVIS: Oh, my gosh.

00:20:46.361 --> 00:20:48.320
It's tremendous.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.475
You learn a lot.

00:20:49.475 --> 00:20:52.010
You learn a lot, because
they're listening too.

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:54.205
So you better be
careful what you say.

00:20:54.205 --> 00:20:55.246
SACHIT EGAN: Fair enough.

00:20:55.246 --> 00:20:56.454
BARON DAVIS: I tell you that.

00:20:56.454 --> 00:20:58.800
For new parents out
there, be careful what

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.470
you say in front of your kids.

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:02.975
They'll use it against you.

00:21:02.975 --> 00:21:06.020
SACHIT EGAN: So obviously,
you've been an analyst now

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:07.136
for a while with Turner.

00:21:07.136 --> 00:21:08.510
I'd be remiss if
I didn't ask you

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:11.090
a couple of questions about
the current state of the NBA.

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:13.520
And one thing you
already alluded to is

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.560
the Bay Area is starting
to become a real target

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:16.460
destination.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.120
It used to be South
Beach, LA, New York.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.880
And now, KD and Boogie,
obviously, the Warriors

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.887
are doing well.

00:21:22.887 --> 00:21:24.470
But do you really
think Silicon Valley

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:27.830
is going to sustain itself as
a long term NBA destination?

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.060
BARON DAVIS: Definitely.

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:33.050
I think they have great
management, great ownership,

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:34.460
and they have great players.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.800
And players want to
play with good players.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.030
And they're winning.

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:43.480
And they do it with great style,
with great professionalism,

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:47.520
and you can't ask for
a better situation

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.480
if you're playing
basketball and you're

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.856
trying to play on the highest
stage at the highest level.

00:21:51.856 --> 00:21:54.230
SACHIT EGAN: Now, I want to
ask you this too, because you

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.660
played for some non-big
market teams-- obviously,

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.970
the Knicks, the
Clippers, the Warriors.

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:02.180
But you played for Cleveland
right after LeBron left.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.680
BARON DAVIS: Yes.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.440
SACHIT EGAN: New
Orleans, Charlotte--

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.272
as an analyst--
and by the way, you

00:22:08.272 --> 00:22:09.980
mentioned not wanting
to go to Minnesota.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.050
You are looking at the
largest Minnesota Timberwolves

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:13.010
fan in the Bay Area.

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:14.210
BARON DAVIS: I live
in Minnesota, man.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:15.940
I like the hamster
wheels and all that.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.610
I could've dealt with that.

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:20.180
I could've dealt with
that in the winter time.

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:21.080
SACHIT EGAN: If
Derrick Rose goes down,

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.080
they could use a backup.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.000
BARON DAVIS: Hey, man.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:23.970
Count me in.

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:25.630
SACHIT EGAN: You
heard it here, first.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:26.990
BARON DAVIS: Count
me in, Thibodeau.

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:28.420
SACHIT EGAN: When I
used to play NBA Live,

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.932
the first thing I'd do is trade
Baron Davis to the T-wolves

00:22:30.932 --> 00:22:32.140
every time as my point guard.

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:33.202
BARON DAVIS: Man, see.

00:22:33.202 --> 00:22:35.660
SACHIT EGAN: How do you feel
for these small market teams--

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.960
Minnesota, and New
Orleans, Milwaukee.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.260
I worry about them if they
can't get people for Giannis.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.409
As a player, do you
worry about the equity

00:22:44.409 --> 00:22:46.450
for those teams and those
markets, or not at all?

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:47.770
BARON DAVIS: No.

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:49.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:50.940
I mean, dude, just
hire better management.

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:54.020
Pick better guys.

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:57.740
I'm not going to feel
sorry for anybody.

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:02.730
A lot of these
teams are tanking.

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:06.440
They're hiring, sorry,
like data analysts

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:13.610
to figure out if
somebody is good or not.

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:14.450
I'm sorry.

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:16.780
All you have to do is
watch somebody play, right?

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:22.120
And then say, is he going to
be good for three years doing

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:22.720
that?

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.560
Or can he do that?

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.960
And the data is just
going to say, oh, shit.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.367
There's a mark on the court.

00:23:27.367 --> 00:23:28.450
He makes shots from there.

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:29.440
Duh-duh-duh.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.580
So they have to do a
better job of bringing

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:38.050
in the right management,
drafting the right players,

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:42.840
trading for the right players,
and managing your budget.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.700
There is a ton of good players.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:50.770
How does a player go from
nothing to something?

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:53.020
How does somebody go
from sugar to shit?

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:56.050
It's all about the
team that they are on.

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:59.860
And so a lot of these
general managers and people--

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:01.960
you get somebody like
Giannis, and then

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:05.470
you panic instead
of understanding

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:11.230
what are the pieces I need
to put around Giannis.

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:15.190
And so when you look
at the Milwaukee Bucks,

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:20.230
and you look at that team, is
that the right team for him?

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:21.820
So they should have
probably started

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:25.255
doing that shit two years ago.

00:24:25.255 --> 00:24:25.755
Minnesota--

00:24:25.755 --> 00:24:26.922
SACHIT EGAN: Oh, boy.

00:24:26.922 --> 00:24:28.770
BARON DAVIS: -- your team.

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:30.730
Just a little break down.

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:31.870
Did Jimmy Butler leave?

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:32.790
SACHIT EGAN: No, he's
going to, though.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:33.706
BARON DAVIS: OK, yeah.

00:24:33.706 --> 00:24:35.096
Because he probably should.

00:24:35.096 --> 00:24:37.376
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.270
To be honest.

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.992
SACHIT EGAN: I hear you, man.

00:24:42.992 --> 00:24:44.200
BARON DAVIS: You got Wiggins.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.000
You've got KAT.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.490
And now, you go and
get Jimmy Butler.

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:50.265
And then, who's the point guard?

00:24:50.265 --> 00:24:50.765
Teague?

00:24:50.765 --> 00:24:51.598
SACHIT EGAN: Teague.

00:24:51.598 --> 00:24:53.380
BARON DAVIS: Do any four--

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:57.340
if you're picking
NBA 2K, would you

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:59.580
put those four players
on the team together?

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:00.586
SACHIT EGAN: No.

00:25:00.586 --> 00:25:02.260
BARON DAVIS: Everybody
wants the ball.

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:03.522
SACHIT EGAN: It's
the Timber Bowl, man.

00:25:03.522 --> 00:25:05.014
It's Thibodeau in
the Timber Bowl.

00:25:05.014 --> 00:25:06.680
BARON DAVIS: And then
you hire Thibodeau

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.430
to be the GM and the coach.

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:15.100
And if you guys don't know
who Tom Thibodeau-- he sweats

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.300
thinking about basketball.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.005
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:17.005 --> 00:25:18.630
SACHIT EGAN: Dreaming
about everything.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:20.171
BARON DAVIS: Man,
that's all he does.

00:25:20.171 --> 00:25:22.340
He's like 24/7 basketball.

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.650
And so he's giving
out the checks.

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:25.930
So one day, he loves you.

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:27.115
The next day, he's
gonna trade you.

00:25:27.115 --> 00:25:27.780
SACHIT EGAN: You're
in the doghouse.

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:30.550
BARON DAVIS: You can't give
a coach that much power.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:33.370
Either you're the general
manager or the coach.

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:37.540
Because a general manager is
not going to fire himself.

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.604
And a coach is not
going to fire himself.

00:25:39.604 --> 00:25:41.020
SACHIT EGAN: Sounds
like you might

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.050
have a future in management.

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:45.610
BARON DAVIS: Yeah, once
we kind of get all our--

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:47.820
once I get rich.

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.396
This guy right here.

00:25:49.396 --> 00:25:50.520
He's going to make me rich.

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.634
SACHIT EGAN: OK.

00:25:51.634 --> 00:25:53.116
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:53.116 --> 00:25:54.600
Done.

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.140
We got to talk really
quick about super teams.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.182
Judging by your
previous answer, I

00:25:59.182 --> 00:26:00.890
don't think you care
too much about teams

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:01.890
that aren't super teams.

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:05.240
You're not worried about
KD coming to the Dubs.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.670
I think about it
like playground--

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:08.294
BARON DAVIS: If he
went somewhere else,

00:26:08.294 --> 00:26:09.950
I would have had a
lot of shit to say.

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:11.115
But he came to the Dubs.

00:26:11.115 --> 00:26:12.790
So I don't really
have much to say.

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:17.300
SACHIT EGAN: What
about the GOAT.

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.110
I could be wrong.

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:20.674
I feel like I've seen you
say that LeBron is the GOAT?

00:26:20.674 --> 00:26:21.340
BARON DAVIS: No.

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:22.306
SACHIT EGAN: OK, no.

00:26:22.306 --> 00:26:22.806
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:22.806 --> 00:26:24.460
BARON DAVIS: I
said he is a GOAT.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.110
I said he is a GOAT.

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:28.750
Like the GOAT?

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:31.060
I say LeBron is a
GOAT because of who

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:32.860
he is as a person--
what he's been

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:37.540
able to do both on the
court and off the court.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:42.430
And as the evolution
of the athlete grows,

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:44.940
so does our fandom, and
so does our celebrity.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.950
And I think that he's
done an excellent job

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:53.440
of taking basketball and
taking who he is as a person

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.240
and building both
at the same time.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:00.790
When you think of LeBron James,
even if you're not a basketball

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:07.660
fan, you appreciate and respect
him as a man, as a businessman,

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:09.970
as a father, and all that.

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:14.830
To me, that's why I give
him GOAT status so early.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:20.620
Because he's actually
taken every sense

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:23.500
of the word of a
superstar, from the time

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.110
he's landed in the league.

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:27.421
And he's never disappointed us.

00:27:27.421 --> 00:27:29.530
SACHIT EGAN: And
I like that answer

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:31.440
GOAT overall, but as
far as basketball GOAT

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.025
goes, do you care
about the rings?

00:27:34.025 --> 00:27:34.739
Does he need six?

00:27:34.739 --> 00:27:35.530
Does he need seven?

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:36.790
Or are you out of that debate?

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:45.505
BARON DAVIS: Michael Jordan
is 6-0 in the finals.

00:27:45.505 --> 00:27:47.110
SACHIT EGAN: Hard to beat.

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:50.192
BARON DAVIS: Who else
is 6-0 in the finals?

00:27:50.192 --> 00:27:51.850
SACHIT EGAN: Was Bill Russell?

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:53.500
BARON DAVIS: Bill
Russell got 11.

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:54.480
He was not 6-0, though.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.521
SACHIT EGAN: That's true.

00:27:55.521 --> 00:27:57.130
BARON DAVIS: He lost a couple.

00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:58.480
But Bill Russell.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.135
You got Kareem.

00:27:59.135 --> 00:28:00.700
You got Michael Jordan.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:01.510
You got LeBron.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:02.350
You got Magic.

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:03.480
You got Bird.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:08.690
You got Dr. J. It's hard to
have these conversations.

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:11.890
It's great to have them.

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:14.320
I think that the media
has these conversations,

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.000
because they don't have
nothing else to talk about.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:20.320
And so when you
look in on the news,

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.900
it's like oh, LeBron said.

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:22.940
Oh, Scotty Pippin said.

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.340
Oh, it's like the same
conversation, dude.

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.340
SACHIT EGAN: I hear you.

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.100
BARON DAVIS: But
these guys, I like

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:32.020
to think of them as artists.

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:36.730
And a lot of these guys
are like one of ones.

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:39.520
Michael Jordan will never,
ever, ever be duplicated.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.650
Neither will Iceman
George Gervin.

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:43.810
Neither will Larry Bird.

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:47.980
So for me, I kind of give
them their own superhero GOAT

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.030
status.

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:52.990
Because it's hard
to play in the sport

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:56.770
and transcend the sport
to where people know who

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:59.620
you are by how you play.

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:03.390
And they figure out your
personality by how you play.

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:04.380
SACHIT EGAN: Cool.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.779
I'm going to ask you one
more basketball question.

00:29:06.779 --> 00:29:08.320
I don't know how
you feel about this.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.361
But you were there
for Linsanity.

00:29:10.361 --> 00:29:10.860
And--

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:11.735
BARON DAVIS: Ah, man.

00:29:11.735 --> 00:29:13.870
That was like the
craziest shit ever.

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:18.430
That was like the
worst thing ever, dude.

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:24.022
It was like being apart
of the worst thing ever.

00:29:24.022 --> 00:29:29.300
[LAUGHTER] It was so great.

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:33.782
But to be the teammate,
it was just like, dude.

00:29:33.782 --> 00:29:36.757
Are you-- is this
really happening?

00:29:36.757 --> 00:29:38.340
SACHIT EGAN: That's
how we felt, yeah.

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.720
BARON DAVIS: And
after every game,

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.140
I would go to Mike D'Antoni.

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:43.300
And like the first game--

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.100
because I was like, coach,
you got to put him in, dude.

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:50.110
He's the only one who goes
north south until I come back.

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:54.610
So it was like, I'm supposed to
come back, play for the Knicks.

00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:55.570
Jeremy Lin was there.

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:57.940
And I was like,
coach, I can't do it.

00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:59.540
Jeremy Lin plays in Houston.

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:03.340
He scores six points, has
three assists in garbage time.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:08.560
But he had more than Shump, who
was a rookie, and Tony Douglas,

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.170
who was just struggling
playing the point guard role.

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:13.277
So after the Houston game,
I was like, coach, man.

00:30:13.277 --> 00:30:14.110
You got to play him.

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:15.901
He was like, I ain't
playing no Jeremy Lin.

00:30:15.901 --> 00:30:17.100
That was garbage time.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.750
I was like, he's only one
that goes north and south.

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:22.340
If anything, if we
can get 6 points and 3

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:24.820
assists somewhere
in the game, we

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.330
wouldn't be getting blown out.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:29.669
[LAUGHTER] So I'm like,
coach, give me a week.

00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:31.210
He was like, man,
I ain't got a week.

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:32.304
I'm going to lose my job.

00:30:32.304 --> 00:30:33.220
I was like well, shit.

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.036
I can't help you, dog.

00:30:35.036 --> 00:30:37.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:39.280
So I'm working out.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.860
Melo gets hurt.

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:41.970
And I'm working out.

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:44.230
And we're watching the
Brooklyn, Nets game.

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:45.130
SACHIT EGAN: Oh, boy.

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:47.380
BARON DAVIS: And I'm
in the locker room.

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:48.491
And he puts Jeremy Lin in.

00:30:48.491 --> 00:30:49.740
I'm like, come on, Jeremy Lin.

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:50.547
Let's go.

00:30:50.547 --> 00:30:51.130
And he scores.

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:51.400
Boom!

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.108
Yeah, that's what I'm
talking about, man.

00:30:53.108 --> 00:30:53.927
Make me look good.

00:30:53.927 --> 00:30:54.426
6 points.

00:30:54.426 --> 00:30:55.320
Boom!

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.920
18, 22, I'm like,
oh, shit, dude.

00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:58.934
Like we [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:58.934 --> 00:31:00.350
Dude's running in
the locker room.

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:03.710
Like the Knicks ain't
never felt like that.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:05.150
Lifting him up.

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:06.100
So coach D'Antoni.

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:06.880
I was like, man.

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.542
He was like, ah,
get out of my face.

00:31:08.542 --> 00:31:13.130
[LAUGHTER] Come
back the next game.

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:17.750
So come back the next
game, but the morale is up.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:18.740
Melo still out.

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:19.990
The morale is up.

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.820
I'm coming back.

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.360
But everybody is like,
yo, this is fucking great.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.970
This is the best thing
about basketball.

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:29.600
It doesn't matter who you are,
but if you are the least likely

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.950
person to help the
team win, he was just

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:36.180
like the darling for the day.

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:39.200
Then the next game, he
had another good game.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:39.800
Wow!

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:40.780
This is amazing!

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:42.590
This is what winning
feels like, guys!

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:43.570
Two in a row.

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:45.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:50.780
All along, D'Antoni comes
in like, well, shit.

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.480
Second game he goes, [MUMBLING].

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:55.220
Third game, it was
like, OK, dude.

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.470
We about to play the
Lakers or something.

00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:59.350
I think we were-- no,
we went to Toronto.

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:01.406
We play Toronto, and
that's when he hit the--

00:32:01.406 --> 00:32:02.155
BOTH: Game winner.

00:32:02.155 --> 00:32:04.940
BARON DAVIS: So it
was like all the drama

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:09.232
was building towards this dude
having the last second shot.

00:32:09.232 --> 00:32:10.190
And he fucking made it.

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:11.530
SACHIT EGAN: It was a lot of--

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:13.321
BARON DAVIS: And it
was like, no way, dude.

00:32:13.321 --> 00:32:15.150
It was like, no way, dude.

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:18.440
And everybody on the team
was like, yo, this is crazy.

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.840
So we rushed the court.

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:21.410
It was just like--

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:27.610
Jeremy Lin is the anti brand
of what you would think

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:31.190
of a superstar or an athlete.

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:34.210
Like Christian, sleeps
on his brother's couch.

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:36.530
It was like the best story ever.

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:38.470
And we get back to
New York, dude--

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:41.390
and I swear to God,
before the next game,

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:43.390
the media room was
like-- he had to go.

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:45.350
He couldn't even be
in the locker room.

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:47.900
There was this much
media in the locker.

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.366
And everybody was like,
you're shitting me, right?

00:32:50.366 --> 00:32:52.190
You're shitting me, right?

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:53.240
And we played the Lakers.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.531
So it was like, all right, man.

00:32:54.531 --> 00:32:56.710
Kobe coming into the garden.

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:59.130
Kobe going to bust his bubble.

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:00.550
So I'm still out.

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:02.150
So I go to the
Laker locker room.

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:04.010
I'm like, Kobe,
man, you better not

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:06.142
let this dude bust your ass.

00:33:06.142 --> 00:33:06.642
I swear.

00:33:06.642 --> 00:33:09.044
[LAUGHTER] I swear to
god, you better not

00:33:09.044 --> 00:33:10.210
let this dude bust your ass.

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:11.460
He was like, yeah, I got him.

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.104
And I said, all right, dude.

00:33:13.104 --> 00:33:13.770
All right, dude.

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:14.760
I'm telling you.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.203
He on a roll.

00:33:16.203 --> 00:33:20.820
[MOUTH NOISES] Kicked
the Lakers ass.

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:23.750
Once he kicked the Lakers
ass, it was over, dude.

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:26.040
He could not go
anywhere in New York.

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.870
People were calling
me from LA like,

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:30.129
yo, what's up with Jeremy Lin?

00:33:30.129 --> 00:33:31.920
What do you mean what's
up with Jeremy Lin?

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:32.836
Is he dating somebody?

00:33:32.836 --> 00:33:34.940
Like, dude, get the
fuck off my line.

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:36.700
What are you talking about?

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:40.145
[LAUGHTER] So D'Antoni comes in.

00:33:40.145 --> 00:33:41.370
And I'm like, dude.

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:44.250
He's like, this boy, he got
fucking angels in the outfield.

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:47.290
And so I was like, yeah this is.

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:49.720
This is angels in the outfield.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:54.450
And I think we won like
three or another game or so.

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:56.760
And then Melo came back.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.260
And then we lost.

00:33:58.260 --> 00:33:59.492
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:59.492 --> 00:34:01.200
SACHIT EGAN: He's
going back to D'Antoni.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.100
BARON DAVIS: No, we lost a game.

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:02.910
We lost a game.

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:05.820
But it was because we played
against Brooklyn again.

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.860
And Deron Williams
wasn't having that shit.

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:10.199
He just wasn't having it.

00:34:10.199 --> 00:34:11.074
You know what I mean?

00:34:11.074 --> 00:34:12.420
So it was just like, uh oh.

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:15.179
OK, now the smoke is coming.

00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:16.090
Man, I'm telling you.

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:18.210
It was only like two weeks.

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:22.270
It was the biggest shit
I've ever seen in my life.

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:26.159
It was like being on the team
with Michael Jordan times 10

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:28.280
for 2 weeks.

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:30.480
It was this amount of
media in the locker,

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.250
to where it was
like, come on, dude.

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:32.940
Please.

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.239
You couldn't get dressed.

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:37.679
It was just like, dude, just
go fucking get another locker

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:38.940
with all these like--

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:41.600
it was the craziest
thing I've ever--

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.790
It was great, but at the
same time, I was like, yo,

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:46.530
this can't last.

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:48.000
This can't last.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:48.920
And it didn't.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.989
Once we played Miami,
and LeBron them--

00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:55.350
right before the
All-star game, they

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:58.290
wouldn't even let the dude
get on the court to warm up.

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:00.805
They were like salivating at
the mouth, like come on, dude.

00:35:00.805 --> 00:35:01.595
Let's go.

00:35:01.595 --> 00:35:04.260
We about to shut him up.

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:05.980
And that was the
end of Linsanity.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.980
SACHIT EGAN: I'm going as
Baron one more question.

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:13.396
So if you want to start going
up to the mic for audience Q

00:35:13.396 --> 00:35:14.690
and A, feel free to go ahead.

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:16.400
You brought this up in
your answer just now.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.191
That's the greatest
thing about basketball.

00:35:18.191 --> 00:35:21.320
This nobody, this
unexpected hero steps up.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.880
Good game, good game, good game.

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.254
When you and I talked on the
phone a couple of weeks ago,

00:35:25.254 --> 00:35:27.920
you told me that your thesis
in life and in business

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.100
now is I believe in underdogs.

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:32.600
Can you talk about that and
what you're doing after your NBA

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.100
career with underdogs?

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:39.800
BARON DAVIS: So for me, opening
up a venture studio, marketing,

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.110
creative business
strategy, full production

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:43.910
and platform building--

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:47.930
and looking at athletes
as content makers.

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:51.950
Looking at content
makers as content makers.

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:55.700
Looking at all the things
that I had to go through

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.050
to reinvent myself.

00:35:57.050 --> 00:36:00.590
I want to be a movie
producer and produce films.

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:03.920
And you go to a studio,
and they're like no.

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:04.702
No?

00:36:04.702 --> 00:36:05.660
What the fuck you mean?

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.110
This shit is hot.

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:10.670
So it was like why
can't we say yes?

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:15.230
And I wanted to build
a platform and also

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:18.860
have venture capabilities
to be able to find

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:22.310
the next wave of talent,
to be able to give access

00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:28.380
to the minority,
whatever you are.

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:31.320
The minority is somebody
who's just basically

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:35.400
been told that you can't do some
shit that you know you can do.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.630
And so just building the
company and building a brand

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:45.090
off of connecting the
dots, packaging the dots,

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:47.840
and then fueling the dots
with the right people

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.570
and the right capital
and the right team

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:52.310
to get successes and wins.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:55.460
Because not everybody is
going to be the Golden State

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:59.330
Warriors in tech.

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:03.080
Nobody's going to be the
big major investment firm.

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.180
But I think that if we
make smart decisions

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:08.460
and know what we
are and who we are--

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:11.720
and using sports
as the landscape

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:16.490
and also as my
business school, I

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:19.330
can apply that to pretty
much any industry,

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:22.840
knowing where my
talents of connectivity

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.260
and where we're smart at.

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.840
SACHIT EGAN: I just want to
say, you've taken that thesis--

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:27.590
that goal--

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:29.480
to help people who
are under-served

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.130
or minorities or underdogs.

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:32.000
You're doing a lot.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.680
There's BIG-- Business
Inside the Game.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.670
There's Black Santa Company.

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:36.295
Do you want to mention
any of that or--

00:37:36.295 --> 00:37:38.900
BARON DAVIS: Yeah, so
Business Inside the Game is--

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:44.540
I have a lot of contacts and
just know a lot of people.

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:47.370
And I would start--

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:50.630
I got on the circuit
for the VC Summit

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:52.550
Circuit and all that shit.

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:55.790
And I was like, man,
this shit hella boring.

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:59.100
[LAUGHTER] I can't be
doing this the whole time.

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.730
So I'd go a day, and then
I'd leave like, man, this

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:03.470
is the same information.

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:05.780
And so I created
Business Inside the Game

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:08.535
based on the Notorious
B.I.G., because that stands

00:38:08.535 --> 00:38:11.070
for business instead of game.

00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:14.620
And so I was like, yo, we need
to have summits and dinners

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:17.800
and mixers where it's us--

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.490
where it's the next
generation of people

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:22.580
that are not getting the
access to these stiff crowds.

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:24.920
I don't want to be in the 1%.

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.410
Because that ain't cool.

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:29.330
I don't drink wine like that.

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:31.910
I don't shoot quail,
all that shit.

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:34.630
I don't do none of that.

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:39.400
I play video games,
and I make music.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.810
But there's musicians.

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:41.720
There's athletes.

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:45.150
There's COOs that
are ready to leave.

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:47.750
And so for business
inside the game,

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:49.370
we want to create
a platform where

00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:52.730
the culture has an opportunity
to share their wins.

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:54.620
And the culture
has an opportunity

00:38:54.620 --> 00:39:00.170
to connect and build
partnerships and just

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:05.540
build friendships through
a well-manicured database

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:08.900
of executives, athletes,
and people who are cultured

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:13.700
and who know what their
next best business move is.

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:14.870
You Wish.

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:19.490
I trademarked Black
Santa, because I

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:20.900
am obsessed with Walt Disney.

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:24.140
And I felt, as a
creative, nobody

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:26.930
will really respect
me as a creative

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:28.670
until I created something.

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:31.310
And so I created Black Santa.

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:35.180
And that's due to
launch this Christmas.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:39.200
But the thought around it was
there are no representations

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:44.210
of color in animation.

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:47.630
So as a kid, growing up,
going back to survival,

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:50.090
how can I get the--
and when you think

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:55.430
about what that survival leads
to from a police brutality

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:57.474
standpoint-- the things
that we're going through

00:39:57.474 --> 00:39:58.890
from a social
justice standpoint--

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:02.720
it's because that kid don't
see himself in the cartoons.

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:06.410
That little girl don't
see herself as a princess.

00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:11.470
And so from that, I wanted to
attack the most low hanging

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:11.970
fruit.

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:13.011
And that was Santa Claus.

00:40:13.011 --> 00:40:16.710
He got $56 billion worth
of equity built into him.

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:19.590
And it was just like hey,
man, you need a competitor.

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:23.580
[LAUGHTER] Somebody
who's cool and cultured.

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:25.920
And I think that
we're launching You

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:32.010
Wish, which is a storytelling
platform for storytellers

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:36.140
and creators to be able to
tell stories of diversity

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:39.840
and basically, about how
we celebrate culture.

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.580
We celebrate heritage.

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:45.040
And we express that
through storytelling.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.530
And then SLIC is obviously--

00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:47.410
I'm an athlete--

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:49.620
Sports Lifestyle in Culture.

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:51.570
That's a platform
we're launching.

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:54.345
And that's really for
athletes to engage,

00:40:54.345 --> 00:40:56.010
and their content
makers to engage

00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:58.740
in the cool things around
the lifestyle of sport,

00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:01.040
the lifestyle of music
and entertainment

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.610
converging on a platform.

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:04.860
Because we feel
that, through sports,

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:07.860
we have so many connectivities
and touch points,

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:11.550
why isn't basketball-- why isn't
a sport considered culture?

00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:14.102
And so that's what we're
building with SLIC.

00:41:14.102 --> 00:41:15.060
SACHIT EGAN: Very cool.

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.420
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
coming today, Baron.

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:16.980
BARON DAVIS: Thank you, man.

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:17.700
AUDIENCE: Quick
question for you.

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:19.050
Could you talk about
your experience playing

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:20.340
in the Big Three league?

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:23.100
And any future potential
you see for that league?

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.615
Where do you see that heading?

00:41:24.615 --> 00:41:27.420
BARON DAVIS: It's
a great league.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:28.440
They foul a lot.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:29.730
They foul a lot.

00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:33.800
[LAUGHTER] But I think Ice
Cube's doing a great job.

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:36.690
It's just showing that the
game that we're playing,

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:39.390
basketball, is expanding.

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:41.550
And there's room for disruption.

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:43.200
There's room for opportunity.

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:48.000
Summer basketball is
an untapped market.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.050
Because the NBA hardly barely
ever plays in that time frame.

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:56.790
But when you look at
basketball as a global sport,

00:41:56.790 --> 00:42:00.040
it's continuing to
reach higher limits.

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:02.490
And I think something
like the Big Three, when

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:04.860
you have retired guys who
still can play, or still

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:07.572
think they can play, or should
be on the Warriors for one

00:42:07.572 --> 00:42:09.780
year and get a championship,
or something like that--

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:12.180
[LAUGHTER] --then
it gives us a chance

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:14.280
to just showcase what we do.

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:17.970
But whether we go back to the
NBA or get a job overseas,

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:22.230
we just fulfill that
nugget for the summer.

00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:25.393
I think we're definitely
on to something with that.

00:42:25.393 --> 00:42:26.160
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:26.460
BARON DAVIS: Thank you.

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:28.520
AUDIENCE: This is a little
bit on a funnier note.

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.660
But when you made that
comedy series like,

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:32.680
Baron Davis Comeback,
and Steve Nash

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.180
tells you he doesn't
eat pizza, what

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:35.950
was going through your mind?

00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:38.848
BARON DAVIS: Like what the fuck
you mean you don't eat pizza?

00:42:38.848 --> 00:42:41.243
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:42.201 --> 00:42:49.523
I hate Steve Nash, by
the way, because of that.

00:42:49.523 --> 00:42:52.022
Because it actually makes me
look fat, you know what I mean?

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:57.020
All right.

00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:00.030
AUDIENCE: Do you actually get
to eat pizza during the season?

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:01.220
Or do you try to refrain?

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:03.774
BARON DAVIS: I eat pizza
all the time, dog, shit.

00:43:03.774 --> 00:43:05.238
[LAUGHTER] Shit.

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:08.310
I'm retired.

00:43:12.318 --> 00:43:14.760
AUDIENCE: Thanks for making
Bay Area basketball relevant.

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:15.718
BARON DAVIS: Thank you.

00:43:15.718 --> 00:43:19.960
I need a YouTube TV
channel, don't y'all think?

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:20.970
Make it out the bag.

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:21.980
What it do with the bag?

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:23.449
Never mind.

00:43:23.449 --> 00:43:25.740
AUDIENCE: I remember growing
up and going to the games,

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:26.989
I watched Thunder, the mascot.

00:43:26.989 --> 00:43:29.040
BARON DAVIS: Yeah,
rest in peace, right?

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.000
SACHIT EGAN: He died?

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:30.530
AUDIENCE: Well, no.

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:31.320
The second one.

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.090
I went to school with him.

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:33.245
He was-- he's still around.

00:43:33.245 --> 00:43:33.930
BARON DAVIS: Oh, OK.

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:34.650
The one before him passed away.

00:43:34.650 --> 00:43:35.650
AUDIENCE: Yeah, rest in peace.

00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:36.290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:37.330
But you came through,
and we were like, well,

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:39.205
we could watch people
play basketball and not

00:43:39.205 --> 00:43:40.030
just the mascot.

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:42.760
But how is your
relationship with the rest

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:44.050
of the "we believe" team.

00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:45.790
BARON DAVIS: Oh,
we still hang out.

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:47.830
We still all in a group chat.

00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:50.720
We do business together.

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.940
A couple of us playing
on the Big Three.

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:55.870
So we stay down for each other.

00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:58.090
C.J. Watson just got married.

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:00.470
We was all at his
wedding turning up.

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:02.120
So shit don't stop.

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.060
It don't stop.

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:04.360
It's a brotherhood, you know?

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:05.550
It's a brotherhood.

00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:09.345
So for me, I know I got a
responsibility to those dudes,

00:44:09.345 --> 00:44:10.720
because we had
something special.

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:13.657
So I check on everybody
and keep them around.

00:44:13.657 --> 00:44:14.740
AUDIENCE: Well, thank you.

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:17.170
And one day, I hope
you end up on Inside

00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:18.700
the NBA with Shaq and them.

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:20.240
BARON DAVIS: Thank you, man.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.637
I hope one day before that
I end up on the Warriors

00:44:22.637 --> 00:44:24.178
and get me championship
or something.

00:44:24.178 --> 00:44:26.568
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:30.180
AUDIENCE: I've got
a quick question.

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:31.980
As someone who invests
a lot in everything

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:34.260
from media to new
technology, how

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:36.270
do you evaluate if
something is worth your time

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:38.490
and energy to invest in?

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:41.070
BARON DAVIS: I think the
way that we look at it

00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:43.570
is how can we help?

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:45.180
How can we support?

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:49.380
So I think listening, for me,
is the most important thing

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:53.260
to see where we can kind of
plug and play with the company.

00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:57.360
So I'm sure, different than
a lot of other investors

00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:02.330
or in venture funds, they'll
give you money and say go.

00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:04.560
It's hard for us
to give you money.

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:08.410
So we're always looking
at what do you need?

00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:09.830
How does this make sense for us?

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:12.120
How does this make sense
in the marketplace?

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:15.930
And then if we can plug-in
and support from what we do,

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:18.620
then that's where we
make the investment.

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:20.980
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:22.300
Hi Baron, thanks for coming.

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:23.140
My name is Richard.

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:24.020
I'm from LA as well.

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:24.740
BARON DAVIS: OK, that's
what I'm talking about.

00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:26.035
AUDIENCE: Long time Bruin fan.

00:45:26.035 --> 00:45:26.910
BARON DAVIS: Dodgers?

00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:28.120
AUDIENCE: Yes, sir.

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.205
Dodgers, Lakers--

00:45:29.205 --> 00:45:31.470
BARON DAVIS: Yeah, Lakers?

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:34.356
I don't want to get rushed
in here, but you know.

00:45:34.356 --> 00:45:35.730
AUDIENCE: Two part
question-- how

00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:38.100
did it feel when you went back
home to play for the Clippers?

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:39.016
BARON DAVIS: Horrible.

00:45:39.016 --> 00:45:40.900
No, I'm just playing.

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:42.680
Actually, I looked
at the Clippers.

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:44.930
I thought it was going to
be the same as the Warriors.

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:45.930
Give me three years.

00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:48.180
I'll be able to turn
this thing around.

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:52.290
And we kind of did, but I didn't
know what I was necessarily

00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:53.550
getting into.

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:59.280
I just think that it was
100 times worse than walking

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:03.210
into the Warriors, who was
just a bad organization

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:06.330
and bad at basketball
management.

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:08.440
The Clippers was just
all fucked up, man.

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:09.590
It was racist.

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:11.640
It was racist, sexist.

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:14.970
All kind of crazy weird
shit was going on.

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:20.760
And for me, it was like,
damn, how do you navigate?

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.160
How do you stand
above all of this?

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.460
And so for me, it
was probably the most

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:28.050
trying time in my life.

00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:34.360
But I think out of that,
I became the most humble.

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:36.490
That was the most humbling
experience for me.

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:38.925
And it made my
character stronger.

00:46:38.925 --> 00:46:41.959
AUDIENCE: Also lastly, how
about playing against Kobe?

00:46:41.959 --> 00:46:42.500
How was that?

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:43.830
BARON DAVIS: It was cool.

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:45.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:47.340
Saw Kobe again on this one.

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.740
AUDIENCE: Hey Baron,
my name is Kyle.

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.240
And I support the
recruiting team.

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:54.412
So our intramural
team starts this week.

00:46:54.412 --> 00:46:56.370
So if you want to join,
we need a fifth person.

00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:57.703
BARON DAVIS: You got some money?

00:46:57.703 --> 00:46:59.707
AUDIENCE: But my question--

00:46:59.707 --> 00:47:01.040
BARON DAVIS: You got some money?

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.400
AUDIENCE: We can find some.

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.358
BARON DAVIS: All right.

00:47:03.358 --> 00:47:04.930
Pay for my plane ticket.

00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:05.775
Man, I'll be here.

00:47:05.775 --> 00:47:06.275
Woo.

00:47:06.275 --> 00:47:07.240
AUDIENCE: All right,
I'll let you know.

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:08.926
BARON DAVIS: Will
I get free lunch?

00:47:08.926 --> 00:47:11.147
AUDIENCE: We got free food,
if you want free food.

00:47:11.147 --> 00:47:12.896
BARON DAVIS: Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

00:47:12.896 --> 00:47:14.687
AUDIENCE: I'll take
you to the best places.

00:47:14.687 --> 00:47:17.130
Anyway, if you could
have one more epic

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:22.920
highlight on any person, past
or present, who would you choose

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:25.980
and why?

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:31.680
Like one more epic
Kirilenko dunk or crossover.

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:34.600
BARON DAVIS: Who is the
most famous NBA player now?

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.670
I'd do something to him.

00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:36.412
AUDIENCE: LeBron.

00:47:36.412 --> 00:47:37.870
BARON DAVIS: Yeah,
I'd dunk on him.

00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:40.860
I'd dunk on LeBron, since
he's the most popular.

00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:42.570
That'd probably be it.

00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:44.340
AUDIENCE: Cool, thanks.

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:46.975
I know the Kirilenko
dunk still haunts you,

00:47:46.975 --> 00:47:47.850
like you were saying.

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:49.635
But it made me fall
in love with the game.

00:47:49.635 --> 00:47:50.340
BARON DAVIS: Thank you, man.

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:50.900
AUDIENCE: I appreciate it.

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:53.399
But I wanted to know who was
the toughest defender you faced

00:47:53.399 --> 00:47:54.000
and why?

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.910
And then also, who was the one
guy that tried to check you up,

00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:58.620
and you would just
think, oh, it's over.

00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:00.600
This is too easy.

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.400
BARON DAVIS: I hate
to sound cocky guys,

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.200
but nobody can guard me.

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:07.710
So-- [LAUGHTER] --I
even made t-shirts

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:08.960
saying, "can you guard me?"

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:11.940
I ask guys now in the
NBA, can they guard me?

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:16.770
So to that question, the
toughest defender was teams.

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:19.780
Because they would just
kind of stack the deck.

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:22.700
But individually, nobody.

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:23.760
I would love to have--

00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:28.620
I love when it's a
one-- like with Kobe.

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:32.160
Or the best thing
about the NBA is when

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.375
guys start taking it personal.

00:48:34.375 --> 00:48:36.000
It's like, man, I'm
going to check him.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:36.810
Oh, I got him.

00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:37.840
It's like, OK.

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.876
Don't tell them to help,
and let's see what happens.

00:48:40.876 --> 00:48:48.060
[LAUGHTER] And so to
me, it didn't matter.

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:51.120
As a point guard, you got to
play against your defender.

00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:56.431
And you got to read
the other eight.

00:48:56.431 --> 00:48:58.680
The other eight players--
your players, their players.

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:04.730
So my responsibility was more
about archetyping the game

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:07.310
than worry about
who was guarding me.

00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:09.300
That was the least
of my worries.

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:11.940
AUDIENCE: Just out of
curiosity, what is the best,

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:15.045
most messed up trash talk
you ever heard on the court?

00:49:15.045 --> 00:49:17.142
SACHIT EGAN: It's got to be KG.

00:49:17.142 --> 00:49:18.630
BARON DAVIS: Gary Payton.

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:22.850
It was my first
year in the league.

00:49:22.850 --> 00:49:23.740
We're in Seattle.

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:25.290
It's 12:00.

00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:28.570
Noon games are horrible for
NBA dudes, especially veterans,

00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:32.660
because they don't
want to wake up.

00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:33.999
And so I was like, damn, dude.

00:49:33.999 --> 00:49:35.040
I'm going to go in early.

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.410
Because all the vets
don't like to wake up.

00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:39.860
They don't get loose
til like 3 o'clock.

00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:42.890
And so I checked in the game.

00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:45.390
And two minutes after
the game is started,

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:50.930
and I was guarding Gary
Payton, and he got--

00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:52.060
somebody got fouled.

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:54.199
He passed the ball and
somebody got fouled.

00:49:54.199 --> 00:49:55.490
We're just standing right here.

00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:57.180
And the dude's shooting
the free throw.

00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:59.250
And the Seattle dude is
like, come on, Seattle!

00:49:59.250 --> 00:49:59.910
Wake up!

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:01.290
Supersonics, let's go!

00:50:01.290 --> 00:50:04.050
And there's nobody
in the arena, dude.

00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:05.550
He's like, come on, guys.

00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:06.180
Get fired up!

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:07.140
We can take control!

00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:11.935
And Gary Peyton said, hey,
shut the [KNOCK NOISE] up.

00:50:11.935 --> 00:50:17.860
[LAUGHTER] Now, sit down!

00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:19.486
This is all going
on while somebody's

00:50:19.486 --> 00:50:20.486
shooting the free throw.

00:50:20.486 --> 00:50:21.918
And the dude goes, let's go!

00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:27.010
So that was the worst.

00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:30.360
That was the worst I've ever
seen, because I was scared.

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:31.990
I was like, damn, dude.

00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:35.680
You can just talk to
the fans like that?

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.310
He was not having it.

00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:39.370
Gary Peyton did not have
his coffee that morning.

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:41.320
And the dude had
too much energy.

00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:44.470
He was like, sit your
ass down, shut up.

00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:46.720
And sit your-- that
haunted me the whole game.

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.125
I was like, damn, dude.

00:50:49.125 --> 00:50:50.860
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:51.870
Hey, Baron.

00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:55.840
So a question about
playoffs of 2007.

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:58.330
So back to then, Don
Nelson was the head coach.

00:50:58.330 --> 00:51:01.510
And he is probably the
man who knows Dirk best.

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:03.970
And so I want to know,
what's the impact

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:05.320
he brought to the team?

00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:08.710
And what he helped
guys to win the series?

00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:11.740
BARON DAVIS: He
came to us before we

00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:12.860
played the first game.

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:15.400
And he said, yo, we're
going to beat them.

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:19.180
And I want you guys to
be humble in the paper.

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:20.700
I want you to praise them.

00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:23.600
I want you to say it's
the most impossible thing.

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:26.780
It's going to be the most
impossible thing in the world.

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:28.270
We'll just keep downplaying it.

00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:30.190
But we're going to beat
the shit out of them.

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:34.180
And he basically knew Dirk.

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:35.400
And he knew Josh Howard.

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:38.200
Those were their
two primary players.

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:44.870
So he knew Dirk's moves and what
made Dirk comfortable scoring.

00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:47.710
And so once he gave that
to us, Stephen Jackson

00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:51.604
took the challenge
to push him right.

00:51:51.604 --> 00:51:53.020
And if he pushed
him right, he was

00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:57.130
going to spin back to
shoot this fade-away.

00:51:57.130 --> 00:52:00.280
If he went left, he would
step away and shoot the fade,

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:02.470
or he would spin
right for the lay-up.

00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:05.440
So all we had to do
as soon as Dirk caught

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:08.050
the ball is play straight up.

00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:10.240
So you make him put
the ball on the floor,

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:12.240
because you don't want
him shooting over you.

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:13.280
And he dribbles right.

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:15.940
As soon as he dribbles
right, when he spins back,

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:18.310
somebody has to--
it don't matter who.

00:52:18.310 --> 00:52:19.940
The next person better be there.

00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:22.540
Either foul the shit out
of him, dive for the ball,

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:23.910
but we should get a steal.

00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:27.070
And so that, if you go
back and watch the game,

00:52:27.070 --> 00:52:28.960
it was him and Josh Howard.

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:32.140
And they were really left
hand dominant guys who

00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:34.000
we were pushing to their right.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.837
Because they couldn't
make all the decisions

00:52:35.837 --> 00:52:36.670
that they needed to.

00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:37.925
So credit to Don Nelson.

00:52:37.925 --> 00:52:38.800
AUDIENCE: Hey, Baron.

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.694
And just a quick
question on leadership.

00:52:40.694 --> 00:52:42.610
You walked into some
situations like you said,

00:52:42.610 --> 00:52:44.050
Warriors and the Clippers.

00:52:44.050 --> 00:52:46.366
As a leader, and an elite
athlete, and a leader

00:52:46.366 --> 00:52:47.740
even in the business
world today,

00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:49.490
how do you determine
to pick your battles?

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:54.880
With the pull you have, you
could say, trade this guy.

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:55.540
Trade that guy.

00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:58.849
But without becoming the
squeaky wheel too much,

00:52:58.849 --> 00:53:00.140
I'm curious how you make that--

00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:02.395
BARON DAVIS: I think
in order to-- you've

00:53:02.395 --> 00:53:05.600
got to learn everybody, first.

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:06.910
You have to learn everybody.

00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:10.070
And then, you have to learn
yourself in the environment.

00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:14.320
Because picking and choosing
your battles in leadership

00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:17.440
is the most important thing.

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:19.600
When to blow up, when to not.

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:22.780
You may blow up when
you don't even have to.

00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:28.750
But if you have a leadership
strategy, you're doing it for--

00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:30.610
you're always thinking future.

00:53:30.610 --> 00:53:34.510
And so when I look at great
leaders or coaches and things

00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:39.580
like that, it's never
about your moment.

00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:42.280
Or never about how
you emotionally

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:45.100
feel about something
or certain things,

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:48.700
it's about where is that going
to get you and your goals.

00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:55.280
And so how do you manage
yourself in the environment.

00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:58.270
And I think the best way to
do that is to learn everybody

00:53:58.270 --> 00:54:00.680
on the team, what they
do, how they feel,

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:03.890
how they feel about what.

00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:06.010
And then, as you
insert yourself,

00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:10.300
you can really start to see
how you can motivate people,

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:13.160
see which battles-- like
this guy right here.

00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:15.610
He probably doesn't do well
if I yell at him, right?

00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:18.430
And so I need to learn that.

00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:21.790
But a lot of that comes from
trial and error and listening.

00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:24.910
But it's also just more
listening and paying

00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:27.340
attention to the people that
are your team and the people

00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:28.131
that you work with.

00:54:28.131 --> 00:54:30.370
How can I best support them?

00:54:30.370 --> 00:54:32.200
Because at that
point, they're going

00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:34.830
to let me know how
they best work.

00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:39.070
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to
speak to your comment about data

00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:39.720
analysts.

00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:43.960
[LAUGHTER] Just because I
find it really interesting

00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:45.040
that you said that.

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:48.310
In this data driven
world, they literally

00:54:48.310 --> 00:54:50.550
record data on everything.

00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:56.470
So do you think in analyzing
all this data, that it's

00:54:56.470 --> 00:55:01.370
created a more positive impact
in how to consider players

00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:03.905
and recruiting talent?

00:55:03.905 --> 00:55:05.530
Or do you think it's
clouded judgement?

00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:10.645
And what do you
think about that?

00:55:10.645 --> 00:55:13.640
BARON DAVIS: I'll tell you this.

00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:18.950
I don't think that teams
really know what data is.

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:24.241
Because they're
not using it right.

00:55:24.241 --> 00:55:24.740
Period.

00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:25.760
Point blank.

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:29.900
If you're using data to tell
me that a dude made or missed

00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:32.382
a shot that he already took--

00:55:32.382 --> 00:55:35.298
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:40.280
You just watch him play.

00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:41.410
I'm like, shit, dude.

00:55:41.410 --> 00:55:44.460
He's going to miss that.

00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:50.072
So data is good information to--

00:55:50.072 --> 00:55:52.150
AUDIENCE: For projection?

00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:58.460
BARON DAVIS: But it's tough,
because to me, it doesn't work.

00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:02.770
And it has every
place in the game

00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:05.800
for the fan, the fan
experience, for the information

00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:06.820
of the team.

00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:10.750
But you cannot rely on data,
because you're taking away from

00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:12.730
the art of the game.

00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:16.300
And basketball is
art and science.

00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:18.730
And when you see art,
science, and performance

00:56:18.730 --> 00:56:21.100
at its perfection, you
get Michael Jordan.

00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:22.450
You get LeBron James.

00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:23.350
You get Kobe Bryant.

00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:25.000
You get the Golden
State Warriors.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.070
You get excellent basketball.

00:56:27.070 --> 00:56:31.760
When you go data, you get teams
like what the Philadelphia

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:35.140
76ers were for four years.

00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:37.810
And then a lot of the
teams in the Midwest--

00:56:37.810 --> 00:56:42.300
and so they are
hiding behind numbers.

00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:45.300
Or smaller market teams
are hiding behind numbers,

00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:48.090
and they're drafting
and judging on numbers

00:56:48.090 --> 00:56:49.920
and shot charts and
things like that.

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:54.870
When the data that they
should be paying attention to

00:56:54.870 --> 00:57:00.030
is health,
understanding, learning,

00:57:00.030 --> 00:57:03.600
their mental capacity,
their range of explosion.

00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:06.570
Things like that are helpful.

00:57:06.570 --> 00:57:11.850
But it can't take away
from the eye test.

00:57:11.850 --> 00:57:15.000
Because if the guy
can play, he can play.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.580
He may have horrible
stats in college.

00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:24.910
But may be the perfect fit at
6'9", 240, can shoot and dunk.

00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:28.380
But in college, he was horrible,
because the coach played him

00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:29.370
out of position.

00:57:29.370 --> 00:57:35.880
So a lot of the data that's
been drawn is really from--

00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:38.047
you have to include everything.

00:57:38.047 --> 00:57:39.380
Is he playing on the right team?

00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:40.560
Is he playing for
the right coach?

00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:42.150
Is that the right
personality matches?

00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:43.470
Is he in with the right guys?

00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:45.960
You know the whole
plus minus thing.

00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:48.910
If you're a smart player,
all you have to do is tell

00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:49.810
the coach, hey, man.

00:57:49.810 --> 00:57:51.018
My plus minus is going to be.

00:57:51.018 --> 00:57:52.620
Let me check out.

00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:54.630
You get a whole $50
million contract

00:57:54.630 --> 00:58:00.090
by being the player with the
best plus minus in the league.

00:58:00.090 --> 00:58:02.025
But you probably ain't
did shit for a team.

00:58:02.025 --> 00:58:02.900
You know what I mean?

00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:04.200
You ain't did nothing.

00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:05.221
You're no good.

00:58:05.221 --> 00:58:05.970
You ain't playing.

00:58:05.970 --> 00:58:08.430
You just check in the game
and know when to check out.

00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:13.380
And so you'll have more players
doing that to get contracts

00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:15.420
or saying, you know
what, I probably

00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:20.009
shouldn't take this shot,
because the data says--

00:58:20.009 --> 00:58:22.050
or the coach will say,
yo, don't shoot that shot.

00:58:22.050 --> 00:58:24.780
And it's like, man,
game on the line.

00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:25.710
50/50 chance.

00:58:28.252 --> 00:58:32.570
AUDIENCE: So what do you think
about NBA and sports betting?

00:58:32.570 --> 00:58:35.930
BARON DAVIS: That's
going to be interesting.

00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:37.310
Fun and interesting.

00:58:37.310 --> 00:58:38.490
AUDIENCE: I think so, too.

00:58:38.490 --> 00:58:42.860
BARON DAVIS: I think that people
have been doing it illegally.

00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:46.390
I think legalizing
it is going to--

00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:49.190
it'll be interesting to see
how the different rules and all

00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:50.000
those things work.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.970
But I don't know.

00:58:52.970 --> 00:58:55.280
Can I gamble?

00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:56.253
Can I?

00:58:56.253 --> 00:58:57.915
SACHIT EGAN: I'm
pretty sure you can.

00:58:57.915 --> 00:58:59.936
BARON DAVIS: Maybe
that's a new profession.

00:58:59.936 --> 00:59:00.560
No, I'm joking.

00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:02.080
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:03.135
BARON DAVIS: Thank you.

00:59:03.135 --> 00:59:04.680
Yeah, I'm not sure
about gambling.

00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:05.410
That's going to be fun, though.

00:59:05.410 --> 00:59:06.020
It will be fun.

00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:07.710
SACHIT EGAN: Baron, thanks
so much for being here, man.

00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:08.010
BARON DAVIS: Thank you guys.

00:59:08.010 --> 00:59:08.910
Appreciate you.

00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:11.660
