00:00:00.804 --> 00:00:03.372
- [Voiceover] Graph
0.6 on the number line.

00:00:03.372 --> 00:00:06.600
Down here we have a number
line that goes from zero to one

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.820
and it's split into one, two, three, four,

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.737
five, six, seven, eight,
nine, 10 equal spaces.

00:00:15.857 --> 00:00:18.849
These tick marks, there's
10 of these spaces

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:21.178
all the way from zero to one.

00:00:21.178 --> 00:00:24.659
So between any two of these spaces,

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:27.851
for example, between these
first two tick marks,

00:00:27.851 --> 00:00:31.184
could be represented by 1/10.

00:00:32.224 --> 00:00:35.307
It's one, one of the 10 equal spaces.

00:00:37.256 --> 00:00:40.330
It's 1/10 of the distance.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.267
Now the number we're
supposed to graph is 0.6.

00:00:44.267 --> 00:00:47.850
Well this six is in
the tenths place value,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.318
so another way we could read this decimal

00:00:53.318 --> 00:00:57.401
is 6 tenths, or as the fraction, 6/10.

00:01:01.241 --> 00:01:05.408
So if one of these spaces
represents one out of 10

00:01:06.496 --> 00:01:10.330
equal spaces, and we want 6/10,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.877
then we need to travel six
of the 10 equal spaces,

00:01:13.877 --> 00:01:16.072
6/10 of the way.

00:01:16.072 --> 00:01:18.084
Six of the 10 spaces.

00:01:18.084 --> 00:01:21.476
So we can start at the
beginning and go one, two,

00:01:21.476 --> 00:01:23.393
three, four, five, six.

00:01:24.365 --> 00:01:28.532
And graph right here with
a point and this is 6/10.
