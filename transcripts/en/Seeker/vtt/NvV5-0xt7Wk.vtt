00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.560
Should autism and Aspergers be
considered separate disorders?

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.540
The debate in the medical
community rages on.

00:00:11.415 --> 00:00:13.790
Hey, guys, this is Annie
guest-hosting for D News.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.880
This week, the Scottish
singer Susan Boyle

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.700
made headlines by announcing
her diagnosis of Asperger's

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.640
Syndrome, opening
up new conversations

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.720
about the often
misunderstood condition.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.830
Asperger's is
characterized by difficulty

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.460
in social interaction and
nonverbal communication,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.400
and in some cases, clumsiness,
atypical use of language,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.730
and other symptoms.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.670
And currently, it's considered
part of autism spectrum

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.630
disorder, a diagnosis that's
increased significantly

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.052
over the past two decades.

00:00:39.052 --> 00:00:40.760
According to the
British Medical Journal,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.830
autism diagnoses were
rare in the UK and the US

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.390
until the '90s, when
the rates began surging.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.130
They've since leveled
off in the UK,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.360
but according to the
Center for Disease Control,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.870
autism rates have continued
to grow in the US.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.340
As of 2008, one in
88 children were

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.710
identified as being on
the autism spectrum.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.510
The spectrum contains a range
of conditions, characterized

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.280
by social and
communicated challenges

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.010
in certain behavioral pattern.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.250
ASD is about five times as
prevalent in boys as in girls.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.790
The spike in rates is
not fully understood,

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.010
though it's been suggested
that the spike is related

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.180
to increased awareness and
changing diagnostic standards.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.530
What the autism spectrum
entails is still

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.450
being hammered out in
the medical community.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.790
Earlier this year, for
example, Asperger's Syndrome

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.920
was removed from
the DSM-5, which

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.530
is the manual psychiatrists
use to diagnose.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.970
It was folded in with autism as
basically a higher functioning

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.140
form of the disorder.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.730
Asperger's patients
don't typically

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.390
suffer from cognitive
or linguistic impairment

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.410
and are often above
average intelligence.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.820
Still newer research finds
that there may in fact

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.690
be significant biological
differences between Asperger's

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:43.750
and autism.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.640
Harvard neurologists
and psychiatrists

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.830
measured brain connectivity
among Asperger's and autism

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.094
patients using a measure
called EEG coherence.

00:01:51.094 --> 00:01:52.510
They found that
this measure could

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.540
be a distinguishing factor but
that larger studies are needed,

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.730
also pointing out that
those differences can have

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.250
huge implications for
patients, their families,

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.320
and their caregivers.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.528
As always, let us know your
thoughts in the comments.
