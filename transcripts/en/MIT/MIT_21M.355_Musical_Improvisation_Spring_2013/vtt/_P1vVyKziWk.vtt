00:00:29.927 --> 00:00:30.510
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.070
So, what we're
doing today is what

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.190
I call flexology--
most of you were here

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.710
last time-- this conducted
improvisation approach.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.890
So, we've got a music stand
here for the conductors,

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:42.710
if you want it.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.520
And we've got a couple stands
here if people need anything.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.830
But you're free to do
whatever you want, so--

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.760
AUDIENCE 1: So, I have three
different melodic lines.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.702
Copy for you.

00:00:53.702 --> 00:00:55.115
PROFESSOR: Thanks.

00:00:55.115 --> 00:00:57.940
AUDIENCE 1: So, they're
labeled 3, 4, and 5,

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.380
and I'll signal those with
the appropriate number.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.250
And then the other cues, I
listed at the bottom, so 1, 1

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.930
and 2 are from the
standard flexology sheet,

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.140
so 1 is you improvise
with a lot of notes, sort

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.440
of active playing,
2 is improvised

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.890
with a few other notes, mostly.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.090
3 to 5 is [INAUDIBLE] by
[INAUDIBLE] the melodic line,

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.010
and then feel free to improvise
upon it once you've played it

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.156
once or twice.

00:01:25.156 --> 00:01:27.050
If I need to change
the dynamics,

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.240
I'll indicate it sort of
hopefully intuitively,

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.162
and that's it.

00:01:32.162 --> 00:01:34.617
I decided not to do
cue-out and cue-in.

00:01:34.617 --> 00:01:38.054
I can just take care
of that with dynamics.

00:01:38.054 --> 00:01:40.018
Any questions about the cues?

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.339
OK.

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:46.880
PROFESSOR: Then we
should try to keep

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.835
all of these about two minutes,
maybe two and 1/2 minutes.

00:01:49.835 --> 00:01:50.817
Something like that.

00:01:50.817 --> 00:01:51.800
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.084
So, to cue you in, I'll do
a number and call you up.

00:01:56.084 --> 00:01:56.584
OK.

00:01:56.584 --> 00:01:57.125
So let's try.

00:04:34.685 --> 00:04:39.158
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:39.158 --> 00:04:40.050
PROFESSOR: Very nice.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.185
How did that suit your--

00:04:41.185 --> 00:04:42.810
AUDIENCE 1: The
[INAUDIBLE] are varied,

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.291
but this thing I noticed when
people began playing was when

00:04:46.291 --> 00:04:49.710
I envisioned this in my head, I
was swinging the eighth notes,

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.940
but I didn't write
that on the cue sheet,

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.462
so you guys decided
to play it straight.

00:04:54.462 --> 00:04:56.465
And, I didn't even
thought of listening

00:04:56.465 --> 00:04:59.450
to the piece that way.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.340
The other shocking thing was
hearing things be out of phase,

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.010
since I didn't really
establish a tempo,

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.130
but it still worked
out well even

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.714
when people weren't
playing together.

00:05:11.714 --> 00:05:12.380
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.040
Very nice.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.414
Players, any comments?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.094
Was this clear?

00:05:20.094 --> 00:05:21.510
Could you follow
the instructions?

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.650
Because it looked like a very
clear set-up on the page.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.120
Very, very good to have
five things, three of them

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.139
actual lines, two of them
sort of textural things,

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:35.680
and we've got the
whole density thing

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.846
that we've worked with
before on a couple occasions.

00:05:37.846 --> 00:05:39.414
So I thought that
was really good.

00:05:39.414 --> 00:05:41.650
Really good.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.080
And obviously, you said
you were shocked sort of.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.705
If you did this again, you
could specify more things.

00:05:47.705 --> 00:05:48.330
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.820
You could specify
swing eighth notes.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.516
AUDIENCE 1: You could-- I didn't
even think of writing that,

00:05:51.516 --> 00:05:52.400
but I should have.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.490
AUDIENCE 1: Right.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.969
Well, maybe or maybe not.

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:58.010
AUDIENCE 1: I like the
way it turned out, anyway.

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.070
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.690
It was very nice, very musical.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.330
And once again, we
had the situation

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.870
where, particularly, piano is
the main rhythmic instrument.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.070
So once piano comes
in and establishes

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.570
a groove of some sort, another
concept we've talked about,

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.350
people tend to
gravitate around that.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.910
So, if you are going to
do this a second time,

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.300
you might specify
the swing quality,

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.090
but you might also say, try
not to get into a groove.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.875
Just as a test
case sort of thing.

00:06:26.875 --> 00:06:28.896
Just something to work with.

00:06:28.896 --> 00:06:30.013
Very nice.

00:06:30.013 --> 00:06:30.512
Cool.

00:06:30.512 --> 00:06:31.890
Who would like to go next?

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.800
OK.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.714
PROFESSOR: Go for it.

00:06:35.714 --> 00:06:36.630
AUDIENCE 2: All right.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.500
So, I'm just going to
draw this on the board.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.208
PROFESSOR: Uh-oh.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.420
AUDIENCE 2: So, my piece
starts off with a set tempo,

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.490
so I'll sort of signal
that at the beginning.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.070
And then the goal after
that is to slowly introduce

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.806
each of the instruments.

00:06:52.806 --> 00:06:55.698
I guess I'm just going
to include everyone

00:06:55.698 --> 00:06:58.472
in this, because
at the beginning

00:06:58.472 --> 00:06:59.680
it's going to be very sparse.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.096
Basically, I'm just going to
ask you guys to pick one note

00:07:02.096 --> 00:07:05.165
and do any rhythm that you want
on that note, but in the tempo.

00:07:05.165 --> 00:07:07.145
And I'll also introduce
you guys one at a time.

00:07:07.145 --> 00:07:09.215
And them I'm going to have
two motives that are just

00:07:09.215 --> 00:07:10.881
going to be sort of
visual, and I'm just

00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:14.150
going to cue you guys one
or two each at a time,

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.316
and then the rest of you
guys just stay on your note

00:07:16.316 --> 00:07:16.900
that you pick.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.232
So basically, you have the
center note, which is the one

00:07:19.232 --> 00:07:20.410
that you choose.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.746
And so the first motive
will be like this.

00:07:31.586 --> 00:07:32.710
So that's the first motive.

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:36.252
So this is-- And
then the second one.

00:07:49.401 --> 00:07:51.754
So this is [? my idea. ?]

00:07:51.754 --> 00:07:53.170
PROFESSOR: You
like the sine wave?

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:53.440
AUDIENCE 2: Yeah.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.648
Sort of a mix of frequencies.

00:07:54.648 --> 00:07:56.854
PROFESSOR: What's the top one?

00:07:56.854 --> 00:07:58.104
AUDIENCE 2: I don't know.

00:07:58.104 --> 00:08:00.270
AUDIENCE 1: Any indication
of how long each of those

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:00.758
should be?

00:08:00.758 --> 00:08:01.383
AUDIENCE 2: No.

00:08:01.383 --> 00:08:02.340
For the pitch.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.630
So, this is your starting
note and then go up.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.840
And the actual notes you
use are totally up to you.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.410
It's all improvisation.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.890
So, I guess I'm going to start
from this side with piano

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:14.980
and introduce you
guys in one at a time,

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.360
and just go with the tempo
and start a rhythm on a note

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.860
and then once we
have everyone in,

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.342
then we'll go for these motives.

00:08:20.342 --> 00:08:21.824
So--

PROFESSOR: Composer, conductor?

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:02.820
AUDIENCE 2: That
one sounded cool.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.278
I wasn't really
expecting anything,

00:10:04.278 --> 00:10:08.450
because these are just
sort of randomly made up,

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:11.987
but it was interesting.

00:10:11.987 --> 00:10:15.561
I like how it had
the sort of groove

00:10:15.561 --> 00:10:17.310
to it in the way that
it started out with.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:20.807
And I guess it would have been
nice to have some areas that

00:10:20.807 --> 00:10:21.890
were a little more sparse.

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:27.110
I probably should have had
some signal sort of for people

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:28.970
to drop out and make
it sparser so I go back

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:31.995
to that rhythmic
thing, but I guess

00:10:31.995 --> 00:10:33.734
that was just
something [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:33.734 --> 00:10:34.400

00:10:44.915 --> 00:10:46.230
AUDIENCE 3: You asked, right?

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.620
If you hadn't asked what
does the level of the line

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:50.290
represent?

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:50.980
OK.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.105
Probably people would have
played that differently.

PROFESSOR: What did you
feel as you were playing?

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:02.800
What did you feel or what did
you hear as you were playing?

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.976
AUDIENCE 3: I felt like
I was taking a walk.

00:11:04.976 --> 00:11:07.690
I mean, because you had
everyone doing their--

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:13.153
they had some simple walking in
place kind of thing filling out

00:11:13.153 --> 00:11:14.236
before the lines happened.

00:11:16.954 --> 00:11:19.120
PROFESSOR: What about in
terms of the overall sound?

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.142
The way you described is
your particular perspective.

00:11:27.142 --> 00:11:27.967
Right?

00:11:27.967 --> 00:11:29.050
AUDIENCE 3: Well, kind of.

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:30.962
I mean, it was
based on my feeling

00:11:30.962 --> 00:11:32.920
from what everyone else
sounded like, but yeah.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.040
It was how I felt.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:34.760
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.360
And what I'm trying to get
at is, did other people

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.377
basically do that?

00:11:39.377 --> 00:11:40.960
Because that's a
typical thing you do.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.810
You think about
what you're doing.

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:50.450
And/or did you factor in playing
off of what others were doing?

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:52.775
Was anybody more conscious
of the second approach?

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:04.790
Or can't you remember?

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:06.250
Because it was hard to tell.

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:08.540
Frankly, as an
observer, it was very

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.790
nice what was being created.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:13.390
But it was almost like I could
tell, as we went this way,

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.530
that each neighbor was
listening to the neighbor.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.190
That's the easiest thing.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.769
But I'm not sure
whether-- were people

00:12:20.769 --> 00:12:23.060
aware of what was happening
on the piano, for instance?

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.650
And were you aware of what
was going on at the other end?

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.120
AUDIENCE 4: I could,
like, [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.570
It's kind of hard to make out,
because it's a [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:34.069
AUDIENCE 3: Yeah,
I think because it

00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:37.892
was so dense it would be hard
to hear the entire thing.

00:12:37.892 --> 00:12:38.600
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.530
Well, these are things
we want to work towards,

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:46.760
and, you know,
especially, particularly,

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.010
collective improvisation.

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.520
Solo improvisation
is its own animal.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.210
And that has peculiarities and
things that you have to know.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:57.180
But collectively, which is
what we've been doing mainly,

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.350
it really is a challenge to try
to listen to the whole thing

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:04.100
develop as well as be
attentive to your contribution.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.780
So let me just suggest
that, as we go forward,

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.530
we just try to pay a
little more attention

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:10.940
to the overall gestalt,
so to speak, as we go on.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.210
But this was great, and what
was happening was great.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:14.730
Really wonderful stuff.

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.216
And once you came in, now we
got the oboe into the mix.

00:13:17.216 --> 00:13:18.590
So that's another--
and now we're

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.910
going to have another flute.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:21.410
Good.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.246
Now, if you can give me
a written thing of this,

00:13:23.246 --> 00:13:23.692
that's important.

00:13:23.692 --> 00:13:23.888
AUDIENCE 3: Oh, yeah.

00:13:23.888 --> 00:13:24.138
I'll send it to you.

00:13:24.138 --> 00:13:25.480
PROFESSOR: That'd be great.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:25.650
OK.

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:26.733
Who would like to go next?

00:13:26.733 --> 00:13:30.687
So is that a couple
of melodic fragments?

00:13:30.687 --> 00:13:31.520
AUDIENCE 5: Ah, yep.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:38.765
So I have two small
written parts, here.

00:13:38.765 --> 00:13:43.980
And I have those--
1 and 2, I guess.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.310
And I have these more
just to establish

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:53.210
a groove for then the rest of
you guys to do your thing over.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:54.135
But, yeah.

00:13:54.135 --> 00:13:58.410
As far as my hand signals
go, if I point to you

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:03.495
and I flash the number 1 or 2,
that's just indicating the part

00:14:03.495 --> 00:14:04.370
you're going to play.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.220
So this is 1, this is 2.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.170
And, yeah.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:13.255
So I'm basically going start
layering you guys in one

00:14:13.255 --> 00:14:14.950
by one to establish this groove.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:16.290
Not necessarily all of you.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.320
Maybe just a few
to get that going.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.000
And then, once that's started,
I have these modes, just

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.580
kind of like floozy kind
of mode, written out here.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.710
And basically with that, if
you're not playing the groove

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:33.534
that I've laid down here,
what you're going to be doing

00:14:33.534 --> 00:14:35.560
is watching for me to go
like this with my fist.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.400
And that just means, pick
a note, any note, in here.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.280
Just play that.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:43.583
So I'm going for short
bursts or sound, I guess.

00:14:43.583 --> 00:14:46.000
If that makes sense.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.290
And yeah, that's basically it.

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.490
I guess also, when I'm going
like this, higher more intense,

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:54.110
it's going to be
a louder dynamic.

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:57.504
Softer and lower
is going to be--

00:14:57.504 --> 00:14:59.045
AUDIENCE 3: How much
trouble would it

00:14:59.045 --> 00:15:01.110
be for you to write
those on the board?

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:03.443
AUDIENCE 5: Actually, it
wouldn't be any trouble at all.

00:15:03.443 --> 00:15:05.910
That makes a lot of sense.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.255
Yeah, so that's just about it.

00:15:07.255 --> 00:15:09.550
I'll write these down
so you guys can see it.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:11.270
And, oh, yeah.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:14.910
The only other thing is, so, if
you're not playing the groove,

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:17.280
if you're picking
a note in this mode

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.400
I have here, if I go
like this with my hand

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.805
and I also go like this
with my other hand, that's

00:15:22.805 --> 00:15:24.850
to indicate pitch.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:28.232
So if I were to go like
something like this,

00:15:28.232 --> 00:15:32.120
this is indicating, pick a
note, any note you want in here,

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.024
and then as my hand goes
down, descend in pitch.

00:15:35.024 --> 00:15:35.992
Ascend [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:39.370
Yeah.

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:42.307
Just, again, picking any note
in here, just going up or down.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:50.090
All right.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:50.250
Yeah.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.625
And then when I'm having you
just pick any note you want,

00:15:52.625 --> 00:15:54.130
it's just any in here.

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.630
All right.

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.703
Does this all kind
of make sense?

00:15:58.703 --> 00:16:00.795
AUDIENCE 3: Is that A, B, C?

00:16:00.795 --> 00:16:02.460
AUDIENCE 5: Ah, sorry.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:06.110
It's A, C, D, E, G.

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.190
AUDIENCE 2: And the
repeat happens once?

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.022
AUDIENCE 5: Ah, the repeat
happens-- it just continues.

00:16:10.022 --> 00:16:12.147
So every time we get there,
we just repeat it back.

00:16:12.147 --> 00:16:14.276
Yep.

00:16:14.276 --> 00:16:15.260
All right.

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:21.530
So this would be-- if
I point to you with 1,

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:23.337
playing you're playing top.

00:16:23.337 --> 00:16:24.625
If 2, you're playing bottom.

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:30.590
AUDIENCE 1: And they
should be in concert pitch?

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:31.390
Right?

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:34.010
AUDIENCE 5: Yep.

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:34.785
All right.

00:16:34.785 --> 00:16:36.470
I guess we'll start with piano.

00:16:39.392 --> 00:16:41.841
I'll have you play 1
to start with, I guess.

00:16:41.841 --> 00:16:42.340
All right.

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.368
1, 2, 3--

[PIANO PLAYING]

[PIANO, GUITAR, AND FLUTE

00:18:44.207 --> 00:18:46.195
AUDIENCE 5: Keep going.

00:18:46.195 --> 00:18:48.633
If I point to you, you're
going to improvise something

00:18:48.633 --> 00:18:49.674

00:19:49.811 --> 00:19:54.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.780
PROFESSOR: So,
composer, conductor.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:57.705
What did you make of it?

00:19:57.705 --> 00:19:58.580
AUDIENCE 5: Ah, yeah.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:19:59.163
That was cool.

00:19:59.163 --> 00:20:02.280
I was kind of hoping to just
establish a simple groove

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:09.380
and then let it get more-- open
up and have fun off of that.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:11.030
PROFESSOR: What was this again?

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:13.570
AUDIENCE 5: So, this was
supposed to be-- just,

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:18.100
I laid down the notes in
this floozy sounding note.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.910
And I just wanted people
to pick any note in there

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:24.929
and just play it in
short bursts of sounds.

00:20:24.929 --> 00:20:26.220
PROFESSOR: Did people get that?

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.580
AUDIENCE 1: It was
really hard to do.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:27.985
AUDIENCE 5: Yeah.

00:20:27.985 --> 00:20:28.780
AUDIENCE 1: Because
we didn't know

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.960
how many times you were
going to do this in a given--

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.350
AUDIENCE 5: Right.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.849
Yeah.

00:20:31.849 --> 00:20:35.440
The implementation was a
little trickier than I thought.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.005
And also, I didn't
tell you guys how

00:20:37.005 --> 00:20:39.485
I was going to, like,
cue you to stop playing.

00:20:39.485 --> 00:20:42.246
But I think you caught
on well enough for that.

00:20:42.246 --> 00:20:44.120
PROFESSOR: And also,
you didn't mention this,

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.544
did you, for the--

00:20:46.544 --> 00:20:48.460
AUDIENCE 1: You mentioned
it during the piece.

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:48.940
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:49.440
Right.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.153
That's all right.

00:20:50.153 --> 00:20:51.402
AUDIENCE 5: I'm working on it.

00:20:51.402 --> 00:20:54.130
PROFESSOR: But each of these
constructs-- it's interesting,

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:56.000
because you've clearly
thought it out,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.390
which is part of a
point of the assignment.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:01.775
But then it's clear
that when you enact it,

00:21:01.775 --> 00:21:04.410
there are things that
you hadn't thought about,

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:07.600
which is like any laboratory
experiment, I guess.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.516
And so, this is what you
find out by doing it.

00:21:11.516 --> 00:21:12.890
And then the next
time-- right?--

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:16.210
you would factor that
kind of thing in.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:17.870
But I thought it
worked really nice,

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:23.420
and that tune is sort of like
an African village kind of sound

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:25.460
that I've heard in a
number of things like this.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:26.340
So it was very nice.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.434
Very nice.

00:21:27.434 --> 00:21:28.350
Comments from players?

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:32.350
Anybody's comments on that?

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:33.760
Great groove.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.912
Great keeping of the groove.

00:21:36.912 --> 00:21:38.250
Good OK.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:40.270
Let's go to the next contestant.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:45.058
AUDIENCE 6: Basically,
there's going

00:21:45.058 --> 00:21:47.812
to be five gestures
that we're doing,

00:21:47.812 --> 00:21:50.530
and they're all on your paper
and I will demonstrate them

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:55.150
first so that you know what they
are and they don't look weird.

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:59.572
So, the first thing
says, meditative.

00:21:59.572 --> 00:22:00.280
PROFESSOR: Great.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.262
Thank you.

00:22:02.262 --> 00:22:05.280
AUDIENCE 6: Which we're
going to gesture by this,

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.098
maybe a little more flipping.

00:22:07.098 --> 00:22:11.860
And it's supposed to kind
of be a cue to the scale

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:13.640
that Alex is
writing on the board

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:21.967
and the-- I guess a
throwback to the Indian music

00:22:21.967 --> 00:22:25.755
that we sort of were exposed
to early in the semester.

00:22:25.755 --> 00:22:27.880
PROFESSOR: Can I just ask--
this looks very Indian,

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:28.380
this hand signal.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.190
AUDIENCE 6: Yeah.

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:31.880
I wasn't trying--
well, I was trying.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:32.380
So, yeah.

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:33.900
So that's why that's like that.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:38.577
Because it was a visual cue
and hopefully an oral one also.

00:22:38.577 --> 00:22:40.160
AUDIENCE 5: And it's
supposed to sound

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.460
like Indian classical music?

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.160
AUDIENCE 6: Yeah.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.176
Yes.

00:22:45.176 --> 00:22:45.875
Yes.

00:22:45.875 --> 00:22:46.375
Yes.

00:22:46.375 --> 00:22:47.041
AUDIENCE 5: Wow.

00:22:47.041 --> 00:22:48.900
OK.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.549
AUDIENCE 6: So,
this improvisation's

00:22:50.549 --> 00:22:52.465
going to be a little
more directed, obviously,

00:22:52.465 --> 00:22:56.090
because we're going to
be in that frame of mine.

00:22:56.090 --> 00:23:00.820
The second thing is the
hand wave, which is this.

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:04.360
And that means to
cycle/ undulation,

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:09.680
so you can do whatever you want,
but it needs to be repetitive.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.435
Waving fingers, that's this.

00:23:12.435 --> 00:23:14.765
It's a cascade of sound.

00:23:14.765 --> 00:23:17.250
Do what you will
with it, as usual.

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:24.610
The tempo will be given by
just general conducting stuff.

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:27.936
If we conduct high, then we
would like you to play higher,

00:23:27.936 --> 00:23:30.310
and if you conduct low, then
we'd like you to play lower.

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:32.380
So, you can take off number six.

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.805
The tempo is going to
cover tempo and the range

00:23:34.805 --> 00:23:36.260
at the same time.

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:42.180
And then dynamics is like,
two hands louder, softer, shh.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.152
Obvious stuff.

00:23:43.152 --> 00:23:45.035
And getting cut off and whatnot.

00:23:45.035 --> 00:23:48.190
And we're actually
going to split, I guess,

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:53.172
the room in half, and one of
the pianists can come with me.

00:23:53.172 --> 00:23:55.820
Alex and Ben are both
going to conduct,

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.665

how this turns out.

AUDIENCE 5: Question.

00:23:58.010 --> 00:23:58.380
AUDIENCE 6: Yes?

00:23:58.380 --> 00:23:59.629
AUDIENCE 5: So that's a scale?

00:23:59.629 --> 00:24:00.800
AUDIENCE 6: That is a scale.

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:01.425
AUDIENCE 5: OK.

00:24:01.425 --> 00:24:03.960
Why is there an A flat after
an A natural if it's going up?

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.280
AUDIENCE 7: I mean,
it's not a scale.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:05.650
It's notes-- OK.

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:06.750
AUDIENCE 5: It's a
sequence of notes?

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:07.244
AUDIENCE 7: Yes.

00:24:07.244 --> 00:24:08.285
It's a sequence of notes.

00:24:08.285 --> 00:24:09.800
AUDIENCE 6: It's a power scale.

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.496
AUDIENCE 5: Is there an order
to it, or is it just a sequence?

00:24:12.496 --> 00:24:14.037
AUDIENCE 7: No,
there's not an order.

00:24:14.037 --> 00:24:14.514
AUDIENCE 6: Yeah.

00:24:14.514 --> 00:24:15.945
Just play it how
you would like it.

00:24:15.945 --> 00:24:16.570
AUDIENCE 5: OK.

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:19.284
AUDIENCE 6: But
these are the notes.

00:24:19.284 --> 00:24:21.110
OK.

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:23.422
This is my first time
moving like this, too.

00:24:23.422 --> 00:24:28.450
So-- OK, I'll take
Chris, I guess-

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:30.430
AUDIENCE 7: Yeah,
where are we splitting?

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:32.905
Between [? Vanita ?] and AJ?

00:24:32.905 --> 00:24:33.895
OK.

00:24:33.895 --> 00:24:37.360
So, you four, and then
you're taking Chris.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.340
AUDIENCE 6: Yeah.

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.720
OK.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:47.615

you guys in individually too.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:13.620
Conductor, composers.

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.090
What do you make of this
which we just created?

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:17.090
AUDIENCE 6: It was cool.

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:18.620
AUDIENCE 7: It was
like two pieces.

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:19.590
It was awesome.

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:20.821
AUDIENCE 6: Yeah.

00:27:20.821 --> 00:27:23.070
AUDIENCE 7: It was fun seeing
the two different groups

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:28.388
playing in the same scale,
but playing [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:28.388 --> 00:27:30.940
AUDIENCE 6: I completely
forgot that-- I was in my head

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.320
when I was-- when we were
thinking about splitting,

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.745
I was like, oh, I'm going to
listen to what Alex is doing.

00:27:36.745 --> 00:27:38.186
And I completely did not.

00:27:38.186 --> 00:27:39.727
PROFESSOR: That was
my next question.

00:27:39.727 --> 00:27:41.218
Right.

00:27:41.218 --> 00:27:42.332
AUDIENCE 6: Yeah.

00:27:42.332 --> 00:27:44.165
AUDIENCE 5: You were
just having so much fun

00:27:44.165 --> 00:27:45.530
using us like marionettes.

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:48.430

and you play that.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:27:49.884 --> 00:27:51.800
AUDIENCE 7: At first, I
was just experimenting

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.356
to see what I could
do, and then I

00:27:53.356 --> 00:27:55.689
looked to see what she was
doing and she was doing this,

00:27:55.689 --> 00:27:59.760
and then I was like, oh,
wait, I'll do that to.

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.230
AUDIENCE 6: That
was interesting.

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:03.688
PROFESSOR: That was completely
different than anything else

00:28:03.688 --> 00:28:04.680
we've heard so far.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.620
Very different.

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:08.940
Players, what are your comments?

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.440
AUDIENCE 2: I really liked it.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.465
I think the only time--
well, I couldn't really

00:28:13.465 --> 00:28:15.050
hear you guys all that well.

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:18.250
Like, I was really listening to
James on the piano and guitar.

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:22.030
But there was a point where
you started going like this,

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:24.860
and they were doing high-pitched
things, so I heard that,

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:27.110
and I was like, oh, I should
try and blend in to this.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:29.800
So he was leading me on
a tempo a little bit,

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.400
so I sort of matched the tempo
a little bit more to that,

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.750
and it sort of sounded cool.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.920
PROFESSOR: So you were
both watching the conductor

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:40.772
and gravitating to other
people, other sounds in the--

00:28:40.772 --> 00:28:41.480
AUDIENCE 2: Yeah.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:44.214
I started gravitating
over there a couple times.

00:28:44.214 --> 00:28:45.170
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:46.336
AUDIENCE 3: I was impressed.

00:28:46.336 --> 00:28:50.686
I mean, I'm impressed by that.

00:28:50.686 --> 00:28:54.060
There was enough going on that
it was hard to pay attention

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.700
to anything but your
conductor out of two,

00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:00.730
and the people maybe, like,
immediately surrounding you.

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:02.230
PROFESSOR: Well, I
had the advantage

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:04.130
of not having to play,
so I got to hear it.

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:04.960
It was great.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.640
It was really-- it was
very interesting, textural.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.700
I mean, a number of you
who have gone so far

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:13.180
have talked about
wanting to maybe lessen

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:15.440
the density at some point
or something like that,

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:19.080
and that happened just because
of whatever choices you made,

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.990
and then however
you folks responded.

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:22.670
And probably, it's
also a function

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:26.420
that we've now been doing
this for, what, maybe not

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.260
exactly an hour, but
maybe 40 minutes.

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:31.960
So we're all becoming more in
tune to what the concept is.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.355
So, it's very, very,
very interesting.

00:29:34.355 --> 00:29:37.140
You know, there's modern
dance groups as well as

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.540
theatrical groups
that do improvisation

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.820
and that work also with
musicians, and so you could

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:45.310
definitely-- you
could be the dancers.

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:46.382
And then people respond--

00:29:46.382 --> 00:29:47.840
AUDIENCE 7: This
is it, right here.

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.680
PROFESSOR: --certain motion
and then back the other way

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.190
and all that kind of thing.

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:51.260
So, really good.

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:52.444
Really good.

00:29:52.444 --> 00:29:54.610
AUDIENCE 1: The one thing
I'd maybe change next time

00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:57.450
is some of that-- like, the
waving fingers hand motion.

00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:00.160
When you did it, I forgot
what it was completely and had

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.090
to ignore you for the second
and read it off the sheet.

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:05.983
AUDIENCE 3: Also, I had no clue
whether-- I stuck to that scale

00:30:05.983 --> 00:30:07.470
the whole time, because
I didn't know what else--

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:08.360
what other scale to play.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.651
AUDIENCE 7: Yeah, and that's
what we actually intended.

00:30:10.651 --> 00:30:13.645
We intended to start off
with that, and then people

00:30:13.645 --> 00:30:15.760
to just generally play
that throughout all

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:19.189
of the [INAUDIBLE], yeah.

00:30:19.189 --> 00:30:20.230
AUDIENCE 6: Thanks, guys.

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:21.150
AUDIENCE 1: Cool.

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:23.110
Cool.

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:24.569
And by the way,
this-- I don't know

00:30:24.569 --> 00:30:26.026
if you guys had
thought about this,

00:30:26.026 --> 00:30:27.740
but this arrangement
of notes, this

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:31.070
could be construed as what's
called a pitch set, meaning

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:33.700
it's not a specific
scale, but it literally

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.800
is a collection of pitches.

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.070
And you can choose that.

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:40.360
It sort of comes out of 12-tone
method and that kind of thing.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:44.060
And you can choose to say--
what have you got there?

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:48.910
You've got a
nine-member pitch set.

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:51.980
You could designate, play
in a straightforward way,

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:54.990
or take three notes
or begin to manipulate

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:55.990
those in different ways.

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:58.010
So there's a lot of things
you can do with that.

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:00.570
In other words, each of these
pieces we're hearing today,

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:03.170
you could take the basic
elements you've got

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:04.370
and really work on it.

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:06.800
You could probably
spend an hour just doing

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.690
sort of a workshop with
each of these approaches,

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:12.150
and then maybe do
three or four pieces.

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:14.340
And I'll bet each piece
would be different.

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:16.070
At least, that
would be the ideal.

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.570
OK.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.238
AUDIENCE 8: So our
idea was, we're

00:31:22.238 --> 00:31:25.280
actually going to focus more
on the rhythmic aspect of what

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.130
people are doing.

00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:29.106
And maybe the harmony
and we'll come up

00:31:29.106 --> 00:31:31.520
with different melodies.

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:36.771
So our way of giving an idea of
what the rhythm will be-- so,

00:31:36.771 --> 00:31:39.585
let's say I'm starting
off by the tempo,

00:31:39.585 --> 00:31:41.680
and then maybe if I want
you to play eighth notes,

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:42.846
I'll go, like, eighth notes.

00:31:42.846 --> 00:31:44.460
And so then this
would mean you're

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:46.080
playing eighth
notes on some notes.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.149
We decided we're going to--

00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:49.190
AUDIENCE 3: Two per beat?

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:50.130
AUDIENCE 8: Yeah,
so, two per beat.

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:51.180
AUDIENCE 3: Two per beat.

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:51.780
AUDIENCE 8: Or,
like, four per beat.

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:53.045
AUDIENCE 3: So, nothing
slower than a quarter

00:31:53.045 --> 00:31:54.044
note is going to happen.

00:31:54.044 --> 00:31:54.794
AUDIENCE 8: No.

00:31:54.794 --> 00:31:55.770
AUDIENCE 3: OK.

00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:59.100
AUDIENCE 8: So, it's just
kind of a guide for setting up

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.750
the groove.

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:03.620
And then we will bring people
in and out for improv lines.

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:06.350
AUDIENCE 3: So, if you,
for example, hold up three,

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:10.082
do we have to play three notes
or can one of them be a rest?

00:32:10.082 --> 00:32:10.790
AUDIENCE 8: Yeah.

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:11.380
So, yeah.

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:13.870
You could play, like, a triplet,
with one of them being a rest.

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:14.240
Yeah.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:14.820
That's fine.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:17.170
The idea is just to give
you an idea of the rhythm.

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:19.660
Or so we could set up
more complicated rhythms,

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:22.130
like eighth note, quarter,
quarter, eighth note,

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:23.070
eighth note, quarter.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:25.670
AUDIENCE 3: Like, you'll have
M on N for arbitrary M on N?

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:27.250
Because you're going to
be pointing at each person

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:28.450
and putting up a
different number.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:28.865
AUDIENCE 8: Yeah.

00:32:28.865 --> 00:32:29.490
AUDIENCE 3: OK.

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:31.725
AUDIENCE 9: Also, so,
just to clarify, only

00:32:31.725 --> 00:32:34.950
when you do that, it's
only for that beat rather

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:37.011
than a looping,
infinite all the time.

two-- if that makes sense.

00:32:41.735 --> 00:32:42.390

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:47.310
Yeah.

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:48.170
AUDIENCE 8: But
we never loop it.

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:49.100
Does that makes sense?

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.350
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:32:55.457 --> 00:32:56.915
AUDIENCE 9: I guess
the way I think

00:32:56.915 --> 00:32:59.520
about it is, it's like a
way to sort of help push

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:03.700
along organically
coming out collectively.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.000
And the other thing that we
were thinking about doing

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.662
was, if we wanted to change
the pitches of the groove

00:33:09.662 --> 00:33:13.250
at any point, we could,
like-- I say somebody,

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:16.364
and then the secret would
be how many half steps.

00:33:16.364 --> 00:33:18.090
Say, two half steps.

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:18.970
All right, up?

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:21.840
Wait for it, now you shift up.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:27.599
So, going down, three half
steps going down, go down.

00:33:27.599 --> 00:33:28.640
AUDIENCE 3: Sudden shift?

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.014
Like, you go down
on a chromatic?

00:33:30.014 --> 00:33:33.125
AUDIENCE 9: So I mean,
it'll be in time.

00:33:33.125 --> 00:33:36.191
So you should be able to preempt
when I'm going to do that.

00:33:36.191 --> 00:33:37.562
If that makes sense.

00:33:37.562 --> 00:33:40.555
Oh, and also, you're
sort of encouraged

00:33:40.555 --> 00:33:44.900
to deviate from-- play
outside the range of just,

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.960
like, one note continuously.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:47.820
Obviously.

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:51.350
AUDIENCE 8: So we're going to
start on the D Dorian scale

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:55.130
and, at some point,
using the modulation,

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:57.572
you might modulate up or down.

00:33:57.572 --> 00:33:59.988
AUDIENCE 3: Also, by the way--
I mean, this group's small.

00:33:59.988 --> 00:34:02.870
We just didn't want to have
three different conductors.

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:06.055
We were going to do the same
thing that Tess and Alex did,

00:34:06.055 --> 00:34:07.025
of splitting in half.

00:34:07.025 --> 00:34:10.905
So, half is following Adrian,
half is following Vinnie,

00:34:10.905 --> 00:34:13.116
but because we're
doing modulations,

00:34:13.116 --> 00:34:15.048
you have to be paying attention.

00:34:15.048 --> 00:34:17.912
[? So, if anyone ?]
wants a modulation--

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:26.570
And again, completely different
from what just preceded you

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:27.820
and all the others.

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:31.154
So, you're take on what worked
and all that kind of thing.

00:37:33.962 --> 00:37:37.570
AUDIENCE 9: It was a good way
of keeping everyone together.

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:39.410
I think it felt a
little [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:42.080
AUDIENCE 8: It also felt
a little too strict.

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.040
AUDIENCE 9: It did feel strict.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.200
I was like-- so, when
I did give people

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.900
notes and things
like that, I was

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:53.730
kind of hoping that there would
be more variation and stuff,

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:55.708
even if I said da-da-da.

00:37:55.708 --> 00:37:57.666
And then I went
[? on to move ?] somebody else,

00:37:57.666 --> 00:38:01.100
that they would sort
of play around with it.

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:06.064
But I guess maybe it was a
bit strict system in itself.

00:38:06.064 --> 00:38:07.480
PROFESSOR: So if
you did it again,

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.369
you might build in
something about taking

00:38:09.369 --> 00:38:10.285
a little more liberty?

00:38:10.285 --> 00:38:10.993
AUDIENCE 8: Yeah.

00:38:14.165 --> 00:38:16.290
PROFESSOR: I thought it
was very, very interesting.

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:17.090
Really interesting.

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:20.360
And it was a rhythmic
thing, obviously,

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.780
but became a color field.

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.744
I don't know if anybody
else sensed this.

00:38:23.744 --> 00:38:25.660
Because of the different
tambers, particularly

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:26.160
over here.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:29.762
We have muted trumpet and
oboe, flute, obviously,

00:38:29.762 --> 00:38:31.220
and then the strings
and the piano.

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:34.510
I mean, you would around, and
when you shifted sometimes,

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:36.180
the combination
effect-- in other words,

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.679
the relationship to whoever
else was playing, whatever other

00:38:38.679 --> 00:38:41.370
pitch-- because
you're getting sort

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:43.920
of a different
version of overtones

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:46.560
or relationship that way.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.370
So I thought it was
very interesting.

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:50.170
Do you guys know
the Terry Riley.

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:52.300
Piece called "In C"?

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:53.410
You know that?

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:54.620
It's very much like this.

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:57.670
We have a recording and Evan
Ziporyn did a version of this

00:38:57.670 --> 00:39:00.170
not too long ago on one of
these many concerts going on

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:02.170
in the spring, and
it's basically--

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:05.540
the pitch is C, that's it.

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:08.147
But there's about
30-some little fragments.

00:39:08.147 --> 00:39:10.230
Sort of like what you were
doing, but written out.

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:13.028
Little fragments like
da-da-da-da, da-da-da,

00:39:13.028 --> 00:39:14.590
and then that kind of a thing.

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:18.260
And so you sort of
evolve a group mind,

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.870
and then you can expand it.

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:23.740
I think it's a variable
duration as to what happens,

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:25.290
but you're thinking,
in other words,

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:27.094
is very much in that ballpark.

00:39:27.094 --> 00:39:28.510
So you might want
to check it out.

sounds, R-I-L-E-Y, "In C."

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:33.790

of different things

00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:56.400
to possibly do, including
I guess a sort of riff.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:01.560
So, for the first one, the one
is rhythmic pulses in tempo,

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.680
and watch for the tempo.

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.440

play notes, feel

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:09.555
free to switch between
two or three notes or just

00:40:09.555 --> 00:40:11.150
a single note.

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:13.400
That's up to you.

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:17.445

Does everyone got it?

So I guess I was going to
start with the piano on five.

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:51.450
So, yeah.

00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:54.365
And it's up to you to interpret
the tempo of how it's played.

00:40:54.365 --> 00:40:55.740
I just drew them
as quarter notes

00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:58.720
because you can see
the notes that way.

what did you feel?

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:22.100
AUDIENCE 10: So, I actually
had nine different things that

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:24.250
sort of just broke
down, and then I

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:28.742
guess given the atmosphere that
I've been feeling from everyone

00:43:28.742 --> 00:43:31.200
else with the small amount, I
decided to pick a few of them

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.210
to put on the board for
everyone to look at.

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:36.210

is actually-- it's the very
first part of Jimmy Page's solo

AUDIENCE 11: OK.

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:51.175
This is kind of based on a
really nasty thunderstorm,

00:44:51.175 --> 00:44:54.150
so you can keep that in
mind while you're playing.

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:56.640
And the parts are
numbered 8, 9, and 10,

00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:00.140
because I wrote a bunch of
parts but I like these the best.

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:04.060
So, there's going to be some
free interpretation here.

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:06.680
We're going to start
out with a summer day

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:10.640
with kind of clouds floating
sparsely was my image.

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:15.890
So everybody can kind of
play something pretty.

00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:21.920

like play pretty notes

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:24.460
in the key of F major.

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:26.170
Make it kind of sparse.

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:29.680
And when I do this, that
means just play, like,

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.960
a really ugly high note.

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:35.206
Because that's like
lightning off in the storm.

00:45:35.206 --> 00:45:37.750
The beginning of
things being ugly.

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:41.230
And then when I do
two, then you're

00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:43.561
going to switch to
9 because that's

00:45:43.561 --> 00:45:47.410
the same [? chord ?] and
just play these notes.

00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:49.903
I kind of have two
parts, sort of.

00:45:49.903 --> 00:45:52.278
AUDIENCE 3: Why don't you just
renumber them 1, 2, and 3?

00:45:52.278 --> 00:45:52.778
OK.

00:45:52.778 --> 00:45:54.890
AUDIENCE 11: I can-- whatever.

00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:55.976
It's an order.

00:45:55.976 --> 00:45:56.968
AUDIENCE 3: Anything
you can do to simplify

00:45:56.968 --> 00:45:57.960
that would be appreciated.

00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:58.626
AUDIENCE 11: OK.

00:45:58.626 --> 00:45:59.448
I'll renumber it.

00:46:10.856 --> 00:46:12.370
OK.

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:14.270
So, this is just
going to be ugly.

00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:17.075
Play all the ugliest
notes that you can find

00:46:17.075 --> 00:46:22.020
and the theme can
kind of be this flow.

00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:29.190
And then I'll use this to
slow down and speed up.

00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:32.964
So I'll eventually slow down,
and then we'll come into this

00:46:32.964 --> 00:46:34.130
and it's like, I don't know.

00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:38.756
It's a really destructive storm,
so it's kind of melancholy.

00:46:38.756 --> 00:46:39.720
Yeah.

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:40.220
OK.

00:46:43.148 --> 00:46:47.052
And this means start.

00:46:47.052 --> 00:46:49.004
[WHISTLING]

00:46:49.004 --> 00:46:51.040
AUDIENCE 11: OK.

[MANY INSTRUMENTS PLAYING]

00:48:28.957 --> 00:48:31.951
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:31.951 --> 00:48:33.750
PROFESSOR: Very nice.

00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:36.220
So, composer, conductor, what
are your thoughts on what

00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:38.271
happened?

00:48:38.271 --> 00:48:40.062
AUDIENCE 11: It was a
little less organized

00:48:40.062 --> 00:48:44.600
than I expected, which
is definitely my fault.

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:48.330
But it was cool.

00:48:48.330 --> 00:48:50.190
PROFESSOR: So how
would you adjust

00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:54.070
that in another performance?

00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:57.510
AUDIENCE 11: I guess I would
make-- because I kind of had

00:48:57.510 --> 00:49:00.205
the idea of having
these parts coinciding

00:49:00.205 --> 00:49:02.840
to some extent, at
least in the beginning.

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:06.892
So I would probably make it
be like that at the beginning

00:49:06.892 --> 00:49:09.272
and make more of a beat.

00:49:09.272 --> 00:49:11.176
Yeah.

00:49:11.176 --> 00:49:13.080
PROFESSOR: Oh, so have
a rhythmic structure.

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:14.163
AUDIENCE 11: A little bit.

00:49:14.163 --> 00:49:15.052
Yeah.

00:49:15.052 --> 00:49:17.510
PROFESSOR: Now, what's the--
because some of your notation,

00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:19.670
there's notes occurring
simultaneously.

00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:21.186
What was the idea behind that?

00:49:21.186 --> 00:49:23.616
AUDIENCE 11: That was
kind of like the parts

00:49:23.616 --> 00:49:26.032
that should occur together.

00:49:26.032 --> 00:49:26.532
Yeah.

00:49:26.532 --> 00:49:27.018
AUDIENCE 11: Oh, OK.

00:49:27.018 --> 00:49:28.962
AUDIENCE 11: So if
it was more rhythmic,

00:49:28.962 --> 00:49:32.370
it would be like those occur
together, and those and these.

00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:35.055
PROFESSOR: I liked all
the visual-- the bursts

00:49:35.055 --> 00:49:35.820
[INAUDIBLE].

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:37.640
And this is almost
like an accordion sort

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:38.747
of an idea or something.

00:49:38.747 --> 00:49:39.246
Yeah.

00:49:39.246 --> 00:49:40.620
Very good.

Players.

00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:42.060
Comments on this?

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:46.609
Easy to follow?

00:49:46.609 --> 00:49:48.900
Seemed like it was, you know,
because you're directing,

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:49.983
I mean, you're conducting.

00:49:49.983 --> 00:49:55.700
You're really giving
pretty specific signals.

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:56.560
Very nice.

00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:01.176
Do you all know the
Beethoven's Sixth Symphony?

00:50:01.176 --> 00:50:03.560
By now, you should know
it if you don't know it.

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:05.470
The middle movement is a storm.

00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:08.515
It's a quiet day, like
you're describing,

00:50:08.515 --> 00:50:11.820
and you even hear the sounds of
birds that whistle or whatever.

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:14.680
And then you hear a thunder
with a timpani coming in,

00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:16.450
and the thunder in a storm.

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:18.900
And I-- one time, I was
at Tanglewood listening

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:21.920
to the BSO, and
they played this.

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:24.270
And this is an
honest-to-god true story.

00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:28.040
As that movement came up and
the storm clouds threatened,

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.510
this huge, black,
storm cloud came over

00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:34.320
and it started to
rain, and then it

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:37.610
stopped exactly as
the movement ended.

00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:39.830
And it went on to the next.

00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:41.315
So make of that what you will.

00:50:41.315 --> 00:50:44.306
But it was a very interesting
experience, shall we say,

00:50:44.306 --> 00:50:47.310
on the lawn of Tanglewood.

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:51.812
Maybe you're channeling
Beethoven here a little bit

00:50:51.812 --> 00:50:52.710
or something.

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:54.668
AUDIENCE 3: So this piece
is called "Birthday,"

00:50:54.668 --> 00:50:58.960
and I feel like one of
these real jazz people

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:02.710
because I did the following.

00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:05.344
So, oh-- do you have some
way of standing there.

00:51:05.344 --> 00:51:06.260
You can just take one.

00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:08.560
There's an extra.

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:09.910
And so I said the following.

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:13.590
Let M be the number of the
month of your birthday.

00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:18.149
And then there are things in
the parts that depend on it.

00:51:18.149 --> 00:51:19.815
So, for example, I
was born in November.

00:51:19.815 --> 00:51:20.880
M is 11.

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:24.690
And I'll say things like,
transpose this part up

00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:25.630
in half steps.

00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:32.440
So, we're not going
to do number 5.

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:35.010
Number 5 involves you
singing, and it's really hard

00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:37.510
to sing in key together.

00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:44.670
So instead, we're
going to do just--

00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:47.750
so I have numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4.

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:50.186
They're the four, let's say,
phrases of the happy birthday

00:51:50.186 --> 00:51:50.685
song.

00:51:50.685 --> 00:51:54.225
And they're in whatever key is
appropriate to your birthday

00:51:54.225 --> 00:51:54.725
month.

00:51:57.290 --> 00:52:00.730
I'll cue them with just
numbers 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:52:03.402 --> 00:52:05.610
And it, again, cues that
apply to individual people--

00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:07.485
or, like, if I want to
cue a group of people,

00:52:07.485 --> 00:52:09.880
I'll do like this and then
I'll say number 2 or whatever.

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:11.380
And, keep in mind,
you'll be playing

00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:13.517
in different keys,
which is good.

00:52:13.517 --> 00:52:15.350
And I don't want you
to play simultaneously.

00:52:15.350 --> 00:52:18.520
I want you to play somewhat
chaotically out of sync.

00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:33.260
So the cues are-- OK, so.

00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:33.760
Number.

00:52:36.082 --> 00:52:36.790
Self-explanatory.

00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:38.910
It's on the sheet.

00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:41.652
Another cue I'll have is this.

00:52:41.652 --> 00:52:43.360
This doesn't mean do
a shake or anything.

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:45.360
This means play chaotically.

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:47.570
This means play something
that isn't written down

00:52:47.570 --> 00:52:48.955
that sounds crazy.

00:52:54.418 --> 00:53:03.620
Shake hands equals chaos.

00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:08.200
And then the other thing
that I'll do is this.

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.100
So, this does not mean
play the same note.

00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:19.830
This means play, well-- it
means play a sustained note,

00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:21.580
and then a couple
seconds later, change it

00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:23.830
to some other sustained note,
approximately at random.

00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:25.930
It should be
approximately at random.

00:53:25.930 --> 00:53:38.298
So level hand motion means play
a series of sustained notes.

00:53:49.170 --> 00:53:55.264
And the last gesture I'll use
is the flexology chord gesture,

00:53:55.264 --> 00:53:55.930
where I do this.

00:53:55.930 --> 00:53:57.763
Where I, like, sweep
my hand back and forth.

00:53:57.763 --> 00:53:59.518
It means play a chord.

00:53:59.518 --> 00:54:00.018
Together.

00:54:07.906 --> 00:54:09.878
OK.

00:54:09.878 --> 00:54:12.836
So, that's what I got.

00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:18.100
Sound good?

00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:19.418
Any questions or any comments?

00:54:22.904 --> 00:54:24.398
I guess I'll cue you in.

00:54:30.374 --> 00:54:33.860
[MANY INSTRUMENTS PLAYING]

[APPLAUSE]

00:56:10.881 --> 00:56:12.256
PROFESSOR: I didn't
know what you

00:56:12.256 --> 00:56:13.010
were going to do at the end.

00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:14.250
I didn't know if you
were getting ready to--

00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:16.154
AUDIENCE 3: I was thinking
about doing something else,

00:56:16.154 --> 00:56:17.582
but I figured no
one would follow

00:56:17.582 --> 00:56:19.305
because they assumed I was done.

00:56:19.305 --> 00:56:20.180
PROFESSOR: Very nice.

00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:23.256
So, your impressions
of how this all worked.

00:56:23.256 --> 00:56:24.630
AUDIENCE 3: That
was pretty hard.

00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:28.684
I knew it would be hard
to be clear in front

00:56:28.684 --> 00:56:30.260
of different people.

00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:31.050
It was.

00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:33.401
Also, no one ended
up doing-- I cued

00:56:33.401 --> 00:56:34.692
a bunch of people for number 3.

00:56:34.692 --> 00:56:37.380
I didn't, I think, hear
anyone doing the alternative.

00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:38.220
So I have cases.

00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:39.902
If M is even, you
play, you know,

00:56:39.902 --> 00:56:43.340
(SINGING) happy birthday
dear-- something.

00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:45.640
And then if M is odd,
you'd go the other way.

00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:47.600
I can't even do this.

00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:49.684
(SINGING) Happy
birthday to whatever.

00:56:49.684 --> 00:56:50.517
Something like that.

That would've been cool.

00:56:56.790 --> 00:56:58.265
PROFESSOR: So in
another iteration,

00:56:58.265 --> 00:56:59.931
and then we're going
to have to move on,

00:56:59.931 --> 00:57:02.470
in another iteration
people would actually

00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:04.560
have to sort of study
this a little bit more.

00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:06.950
Because I saw Brian,
you were cued 2,

00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:09.140
and you were looking
to see what's 2.

00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:11.430
Because we're getting a
lot of material very fast

00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:12.816
this afternoon.

00:57:12.816 --> 00:57:14.440
But you would do just
like you practice

00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:15.740
for a piece that's written out.

00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:18.040
You would really have to
know what the cues were.

00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:20.248
AUDIENCE 3: I guess I was
hoping that the familiarity

00:57:20.248 --> 00:57:21.882
with this melody would help.

00:57:21.882 --> 00:57:22.590
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:57:22.590 --> 00:57:23.498
AUDIENCE 3: It probably did.

00:57:23.498 --> 00:57:24.414
But still, it's a lot.

00:57:24.414 --> 00:57:27.130
PROFESSOR: It was there
in the background.

00:57:27.130 --> 00:57:28.530
OK, so two more.

00:57:28.530 --> 00:57:35.815
AUDIENCE 13: So there's six
new reference material that'll

00:57:35.815 --> 00:57:39.910
just be basic framework material
that I tried to at least

00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:43.210
transcribe to the order
of numbers in [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:48.660
So these first two are just
these very simple patterns.

00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:52.780
Definitely not
very strict, or not

00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:56.200
required to be very
to the transcription.

00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:59.972
But just as a starting
point for the improvisation.

00:57:59.972 --> 00:58:02.770
And so I would maybe take
that with ones or twos.

00:58:06.550 --> 00:58:08.550
And then the rest are
graphical notations,

00:58:08.550 --> 00:58:10.480
so three is kind of
like a trio above.

00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:13.480
It's the same thing for
the rest of these patters.

00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:15.452
Five and six have
their own patterns,

00:58:15.452 --> 00:58:17.192
so interpret those as you will.

00:58:17.192 --> 00:58:18.900
So those will just be
the number signals,

00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:20.980
and if I point at you
or point at a section,

00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:23.020
use those numbers,
that's probably

00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:24.540
what you'll want to do.

00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:29.500
And then some other signals
that I was interested in using

00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:31.020
is this.

00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:33.556
Bringing hands together
like using a [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:33.556 --> 00:58:36.680
would be like making
what you're doing simpler

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:39.500
or adding more space
to what you're using.

00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:41.419
Where the opposite
like this would

00:58:41.419 --> 00:58:43.600
be making it more complicated.

00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:48.110
I'll just do some very
intuitive, dynamic markings,

00:58:48.110 --> 00:58:48.920
too.

00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:50.755
And yeah.

00:58:50.755 --> 00:58:53.270
Anything else should
be fairly intuitive.

00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:55.360
So is everyone good with that?

[MANY INSTRUMENTS PLAYING]

01:01:23.936 --> 01:01:25.860
PROFESSOR: Nice.

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:28.760
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.330
PROFESSOR: So, as far as this
coming up, let me just ask.

01:01:31.330 --> 01:01:33.740
What worked as you had
envisioned it and were there

01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:35.860
any surprises in here?

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:40.275
AUDIENCE 13: So, I think it
was a good-- it kind of got

01:01:40.275 --> 01:01:44.892
everyone started in at
least some idea of what

01:01:44.892 --> 01:01:48.140
sound or some rough
idea of key, I guess.

01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:53.390
It was maybe a little
freer than I expected,

01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:57.020
just because everyone
started at different tempos.

01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:57.520
Yeah.

01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:01.560
So it was also
different adding--

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:06.022
I guess it was probably not
necessarily a bug, but just

01:02:06.022 --> 01:02:08.006
a feature of how it works.

01:02:08.006 --> 01:02:12.216
People have different, I guess,
ideas of how to add complexity.

01:02:12.216 --> 01:02:12.966
PROFESSOR: Mm-hmm.

01:02:12.966 --> 01:02:14.950
Mm-hmm.

01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:15.460
Good.

01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:16.540
Very nice.

01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:18.810
AUDIENCE 14: So, I didn't
write any material.

01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:22.891
So this is going to be focused
on listening to other people.

01:02:22.891 --> 01:02:23.390
All right.

01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:24.732
So, one is active.

01:02:24.732 --> 01:02:25.315
Two is sparse.

01:02:25.315 --> 01:02:28.460
These are the ones
we've used before.

01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:31.380
What we're going to start
with is three, which is,

01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:34.900
you should be alternating
between serene chords

01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:35.950
and motives.

01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:39.410
As by motives I just
mean two to four notes.

01:02:39.410 --> 01:02:40.790
It can have rhythm if you want.

01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:44.400
Something that can be
easily recognizable.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:50.180
OK, so hands rising is
crescendo, diminuendo.

01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:53.820
And if I cup my ears, that
means listen to other people

01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:57.010
and try to repeat their motives.

01:02:57.010 --> 01:03:00.040
If I do a ball, like
this, this means

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:02.210
that we're going to
try to sort of all come

01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:04.420
into-- all repeat
the same motive.

01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:06.410
Like coalesce into one.

01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:08.530
And if that happens,
then I'll go like this,

01:03:08.530 --> 01:03:10.945
and that'll mean to
gradually break apart.

01:03:10.945 --> 01:03:12.877
So, we'll see if that works.

01:03:12.877 --> 01:03:14.326
All right.

01:03:14.326 --> 01:03:15.292
So.

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:16.258

01:05:02.466 --> 01:05:06.174
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:06.174 --> 01:05:07.840
PROFESSOR: What did
you feel about this?

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.950
AUDIENCE 14: Well,
it didn't really

01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:11.520
coalesce as I was
expecting it to,

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:14.310
maybe because there wasn't
a really distinctive motive.

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:17.790
But I did hear some
feedback, which was great.

01:05:17.790 --> 01:05:21.697
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I heard that
as the non-interested observer,

01:05:21.697 --> 01:05:23.780
or very interested but
non-participating observer,

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:25.086
I should say.

01:05:25.086 --> 01:05:26.710
I could definitely
hear that happening.

01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:27.100
AUDIENCE 14: Yeah.

01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:28.890
I was trying to bring
out certain motives,

01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:32.010
but I guess one really
became dominant.

01:05:32.010 --> 01:05:34.410
PROFESSOR: There, again,
literally practicing

01:05:34.410 --> 01:05:35.829
or working with the material.

01:05:35.829 --> 01:05:36.620
AUDIENCE 14: Right.

01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:38.292
But really, really well done.

01:05:38.292 --> 01:05:39.720
Give everybody a hand.

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:40.991
Give yourself all a hand.

01:05:40.991 --> 01:05:41.616
Very well done.

01:05:41.616 --> 01:05:43.040
Very well done.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.270
So, as I've said after
each person's thing,

01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:46.830
I've said-- or
almost everybody--

01:05:46.830 --> 01:05:50.180
I've said composer and/or
conductor or composer,

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:51.940
conductor, because
each of you, when

01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:54.270
you did that, you're
both those things.

01:05:54.270 --> 01:05:56.270
You're enacting out
of-- essentially,

01:05:56.270 --> 01:05:58.330
this is your raw material,
whatever it would be,

01:05:58.330 --> 01:05:59.510
for each person.

01:05:59.510 --> 01:06:02.170
And you're enacting
in the moment

01:06:02.170 --> 01:06:05.920
through improvisation what the
composition is going to be.

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.420
Because as we've
said, improvisation

01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:08.586
is composition and all that.

01:06:08.586 --> 01:06:12.670
So this is just a different,
yet another way to do it.

01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:15.440
It's a little bit different
than what we've done before,

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:17.100
but can be interesting.

01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:20.360
I would suggest that
you think about--

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.090
whether it ever
happens again or not.

01:06:22.090 --> 01:06:24.520
I mean, it could be factored
into your final project,

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:27.315
obviously-- think about what
I've said to a couple of you.

01:06:27.315 --> 01:06:30.230
If you were to do your piece for
today, if you were to do that

01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:32.750
again, what would
you do to enhance it?

01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:34.540
What could you do
to make sure that it

01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:38.612
was closer to what
your intention was?

01:06:38.612 --> 01:06:40.070
And the other thing
is, I think you

01:06:40.070 --> 01:06:42.760
might want to check out
that OCW film of Walter

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:46.099
Thompson, his sound-painting
thing from another course.

01:06:46.099 --> 01:06:48.015
But I think if you just
put in Walter Thompson

01:06:48.015 --> 01:06:50.580
and sound painting on
OCW, you'll get this.

01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:52.407
It's fascinating, what he does.

01:06:52.407 --> 01:06:54.240
And he has a whole
different set of signals.

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:57.314
I think you'd get
a kick out of it.

01:06:57.314 --> 01:06:59.105
What was the last thing
I was going to say?

01:06:59.105 --> 01:06:59.605
Oh, yeah.

01:06:59.605 --> 01:07:01.400
See you Saturday.

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:01.920
Thank you.

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:02.420
Good job.

01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:04.370
Really good job.
