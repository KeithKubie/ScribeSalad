00:00:00.547 --> 00:00:02.805
I want to now build on
what we did in the last

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:05.975
video on the Keynesian Cross and planned

00:00:05.975 --> 00:00:08.549
aggregate expenditures and
fill in a little bit more

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:12.068
on the details and think
about how this could be

00:00:12.068 --> 00:00:15.607
of useful conceptual tool
for Keynesian thinking.

00:00:15.607 --> 00:00:17.676
Let's just review a little bit.

00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:21.539
I'll rebuild our planned
aggregate expenditure

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.396
function, but I'll fill in
little bit of the details.

00:00:24.396 --> 00:00:28.069
Let's say this is
planned, planned aggregate

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:30.622
expenditures and this
is going to be equal to

00:00:30.622 --> 00:00:32.720
consumption.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.871
You'll often see it in a
book written like this:

00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:37.473
Consumption as a function
of aggregate income

00:00:37.473 --> 00:00:40.287
minus taxes and I want
to be very clear here.

00:00:40.287 --> 00:00:43.739
They're not saying that
this term should be

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.022
aggregate income times aggregate income

00:00:47.022 --> 00:00:48.011
minus taxes.

00:00:48.011 --> 00:00:50.210
They're saying that
consumption is a function of

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.373
this right over here;
the same way we would say

00:00:53.373 --> 00:00:57.670
that F is a function of
X, but if you give me a

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.535
Y-T or essentially if
you give me a disposable

00:01:00.535 --> 00:01:06.139
income right over here, I
will give you a consumption.

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:08.290
If you actually want to
deal with this directly

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.872
mathematically, analytically,
you'd have to define

00:01:10.872 --> 00:01:13.136
what this function is, but
I'll write it like this

00:01:13.136 --> 00:01:15.873
now and in the next step
I'll actually define what

00:01:15.873 --> 00:01:17.269
our consumption function is.

00:01:17.269 --> 00:01:20.603
This is just saying an
arbitrary consumption function

00:01:20.603 --> 00:01:24.689
and it is a function of disposable income.

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.534
It's going to be your
consumption function plus

00:01:28.534 --> 00:01:31.459
your planned investment,
which we're going to

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:36.091
assume is constant, plus
government expenditures

00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:38.340
plus net exports.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.471
Plus net exports.

00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:43.967
A couple of videos ago we
built some simple models

00:01:43.967 --> 00:01:46.475
for consumption function so
let's put one of those in.

00:01:46.475 --> 00:01:50.207
Let's say that our consumption function,

00:01:50.207 --> 00:01:53.943
so aggregate consumption is a function of

00:01:53.943 --> 00:01:56.337
disposable income, as a function of income

00:01:56.337 --> 00:01:58.078
minus taxes.

00:01:58.078 --> 00:02:00.821
Let's say that's going to be equal to some

00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:03.388
autonomous expenditure

00:02:03.388 --> 00:02:07.299
plus the marginal propensity to consume.

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:08.881
(Maybe I don't have to keep
switching colors because

00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:10.407
we've seen this before.)

00:02:10.407 --> 00:02:12.382
Plus the marginal propensity to consume

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:17.050
times disposable income.
Times disposable income.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.379
Now you see that consumption, aggregate

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.545
consumption is being defined.

00:02:21.545 --> 00:02:24.139
It's being defined as a function of

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:25.933
disposable income.

00:02:25.933 --> 00:02:28.076
That's what that notation
right over there means.

00:02:28.076 --> 00:02:31.073
We could substitute
this function expression

00:02:31.073 --> 00:02:33.293
with this stuff in green right over here.

00:02:33.293 --> 00:02:38.440
We can say aggregate planned expenditure,

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.466
is equal to, this is our
consumption function,

00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:44.407
so it's equal to (Oh,
I'll do it in that same

00:02:44.407 --> 00:02:49.944
yellow.) it's equal to
autonomous consumption

00:02:49.944 --> 00:02:52.538
plus the marginal
propensity to consume times

00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:55.042
disposable income which
is aggregate income

00:02:55.042 --> 00:02:57.669
minus taxes and then of course we have the

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:01.403
other terms plus planned investment plus

00:03:01.403 --> 00:03:05.133
government spending plus net exports.

00:03:05.133 --> 00:03:09.139
Plus net exports.

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:10.997
Then we can simplify
this a little bit just so

00:03:10.997 --> 00:03:13.469
it makes clear what parts
of this are constant

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:15.801
and what parts aren't,
what parts are a function

00:03:15.801 --> 00:03:18.037
of income.

00:03:18.037 --> 00:03:20.672
For the sake of this little
lesson right over here,

00:03:20.672 --> 00:03:22.416
you might remember a few videos ago,

00:03:22.416 --> 00:03:24.594
we can have a debate
whether taxes should be

00:03:24.594 --> 00:03:26.142
a function of income or not.

00:03:26.142 --> 00:03:28.183
In the real world, taxes
really are a function

00:03:28.183 --> 00:03:30.343
of income, but for the
sake of this analysis

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:33.144
we'll just assume that like investment,

00:03:33.144 --> 00:03:34.858
planned investment,
government spending and

00:03:34.858 --> 00:03:38.483
net exports, we'll assume for the sake of

00:03:38.483 --> 00:03:40.112
this presentation we're
going to assume this is

00:03:40.112 --> 00:03:45.533
constant. Assume that this is constant.

00:03:45.533 --> 00:03:46.870
This is constant.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.669
If we assume that that's
a constant, we can

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.689
multiply (And actually even if we didn't

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.405
assume it's a constant
we could still multiply,

00:03:52.405 --> 00:03:55.267
but then we'd want to
redefine this in terms of Y)

00:03:55.267 --> 00:03:59.760
but we can distribute the C1 and so we get

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.675
- We get; I don't have
to keep writing that

00:04:01.675 --> 00:04:03.669
- this part right over here, we have our

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:05.019
autonomous expenditures,

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:11.873
(C1xY)+(C1 x aggregate
income) - the marginal

00:04:11.873 --> 00:04:16.407
propensity to consume
times taxes + all of this

00:04:16.407 --> 00:04:17.878
other stuff.

00:04:17.878 --> 00:04:20.229
Actually I could just copy and paste that,

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:21.630
plus all of this other stuff.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.669
Let me copy it and then let me paste it.

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.549
Plus all of this other
stuff and that is equal to

00:04:28.549 --> 00:04:32.469
our planned expenditures;
planned expenditures.

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.207
Now we can think about well
this part right over here,

00:04:35.207 --> 00:04:40.337
this is the function,
this is how aggregate

00:04:40.337 --> 00:04:41.818
income is really driving it.

00:04:41.818 --> 00:04:43.669
Everything else is really a constant here.

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.602
Let's write it in those terms.

00:04:45.602 --> 00:04:46.879
Let's write it in those terms.

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:50.406
We have aggregate planned
expenditure is equal

00:04:50.406 --> 00:04:54.533
to the marginal propensity
to consume times

00:04:54.533 --> 00:04:57.659
our aggregate income;
times our aggregate income.

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:59.208
That's this term right over here.

00:04:59.208 --> 00:05:00.470
I'll box it off.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.422
Everything else is a
constant, so plus the C sub 0

00:05:05.422 --> 00:05:07.728
which was our autonomous expenditures,

00:05:07.728 --> 00:05:10.034
minus (C sub 1 X T)

00:05:10.034 --> 00:05:12.341
so the marginal propensity
to consume times T

00:05:12.341 --> 00:05:14.603
and these are both
constants for the sake of

00:05:14.603 --> 00:05:16.540
our analysis so this
whole thing is a constant

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.736
and then plus all that other stuff.

00:05:18.736 --> 00:05:21.673
Then plus all of that other stuff there.

00:05:21.673 --> 00:05:24.272
This might look like a
really fancy, complicated

00:05:24.272 --> 00:05:26.677
formula, but it's actually
pretty straight forward

00:05:26.677 --> 00:05:29.736
because we're assuming for
the sake of our analysis

00:05:29.736 --> 00:05:33.481
that all of this, all
of this right over here,

00:05:33.481 --> 00:05:35.936
all of this is constant.

00:05:35.936 --> 00:05:38.412
If you were to plot this right over here,

00:05:38.412 --> 00:05:41.088
it would look something like this.

00:05:41.088 --> 00:05:44.272
Let us plot it.

00:05:44.272 --> 00:05:46.012
Really this is almost
exactly what we did in the

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:49.003
last video, but we're now
filling in some details.

00:05:49.003 --> 00:05:51.177
Our independent variable is going to be

00:05:51.177 --> 00:05:54.096
aggregate income or
GDP, however you want to

00:05:54.096 --> 00:06:00.810
view it, and then our
vertical axis is expenditures.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.869
Expenditures.

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:06.905
Expenditures and so if
we wanted to plot this,

00:06:06.905 --> 00:06:09.603
the constant part, this
thing right over here,

00:06:09.603 --> 00:06:14.406
if I were to redefine
this whole thing as B,

00:06:14.406 --> 00:06:16.206
that would be where we intersect the

00:06:16.206 --> 00:06:18.422
vertical axis, that B right over there.

00:06:18.422 --> 00:06:20.206
I could rewrite this whole
thing, but that would

00:06:20.206 --> 00:06:21.874
just be a pain so I'll
just call this B, but

00:06:21.874 --> 00:06:24.246
this whole thing is B and then we'd have

00:06:24.246 --> 00:06:27.753
an upward sloping line
assuming that C1 is positive.

00:06:27.753 --> 00:06:29.361
It's going to have a slope less than one.

00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:31.207
We're assuming that people
won't be able to spend

00:06:31.207 --> 00:06:33.371
more than their aggregate income.

00:06:33.371 --> 00:06:34.669
They're only going to
spend a fraction of their

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:35.492
aggregate income.

00:06:35.492 --> 00:06:39.045
This is going to be between zero and 1.

00:06:39.045 --> 00:06:42.654
We will have our aggregate
planned expenditures

00:06:42.654 --> 00:06:45.736
would be line that might
look something like this.

00:06:45.736 --> 00:06:49.483
Aggregate planned expenditures.

00:06:49.483 --> 00:06:51.537
To think about our
Kenyesian Cross, you can't

00:06:51.537 --> 00:06:55.470
have an economy in equilibrium
if aggregate output

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.936
is not equal to aggregate expenditures.

00:06:59.936 --> 00:07:01.603
To think about all of
the different scenarios

00:07:01.603 --> 00:07:04.930
where the economy is in
equilibrium, we draw a line

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.237
at a 45 degree angle because
at every point on this

00:07:07.237 --> 00:07:11.336
line, output is equal to expenditures.

00:07:11.336 --> 00:07:14.339
Output is equal to
expenditures so we get our

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:18.663
45 degree line looks something like this.

00:07:18.663 --> 00:07:20.984
Just as a little bit of
review, what this is really

00:07:20.984 --> 00:07:24.553
saying is look out of
this, if we have this

00:07:24.553 --> 00:07:26.736
aggregate planned
expenditures, this is going

00:07:26.736 --> 00:07:28.467
to be the equilibrium point.

00:07:28.467 --> 00:07:32.272
This is the point where expenditures is

00:07:32.272 --> 00:07:34.339
equal to output.

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:38.206
If for whatever reason
the economy is performing,

00:07:38.206 --> 00:07:41.339
is outputting above
that equilibrium point,

00:07:41.339 --> 00:07:44.004
then output which is this line.

00:07:44.004 --> 00:07:46.404
This line could be used
as output or expenditures

00:07:46.404 --> 00:07:48.017
because it's the line where they're equal

00:07:48.017 --> 00:07:49.268
to each other.

00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:51.795
This is where actual
output is outperforming

00:07:51.795 --> 00:07:56.382
planned expenditures I
should say and you have

00:07:56.382 --> 00:07:58.213
all this inventory building up.

00:07:58.213 --> 00:08:00.210
You have all this inventory
building up and so the

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.208
actual investment would be larger than the

00:08:02.208 --> 00:08:03.631
planned investment
because you have all that

00:08:03.631 --> 00:08:06.608
inventory built up.

00:08:06.608 --> 00:08:09.282
If output is below equilibrium,

00:08:09.282 --> 00:08:11.291
then the planned
expenditures are higher than

00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:13.296
output and so people are essentially;

00:08:13.296 --> 00:08:15.336
the economies are going
to have to actually

00:08:15.336 --> 00:08:17.290
dig in to inventory.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.799
The actual investment is
going to be lower than

00:08:19.799 --> 00:08:21.137
the planned investment.

00:08:21.137 --> 00:08:24.059
It will be dug into a
little bit because that

00:08:24.059 --> 00:08:26.588
eating into the inventory,
it would be considered

00:08:26.588 --> 00:08:28.839
to be negative investment.

00:08:28.839 --> 00:08:31.273
Now the whole reason that
I set up this whole thing,

00:08:31.273 --> 00:08:32.937
this was all review
maybe with a little bit

00:08:32.937 --> 00:08:35.172
more detail than we did in the last video,

00:08:35.172 --> 00:08:38.252
is beyond using the
Keynesian Cross for this

00:08:38.252 --> 00:08:41.287
kind of equilibrium
analysis, is to use it to

00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:43.940
go into the Keynesian
mindset of how can we

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.005
actually change the
equilibrium then because

00:08:46.005 --> 00:08:48.334
if we just change the
output, it's natural if

00:08:48.334 --> 00:08:50.940
output is too high, inventories build up.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.755
People will say oh my
inventories are building up.

00:08:52.755 --> 00:08:55.188
I'm going to produce
less, output will go down.

00:08:55.188 --> 00:08:56.739
If inventories are being eaten into,

00:08:56.739 --> 00:08:58.133
they'll produce more
and we'll go back to the

00:08:58.133 --> 00:08:59.301
equilibrium.

00:08:59.301 --> 00:09:01.404
But what if the equilibrium is not where,

00:09:01.404 --> 00:09:03.933
in our opinion, the economy should be?

00:09:03.933 --> 00:09:07.162
What if it's well below full employment?

00:09:07.162 --> 00:09:10.706
What if it's well below our potential?

00:09:10.706 --> 00:09:14.000
For example, what if the
economy's potential at

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.240
full employment is an
output that is something

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:18.910
over here.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:20.616
You could debate what that
point is, but how do you

00:09:20.616 --> 00:09:23.263
get it to there because
you can't just increase the

00:09:23.263 --> 00:09:25.435
supply; you can't just
increase the output; that will

00:09:25.435 --> 00:09:28.272
just make our inventories build up.

00:09:28.272 --> 00:09:29.490
From a Keynesian point
of view, we could say

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.742
well you want to just
shift this actual curve

00:09:32.742 --> 00:09:34.516
and there's a bunch of
ways in which you can

00:09:34.516 --> 00:09:35.671
shift the curve.

00:09:35.671 --> 00:09:37.606
In general, you can change
any of these variables

00:09:37.606 --> 00:09:40.067
right over here, all the
things that we assumed

00:09:40.067 --> 00:09:42.479
are constant, and that
would shift the curve.

00:09:42.479 --> 00:09:45.812
For example, the government
could say hey, I'm

00:09:45.812 --> 00:09:48.269
going to take; the G was at some level.

00:09:48.269 --> 00:09:50.072
What if I pop that G up?

00:09:50.072 --> 00:09:53.813
What if I turn that into
whatever our existing

00:09:53.813 --> 00:09:57.817
G is and then we add some change in G?

00:09:57.817 --> 00:10:00.066
They add some incremental.

00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:02.227
Well now this is going
to be bigger by this

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:04.073
increment right over here.

00:10:04.073 --> 00:10:07.006
Maybe we'll call it this right over here.

00:10:07.006 --> 00:10:08.144
What will happen to the curve?

00:10:08.144 --> 00:10:10.658
It will shift up by that increment.

00:10:10.658 --> 00:10:13.007
Let's see what happens
when we shift the curve up

00:10:13.007 --> 00:10:14.814
by that increment and I'll do that in that

00:10:14.814 --> 00:10:15.723
magenta color.

00:10:15.723 --> 00:10:18.602
If we shift this curve up by delta G,

00:10:18.602 --> 00:10:21.391
if we shift it up by delta
G, it's going to look

00:10:21.391 --> 00:10:24.004
something like this.

00:10:24.004 --> 00:10:25.729
You're not changing
the slope of the curve.

00:10:25.729 --> 00:10:27.315
That's this right over here.

00:10:27.315 --> 00:10:29.225
You're just changing its
intercept, so we just

00:10:29.225 --> 00:10:30.648
added delta G up here.

00:10:30.648 --> 00:10:33.267
This would be B, the
original B plus delta G.

00:10:33.267 --> 00:10:35.736
I guess you could say it that way.

00:10:35.736 --> 00:10:39.006
Our new planned expenditures might look

00:10:39.006 --> 00:10:40.816
something like this.

00:10:40.816 --> 00:10:42.739
Our new planned expenditures
might look something

00:10:42.739 --> 00:10:44.939
like that and that's
pretty interesting because

00:10:44.939 --> 00:10:50.720
now our equilibrium point
is at a significantly

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.005
higher point.

00:10:53.005 --> 00:10:56.403
Our equilibrium point, our
change in our equilibrium,

00:10:56.403 --> 00:11:00.340
so our delta in output
actually went up by more.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:06.007
Our delta in output was
larger than our change

00:11:06.007 --> 00:11:09.640
in spending so it seems
like it was well worth it

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.561
if you believe this analysis right here.

00:11:11.561 --> 00:11:13.671
Visually the reason why
it happened was because

00:11:13.671 --> 00:11:16.462
this line right here had a lower slope.

00:11:16.462 --> 00:11:20.210
The new intersection point
between it and essentially

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:23.337
a slope of 1, it had
to be pushed out more.

00:11:23.337 --> 00:11:24.779
What we'll see in the
last video is that this

00:11:24.779 --> 00:11:26.872
actually works out mathematically as well.

00:11:26.872 --> 00:11:28.939
It's consistent with
what we learned about the

00:11:28.939 --> 00:11:31.006
multiplier effect and
that's actually the reason

00:11:31.006 --> 00:11:33.803
algebraically why this
is happening, why you're

00:11:33.803 --> 00:11:37.882
getting a bigger change in output than the

00:11:37.882 --> 00:11:39.862
incremental shift in demand.

00:11:39.862 --> 00:11:41.604
That's because of the
multiplier effect and we'll

00:11:41.604 --> 00:11:45.000
see it in the next video.
