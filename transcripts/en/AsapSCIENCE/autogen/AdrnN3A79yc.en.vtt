 courses plus Terperi is not the ideal This episode is supported by the great 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.080
 way to study for an exam, but you are here courses plus Terperi is not the ideal 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.059
 You've come to this video for sure with a way to study for an exam, but you're here 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.870
 exam tomorrow or in a couple of hours let's you come to this video for sure with one 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.969
 Focus on what you can do to optimize the exam tomorrow or in a few hours then let us 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.850
 your time. How can you effectively hone your focus on what you can do to optimize 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.160
 before your exam? You may not have your time. How can you effectively hint 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.080
 Learn a lot, but you can save a lot before your exam? You may not 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.580
 information in your short-term memory. Learn a lot, but you can save a lot 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.430
 Try using the ancient technology information in your short-term memory. 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.340
 "Memory Palace". Dated back to before Christ Try using the ancient technique 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.529
 this technique involves associating "memory palace". Dated back to before Christ 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.660
 Ideas you would like to remember with memorable this technique involves associating 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.730
 places like your home. In a study, ideas you would like to remember had memorable 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.500
 medical students created memory palaces places like your home. In one study had 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.329
 To help them remember the effect of insulin medical students created memory palaces 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.760
 For example, in this example, you can save to help them remember the effect of insulin 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.620
 glycolysis in your living room and In this example you can, for example, save 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.870
 ketogenesis in the kitchen. Then you can glycolysis in your living room and 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.640
 Mentally travel through your house to ketogenesis in the kitchen. Then you can 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.800
 remember each room. Those who make mental palaces mentally travel through your house to 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.780
 Manages significantly better remember each room. Those who make memory palaces 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.910
 in test than those who do not and the reason is performing significantly better 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.770
 for that is our visual and ours in test than those who do not and the reason 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.449
 Spatial memory is reasonably strong and for that is our visual and ours 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.430
 connecting information to the already spatial memory is reasonably strong and 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.859
 Existing memories turn out to be extremely connected to information already 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.870
 effectively. You should also use mnemonic existing memories to prove to be extreme 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.790
 aids whenever possible. Try it effectively. You should also use mnemonics 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.680
 to remember the citric acid cycle? Take assistive devices whenever possible. Try it 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.600
 the beginning of each product and one to remember the citric acid cycle? Roof 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.530
 phrase out of it! the beginning of each product and low one 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.310
 [Can you throw large stones against Oskar] statement out of it! 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.229
 You can also create things like rhythms [Can you throw large stones against Oskar] 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.900
 or songs. This method has been proven in You can also create things like rhythms 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.790
 Several studies as a way of tying or singing. This method has been proven in 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.740
 information for memory and the more strange several studies as a way to bind 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.689
 you can make them the better! Involve your information into memory and the stranger 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.939
 exam preparation re-reading notes you can make them the better! Involve yours 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.820
 and books? You are not alone, but you are exam preparation reloading of notes 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.590
 should stop it. In a study and books? You're not alone, but you 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.900
 read participants an educational text. should stop it. In a study 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.509
 A group was then asked to re-read readers an educational text. 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.610
 the text once again while the other A group was then asked to read it again 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.500
 group only read it once. They were the text once again while the other 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.030
 then tested with a multiple choice group only read it once. They became 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.220
 short-answer questions and text summaries then tested with a multiple choice, 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.659
 to measure their ability to short-answer questions and text summaries 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.030
 preserve the information. The experimenters to measure their ability to 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.220
 found no significant difference in preserving the information. Eksperimentatorene 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.740
 the performance between the two groups. found no significant difference in 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.080
 Reloading thus does not give any clear execution between the two groups. 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.180
 advantage. Although we know that examinations are To re-read, so no one gives clear 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.740
 stressful, so put some energy into benefits. Although we know exams are 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.780
 stress relieving while studying and under stressful, so put some energy into it 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.909
 your exam. Stress causes your body to stress while you are studying and under 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.680
 produce adrenaline that increases your exam. Stress causes your body to 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.360
 heart rate and can make you sweat. produce adrenaline that increases your 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.610
 About 20 min after feeling stressed heart rate and can make you sweat. 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.709
 undergoes your body a delayed About 20 minutes after feeling stressed 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.989
 reaction which releases the hormone cortisol. undergoes your body a delayed 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.970
 Cortisol attaches to receptors on reaction that release the hormone cortisol. 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.220
 The hippocampus, which is a seahorse-shaped cortisol, attaches to receptors on 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.140
 part of your brain. It is part of the hippocampus, which is a seahorse-shaped 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.450
 limbic system and that is the hippocampus part of your brain. It's part of it 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.920
 who is responsible for low limbic systems and that is the hippocampus 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.290
 short-term memory to long-term memory that is responsible for low 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.540
 but when cortisol binds to short-term memory into long-term memory 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.910
 The hippocampus damages the retraction but when cortisol binds to it 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.830
 memory. So if you are stressed the hippocampus damages it 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.480
 You will have harder memory. So if you are stressed out 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.090
 Recall information during an exam, so you will have more difficulty with 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.640
 Take some deep breaths! But just to forget about recalling information during an exam, then 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.290
 Stress is easier said than done. Take some deep breaths! But just to forget 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.239
 That's why you need a technique to study stress is easier said than done. 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.220
 which is stress free. Scientists That's why you need a technique to study 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.410
 recommend testing yourself. which is stress free. scientists 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.390
 Exercise tests are not only scientifically recommended to test yourself. 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.250
 Proven Way to Improve Memory Exercise tests are not only scientific 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.500
 But they help to deal with stressful proven way of improving memory 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.870
 situations. Scientists found out that when they do help to cope with stress 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.090
 individuals used exercise tests and subsequent situations. Scientists found out when 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.799
 were put into stressful situations, they managed individuals used exercise tests and subsequently 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.870
 as well as those put into stressful situations, they did 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.360
 was not in a stressful quote. MRI as good as those 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.130
 studies have also proved that exercise tests were not in a stressful quote. MRI 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.140
 Increases the ability of the hippocampus to study has also proved that exercise tests 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.700
 connecting to other parts of the brain increases the ability of the hippocampus to 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.070
 So even though cortisone can harm some connect to other parts of the brain 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.350
 lanes, exercise tests can help so even though cortisone can hurt some 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.239
 to create new paths around the blockages. lanes, exercise tests can help 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.000
 Do you feel distracted? Try a little to create new roads outside the block stores. 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.860
 workout. Studies show that those who feel distracted? Try a little one 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.930
 have exercised for 15 minutes and then workout. Studies show that those who 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.030
 performs a memory task, manages it to exercise for 15 minutes and then 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.100
 significantly faster than anyone performing a memory task can do it 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.590
 did not exercise. Even a simple walk can significantly faster ones ones 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.360
 make a difference. But you also don't have to exercise. Even a simple walk can 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.980
 Take a moment and think about the way make a difference. But you should also t 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.780
 you personally study best. Take a moment and think about that way 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.450
 Metacognition is the analysis of you personally studying best. 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.549
 one's own learning and thought process. metacognition is the analysis of 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.260
 Studies have shown that students with their own learning and thought process. 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.660
 poor metacognitive abilities - ie Studies have shown that students participate 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.430
 they do not know their own poor metacognitive abilities - ie 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.320
 Pieces and weaknesses - generally they fail to know their own 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.170
 poorer in test. So look inward in ways pieces and weaknesses - generally do 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.060
 You have been effective before and worse in tests. So look inward in ways 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.160
 implement these strategies. If you know you have been effective before and 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.959
 that working alone works best for you implementing these strategies. If you know 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.970
 So don't go to the common terpertime. that working alone works best for you 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.280
 with your classmates. It's a busy time! So don't go to the common terpertime. 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.410
 There is also another lot with your classmates. It's a busy time! 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.410
 important note to make. There is also another lot 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.720
 If you try to make far-reaching important note to do. 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.850
 at night because you know very little if you try to go far 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.040
 about a topic for your upcoming exam? night because you know very little 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.530
 Do you hope to refine one already on a topic for your upcoming exam? 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.720
 strong base of knowledge? Hope to refine one already 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.110
 GO TO BED! strong base of knowledge? 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.880
 There are more than a century's worth of studies GOING IN BED! 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.860
 That proves that sleep is essential for There is more than a century's worth of research 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.290
 memory. But if you really prove that sleep is essential 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.970
 is pressed for time memory. But if you really 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.940
 Consider cradling yourself asleep. It is true! One is pressed for time 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.650
 study showed that participants who slept consider to cradle yourself asleep. It is true! One 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.410
 on a bed made to cradle examination showed that participants asleep 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.420
 fell asleep much faster on a bed made to cradle 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.970
 slept deeper and did better in memory fell asleep much faster 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.130
 exercises the next morning, so "rockabyebaby" slept deeper and did better in memory 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.920
 actually works! Of course if you want to exercise the next morning, then "rockabyebaby"
