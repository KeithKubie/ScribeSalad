00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
JAMES GRIME: OK, so,
the superflip--

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.660
so let me write down the
superflip for you.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.160
Rubik's cube fans have a
notation, and they call this

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.910
the up, they call this the
down, they call this the

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.030
right-hand side--

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.760
for obvious reasons-- the
left-hand side, the front,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.130
which is facing me--

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.020
and the back, which is facing
away from me there.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.260
So it's got up, down, left,
right, front, and back.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.400
I can write down the superflip
using this idea.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.740
It's going to take 20 moves.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.470
I'm going to write down what the
20 moves are, then we'll

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.410
try it out.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.910
Looks like this--

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:37.320
up.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.570
So I'm going to turn
the up once.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.670
Now, this means right-hand
side twice--

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.670
once, twice.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.340
Front--

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.310
that's towards me--

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.020
once.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.475
Back-- that's over here.

00:00:51.475 --> 00:00:53.610
That's the back--

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.760
right.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.680
Right-hand side again.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.365
Back twice.

00:00:59.365 --> 00:01:01.180
Look at it there.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.880
Oh, one, two that one too.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.610
Right.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.390
Up twice--

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.900
one, two.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.590
Left--

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.930
back twice--

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.760
one, two.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.220
Right--

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.340
"U" dash-- that means the
opposite direction--

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.510
anticlockwise.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.170
Down--

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.280
anticlockwise.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.600
Right-hand side twice.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.850
Front.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.220
Right-hand side backwards.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.920
Left.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.570
Bottom twice--

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.160
once, twice.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.470
Up twice--

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.500
once, twice.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.826
And then do the front twice,
so once, twice.

00:01:40.826 --> 00:01:42.490
Look at that.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.000
So there are 20 moves
there, and this was

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.220
superflip, the cube.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.830
From the solved state, you get
this really pretty combination

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.650
there, and this is the furthest
away from being

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.620
solved that you can get.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.650
Now, if you look at it, what's
happened is all the corners

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.810
are perfectly fine.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.590
You see, this is the
orange face.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.060
All the orange corners and
the center are just fine.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.124
This is the orange face.

00:02:08.124 --> 00:02:09.960
Look at the edge pieces.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.520
This is the orange-white edge,
and it's flipped over.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.150
Turn it 'round.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.940
This is the orange-blue edge,
and it's flipped over.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.100
This is the orange-yellow edge,
which is flipped over.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.890
And that's the orange-green
edge, and that's flipped over.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.240
So all the edge pieces
flip over.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.640
All the corners are absolutely
fine, and the centers are

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.830
always fine.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.170
They don't move at all.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.630
There's a couple of cool things
about this superflip

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.050
that I haven't told you yet.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.950
So if I do the superflip
twice--

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.160
so the superflip was 20 moves.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.420
If I do it twice, I will get
back to where I started.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.350
In mathematics, we say
it has order 2.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.020
You do it twice, and you'll get
back to where you started.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.360
So that's pretty cool.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.090
The other cool thing about the
superflip is that if I do a

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.030
bunch of moves, and then I do
the superflip, you'll get the

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.520
same answer as if you do the
superflip first, and then you

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.870
do that bunch of moves.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:09.860
So you'll get the same answer.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.680
So if you do superflip first,
and stuff, or if you do stuff

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.140
first, and superflip, you'll get
the exact same position.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.790
In fact, superflip is the only
move that isn't just doing

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.780
nothing at all.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.370
It's the only move that
has that property.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.203
MALE SPEAKER: Because I would
have thought that would be

00:03:32.203 --> 00:03:33.530
true for everything,
but it's not.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.120
JAMES GRIME: It's not
true for everything.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.320
Now, that's really important.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.080
So if I do a move followed
by another

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.410
move, the order matters.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.780
The order matters.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.710
You get a different answer if
you do it in a different

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.030
order, if you swap those over,
except for the superflip.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.140
Only the superflip--

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.050
this works.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.125
The order doesn't matter.

00:03:57.125 --> 00:03:59.520
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, whoa--

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.940
lock up.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.430
No!

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.630
Wha--

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.730
oh, man.
