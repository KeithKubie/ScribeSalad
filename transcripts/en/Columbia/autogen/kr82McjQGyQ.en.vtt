science research council and one of the
 

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:50.840

issues I've raised in that context is

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:50.850
issues I've raised in that context is
 

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:53.690

asked me this week to join a group that
 

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.810
asked me this week to join a group that
will focus on this issue within the

context of the social sciences they're
 

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:04.990
context of the social sciences they're
sort of really worried about the

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:05.000
sort of really worried about the
 

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.760
sort of really worried about the

remember sitting in your office at

00:35:59.400 --> 00:35:59.410
remember sitting in your office at
 

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:03.599
remember sitting in your office at
Columbia ten years ago and having a

00:36:03.599 --> 00:36:03.609
Columbia ten years ago and having a
 

00:36:03.609 --> 00:36:08.849
Columbia ten years ago and having a
conversation very much like this and who

00:36:08.849 --> 00:36:08.859
conversation very much like this and who
 

00:36:08.859 --> 00:36:11.730
conversation very much like this and who
are you meeting with you Oh Misha you

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:16.200
with me be with you enjoy and we were
talking about so I was right then

talking about so I was right then
 

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:18.060
talking about so I was right then
resident were right then and we were

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:18.070
resident were right then and we were
 

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:23.520
resident were right then and we were
talking about ARL and leadership foreign

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:23.530
talking about ARL and leadership foreign
 

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:25.680
talking about ARL and leadership foreign
digital and preservation and the need

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:25.690
digital and preservation and the need
 

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:27.570
digital and preservation and the need
for the libraries to continue to build

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:27.580
for the libraries to continue to build
 

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:30.320
for the libraries to continue to build
collections and take responsibility and

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:30.330
collections and take responsibility and
 

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:35.839
collections and take responsibility and
I wonder if you've seen a shift a

00:36:35.839 --> 00:36:35.849
I wonder if you've seen a shift a
 

00:36:35.849 --> 00:36:39.660
I wonder if you've seen a shift a
positive shift over the last decade to

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:39.670
positive shift over the last decade to
 

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:44.130
positive shift over the last decade to
finally have that finally shows us that

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:44.140
finally have that finally shows us that
 

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:46.550
finally have that finally shows us that
more people are willing to step up I

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560
more people are willing to step up I
 

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:49.290
more people are willing to step up I
think I have seen more of a recognition

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:49.300
think I have seen more of a recognition
 

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:53.190
think I have seen more of a recognition
of the challenge and why it's important

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200
of the challenge and why it's important
 

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.730
of the challenge and why it's important
and the complexity of it and I think

00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:56.740
and the complexity of it and I think
 

00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:59.250
and the complexity of it and I think
when people look at that scale and

00:36:59.250 --> 00:36:59.260
when people look at that scale and
 

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:03.120
when people look at that scale and
complexity they sort of back up and say

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:03.130
complexity they sort of back up and say
 

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:06.030
complexity they sort of back up and say
oh my goodness this is more than I can

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:06.040
oh my goodness this is more than I can
 

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:09.870
oh my goodness this is more than I can
deal with and therefore the

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:09.880
deal with and therefore the
 

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.510
deal with and therefore the
collaborative National systemic if not

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:12.520
collaborative National systemic if not
 

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:15.329
collaborative National systemic if not
global systemic approach is going to be

00:37:15.329 --> 00:37:15.339
global systemic approach is going to be
 

00:37:15.339 --> 00:37:17.250
global systemic approach is going to be

of how he does it and what he picks up
 

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:54.430
of how he does it and what he picks up
and when he doesn't pick up in that

and when he doesn't pick up in that
 

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:59.260
and when he doesn't pick up in that
effort and it just doesn't get into the

00:37:59.260 --> 00:37:59.270
effort and it just doesn't get into the
 

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:02.140

that I think are going to be essential

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:07.910
that I think are going to be essential
 

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:10.030
that I think are going to be essential
going forward so yes I think it's being

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:10.040
going forward so yes I think it's being
 

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.890
going forward so yes I think it's being
embraced and recognized but I think

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:11.900
embraced and recognized but I think
 

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:14.980
embraced and recognized but I think
we're far far short of the solutions

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:14.990
we're far far short of the solutions
 

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:17.410
we're far far short of the solutions
that we need that's why this meeting is

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:17.420
that we need that's why this meeting is
 

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:21.250
that we need that's why this meeting is
so important um Jim one more thing and

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:21.260
so important um Jim one more thing and
 

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.410
so important um Jim one more thing and
it's I guess it is pushing back a little

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:23.420
it's I guess it is pushing back a little
 

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:24.850
it's I guess it is pushing back a little
bit maybe on a couple of things that you

00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:24.860
bit maybe on a couple of things that you
 

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:27.850
bit maybe on a couple of things that you
said and it's that I think for for good

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:27.860
said and it's that I think for for good
 

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:30.180
said and it's that I think for for good
reasons we keep talking about libraries

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:30.190
reasons we keep talking about libraries
 

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:33.670
reasons we keep talking about libraries
and and and in fact there's you know the

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680
and and and in fact there's you know the
 

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.500
and and and in fact there's you know the
archives that are not in libraries

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:35.510
archives that are not in libraries
 

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:37.030
archives that are not in libraries
there's all the archives that are doing

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:37.040
there's all the archives that are doing
 

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:39.670
there's all the archives that are doing
born-digital you know archiving

00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:39.680
born-digital you know archiving
 

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:41.980
born-digital you know archiving
collecting of material that may also

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:41.990
collecting of material that may also
 

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:43.900
collecting of material that may also
happen to be web-only kinds of

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:43.910
happen to be web-only kinds of
 

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:45.370
happen to be web-only kinds of
information and so I think that that

00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:45.380
information and so I think that that
 

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:47.380
information and so I think that that
idea of the who are we talking about

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:47.390
idea of the who are we talking about
 

00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:49.780
idea of the who are we talking about
what is this what is the community what

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:49.790
what is this what is the community what
 

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:53.320
what is this what is the community what
is the the collaborations and the and

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:53.330
is the the collaborations and the and
 

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:55.300
is the the collaborations and the and
therefore the platforms of also all the

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:55.310
therefore the platforms of also all the
 

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:57.490
therefore the platforms of also all the
archival communities and and you know

00:38:57.490 --> 00:38:57.500
archival communities and and you know
 

00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.320
archival communities and and you know
whether that's in private companies and

00:38:59.320 --> 00:38:59.330
whether that's in private companies and
 

00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:01.570
whether that's in private companies and
institutions and in public sector and

00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:01.580
institutions and in public sector and
 

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:03.490
institutions and in public sector and
private sector non-government that

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:03.500
private sector non-government that
 

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:05.740
private sector non-government that
there's a there's we we also need to be

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:05.750
there's a there's we we also need to be
 

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:08.260
there's a there's we we also need to be
brought into the table not just to the

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:08.270
brought into the table not just to the
 

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:10.210
brought into the table not just to the
exclusion of if we're not in a library

00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:10.220
exclusion of if we're not in a library
 

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.190
exclusion of if we're not in a library
then we're not a part of this and I

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:12.200
then we're not a part of this and I
 

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.840
then we're not a part of this and I
think that's an important I agree one

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:13.850
think that's an important I agree one
 

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:15.130
think that's an important I agree one

observation I said it's beginning I was
 

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:19.770
observation I said it's beginning I was
going to use the library lens but for me

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:19.780
going to use the library lens but for me
 

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:23.530
going to use the library lens but for me
library equals lamb libraries archives

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:23.540

meeting as well and I sort of hugged the

00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:30.740
meeting as well and I sort of hugged the
 

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:34.300

with you as well so
my vocabulary needs to change but I

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:37.660
my vocabulary needs to change but I
 

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:41.130
my vocabulary needs to change but I
totally embrace the role of the liar the

totally embrace the role of the liar the

larger archival community in this effort
 

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:46.200
larger archival community in this effort
but I also recognize the importance of

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:46.210
but I also recognize the importance of
 

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:49.280
but I also recognize the importance of

individual libraries are not going to be
 

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:04.470
individual libraries are not going to be
able to solve this problem so absolutely

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480
able to solve this problem so absolutely
 

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:08.600
