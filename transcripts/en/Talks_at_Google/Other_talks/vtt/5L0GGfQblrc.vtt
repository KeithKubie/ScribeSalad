00:00:05.407 --> 00:00:06.990
PRASAD SETTY: Good
afternoon everyone.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.990
Welcome to our Talks at
Google session today.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.180
We are very fortunate to
have a guest amidst us

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.470
who doesn't need
any introduction.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.462
Seriously, how many people
need an introduction

00:00:18.462 --> 00:00:19.295
to Malcolm Gladwell?

00:00:19.295 --> 00:00:21.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.080
PRASAD SETTY: Malcolm was
the bestselling author

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.330
of "The Tipping Point,"
"Blink," "Outliers," et cetera.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.960
He's received many honors.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.160
But I think what he's
probably proudest

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.900
of having accomplished in his
life must be the fact that he

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.130
was our very first Authors
at speaker way back in 2006.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.560
And so that has started
author's tradition

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.800
where we now have had more
than 1,000 speakers come over

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.910
to Google and share
with us their ideas.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.260
Malcolm has recently
written a new book

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.520
called "David and Goliath."

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.870
And that is what we'll
be talking about today.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.870
The format for this,
as you can guess,

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.490
is more of a fireside chat.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.764
I have a set of questions that
many colleagues have shared

00:01:06.764 --> 00:01:08.930
with me, things that they'd
be interested in hearing

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.355
Malcolm's perspectives on.

00:01:10.355 --> 00:01:13.490
But we'll certainly open it up
for a Q&amp;A with all of you folks

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.070
too.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.890
And so there are mikes.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.670
And when it's time, I'll ask
you to line up out there.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.510
And then we do have
certainly books

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.820
to pass around of
"David and Goliath."

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.330
So let's give a very warm round
of welcome to Malcolm Gladwell.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.895
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:38.410
PRASAD SETTY: Malcolm,
just to kick this off,

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.990
what would you like to
tell us about this new book

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.440
and why you chose to write it?

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.440
MALCOLM GLADWELL: Well,
it's a book called

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.300
"David and Goliath."

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.280
And it's about
underdogs, misfits,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.000
and the art of battling giants.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.920
It's about a number of things.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.020
But it's principally about
asymmetrical conflicts

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.690
and the strategies that are
available to the weaker side.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.020
And then sort of
secondarily it's

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.910
about the accuracy of our
assumptions about advantages

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.170
and the nature of advantages
and disadvantages.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.700
So is our perception in an
asymmetrical conflict of one

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.330
side is the favorite and the
other side as the underdog

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.080
accurate?

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.310
Or is it an illusion based
on our own faulty assumptions

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.990
about the nature of advantage?

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.100
And then the third
argument in the book

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.360
has to do with
whether adversity is

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.690
a more useful way of learning
certain kinds of lessons

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:54.260
than conditions
without constraint.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.477
So it's called
"David and Goliath"

00:02:56.477 --> 00:02:58.060
because the story
of David and Goliath

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.910
is in fact a
perfect illustration

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:00.720
of this very thing.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.220
David's choice of
weapon, the sling,

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.120
is actually an incredibly
devastating weapon.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.730
You place a rock
in a leather pouch,

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.280
and you swing it around
at roughly six or seven

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.330
revolutions per second.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.780
You release one of the chords.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.310
The rock goes forward
at speeds, depending

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.130
on the weight of
the rock, speeds

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.120
of probably 30
meters per second.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.080
The stopping power of a typical
projectile launched in that way

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.570
is the equivalent of
a 45 caliber handgun.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.480
And the accuracy of people
in those years with one

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.470
of these things
was extraordinary.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:54.700
We know from primitive
tries that somebody

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.770
with a couple of
years of experience

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.690
could hit the
center of that clock

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.270
very easily from
where I'm standing.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.990
So David up against Goliath
has superior technology.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.020
Routinely slingers
defeated heavy infantry,

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.490
which is what Goliath is,
in combat in ancient times.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.399
In fact, ancient
army's had slingers

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.570
on their kind of payroll
for that precise purpose.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.840
The minute he
takes out the sling

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.520
and it changes the rules of
combat, he is the favorite.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.300
He's not going to lose, right?

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.130
There's only Goliath,
who's lumbering.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.088
And then the other
fascinating about that story

00:04:34.088 --> 00:04:38.117
is that Goliath-- there's
been all this speculation

00:04:38.117 --> 00:04:39.700
in the medical
literature about what's

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.320
going on with Goliath
because there's

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.650
all these weird things he does.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.160
He moves very slowly.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.300
He's led on to the valley
floor by an attendant.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.930
And the thinking is that he
has what's called acromegaly,

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.887
which is the condition
caused by a benign tumor

00:04:54.887 --> 00:04:56.970
on your pituitary gland
that causes overproduction

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.660
of human growth hormone.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.260
He's tall.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.170
He's a giant.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:05.100
Giants are often-- you know,
Andre the Giant had acromegaly.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.020
We think Abraham
Lincoln had acromegaly.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.730
When people are unusually tall,
that's one of the explanations.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.910
And acromegaly
has a side effect,

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.270
which is that it compresses
the optic nerves.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.740
And people with acromegaly often
have severe vision problems.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.990
Goliath is probably half
blind, in other words.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.710
So a guy who's
half blind goes up

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.840
against another guy with an
incredibly lethal weapon,

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.930
accurate to within
a hair's breath

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.370
from 50 yards away and with the
stopping power of 45 pistol.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.120
And yet for 3,000
years we've insisted

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.800
that guy is an underdog.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.040
It's insane, right?

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.710
It's the most irrational
reading of the allocation

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.160
of advantages and
disadvantages in that conflict.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.050
So the question is if we
are so profoundly irrational

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.340
in the way we have read the
relative strengths of the two

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.700
parties in that most
famous of conflicts,

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.960
how many other
situations do we misread?

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.620
And that's what
the book's about.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.982
And I think the answer is lots.

00:06:08.982 --> 00:06:10.690
PRASAD SETTY: And you
do talk about quite

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.690
a few real underdogs
in the book as well.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.660
And one of the examples you
were mentioning at lunch today

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.620
was about this girl's
basketball team.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.009
Tell us about that and
how that was shaped.

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:24.300
MALCOLM GLADWELL: Well this
is one of the reasons I got

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.150
started writing the book is I
ran into a guy who some of you

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:32.020
may know, the guy who founded
Tibco, Vivek Ranadive.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.320
I met him at a conference and
didn't realize who he was.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.760
Weirdly, by the way, I
had another experience

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.620
in this exact same thing where
I met someone at a conference,

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.060
did not realize who
they were, and just

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.250
had a conversation with
sports as a result.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.950
The first person I did
this with was Larry Page.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.520
I met him years
ago, and I thought

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.560
he was just a graduate student.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.350
And I had no idea.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.200
And so I was like, where
did you got to school?

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.640
He's like, oh,
I'm from Michigan.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.120
So we just talked about
Michigan State basketball

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.995
for about 45 minutes.

00:07:03.995 --> 00:07:05.579
And then afterwards,
people were like,

00:07:05.579 --> 00:07:07.078
do you know who you
were talking to?

00:07:07.078 --> 00:07:07.690
I had no clue.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.750
Anyway, I did the same
thing with this guy, Vivek.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.610
So he started
telling me about how

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.040
he coached his 12-year-old
daughter's basketball team.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.950
And because he's Indian, he
had no clue about basketball.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.480
So he goes to-- I mean--

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.722
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:22.722 --> 00:07:24.180
PRASAD SETTY: I
can relate to that.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:24.540
MALCOLM GLADWELL: OK.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:25.040
Good.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.470
Just checking.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.900
There was no natural
reason to assume

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.790
he would know a lot
about basketball.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:31.790
PRASAD SETTY: Underdogs.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:32.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.140
MALCOLM GLADWELL:
That's right, exactly.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.450
Although, only an India, a
country of a billion people,

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:40.700
could claim to be an underdog.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.750
So Vivek goes and studies-- in
his kind of software engineer

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.610
kind of way-- goes to
study basketball games

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.260
and becomes convinced that
Americans are completely

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.230
irrational in the way
they play basketball.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.370
Because he doesn't
understand why,

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.060
if you are the weaker
party in a game,

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.930
you don't do the full
court press all the time.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.340
Because you're going to
lose otherwise, right?

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.220
And by not playing
the full court press,

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.530
you are allowing your opponent
to do precisely the thing

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:10.300
that your opponent
excels at, which

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:15.850
is to pass and dribble and
execute choreographed plays.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:28.450
Why would you give them
the easiest possible route

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.310
to doing the thing that
makes them better than you?

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.280
So he says your only
hope is to slow them down

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.990
and to defeat them at the things
they're not expert at, ie,

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.570
play the full court press.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.513
If it fails, so what?

00:08:40.513 --> 00:08:41.679
You're going to lose anyway.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:43.690
But at least you've
raised your chances

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:49.915
of losing from 95% to
something less than 95%.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.020
This is relevant to him because
his daughter's team is utterly

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.380
without any talent whatsoever.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:04.060
These are the very, very,
very skinny, somewhat nerdy

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.710
daughters of programmers
from Silicon Valley.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.414
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:09.414 --> 00:09:10.830
MALCOLM GLADWELL:
So he does this.

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.590
And his strategy
is we're not going

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:18.720
to learn how to shoot,
dribble, or pass.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.330
We're not even going to practice
any kind of offensive plays.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.830
What you're going
to do is I'm going

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.496
to get you in really,
really good shape.

00:09:24.496 --> 00:09:27.530
And I'm going to teach you to
do this for the entire game.

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:31.310
And what happens is that if
you do this for the entire game

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.280
in a basketball game made
up of 12-year-old girls,

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:38.170
the other team will not advance
the ball past mid court.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.180
And so Vivek's
team starts to win

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.627
by scores like eight, nothing.

00:09:42.627 --> 00:09:43.664
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:43.664 --> 00:09:45.080
MALCOLM GLADWELL:
And they advance

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.329
to the national championships.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.640
It's such a hilarious story.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:58.860
And, of course, the
opponents are so flummoxed

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.250
by this, first of
all, and then outraged

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:05.230
because the thing that Vivek
is playing with his girls

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.450
is not actually
basketball, right?

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:12.670
If you don't dribble,
pass, or shoot, and have

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:15.100
no intention of so
doing, and if the score

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.210
at the end of the game is
something like six, nothing,

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:19.940
that's not basketball.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.230
That's another sport.

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.132
And so they throw
chairs on the court.

00:10:24.132 --> 00:10:26.340
They challenge him to fist
fights in the parking lot.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.790
They scream at the refs.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:31.010
And he is sort of
massively different.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:34.430
To him this is more of
the strange idiosyncrasies

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:38.030
of the American
sporting personality.

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:43.730
And that is a lovely
illustration of my very point

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:49.050
because why is he compelled
to follow this strategy?

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.570
Because he's got nothing, right?

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.410
He's got bupkis.

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:56.191
His girls are incapable of
playing the game of basketball,

00:10:56.191 --> 00:10:56.690
right?

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:57.564
So what does that do?

00:10:57.564 --> 00:11:01.490
It spurs him to find a
completely alternate strategy

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:02.960
that's far more successful.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.470
And this is, of course, the
great story of innovation,

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:05.970
right?

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:12.370
That nothing acts
ts a greater spur

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:18.280
to innovation then the
absence of advantage.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.520
So if that's the case,
there must be situations

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:26.920
where it is not advantageous
to have advantages, right?

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.800
The only situation
where he's better off

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.904
is if his girls are
really talented.

00:11:30.904 --> 00:11:32.320
So there's a series
of conditions.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.350
You could have no talent,
you can have massive talent,

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.320
and you can be
anywhere in the middle.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.670
The only situation
where he could also

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.270
have reached the
national championship

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.610
is in the 99th ninth
percentile condition

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:46.940
where his team is
massively talented.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.560
But had he been at
anything other--

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.115
so he's in the 1% condition.

00:11:51.115 --> 00:11:52.740
That's advantageous
because that forces

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.300
you to play the
full court press.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.870
The 99th percentile
condition is advantageous.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:00.080
But the two through
98 is not advantageous

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.790
because you have no
incentive from to two to 98

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.020
to try anything new.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.170
Your instinct is just
to play the game the way

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.160
the game is supposed
to be played.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.190
So had his girls been
even a little bit better,

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.398
they would've been worse off.

00:12:15.835 --> 00:12:17.210
PRASAD SETTY: So
you're saying we

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:18.864
should be as bad as we can be?

00:12:18.864 --> 00:12:20.280
MALCOLM GLADWELL:
Well, I'm saying

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:27.660
there are situations where being
bad is highly advantageous.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.650
And I don't go into
this in the book,

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:33.410
but if you've read
"Innovator's Dilemma," that's

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:35.690
what "Innovator's Dilemma"
is all about, right?

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.420
The disruptive
outsider is the one

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:42.410
who is incapable of meeting
the marketplace needs

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:44.380
as the market is
traditionally defined.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.280
They can't do it.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.780
So what they do they do?

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.510
They try a completely
new half-assed approach,

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.040
which in the beginning,
doesn't work.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.550
But by that very nature of
trying something completely

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.720
outside the
mainstream, they end up

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.730
upending the--
were they any good,

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:02.910
they would never be
forced to do that.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:04.824
So it's the same
kind of principle.

00:13:04.824 --> 00:13:06.490
PRASAD SETTY: One of
the things that you

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:09.770
talk about in the
book which hinders

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:12.560
your chance of
improving your success

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.820
is something that you say
that we're all susceptible to.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:21.830
And the acronym that you use
is EICD, Elite Institution

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:23.470
Cognitive Disorder.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.230
Tell us about that
because that's

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:28.065
something I'm sure we
don't know anything about.

00:13:28.065 --> 00:13:29.690
MALCOLM GLADWELL: I
gave a talk on this

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:32.190
at the Google
Zeitgeist Conference.

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:35.270
And because I was
having fun with it,

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:37.130
I invented the acronym
for the conference.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.540
It's not actually in the book.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:44.810
Elite Institution Cognitive
Disorder is the mistaken belief

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:48.440
that attending the most elite
institution you can get into

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.220
is always in your best interest.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.950
This is false.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:54.920
There are a number of
many, many situations

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.030
where it is not in your best
interest to go to, for example,

00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:59.560
the best school
you can get into.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.520
But rather it's in
your best interest

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.400
to go to, at the very
most, your second choice,

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:10.130
and probably, ideally, your
third or fourth choice.

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:11.690
The reason is as follows.

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:15.180
The best predictor of success
in a highly competitive

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:19.540
environment like, for example,
law school, or more relevant,

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.200
the one I use in my book
is getting a STEM degree,

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.250
getting a science and math
degree-- science and math

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:28.280
education at the
university level

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.090
is marked by dropout rates
that are north of 50%.

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:36.330
Most people who try to get a
science and math agree fail.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:40.290
So the question is if you would
like to get a science and math

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:43.230
degree, what is the
optimal strategy?

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.740
And the optimal
strategy is not to go

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.480
to the best school you get into.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.150
Why?

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.770
Because the best predictor
of success in getting

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:53.690
a degree is not your absolute
level of intelligence

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.530
but your relative
level of intelligence.

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:57.880
It's your class rank.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.770
It's your rank relative to
your peers in your class,

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:08.280
not your SAT score or your IQ.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:15.380
So basically anyone, if you
fall in the bottom third

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:20.180
of your class, your
chances of dropping out

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.642
rise astronomically.

00:15:22.642 --> 00:15:24.350
So you should basically
follow a strategy

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:26.670
that minimizes your
chances of falling

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.090
in the bottom third
of your class.

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:28.923
What does that mean?

00:15:28.923 --> 00:15:31.810
Don't go to a good
school, right?

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:35.300
Now what's fascinating
about this,

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.990
the amazing thing
about this, is that we

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:42.010
appear to have
consistently undervalued

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:47.370
the psychological
costs of finishing

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.706
in the bottom half of any
competitive situation.

00:15:49.706 --> 00:15:51.080
In other words,
what we overvalue

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.170
is the prestige of
the institution.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.620
And what we undervalue
is the cost to you

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:59.470
of not succeeding
at that institution.

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:01.470
And so there's a
beautiful illustration

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:05.650
of this in this study that
was done of economics PhDs.

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:08.630
So what we do is we take
the top 30 PhD Programs

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.360
in economics in America.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.180
And we break the
students down by how

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:17.810
they rank in their
graduate class.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:21.130
And then we look at
their publication rate

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:24.600
six years out of
attaining their PhD.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.780
These are those who
take the academic route.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:30.650
So in something like economics,
we use your publication rate

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:34.640
as the number of
papers you get accepted

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.640
by prestigious journals.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.310
It's used as a proxy for
your success as an economist.

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:40.880
What do we find when
we look at that?

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.380
What we find is the
95th percentile student

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:49.680
at Harvard, Stanford,
Princeton, MIT, et cetera,

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.720
publishes a lot of papers,
as you would expect.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.110
They're brilliant.

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:57.560
But the drop off from the
95th to the 80th percent

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.170
is astronomical.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:03.240
And by the time you get to
the middle of the PhD class

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.390
at elite schools, they're
not publishing at all.

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:09.880
In fact, the 95th
percentile student

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.790
at the worst PhD
program you can find

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:16.319
will publish more and be a
more successful economist then

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:21.560
the 75th percentile student
at Harvard, MIT, and Stanford.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.849
Now, there are many
explanations for that.

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:25.750
But the most
parsimonious explanation

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:31.500
is it is so traumatic and
humiliating and overwhelming

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:35.230
to be in an elite program and
see a handful of people just

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.540
beat the crap out of you, but
you are permanently impaired.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.670
And my message at
Google Zeitgeist

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:48.010
was that I think
the logical response

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:50.950
to this line of reasoning
is that you should hire only

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:52.750
on the basis of
class rank and not

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.850
on the basis of institution.

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.600
In other words, you
should have don't ask,

00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.800
don't tell when it comes to
the name of your undergraduate

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.842
and graduate institution.

00:18:01.842 --> 00:18:04.050
We should be indifferent to
where you went to school.

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:05.500
We should only
care about how you

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:10.360
ranked because if it's so
devastating to be in anything

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.290
other than the top
third of your class,

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:16.860
I don't want you if you weren't
in the top third of your class,

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:17.560
right?

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.600
Now I'm being playful
a little bit here.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.030
But the point is
do you see how we

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:25.740
have allocated our strengths?

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:29.670
And our notion of
what is an advantage

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:33.420
and what is a disadvantage are
allocated in an irrational way.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:39.330
We've become obsessed with
the advantages of prestige.

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:42.090
We have not paid attention to
the disadvantages of prestige.

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:45.024
And that's a mistake.

00:18:45.024 --> 00:18:46.440
PRASAD SETTY: But
some people seem

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:50.040
to get motivated by being
surrounded by people

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.710
smarter than they are, right?

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:52.632
So that's sort of--

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:54.590
MALCOLM GLADWELL: Not
economic PhDs apparently.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:00.200
MALCOLM GLADWELL: No, I mean,
intuitively, I agree with you.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:04.870
I want to find reasons to
like elite institutions.

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:06.771
All my friends went
to elite institutions.

00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:08.270
Should I have
children, I would want

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:10.220
them to go to
elite institutions.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.970
But the problem is that when
we go and systematically look

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:15.430
for those advantages,
we can't find them.

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:16.680
I don't go into it in my book.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.700
But there's a long
and rich tradition

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:23.260
in economics in
which people hunt

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.190
for the value of
an elite education.

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.440
And they can't find it.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:34.140
So we know that it is the
case that a student who

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:38.060
goes to Harvard earns more money
in the course of their career

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:41.580
than a student who goes to
the University of Tennessee.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.225
OK.

00:19:42.225 --> 00:19:43.975
But that doesn't tell
you anything at all.

00:19:43.975 --> 00:19:47.720
What you really need to do is to
find two students, both of who

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.794
get into Harvard,
one of whom goes

00:19:49.794 --> 00:19:51.460
and one goes to
University of Tennessee.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.870
And then compare
their career earnings.

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:57.960
And when you equalize
for the person,

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.340
you can't find any difference.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:02.202
In other words, it's
not that Harvard

00:20:02.202 --> 00:20:03.410
is making you a lot of money.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.576
It's the kind of person who
gets accepted by Harvard

00:20:05.576 --> 00:20:06.940
makes a lot of money.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:10.751
And then there is an even
cleverer line of things.

00:20:10.751 --> 00:20:12.500
There's now been like
ten studies on this,

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.420
and it's so interesting.

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.220
They now look at
elite high schools.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:23.070
So what is the benefit of going
to a selective high school?

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:27.510
Now, intuitively, you would
think it must show up.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:31.140
You must be able to see, whether
in test scores, or the quality

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:32.910
of the college you go
to, or somewhere, we

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:34.710
must see some impact of that.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:39.680
And we can't find advantage.

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:47.730
Once you do that
equalization thing,

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.630
if you are a smart
kid, in other words,

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:51.330
it doesn't matter
what school you go to.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:58.747
Smart is smart, which is
an intriguing finding.

00:20:58.747 --> 00:20:59.830
PRASAD SETTY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.490
Thank you.

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:04.250
I want to switch
topics a little bit.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:06.030
You know, you do
a remarkable job

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:08.550
of popularizing social sciences.

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:12.497
And by the way, I forgot
to introduce myself.

00:21:12.497 --> 00:21:13.205
I'm Prasad Setty.

00:21:13.205 --> 00:21:14.800
I'm part of people operations.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.410
And I lead the
analytics group, which

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:21.070
is composed of many
social scientists who

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:25.040
love the fact that
Malcolm's work gets

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:29.360
their kind of thinking
into the public limelight.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:34.160
How do you distill and aggregate
all of this research that's

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.410
done in the social
sciences and come up

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:40.390
with what you think are
the most cogent arguments?

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:41.990
Because as you've
mentioned, there

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.120
are lots of studies
done on similar topics.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.950
And some of them point
towards one direction.

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.800
Others point towards a
different direction, et cetera.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.383
MALCOLM GLADWELL:
Well, you're looking

00:21:51.383 --> 00:21:54.580
for trends in the research.

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.810
And so, for example,
the studies I

00:21:57.810 --> 00:21:59.820
was just mentioning
about trying to measure

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.910
the value of elite schools,
that's a very clear trend.

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:05.510
And you've got a
cluster of studies

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:08.920
that have been done in the
last two or three years using

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.180
pretty rich data
sets that are all

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:13.860
coming to roughly
the same conclusion.

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:16.860
So that's the sort of
thing I'm looking for.

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:21.060
What you want to steer clear of
are the one really wacky study

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.892
that is sitting all by itself.

00:22:23.892 --> 00:22:25.100
That doesn't mean it's wrong.

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.330
It's just you have to
approach it with more caution.

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.940
But there's no shortage.

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:31.940
I mean, the thing that's
fascinating about being

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:35.890
a sort of student
of academic research

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:41.920
is that the number of things
that on an academic level--

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:47.040
ideas that are being
pursued and conclusions

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:50.760
that are being drawn that are
quite dramatically at odds

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:54.000
with conventional
wisdom is enormous.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.520
If you're in the game
of, in other words,

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.940
looking in academic
research for ways

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:02.360
to challenge the way
we think about things,

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.500
there's an embarrassment
of riches out there.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.830
I mean, it's not hard to do.

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:12.240
So to me, what always
amazes me, is how much

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.010
fascinating and
useful material lies

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:19.190
buried in academia, just
never sees the light of day

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:24.247
because no one bothers
to go and write about it

00:23:24.247 --> 00:23:25.080
and popularizing it.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:28.200
I mean, it's astounding
how-- you know,

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:33.254
if you talk to academics,
the list of things

00:23:33.254 --> 00:23:35.670
that they think that the rest
of the world is doing wrong,

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:38.640
it's like this long.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:43.646
So it's not a very
difficult process.

00:23:43.646 --> 00:23:46.919
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:46.919 --> 00:23:48.210
PRASAD SETTY: Related question.

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:53.140
You use a lot of stories to
bring your thoughts to life.

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.770
And the stories add a lot
of emotional richness,

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:58.620
and we can really
connect with them.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:02.800
But how do you ensure that the
stories that you're picking

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.620
are the most representative
of the phenomenon that you're

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:07.430
trying to describe?

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:10.300
Because you could
probably find a story

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.390
to fit any theory that
you want, one story.

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:17.320
MALCOLM GLADWELL: Yeah.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.350
So there's a whole set
of trade offs here.

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:27.230
Storytelling, by
definition, has one

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:30.710
great disadvantage, which
is you are representing

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:35.620
a single narrative,
a single experience.

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:39.140
On the other side
of the equation,

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.330
story telling has a
massive advantage,

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:46.080
which is there is no better way
to communicate and move people

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:49.080
than through story.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:52.020
So what I've always tried
to do is-- the reason

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:56.640
I try to balance storytelling
and kind of social science

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.410
research is that
I'm trying to find

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:00.560
some kind of middle ground.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.010
I'm trying to find
an observation that

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:06.340
is being made in the
literature or by academics

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.440
and illustrated by
means of a story.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.970
So it's rare that the
story comes first.

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:14.940
It's not that I hear something
cool and then hunt for data

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:15.487
to fit that.

00:25:15.487 --> 00:25:16.570
It's the other way around.

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:19.160
I look for an idea that's
been expressed in academia.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:28.880
And I say, well, how can I
make that story resonant,

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.090
make that, sorry,
observation resonant?

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:37.340
So you hunt for stories
that match this kind of idea

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:42.990
that you feel has some
firepower behind it.

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:46.870
But that said, it's a
necessarily imperfect process.

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:49.170
All my books are
massively imperfect.

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:52.790
I don't imagine that
anyone will ever

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:55.032
agree with 100% of
the things in my book.

00:25:55.032 --> 00:25:56.740
I don't even want them
to agree with 100%

00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:58.640
of the things in the book.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.950
That's not what you want.

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:02.541
You're not looking for converts.

00:26:02.541 --> 00:26:04.166
You want people to
start conversations.

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:11.890
And writers who are looking
for converts are scary.

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:13.730
I think what you're
looking for is

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:17.380
you want people to
engage with the ideas.

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:22.220
I did a piece for the "New
Yorker" a couple weeks ago

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:26.230
about doping in sports.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:28.890
And I'm a big runner.

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:31.210
I'm a huge fan of
track and field.

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:33.370
If my favorite
runners were found

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:37.130
to be using some kind of
PEDs, I would be devastated.

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.680
Nonetheless, my piece
was all about look at it

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.350
from Lance Armstrong's
point of view, right?

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:44.950
Or look at it from Alex
Rodriguez's point of view.

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:46.900
I simply pointed out
that the arguments

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.390
that we use to justify our
prohibition on performance

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:52.925
enhancing drugs or really lame.

00:26:52.925 --> 00:26:54.530
They're insanely lame.

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:59.114
And you can't run around
condemning people and suing

00:26:59.114 --> 00:27:01.030
them and putting them
in jail, whatever we do,

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:03.082
on the basis of
insanely lame arguments.

00:27:03.082 --> 00:27:04.790
So lame argument number
one, for example,

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:09.320
the one that I cannot get over
is in baseball you are allowed,

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:14.210
if you're a pitcher, to replace
your ulnar collateral ligament

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:16.810
in your elbow, which is the
principal ligament you use when

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:21.430
you throw a baseball-- to take
it out and replace it with

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:25.670
a tendon taken from another part
of your body or from a cadaver

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:27.230
if you so choose.

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:30.280
This tendon will have
performance characteristics

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:34.180
that are infinitely
superior to the ligament

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:35.245
that nature gave you.

00:27:35.245 --> 00:27:38.380
You can swap it out, bring
in the bionic ligament,

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.860
extend your career, be able
to the throw the ball harder.

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:41.640
And what do we do?

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.560
We think that's fantastic.

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.860
75% of pitchers in
the major league

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:48.410
have had this procedure done.

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:50.140
No one bats an eyelash.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:52.306
The guy who pioneered
the procedure

00:27:52.306 --> 00:27:53.430
is considered to be a hero.

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:58.650
Alex Rodriguez is
a baseball player

00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:04.670
who decides to
take testosterone,

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:07.950
a naturally-- he's not taking
something from a cadaver.

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:10.120
He's taking a naturally
occurring hormone

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:13.350
approved by the FDA and
available through prescription

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:15.170
to everyone in this room.

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:16.530
And he's decided to take it.

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:17.650
And what happens?

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:21.300
He's considered to
be a massive villain.

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:25.202
Lance Armstrong takes his
own blood, his own blood,

00:28:25.202 --> 00:28:26.910
and reinjects himself
with his own blood,

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:28.202
and he's considered a villain.

00:28:28.202 --> 00:28:28.910
So wait a minute.

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:33.910
On the one hand,
people are importing

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:38.820
tendons taken from cadavers,
which profoundly alters

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:42.180
performance characteristic
of the arm they use to pitch.

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:43.510
And that's fine.

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:45.130
But you can't take
your own blood

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:46.520
and reinject yourself with it.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.540
And if you do that,
you're a cheater.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.960
Explain to me why that's-- I am
perfectly willing to go after

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.740
Lance Armstrong once
someone makes sense of that

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:56.880
contradiction.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.980
So there's a case
where do I expect

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.670
to convince all of
you of this argument?

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:03.550
No.

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:06.890
But if I, by writing
stuff like that,

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:09.420
force people to just sit
down and actually come up

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:13.990
with better arguments for why
we hate performance enhancing

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:18.082
drugs, then I will
have succeeded I think.

00:29:18.082 --> 00:29:19.540
PRASAD SETTY: I
guess that gives us

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.980
a new benefits idea for Google.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:25.090
Bionic ligaments for
our software engineers

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:27.280
so they can code faster.

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:35.880
PRASAD SETTY: You talk about
how lots of studies in academia

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.810
never find it to
the outside world.

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:42.407
What can we, as society, do to
improve the chances of that?

00:29:42.407 --> 00:29:44.740
Because there is so much
knowledge, and it seems like it

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.072
could be useful
in every day life.

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:54.170
MALCOLM GLADWELL: It's a
really interesting question.

00:29:54.170 --> 00:30:00.910
In general, I think
we have to understand

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:11.340
that the appropriate attitude of
non specialists to specialists

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:20.450
ought to be one of respect,
not necessarily enthusiasm.

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:23.390
You shouldn't always accept
what the expert says as true.

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:27.820
But you should be respectful of
what they know and you don't.

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:30.830
And I think that that is an
ongoing-- unless you take

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:36.530
great pains as a society to
constantly reinforce that idea,

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:38.950
that experts
deserve our respect,

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:41.900
experts will not get respect.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.410
This is on display
right now, right?

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:45.520
You have a group
of lawmakers who

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:49.760
have no respect for the
expertise of the economics

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.090
profession.

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:53.910
I saw a guy on TV the
other day, some lawmaker

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:56.250
from somewhere, who is
like, I don't know anything

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:57.390
about economics.

00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:00.860
I know something about what
it takes to run a household.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:02.520
This is a guy who's in Congress.

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.590
MALCOLM GLADWELL: I mean,
that's problematic, right?

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:12.610
But there has to be a kind
of-- this is something

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:17.190
that you can't ever let
up on enforcing that

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:20.210
as a core ethic in
a technologically

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:22.690
complex society.

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:26.520
Expertise is at the heart
of all progress, right?

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.750
And you have to create
the social conditions

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:31.510
under which expertise
is respected.

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:36.390
And if you let down your
guard at all on that,

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:37.759
crazy things start to happen.

00:31:37.759 --> 00:31:39.300
You have people
running around saying

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.830
that they don't want to
vaccinate their children.

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:43.163
And you have people running
around saying that it's fine

00:31:43.163 --> 00:31:44.920
if we defaulted in two weeks.

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:50.090
You know, there's this kind of
madness that will take over.

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:51.940
I mean, that's not an
answer to the question

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:54.140
because it's really
hard to inculcate that.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:58.460
But the people in
this room and me,

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:03.790
we're all the people who
have to do that kind of work.

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:05.370
PRASAD SETTY: Makes sense.

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:08.130
Why don't folks start
lining up at the mikes?

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:13.170
I think we have one out here
if you want to ask a question.

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:17.410
But I'll keep going
on until you do.

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:20.500
As you think about all the
work that you have done,

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:23.065
has there been an
insight or two that you

00:32:23.065 --> 00:32:25.870
have captured that's
really profoundly shaped

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:28.083
your own behavior,
your own life?

00:32:29.529 --> 00:32:31.070
MALCOLM GLADWELL:
That's interesting.

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:44.880
Well, "Blink," my
second book, it

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:49.100
so profoundly undermined my
belief in my own capacity

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.030
to make good
decisions that I feel

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:55.890
I floundered for
several years after.

00:32:55.890 --> 00:33:00.250
But in all kinds of ways I
just came away from that book

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:07.780
realizing the degree
that we massively

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:12.827
underestimate the role of the
irrational in our own lives.

00:33:12.827 --> 00:33:14.410
And we're constantly
making up stories

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:18.310
that make it sound to
ourselves like we are behaving

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:21.670
in a logical,
commonsensical manner.

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:23.200
And we're simply not.

00:33:27.404 --> 00:33:29.570
One of the guys I run with
is a social psychologist.

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:33.650
And he was telling me about this
study that was done recently

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:42.630
that looked at how the
willingness of a judge

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:46.600
to grant parole varied
by the time of day.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.690
So right before lunch, judges
are really, really crabby

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:51.940
and don't grant parole at all.

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:55.574
And then when they come back
from lunch, their rates soar.

00:33:55.574 --> 00:33:58.240
That's the kind of thing where I
would imagine that if you lined

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.781
up all the criminal
judges in America

00:33:59.781 --> 00:34:02.180
and you told them that,
they would dispute that

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:04.480
so vigorously.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:08.100
They're convinced that they
approach every case the same.

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:10.540
And you do the
simplest analysis,

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:15.190
and you discover a very
disturbing pattern.

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:19.110
Now, maybe some part of
that is auto factual.

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:19.760
Who knows?

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.739
But it certainly merits
some investigation, right?

00:34:24.739 --> 00:34:28.239
Well, I feel like there's
versions of that everywhere.

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:30.360
And we're so resistant
to kind of acknowledging

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.777
that about our lives.

00:34:32.777 --> 00:34:35.360
PRASAD SETTY: Why don't we take
one of the audience questions.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.830
AUDIENCE: So I was really
fascinated by your Zeitgeist

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:39.830
talk about elite institutions.

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:44.550
And thinking if we take
Google as a potential elite

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:47.010
institution, I'm
curious of your thoughts

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:51.670
on the potential damage we
may be doing to ourselves

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:54.429
and our employees
because not everyone here

00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:55.877
can be the superstar.

00:34:55.877 --> 00:34:57.460
And yet most of the
people coming here

00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:00.040
were superstars before.

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.240
So I'm curious if you have
any research or thoughts

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.907
on the impact of that
for organizations.

00:35:03.907 --> 00:35:06.115
MALCOLM GLADWELL: So this
is an interesting question.

00:35:06.115 --> 00:35:08.440
So how do you restructure
organizations such

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:12.780
that you minimize the
psychological damage of people

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.250
at the bottom of the hierarchy?

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:17.610
So one way is to limit the
notion of hierarchy, right?

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:23.000
So the thing that is so toxic
about elite colleges in science

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.605
and math programs is
that necessarily there

00:35:25.605 --> 00:35:26.230
is a hierarchy.

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:29.930
You give out grades, and
you know were you rank.

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:32.100
And you're in a classroom
setting where you're all

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:33.600
trying to do the same thing.

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.730
So you can easily compare
yourself to your peers

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:38.260
and know whether you're behind.

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:39.980
Those conditions
don't necessarily

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.300
apply in the workplace.

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.990
It's possible to
construct work places that

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:46.960
don't have the toxic element of
hierarchy to the same degree.

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:52.485
AUDIENCE: We shouldn't
give grades then at Google?

00:35:52.485 --> 00:35:55.200
MALCOLM GLADWELL: Well, I don't
know how you-- no, I mean,

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.741
it wouldn't be as
explicit as grades.

00:35:56.741 --> 00:36:00.370
But I'm saying that you can
organize a workplace in a very,

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:04.010
very hierarchical way or
you could choose not to.

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:06.290
The other thing it
would tell you is it

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:10.620
would say something about
the size of teams as well.

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:13.360
I mean, it would
seem to argue, I

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.230
would think--
although maybe not.

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:18.440
It's really about the
structure of teams.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:23.340
To the extent that you can
keep things that are as flat

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:26.190
as possible, I think you
minimize the damage caused

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:29.343
by hierarchy's.

00:36:29.343 --> 00:36:30.506
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:30.506 --> 00:36:31.630
Thanks for coming to speak.

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:35.330
So I just started in people
operations about a month ago.

00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:36.970
And since I've
been here, I've had

00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:39.400
a lot of people recommend
"Strength Finder"

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.990
and other books like that,
and I've taken a look at it.

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:44.200
And I can't help but
think that things

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:47.400
like that are kind of, as the
great skeptic James Randi said,

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:52.150
"flim flam," or like modern
day pseudo social science.

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:54.390
And I'm wondering if you
have any insight into those

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:56.556
because I know companies
spend a lot of money buying

00:36:56.556 --> 00:36:58.752
those kinds of books
for their employees.

00:36:58.752 --> 00:37:00.210
MALCOLM GLADWELL:
I have to confess

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:02.140
I've never read any of those.

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:05.779
I mean, I know that
they're very successful.

00:37:05.779 --> 00:37:07.820
AUDIENCE: In sales or in
what they set out to do?

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:08.944
MALCOLM GLADWELL: In sales.

00:37:08.944 --> 00:37:11.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.510
MALCOLM GLADWELL: But
I guess I would only

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:15.720
say it's interesting
though that there

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:19.550
is such a hunger for
that kind of thing.

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:22.280
I will say this, people are
experience rich and theory

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.040
poor.

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:28.460
Most people
necessarily lack access

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:31.480
to organizing principles
in their life.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.495
If you're not immersed
in the world of academia

00:37:33.495 --> 00:37:38.910
and you don't have the
leisure to follow and acquire

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:41.510
grand theories, you don't have
theories to explain things.

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:45.200
So whenever someone comes along
with an explanatory mechanism

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:48.580
for something that you're
experience rich in,

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:50.680
it's enormously attractive.

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:55.027
So if "Strength Finder" is
lousy, it's incumbent on us

00:37:55.027 --> 00:37:57.110
just to come up with better
and more sophisticated

00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:59.720
ways of-- but it's
clear that there

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:04.457
is a massive demand for
something to allow people

00:38:04.457 --> 00:38:05.665
to organize their experience.

00:38:08.134 --> 00:38:09.050
AUDIENCE: Hey Malcolm.

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:09.930
My name is Mike.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:11.176
Thanks for being here.

00:38:11.176 --> 00:38:12.550
My question is
kind of going back

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:15.700
to the value of elite
institutions again.

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:17.535
So you talk about
how someone who

00:38:17.535 --> 00:38:18.910
goes to Harvard,
someone who goes

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:22.580
to the University of Tennessee,
they are intrinsically

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:27.220
going to do the same if they are
on the same intelligence level.

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.882
So I guess my
question is, you know,

00:38:28.882 --> 00:38:31.790
you hear you're kind of the
average of the five people

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:32.500
you hang around.

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:34.680
You surround yourself with
people who are smarter

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:37.982
than you, you will naturally
elevate your level.

00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:38.940
Do you believe in that?

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:41.280
Or do you believe
that's kind of-- it

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:45.100
seems like your
theory kind of puts

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.700
demerits towards
that thought process.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.870
MALCOLM GLADWELL: Well,
there's a couple of things.

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:55.180
One is that one of the
implications of that argument

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:58.310
is that there are a lot
more very able people

00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:01.979
at non-elite institutions
than we think.

00:39:01.979 --> 00:39:04.020
And actually this is kind
of a fascinating thing.

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:07.930
So to take a step backwards,
the larger question

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:13.120
is how efficient are elite
educational institutions

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:16.720
as search engines for talent?

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:19.130
What percentage of
qualified students

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:22.100
do they actually uncover?

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.880
And the answer is we used to
think they were very efficient.

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.680
What we have
discovered recently is

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.830
they're actually
quite inefficient.

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:31.390
In other words, enormous numbers
of very, very intellectually

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:38.110
capable people never even come
close to the 250 top colleges

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:39.240
in the country.

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:42.120
So non-selective colleges
have a much larger share

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:47.770
of the intellectual aristocracy
than we would imagine.

00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:51.740
So to your question, if you go
to the University of Tennessee,

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:54.119
you can find lots
and lots and lots

00:39:54.119 --> 00:39:55.910
of very, very intellectually
capable people

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:57.239
to hang around with.

00:39:57.239 --> 00:39:59.530
And if you are that kid who
could have gone to Harvard,

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:03.340
you will probably
gravitate to those five.

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:05.994
So you'll be surrounded by peers
who may be every bit as able.

00:40:05.994 --> 00:40:08.160
But the difference is that
you will almost certainly

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.680
be the top of your
class as opposed

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:12.055
to running the risk at being
in the middle or the bottom.

00:40:12.055 --> 00:40:16.420
So you're getting two benefits,
intellectual benefits,

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:20.440
as opposed to maybe only one.

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.872
The other thing, of course,
is that-- well, I'll

00:40:22.872 --> 00:40:23.580
leave it at that.

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:26.320
There are many, many parallel
arguments along these lines.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:29.630
Now, of course, not everyone
can follow this strategy.

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:33.170
If everyone does, it
ceases to work, right?

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:35.800
Everyone can't go down a notch.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:39.460
So the whole thing is if you're
going to follow this strategy,

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:43.690
do it quick before I sell too
many books and the advantage

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:46.587
is wiped out.

00:40:46.587 --> 00:40:48.920
AUDIENCE: So you said in
response to a previous question

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:52.536
that it would be useful to
eliminate some hierarchy so

00:40:52.536 --> 00:40:55.160
that you get rid of this problem
of people being at the bottom.

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:58.710
But how do we know that's the
bigger issue as opposed to it's

00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:01.584
just a great boost to people
when they are at the top?

00:41:01.584 --> 00:41:03.500
And if that was the
predominating factor, then

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:06.002
maybe we should just have
more awards or more ways

00:41:06.002 --> 00:41:07.430
to recognize people.

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:09.270
MALCOLM GLADWELL: Oh, I see.

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:11.960
You mean have a kind
of pretend hierarchy

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:13.845
where you give everyone
a pat on the back?

00:41:13.845 --> 00:41:15.220
AUDIENCE: Or maybe
we should have

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:16.474
even more levels of hierarchy.

00:41:16.474 --> 00:41:17.640
MALCOLM GLADWELL: Oh, I see.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:23.500
Well, so the classic study--
let's see if I get this right.

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.010
The classic study
in this regard,

00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:27.176
which I talk about in the
book, is this famous study

00:41:27.176 --> 00:41:27.910
that was done.

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:30.560
The largest psychological
study ever in the United States

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:34.100
was done during the second
World War of American soldiers.

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.510
And one of the most
interesting insights

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:43.420
was a comparison of
commissioned officers in the Air

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:46.090
Force, the Air Corps, the
precursor to the Air Force,

00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:49.120
and commissioned officers
in the military police.

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:52.160
And the question was
who was more satisfied

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:55.990
with their promotion
prospects, the openness

00:41:55.990 --> 00:42:00.640
of their institution
to rewarding talent?

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:05.440
And the answer was that the
people in the military police

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.280
were way more
satisfied with that

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:09.030
than people in the Air Force.

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:11.860
This was very puzzling because
almost no one got promoted

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:14.230
in the military police,
and everyone got promotions

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:15.880
in the Air Force.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:18.140
So why would people
be more satisfied

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:19.230
in the military police?

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:24.450
Well, the answer is that so many
people got promoted in the Air

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:28.730
Force, that getting promoted
was meaningless, right?

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:34.700
The median condition
in the military police

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:35.772
was not getting promoted.

00:42:35.772 --> 00:42:37.980
So if you didn't get promoted
in the military police,

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:39.460
you were like, well, no one is.

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:39.960
That's fine.

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:42.950
If you didn't get
promoted in the Air Force,

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:45.172
oh, man, you're devastated
because everyone's

00:42:45.172 --> 00:42:45.880
getting promoted.

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:47.800
And if you did get promoted,
it's like, who cares?

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:48.966
Everyone's getting promoted.

00:42:48.966 --> 00:42:53.260
So it's like this
totally inverted thing.

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.104
You think that you're
making life better

00:42:55.104 --> 00:42:56.020
by promoting everyone.

00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:57.050
But you're not.

00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:02.380
You're simply altering the
set of existing expectations.

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:07.300
So, yeah, I don't know whether
you could-- messing around

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:10.010
with hierarchies is a
very, very, very, very

00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:10.929
tricky business.

00:43:10.929 --> 00:43:13.595
And it's probably better just to
try to avoid them when you can.

00:43:15.922 --> 00:43:16.880
PRASAD SETTY: Go ahead.

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:17.890
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming in.

00:43:17.890 --> 00:43:19.390
My question is a little
bit around, I guess,

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:20.350
your media diet.

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:23.020
Obviously, as someone who writes
a lot about social science,

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:24.540
you have to go through a
lot of academic journals.

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:26.810
But what I was actually
really interested to see

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:29.950
was that you had a really
cogent and fluent conversation

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:33.355
with Bill Simmons on
his blog about sports

00:43:33.355 --> 00:43:34.240
and different topics.

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:36.100
So I was wondering a little bit
about your media diet outside

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:37.910
of the academic journal
sphere, and, like,

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:39.701
how you kind of keep
your mind and horizons

00:43:39.701 --> 00:43:40.954
broad across different topics.

00:43:40.954 --> 00:43:42.870
MALCOLM GLADWELL: Well,
I'm a huge sports fan.

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:46.080
So there's an enormous
amount of consumption

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.750
of sports related stuff.

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:54.040
And particularly these days I
spend enormous amounts of time

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.800
watching obscure
European track and field

00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:01.260
meets on sort of live streams
of 2:00 in the morning.

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:04.260
So there's that.

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:09.040
But I think, you know, my
strategy has always-- you

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:11.190
have to very consciously
differentiate yourself

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:14.290
from where you think
your professional peer

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:17.080
group is going.

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:22.680
So to the extent
that people migrate

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:25.520
to things that are
accessible online,

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.380
I feel I should
migrate to things

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:31.170
that are inaccessible online.

00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:34.150
Or to the extent that
people stop reading books,

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:37.830
I feel I need to
read more books.

00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:40.060
So what I've been
trying to do is

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:42.030
to kind of-- it's why
I spend a lot of time

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:46.750
in actual physical libraries
reading things in hard copy

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:50.460
because there's a
kind of serendipity

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:53.290
that you get when you--
and this is not in anyway

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:56.830
meant as a criticism, by
the way, of search engines,

00:44:56.830 --> 00:44:59.670
for example, which
are incredibly useful.

00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:02.580
But they also have limitations.

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:04.840
They reward a certain
kind of serendipity,

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:07.960
and they punish another
kind of serendipity.

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:11.240
And if you you're interested
in serendipitous learning,

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:15.380
as I am-- much of what I uncover
is uncovered serendipitously--

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:18.410
you have to be a student of
all of the different mechanisms

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:24.090
of chance encounters with the
unusual and the insightful.

00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:27.670
And so that means that not
only do I spend a lot of time

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:30.230
screwing around
online on databases,

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:32.740
but I also very,
very consciously make

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:35.220
sure that I go to
physical libraries

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:37.540
and walk through the stacks.

00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:41.066
And even something as simple as
you're interested in one book

00:45:41.066 --> 00:45:42.440
and then you go
and you just look

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:45.380
at all of the books
that surround it.

00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:49.262
And the connections
are not always--

00:45:49.262 --> 00:45:50.720
there are connections
between them.

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.790
But it's a different
kind of connection

00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:54.400
than they would be
connected online.

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.210
It's not a keyword connection.

00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:58.102
It's a thematic connection.

00:45:58.102 --> 00:45:59.560
So there's all
these sorts of-- you

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:07.360
have to be a student of the
different ways in which ideas

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:09.580
cluster.

00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:12.820
And I've thought a lot
about that in recent years

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:17.549
as a way of distinguishing
myself from other journalists.

00:46:17.549 --> 00:46:18.090
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:19.180
Have a quick question.

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:24.370
In your last book, "Outliers,"
you spoke about the advantages

00:46:24.370 --> 00:46:27.050
of, whether it's being
born in a certain year

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:31.270
or having access to the earliest
computers and stuff like that.

00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:34.120
And in this book you
have a whole new section

00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:38.239
called the disadvantages
of being advantageous.

00:46:38.239 --> 00:46:40.030
I was wondering if you
see a contradiction,

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:41.744
or how do you reconcile the two?

00:46:41.744 --> 00:46:43.660
MALCOLM GLADWELL: Well,
I have several answers

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:46.610
to that question.

00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:49.770
So there's clearly a
difference between-- the notion

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:52.890
that I play with in this book
is called desirable difficulty.

00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:57.270
And desirable
difficulty is a class

00:46:57.270 --> 00:47:00.660
of difficulties that have
paradoxical outcomes that

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:03.920
force you to do things that
end up being advantageous.

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:10.690
So there's a whole
school of research

00:47:10.690 --> 00:47:12.792
around these people at
UCLA called the bjorks who

00:47:12.792 --> 00:47:15.250
try to uncover specific examples
of desirable difficulties.

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:17.166
A good one would be, for
example, a simple one

00:47:17.166 --> 00:47:20.416
would be studying strategies.

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:26.770
To the extent that you can
make your studying process more

00:47:26.770 --> 00:47:30.027
difficult, you will
retain more information.

00:47:30.027 --> 00:47:31.610
So the bjorks have
this beautiful data

00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:36.910
that says if you're learning
something very complex,

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:41.940
the best thing to do is to
learn it in small chunks.

00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:45.630
So say I have three tasks
that require mastery.

00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:46.440
I have two choices.

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:49.530
I can master the first, master
the second, master the third.

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:53.930
Or I can break up all the
learning into 10 minute chunks

00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:56.120
and do 10 minutes, 10
minutes, 10 minutes.

00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:59.020
They say do the latter
even though it's harder,

00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:00.979
even though you have to
start over every time.

00:48:00.979 --> 00:48:02.520
You go ten minutes,
ten minutes, then

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:03.450
you come back to
the first thing.

00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:05.116
You're like, oh, what
was I doing again?

00:48:05.116 --> 00:48:06.820
It's this reentry problem.

00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:09.420
The reentry problem
is not a problem.

00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:12.520
It's why you will remember
and master it way better.

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:16.540
It's forcing your brain to kind
of go into a different mode.

00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:19.390
So the idea is
that, yeah, there's

00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:23.170
a set of things-- getting
access to-- if learning

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:26.840
programming requires
10,000 hours of mastery

00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:29.370
and you're in a condition
where access to computers

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:31.910
is constrained, early
access to computers

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:35.590
will be an unalloyed
advantage, right?

00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:38.300
But that doesn't mean that
there aren't other situations

00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:43.930
that we could find where what
looks like access to something

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:46.470
preferentially may look
advantageous and not

00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:47.750
be advantageous at all.

00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:50.940
So my discussion of
dyslexia in the book

00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:56.100
is all about conditions under
which not knowing how to read

00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:57.830
can be advantageous.

00:48:57.830 --> 00:48:58.330
Why?

00:48:58.330 --> 00:49:03.570
Because the strategies that
you might follow to work around

00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:05.950
your reading problem
can end up being

00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:08.350
more helpful to
you then reading.

00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:10.560
So I have this long
thing about David Boies.

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:13.090
He's the lawyer who
basically can't read

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:17.190
and as a result developed an
incredible capacity to listen

00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:19.392
and an incredible memory.

00:49:19.392 --> 00:49:21.100
If you're a trial
lawyer, believe or not,

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:23.300
it's more important to
have an amazing memory

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:26.331
and be an incredible listener
than it is to know how to read.

00:49:26.331 --> 00:49:28.330
Not if you're a litigator
or a corporate lawyer.

00:49:28.330 --> 00:49:29.910
But if you're a
trial lawyer, yeah.

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:30.930
Not if you're, sorry,
a corporate lawyer,

00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:32.138
but if you're a trial lawyer.

00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:36.900
We can clearly say, look, there
are desirable difficulties

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:38.920
and there are
undesirable difficulties.

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:41.380
That said, on a
broader, macro level

00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:44.160
is there a possible
contradiction?

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.850
Yeah.

00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:48.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:49.500
MALCOLM GLADWELL: But so what?

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:51.454
We're all adults.

00:49:51.454 --> 00:49:53.870
I don't know why people are
so terrified of contradiction.

00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:56.610
I think contradiction is fine.

00:49:56.610 --> 00:49:59.680
I mean, I can identify
hundreds of contradictions

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:00.880
in my own life.

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:02.490
All of you can.

00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:09.640
In fact, this next
project I'm working on

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:12.790
is all about the
centrality of contradiction

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:14.460
in human behavior.

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:17.300
And the idea has always been
that as human beings, what

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:22.060
we seek to do is to locate
and extinguish contradictions.

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:23.754
I think that's nonsense.

00:50:23.754 --> 00:50:25.920
And there's a lot of very
interesting social science

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.360
research which suggests
to the contrary.

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:32.170
What we do is we exploit,
we aggressively exploit,

00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:33.040
our contradictions.

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:36.464
They enable us to do all kinds
of-- not always good things.

00:50:36.464 --> 00:50:38.630
So I'm very interested in--
I was talking about this

00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:44.210
at lunch-- very interested in
this notion that we sometimes

00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:47.370
behave generously
or pro-socially

00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:50.400
towards an outsider
group in order

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:54.830
to justify turning on them
in some future situation.

00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:59.310
And the incredible
example of this

00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:02.680
is Adolph Eichmann,
the architect

00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:07.830
of The Final Solution, who
spends the 1930s pretending,

00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:11.510
not pretending, convincing
himself that he's a Zionist.

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:15.290
He reads books on Zionism.

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:16.790
He goes to Jerusalem.

00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:21.480
He hangs out with
the rabbis of Vienna.

00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:24.880
He teaches himself Hebrew.

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:26.626
And he does this.

00:51:26.626 --> 00:51:28.750
And what that means is that
when it comes time to--

00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:32.660
and he's responsible in the '30s
for deporting thousands of Jews

00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:34.570
from Vienna to Palestine.

00:51:34.570 --> 00:51:35.580
What does that do?

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:39.750
It enables him, when he
turns to exterminating Jews,

00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:44.690
to be able to say to himself,
in his grotesque way,

00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:46.320
I don't hate Jews.

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:47.340
I was deporting them.

00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:48.500
I was saving them.

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:50.980
I was reading Hebrew
and going to Jerusalem.

00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:54.700
And at one of the death
camps that he sets up,

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:57.010
he builds a library.

00:51:57.010 --> 00:52:00.560
And he imports Judaica from
a prominent Jewish library

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:01.370
in Prague.

00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:05.270
And he would go and visit
this place, this grotesque

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:07.200
concentration camp,
and sit in the library

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:09.435
and read ancient
Hebrew manuscripts.

00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:15.330
At his core, this man had
a massive contradiction.

00:52:15.330 --> 00:52:17.810
And he was driven to resolve it.

00:52:17.810 --> 00:52:20.600
He used it to
justify everything he

00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:22.240
did over the course of the war.

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:25.950
Now that's a horrible,
extreme, grotesque example.

00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:30.150
But my point is that we all have
within us these contradictions.

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:34.820
And I think that's part of
what it means to be human.

00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:36.900
And just as you can
use contributions

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:39.160
for terrible ends,
like Eichmann did,

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:42.600
they are also, at the same
time, the ways in which we

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:47.710
explore new ideas and expose
ourself to risky things

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:50.460
and do all kinds of things
that are ultimately positive.

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:54.170
And if you're not willing
to tolerate contradiction

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:59.140
in your own life, I think
you're limiting yourself

00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:01.610
in a certain sense.

00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:04.070
You're also running huge risks.

00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:06.670
The Eichmann route is
the risky route, right?

00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:08.960
But at the same
time, someone who

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:14.750
insists that everything be
absolutely consistent is

00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:18.100
leading an impoverished
life, I think.

00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:21.180
So, yeah, I [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:22.400
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.650
PRASAD SETTY: Why don't
we take one more question?

00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:26.066
AUDIENCE: In the
context of Google

00:53:26.066 --> 00:53:27.620
and "The Innovator's
Dilemma" that

00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:31.550
you mentioned earlier,
when you are a giant,

00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:35.380
how do you stay a giant and
kind of, towards the book,

00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:37.590
not be slayed by a David?

00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:38.176
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:38.176 --> 00:53:39.259
MALCOLM GLADWELL: Oh, wow.

00:53:39.259 --> 00:53:45.184
Well, you know you will
be eventually, right?

00:53:45.184 --> 00:53:46.845
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:46.845 --> 00:53:48.220
MALCOLM GLADWELL:
I mean, give me

00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:55.110
an example of-- in
your space there's

00:53:55.110 --> 00:54:00.280
kind of IBM, which does this
thing which in retrospect seems

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:02.880
unbelievable, that
they've managed to kind

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:07.190
of resuscitate themselves
and transform themselves.

00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:11.810
But they might be a sui generis.

00:54:11.810 --> 00:54:14.100
Maybe they were just in
such an unusual position

00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:17.430
and were so deeply rooted in
so many parts of the world

00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:21.090
and had such a deep bench
that that was possible.

00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:25.890
But the rule is you
don't get to-- it's not

00:54:25.890 --> 00:54:28.820
going to last longer
than a generation or so.

00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:32.820
Maybe part of the answer
is, that's fine, as long

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:36.600
as you don't think about Google,
as long as you think about you,

00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:38.280
right?

00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:41.520
So years ago, I
remember doing this--

00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:46.410
it was the first time
this hit home for me.

00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:48.510
I went to Rochester.

00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:52.260
And in Rochester, it used
to be a high technology

00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:56.440
hub, Kodak, Xerox,
Bausch and Lomb.

00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:59.110
But one of the biggest
employers in Rochester,

00:54:59.110 --> 00:55:05.970
high tech employers in the
1960s, was General Dynamics,

00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:08.670
I think General Dynamics, one
of the big defense contractors.

00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:12.140
They employed vast
numbers of engineers.

00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:13.920
And basically their
business model

00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:16.250
implodes after the Vietnam War.

00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:20.470
And they shut down their
operations in Rochester

00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:21.420
and moved away.

00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:23.050
And everyone said, oh, my God.

00:55:23.050 --> 00:55:24.370
It's over.

00:55:24.370 --> 00:55:26.795
One of the biggest employers
in town has folded.

00:55:26.795 --> 00:55:28.920
And what happened, if you
went back 10 years later,

00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:33.220
was you discovered that the
talent that was kicked out

00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:35.500
of General Dynamics
went on to start

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:39.240
so many start-ups in
Rochester that they sparked

00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:43.250
a whole second wave that
ended up actually being,

00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:45.830
in terms of employment and
income brought into the city,

00:55:45.830 --> 00:55:49.516
greater than the benefits
General Dynamics had risen.

00:55:49.516 --> 00:55:54.610
In other words, Google may
fall one day, probably will.

00:55:54.610 --> 00:55:58.170
But you won't.

00:55:58.170 --> 00:56:00.370
You guys will all,
hopefully, many of you,

00:56:00.370 --> 00:56:02.900
will go on and do other
incredibly cool things

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:06.560
because of what you learned
while you were here.

00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:08.640
So you can look at it two ways.

00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:10.129
There's a pessimist view.

00:56:10.129 --> 00:56:11.920
But there's also a view
that says, no, it's

00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:13.859
part of the natural cycle.

00:56:13.859 --> 00:56:15.400
You probably don't
want to be working

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:18.264
at Google-- is this
horrible to say?

00:56:18.264 --> 00:56:20.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:22.360
MALCOLM GLADWELL:
--25 years from now.

00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:26.892
And nor does society want you
to be if this company doesn't

00:56:26.892 --> 00:56:28.350
evolve in dramatic--
maybe it will.

00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:30.020
I mean, I'm just using
Google as a stand

00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:31.820
in for-- let's use
another company.

00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:32.342
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:32.342 --> 00:56:33.550
MALCOLM GLADWELL: Let's say--

00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:34.810
AUDIENCE: Microsoft.

00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:36.320
MALCOLM GLADWELL: Microsoft.

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:38.590
I mean, at this point would
the world be better off

00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:41.250
if Microsoft
disappeared tomorrow?

00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:42.321
Yeah.

00:56:42.321 --> 00:56:44.189
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:44.189 --> 00:56:46.480
MALCOLM GLADWELL: How many
unbelievably talented people

00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:50.070
are trapped working on the
umpteenth version of Word,

00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:51.282
right?

00:56:51.282 --> 00:56:52.365
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:52.365 --> 00:56:53.781
MALCOLM GLADWELL:
Like, that's not

00:56:53.781 --> 00:56:57.830
a good use of 150 IQ points.

00:56:57.830 --> 00:57:05.477
So I'd be more kind of
sanguine about this problem

00:57:05.477 --> 00:57:06.810
than you might be at the moment.

00:57:06.810 --> 00:57:08.692
PRASAD SETTY: Thank you.

00:57:08.692 --> 00:57:11.150
I can't think of a
