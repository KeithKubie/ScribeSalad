00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:01.807
- [Instructor] What we're
gonna do in this video

00:00:01.807 --> 00:00:03.953
is talk a little bit
more about federal powers

00:00:03.953 --> 00:00:08.020
versus state powers, and as
we've mentioned in other videos,

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.819
this is a relevant
topic because even today

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:14.765
you'll have Supreme Court
decisions being decided

00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:18.235
based on citing different
parts of the Constitution

00:00:18.235 --> 00:00:21.543
or various amendments that seem
to give one power or another

00:00:21.543 --> 00:00:24.322
more to the federal government
or to the state government.

00:00:24.322 --> 00:00:28.231
Another important appreciation
is the balance of power

00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:31.132
or the shifts of power
between federal and state.

00:00:31.132 --> 00:00:33.621
It has historically changed over time,

00:00:33.621 --> 00:00:35.817
so it isn't this fixed thing.

00:00:35.817 --> 00:00:38.115
So in a previous video, we talked about

00:00:38.115 --> 00:00:41.559
the enumerated powers that
the Constitution gives

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:43.238
the federal government.

00:00:43.238 --> 00:00:47.121
In particular, we have talked
about the Commerce Clause

00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:50.908
that allows the federal
government "to regulate Commerce

00:00:50.908 --> 00:00:53.461
among the several states,"

00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:56.500
which has turned out to be a
much farther-reaching power

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.064
than maybe the drafters of
the Constitution intended.

00:01:00.064 --> 00:01:02.212
And then, the thing
that really gives power

00:01:02.212 --> 00:01:03.967
to even the enumerated powers

00:01:03.967 --> 00:01:06.193
is the necessary and proper clause.

00:01:06.193 --> 00:01:09.901
"To make all Laws which
shall be necessary and proper

00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:13.342
"for carrying into Execution
the foregoing Powers,"

00:01:13.342 --> 00:01:15.000
and so this is what we talk about,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.511
this necessary and proper clause,

00:01:16.511 --> 00:01:19.089
creates a lot of implied powers.

00:01:19.089 --> 00:01:20.883
So you can imagine, this isn't,

00:01:20.883 --> 00:01:23.257
the necessary and proper
clause is not something

00:01:23.257 --> 00:01:25.396
that made the Antifederalists very happy.

00:01:25.396 --> 00:01:28.117
They were worried about power grabs

00:01:28.117 --> 00:01:30.146
by the federal government.

00:01:30.146 --> 00:01:32.157
And so you have the Bill of Rights

00:01:32.157 --> 00:01:34.365
which are the first 10 amendments.

00:01:34.365 --> 00:01:36.900
And the 9th and 10th
amendment in particular

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.729
are Antifederalists' attempt

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.037
to limit the federal government's power.

00:01:43.037 --> 00:01:44.589
So the 9th Amendment says,

00:01:44.589 --> 00:01:47.426
"The enumeration in the
Constitution, of certain rights,

00:01:47.426 --> 00:01:51.736
"shall not be construed to
deny or disparage others

00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:55.167
"retained by the people,"
and even more important,

00:01:55.167 --> 00:01:57.405
the 10th Amendment, and
this is really speaking to

00:01:57.405 --> 00:02:01.062
federal versus state powers,
"The powers not delegated

00:02:01.062 --> 00:02:03.723
"to the United States
by the Constitution,"

00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:05.675
so not delegated to
the federal government,

00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:08.417
"nor prohibited by it,"
the federal government,

00:02:08.417 --> 00:02:12.375
"to the States, are reserved
to the States respectively,

00:02:12.375 --> 00:02:15.607
"or to the people," and
so you could view this

00:02:15.607 --> 00:02:17.753
as reserved powers for the states.

00:02:17.753 --> 00:02:19.338
It's an Antifederalist attempt to say,

00:02:19.338 --> 00:02:21.550
"Hey, you know, the federal
government can't just

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.983
"do whatever it wants."

00:02:22.983 --> 00:02:24.734
It's trying to put a little bit of a check

00:02:24.734 --> 00:02:27.532
on the necessary and proper clause.

00:02:27.532 --> 00:02:30.116
So if you fast-forward to the period right

00:02:30.116 --> 00:02:33.193
after the Civil War, you
have the 13th Amendment,

00:02:33.193 --> 00:02:36.014
which bans slavery, and then
you have the 14th Amendment,

00:02:36.014 --> 00:02:40.217
which is trying to bring
slaves into society,

00:02:40.217 --> 00:02:42.224
allow them to be citizens, not just them

00:02:42.224 --> 00:02:45.154
but their descendants, and
this is in direct contradiction

00:02:45.154 --> 00:02:48.240
of the 1857 Dred Scott
decision that we'll talk about

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.708
in other videos where the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled

00:02:51.708 --> 00:02:55.394
that slaves and their
descendants are not considered

00:02:55.394 --> 00:02:58.063
American citizens and so
they don't have a right

00:02:58.063 --> 00:03:01.574
to petition the government,
but the 14th Amendment says,

00:03:01.574 --> 00:03:04.829
"All persons born or naturalized
in the United States,

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.926
"and subject to the jurisdiction
thereof, are citizens

00:03:08.926 --> 00:03:13.331
"of the United States and of
the State wherein they reside.

00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:16.693
"No State shall make or enforce any law,"

00:03:16.693 --> 00:03:18.949
and so this is actually
putting constraints on states,

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.285
and so as we'll see, even
though this is in the context

00:03:21.285 --> 00:03:25.217
of the post-Civil War era,
because it's putting constraints

00:03:25.217 --> 00:03:27.026
on states, this is one of the amendments

00:03:27.026 --> 00:03:29.453
that's often cited that puts more power

00:03:29.453 --> 00:03:31.251
in the hands of the federal government.

00:03:31.251 --> 00:03:35.104
"No State shall make or
enforce any law which shall

00:03:35.104 --> 00:03:38.091
"abridge the privileges
or immunities of citizens

00:03:38.091 --> 00:03:41.064
"of the United States; nor shall any State

00:03:41.064 --> 00:03:45.118
"deprive any person of
life, liberty, or property,

00:03:45.118 --> 00:03:48.910
"without due process of
law; nor deny to any person

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.444
"within its jurisdiction the
equal protection of the laws."

00:03:53.444 --> 00:03:55.462
The 14th Amendment has been very relevant

00:03:55.462 --> 00:03:57.796
in some very current debates.

00:03:57.796 --> 00:04:01.115
This notion of that any state, no state,

00:04:01.115 --> 00:04:03.781
can deprive any person of
life, liberty, or property

00:04:03.781 --> 00:04:05.965
without due process of law,

00:04:05.965 --> 00:04:08.325
this is often known as
the due process clause

00:04:08.325 --> 00:04:11.298
and it's this idea that no
state can really strip away

00:04:11.298 --> 00:04:13.828
some of the rights that
might be articulated in say

00:04:13.828 --> 00:04:16.627
The Bill of Rights,
"nor deny to any person

00:04:16.627 --> 00:04:20.590
"within its jurisdiction the
equal protection of the laws."

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.897
This is often known as the
equal protection clause.

00:04:22.897 --> 00:04:26.158
This is, you could view
it as a protection against

00:04:26.158 --> 00:04:28.479
some form of discrimination.

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.264
And so even in very current debates

00:04:30.264 --> 00:04:34.352
around things like abortion
or same-sex marriage,

00:04:34.352 --> 00:04:38.519
much of the debate will center
around the 14th Amendment.
