00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.300
It's normal to think that we'll cry
when sad stuff happens on screen,

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.900
when a character we've come to like dies,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.080
when a relationship we wanted to believe in falls apart,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.680
when a favorite animal doesn't make it.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.420
Of course, we do sometimes shed tears here,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.320
but the odd thing is, especially the older we get,

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.400
we start crying not when things are horrible 
- one toughens up a little -

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.440
but when they're suddenly,
and unexpectedly, precisely the opposite.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.520
When they're unusually sweet, 
tender, joyful, innocent, or kind.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.220
"And the little one is Beatrice."

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.700
"Oh, Beatrice, she's got mischievous glint in her eye, doesn't she?"

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.500
"Yeah, unbelievable."

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.300
"Forgot napkins."

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.200
"Okay, 33 seconds."

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.800
For example, when a rather gruff,
distant father shows vulnerability,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.120
"I'm proud of you, Flint."

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.040
"I'm amazed that someone as ordinary as me"

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.400
"could be the father of someone
as extraordinary as you."

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.360
when two lovers who'd been rowing make it up,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.780
when a child says something
incredibly sweet and innocent,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.940
"I'm really good."

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.760
when someone is so tender with somebody else.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.860
Far more than grimness,
it's a particular grace and loveliness

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.660
which can, for a moment, feel heart breaking.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.900
We're crying not because
something sad has happened on the screen,

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.680
but because what's so lovely on screen
is nudging us to realize, semi-consciously,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.220
that some pretty sad things
have been happening in our lives.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.580
The loveliness is drawing our attention
to some of the struggles we face,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.120
and to some of the things we really want,
but are finding it so hard to get:

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.840
reconciliation, forgiveness, tenderness,
an end to the fighting, a chance to say sorry.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.460
We start to cry at a brief vision of a state of grace
from which we're exiled most of the time.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.840
We ache for all the lost innocence of the world.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.860
Loveliness and goodness can make the actual ugliness of our existence all the more vivid.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.740
That's also why, if we were to consider
the unusual project of creating a robot

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.820
that could cry at the movies, we would have to do something apparently rather cruel.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.820
We would have to ensure
that this robot knew all about suffering,

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.380
for it's only against a background of pain
that beautiful scenes in films

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.820
become deeply moving, rather than merely nice.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.320
Our tears are telling us something key,

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.600
that our lives are tougher
than they used to be we were little,

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.080
and that our longing for
uncomplicated niceness and goodness

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.840
is, correspondingly, all the more intense.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:02.400
[choir singing]

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.680
"But when Johnny lifts her at the end..."

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.820
"No, I know, it's a very... it's a great movie."

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.920
"If you tell anyone I'll kill you."

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.460
"Yeah, understood, yeah, hundred percent."
