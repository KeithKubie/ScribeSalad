00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.670
[music playing]

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.120
NARRATOR: Outside the ruins
of Sacsayhuaman, just a mile

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.710
and a half from the
Coricancha Temple in Cusco,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.170
are little-known entrances
to underground passageways

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.540
dating back to the Inca.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.710
Many of the openings
have been covered up

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.040
and sealed for public
safety, but a few

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.250
still remain accessible.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.170
In 2017, David Childress
visited the site of one

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.540
of the remaining open tunnels.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.000
DAVID CHILDRESS: There
is a labyrinth of tunnels

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.830
beneath Cusco, and they
extend for hundreds

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.380
of miles in every direction.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.250
And some of these
tunnels even intersect.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.920
Over the years,
these tunnels have

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.670
been blocked off and sealed.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.710
But you can still access
parts of this tunnel system,

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.920
such as this tunnel here,
cut through solid rock.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.080
Local legend says
that the sun disc

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.250
was transported out of the
city through these tunnels.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.790
There's been a lot of
speculation of where the sun

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.580
disc was taken, and
treasure hunters

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.790
have been searching for
this location for centuries.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.620
ASHLEY COWIE:
Legends recount three

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.960
myths as to how with the sacred
golden sun disc left Cusco.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.750
Some legends maintain that it
was taken out through a tunnel

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.790
system to Grand
Paititi, a lost Inca

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.920
village at the top
of a mountain which

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.790
the Spanish never, ever found.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.460
Some maintain it was
taken to Sacsayhuaman,

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.670
and some maintain it was
returned to Lake Titicaca

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.330
from whence it came.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.620
NARRATOR: Located more than
200 miles southeast of Cusco

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.170
at an elevation of over
12,500 feet above sea level,

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.460
Titicaca is the highest
navigable lake in the world

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.750
and considered sacred to
the local Andean population.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.250
WILLIAM HENRY: In the
Incan creation myth,

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.920
their god Viracocha
emerged from Lake Titicaca.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.620
This goes along with ancient
myths and legends that tell us

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.460
that there is an etheric
or etherial city that's

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.670
underneath Lake Titicaca.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.500
In light of this, it makes sense
that the Incas returned their

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.210
prized golden disc to the lake.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.710
ASHLEY COWIE: The
temple was said

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.540
to be a thing of imagination--
a thing of wonder,

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.540
until the year 2000.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.540
In the year 2000, a team of
Italian divers and scientists

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.120
ventured to the base
of Lake Titicaca

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.040
after finding a
road of Inca stones.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.710
They followed the road for
just less than half a mile

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:56.000
into the lake and
discovered a 650-

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.500
by 150-foot temple underneath
the waters of Lake Titicaca.
