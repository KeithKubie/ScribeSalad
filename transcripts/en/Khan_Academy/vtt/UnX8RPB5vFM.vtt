00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.103
- [Instructor] We are now

00:00:01.103 --> 00:00:02.360
going to introduce ourselves

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.310
to the idea of Utility in Economics.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.760
Now in everyday language,

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.750
if someone says what's
the Utility of that?

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.250
They're usually saying
what's the usefulness

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.260
of doing that.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.663
And Utility in Economics

00:00:14.663 --> 00:00:17.220
takes that view of Utility

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.550
and extends that a little bit.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.640
You could view Utility in Economics

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.810
as a measure of usefulness,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.570
usefulness, worth, value.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.100
Some economists will even say

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.720
it's a measure of happiness

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.940
'cause things that might
not have a practical use

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.060
can still have Utility
to them in Economics

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.930
because they're giving
you some satisfaction

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.130
or some happiness,

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.740
or I'll even write that over here.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.190
And as we'll see, it is
something that economists

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.360
try to measure or try to quantify,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.600
and they do it with just Utility units.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.310
So let's see a tangible example of that.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.140
So let's say you wanted to think about

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.210
your Utility from scoops of ice cream.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.120
So if we say, let's make a col,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.550
let's make a table here.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.030
So number of scoops,

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.800
that'll be in my left column,

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.640
and then on my right column,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.950
let's think about Total Utility,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.950
and I will do it in utils.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.000
You could view that as
your unit of Utility.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.043
And let me put my columns in here.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.920
So, there we go.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.753
And so let's say

00:01:28.753 --> 00:01:31.610
if I have zero scoops of ice cream,

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.443
well you might guess

00:01:32.443 --> 00:01:34.010
what my Utility is going to be,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.500
it is going to be zero.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.270
Now what if I have one scoop of ice cream?

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.103
Well let's just say that

00:01:40.103 --> 00:01:42.550
that is 80 Utility units.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.480
And I know what you're thinking,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.590
Sal, where did you come
with 80 Utility units?

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.220
And this is really just
an arbitrary number

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.720
that I'm throwing down here.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.090
What's more important is what this is

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.140
relative to my Utility for other things.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.100
So, for example, using this scale,

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.770
if I said two scoops of ice cream,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.967
my Total Utility is 140.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.760
80 and 140 aren't what matter.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.030
What matters is the ratio between the two.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.260
So if I said my Utility

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.770
for one scoop of ice cream was 800,

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.960
then, if this ratio is true,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.700
then for two scoops of ice cream,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.520
my Total Utility would be 1,400.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.750
It could be eight million and 14 million.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.540
What matters is the relative Utility.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.010
I just happened to anchor on one scoop

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.420
gives me eight units, Total Utility units.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.320
But let's keep going.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.370
If we go with this scale,

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.829
then three scoops of ice cream,

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.800
let's say that this gives me

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.767
180 units of Utility.

00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:43.090
And I know what you're saying.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.480
Even if you get the ratio right,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.320
how do you even know that

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.750
this is the right ratio?

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.130
Well, economists will
debate how to measure this,

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.380
but there might be ways
that you could measure it

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.270
maybe with dollars,

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.750
with what people are willing to pay,

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.260
and then you can get the ratios.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.510
You could survey people.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.180
You could say on a scale of 10, one to 10,

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.650
how happy will it make you

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.720
if you got one scoop of ice cream?

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.300
What if you got two scoops of ice cream?

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.133
What if you got three?

00:03:05.133 --> 00:03:07.290
And then you would wanna
get these ratios right.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.210
But, of course, it isn't an exact science,

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.250
but people are trying to quantity this.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.830
Now let's just go to four.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.070
Four scoops of ice cream

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.260
would give you a Total Utility,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.440
let's say we knew it would give you

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.440
a Total Utility of 170.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.760
Now something interesting is happening.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.910
As you got more scoops of ice cream,

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.200
from zero to one, from one to two,

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.600
from two to three,

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.520
it looks like you're getting more Utility,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.720
but then all of a sudden,

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.110
when you have four scoops of ice cream,

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.370
your Total Utility goes down a little bit.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.520
Maybe it's because

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.270
people can't eat four scoops of ice cream

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.480
and they say what do I do with that?

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.330
And they just have all,

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.170
they're left with a bowl
of melted ice cream.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.300
And so it doesn't give
them as much Utility,

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.900
it makes them feel bad somehow

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.990
as having three bowls of ice cream

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.900
or three scoops of ice cream.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.500
Another thing to think about is

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.410
how much does the Total Utility increase

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.810
every time you get

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.940
an incremental unit of that thing?

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.660
And we'll talk about it in more depth

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.691
in future videos, but that general idea

00:04:06.691 --> 00:04:09.380
of how much more Utility you get

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.280
for that incremental unit.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.250
In Economics when we're talking about

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.070
what happens on the increment,

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.813
we use the word marginal a lot.

00:04:18.096 --> 00:04:21.233
Marginal Utility,

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.733
sometimes abbreviated mu.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.330
And this would still be in Utility units.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.580
And so we could start with that first

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.120
going from zero to one.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.860
I'll start with that
first scoop of ice cream.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.450
What's the marginal utility?

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.560
Well it gave you an incremental 80 units

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.740
of Utility, so the marginal utility is 80.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.000
Now what about that
second scoop of ice cream?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.320
Well we know when you had one,

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.360
you had 80 Total Utility units,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.610
and now when you have two, you have 140,

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.810
so that incremental second scoop

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.760
gave you to go from 80 to 140,

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.850
it gave you 60 extra units of Utility.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.710
So notice, you are really,

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.710
it really increased your happiness or,

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.470
you got a lot of value
out of that first scoop

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.610
and you still got value

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.480
outta that second scoop,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.890
but it's a little bit less

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.730
because you're not maybe
just as not as hungry,

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.040
you're getting a little bit tired

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.890
of the ice cream.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.190
And then that continues to happen

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.730
on that third scoop,
to go from 140 to 180,

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.763
that third scoop gave
you 40 units of Utility.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.110
And then as we talked about,

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.020
when you add on that fourth scoop,

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.610
it didn't even add to your Total Utility,

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.350
it took away from your Total Utility.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.640
So it actually had a
negative marginal utility.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.100
It is negative 10.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.690
That fourth scoop actually took away

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.090
from your happiness.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.800
So I will leave you there.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.420
You have this idea of
Utility, Total Utility,

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.240
and we also looked at Marginal Utility.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.350
And you see in this example,

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.930
and this is typical, that Marginal Utility

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.230
typically decreases as you get

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.720
more and more units of that thing.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.840
And in future videos,

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.330
we're going to use this
framework of Utility,

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.220
Total Utility, Marginal Utility,

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.740
to think about how folks

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.050
might make rational decisions

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.193
to optimize their Total Utility.
