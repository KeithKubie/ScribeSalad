language you're learning when we talk
about vowels in the context of IPA or

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680
about vowels in the context of IPA or
 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.190
about vowels in the context of IPA or
phonetics we don't tend to say things

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200
phonetics we don't tend to say things
 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.180
phonetics we don't tend to say things
like the letter A or the letter U or the

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:26.190
like the letter A or the letter U or the
 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.210
like the letter A or the letter U or the
vowel U even instead we break down

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220
vowel U even instead we break down
 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.730
vowel U even instead we break down
vowels by their features and features

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740
vowels by their features and features
 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.340
vowels by their features and features
are kind of like the component parts of

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350
are kind of like the component parts of
 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.599
are kind of like the component parts of
vowels each vowel has multiple features

00:00:37.599 --> 00:00:37.609
vowels each vowel has multiple features
 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:40.279
vowels each vowel has multiple features
the first of these features is vowel

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:40.289
the first of these features is vowel
 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:42.919
the first of these features is vowel
height if you want to think about it

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:42.929
height if you want to think about it
 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:45.049
height if you want to think about it
anatomically you can distinguish

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059
anatomically you can distinguish
 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.779
anatomically you can distinguish
different vowel Heights by considering

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789
different vowel Heights by considering
 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.520
different vowel Heights by considering
the position of your jaw when you make a

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530
the position of your jaw when you make a
 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.369
the position of your jaw when you make a
certain vowel sound for instance when I

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379
certain vowel sound for instance when I
 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.119
certain vowel sound for instance when I
make the open sound all my jaw is in a

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129
make the open sound all my jaw is in a
 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.189
make the open sound all my jaw is in a
different position than it is when I say

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199
different position than it is when I say
 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.139
different position than it is when I say
the closed vowel e so my jaw opens up

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149
the closed vowel e so my jaw opens up
 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.300
the closed vowel e so my jaw opens up
between E and all you can also relate

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310
between E and all you can also relate
 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.790
between E and all you can also relate
hype to how close your tongue is to the

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800
hype to how close your tongue is to the
 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.340
hype to how close your tongue is to the
roof of your mouth it's closer when you

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350
roof of your mouth it's closer when you
 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.800
roof of your mouth it's closer when you
say the sound e than it is when you say

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810
say the sound e than it is when you say
 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.070
say the sound e than it is when you say
all we can distinguish open mid and

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080
all we can distinguish open mid and
 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.510
all we can distinguish open mid and
closed vowels backness is the other

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520
closed vowels backness is the other
 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.190
closed vowels backness is the other
feature we should distinguish at this

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
feature we should distinguish at this
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.160
feature we should distinguish at this
point backness involves instead what we

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
point backness involves instead what we
 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.920
point backness involves instead what we
can think of as how far forward and how

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930
can think of as how far forward and how
 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.070
can think of as how far forward and how
far back our tongue is in our mouth

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080
far back our tongue is in our mouth
 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.690
far back our tongue is in our mouth
that's the anatomical way of thinking

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700
that's the anatomical way of thinking
 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.720
that's the anatomical way of thinking
about it so if you again say the vowel e

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730
about it so if you again say the vowel e
 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.360
about it so if you again say the vowel e
your tongue is fairly far forward in

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370
your tongue is fairly far forward in
 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.270
your tongue is fairly far forward in
your mouth but if you say all you pull

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280
your mouth but if you say all you pull
 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.560
your mouth but if you say all you pull
it back so that's the feature backness

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570
it back so that's the feature backness
 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.270
it back so that's the feature backness
we can distinguish three levels of

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280
we can distinguish three levels of
 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.120
we can distinguish three levels of
backness the first one is going to be

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130
backness the first one is going to be
 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.210
backness the first one is going to be
back the second one is central and the

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220
back the second one is central and the
 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.719
back the second one is central and the
third is front

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729
third is front
 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.600
third is front
using those two features backness and

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610
using those two features backness and
 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.880
using those two features backness and
height we can lay vowels out on the

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890
height we can lay vowels out on the
 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.270
height we can lay vowels out on the
table with the x axis being backness and

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280
table with the x axis being backness and
 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.080
table with the x axis being backness and
the y axis being height this will allow

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090
the y axis being height this will allow
 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.940
the y axis being height this will allow
you to lay out all of your basic vowels

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950
you to lay out all of your basic vowels
 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.830
you to lay out all of your basic vowels
on a chart and to be able to pronounce

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840
on a chart and to be able to pronounce
 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.320
on a chart and to be able to pronounce
them in relation to each other let's

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330
them in relation to each other let's
 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.089
them in relation to each other let's
take a look at one of those charts and

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099
take a look at one of those charts and
 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.970
take a look at one of those charts and
how pronounce the sounds for you e eh eh

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980
how pronounce the sounds for you e eh eh
 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:38.410
how pronounce the sounds for you e eh eh
eh ah ah ah oh oh ah ah
