00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.140
No one likes going to the dentist, but you
should all go every year.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.140
Because really, do you want to risk an infection
in the biggest hole in your head?!

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:15.960
Hey guys, Amy talking the joys of oral hygiene
with you on DNews today!

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.419
As many as 700 types of bacteria can live
in our mouths, though most people only host

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:23.000
between 34 and 72 varieties.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.749
Some of these bacteria are innocuous, others
known as probiotics actually help us digest

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:27.749
food.

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:30.429
There are even bacterial strains that protect
our teeth and gums.

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.450
But there are some bad bacteria living in
your mouth as well.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.570
One is called streptococcus mutans.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.650
This bacteria feeds on the sugars and starches
you eat, producing enamel-eroding acids as

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.060
a by-product, which can lead to tooth decay.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.300
Another bad bacteria is porphyromonas gingivalis,
which is linked to periodontitis, a serious

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.490
and progressive disease that affects the soft
tissue and the alveolar bone that support

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.870
the teeth causing tooth pain and in some cases
tooth loss.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.950
For most of us, our main dental issue will
be plaque, the film that builds up on your

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.890
teeth and contains the bacteria that produces
enamel-destroying acids.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.310
Regular cleanings get rid of plaque, but if
you don’t clean the plaque from your teeth

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.650
it hardens into tartar, which can get below
your gums, causing inflammation and infection.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.070
That can open a pathway into your bloodstream.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.600
Once that bacteria is in your blood, it can
get anywhere.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.909
The first place that bacteria-filled blood
could go is your heart where there is some

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.819
evidence that it can lead to atherosclerosis,
or a hardening of the arteries caused by plaque,

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:27.869
though this is a different kind of plaque
than you'd find on your teeth.

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.630
The plaque in your arteries is made of cholesterol,
fatty substances, cellular waste products,

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.179
calcium and a clotting agent called fibrin.

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:38.819
It builds up and thickens the walls of the
arteries, constricting blood flow and increasing

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:40.299
risk of a heart attack.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.369
Clogged or blocked arteries can also restrict
blood flow to the brain, increasing risk of

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.369
stroke.

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.299
A recent single hospital study in Osaka, Japan,
found that a quarter of stroke victims had

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.630
a bacteria called cnm-positive S. mutans in
their saliva.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.829
The researchers acknowledged that it’s a
rare bacteria only 10 percent of people have,

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.119
but it’s still enough to reinforce the link
between the oral bacterium and stroke.

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.159
And mouth bacteria can even follow a path
to your brain, increasing risk of dementia.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.570
A 2013 study from the University of Central
Lancashire found a correlation between the

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.060
bacteria commonly associated with gingivitis
and an immune response that may kill neurons.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.700
This could ultimately change the brain in
a way consistent with Alzheimer’s disease.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.610
And, if that weren't bad enough, letting bacteria
form colonies in your mouth can also lead

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.440
to lung infections, but not through the bloodstream…

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.560
Instead you literally breathe oral microbes
into your lungs, where it can infect and spread.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.860
And your oral health doesn’t just impact
your body health, it can be a good indicator

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.910
of your overall health.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.290
For example: gum disease can be a sign of
diabetes, painful mucosal lesions are more

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.050
common in people who are HIV positive, and
tooth weakness or loss can be a sign of osteoporosis.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.030
So it should be said that this is a huge “more
research is needed” topic since most studies

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.990
have small sample sizes and need follow-up
work.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.650
And experts somewhat begrudgingly admit that
we just don’t know yet whether treating

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.900
gum disease can reduce the risk of heart attack,
stroke, or dementia.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.140
But, really, do you need more motivation for
keeping up with dental visits than maintaining

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.140
good teeth for chewing?

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.140
Floss!

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.140
Brush!

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.140
And above all: go to the dentist!

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.410
And speaking of painful things in your mouth,
confused about the difference between canker

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.950
sores and cold sores?

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:30.390
We were, too, so Trace explains it in this
video right here.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.610
So how many of you always go in your yearly
dental cleaning?

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.610
I do!
