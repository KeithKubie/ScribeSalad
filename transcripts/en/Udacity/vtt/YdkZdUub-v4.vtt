00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.920
Well so, there's a couple a ways to think about it,

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.230
but let me just kind of go top down. So, here's what I'm

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.640
thinking. I think the same principle applies, where you sort of want to

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.600
ask the question that gives you the maximum amount of information. And

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.430
from the teacher's point of view, I might be able to

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.680
pick a question that gives you the answer right away, depending upon

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.990
what h is and what x is. But from the learner's point

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.970
of view, I sort of can't. So what does the learner know?

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.346
&gt;&gt; So, when we ask a question,

00:00:25.346 --> 00:00:29.155
x, it's going to either have a yes answer. Or a no

00:00:29.155 --> 00:00:32.342
answer. And let's say that at any given point in time,

00:00:32.342 --> 00:00:36.270
we have n possible people that we're trying to reason about.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.010
And then after we choose x, after we choose the question,

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.220
if the answer is yes then we're going to have, I don't

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.790
know, some other number of people. Let's say l. And if

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.370
the answer is no then it's going to be n minus l,

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.290
right? And so you said that in the case of the teacher,

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.460
pick a question so that this yes is going to whittle it

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.630
down so that this is just going to be the one right answer.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.970
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right. That, that's assuming that x is set up

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.180
in such a way that you could ask that kind of question.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.080
&gt;&gt; Basically a question could be of the form, is it this or this or this

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.220
or this or this? Any pattern of answers

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.550
that we want, we can construct the corresponding question.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.980
&gt;&gt; Okay, that makes sense to me and I don't think it changes, my

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.830
thought process, so, so, that's good. So

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.380
I always want to ask the question that's going to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.740
give me maximum information. I'm the learner.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.570
I don't know, everything like the teacher does,

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.630
but what I do know are all of my hypotheses. Alright. So I know how

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.900
each hypothesis responds to each of the

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.100
questions. So, in general, it seems to me

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.890
that I should try to eliminate as many

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.240
hypotheses as I can, okay? That makes sense?

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll write that down. I like that.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.224
&gt;&gt; Now, you could say,

00:01:40.224 --> 00:01:42.876
that's what the teacher did. But, let's take what the teacher did,

00:01:42.876 --> 00:01:45.564
the teacher knew that there was a hypothesis where it would whittle

00:01:45.564 --> 00:01:47.964
it down that, since the answer was yes, it would whittle it

00:01:47.964 --> 00:01:50.365
down to one. But if the answer had been no, it would have

00:01:50.365 --> 00:01:53.264
only gotten rid of one. So since the teacher knew the answer

00:01:53.264 --> 00:01:57.203
the teacher could pick that question. But as a learner, I don't know

00:01:57.203 --> 00:02:00.966
the answer, so finding questions that whittle it down to one if

00:02:00.966 --> 00:02:05.209
the answer is yes aren't very helpful because the answer might be no.

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.650
&gt;&gt; Alright

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.538
so how many. Let's see so under the assumption the

00:02:08.538 --> 00:02:11.840
target hypothesis was chosen from H say, uniformly at random.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.070
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.620
&gt;&gt; What's the expected number of hypotheses we

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.530
can eliminate with a question that has this form?

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.450
&gt;&gt; Well, it's binary. So if you assume

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.600
that the hypothesis covers every, the hypothesis base

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.340
covers everything. Then the best you can do

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.090
is eliminate about half of them, on average.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.380
&gt;&gt; Well, so, but in particular, if you have

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.860
a question like this, x. That, you now, you ask

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.060
it when there's n possible people. And then, after

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.510
you ask it if the answer is yes, you're

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.650
at l possible people. And otherwise, you're at n

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.820
minus l. Which branch are we going to go down?

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.210
&gt;&gt; Well, we don't know. It could be either one.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.070
&gt;&gt; ha. But do, can we put a probability on it?

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.790
&gt;&gt; Yes if it covers everything. It's about a half

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.230
and a half. You said it was uniform, right? Uniformly chosen?

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.150
&gt;&gt; The, the right answer, the, the target person is uniformly

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.274
chosen. But this question isn't, isn't necessarily of that form, right?

00:02:56.274 --> 00:02:58.794
This, this question could be very skewed, it might only have one thing

00:02:58.794 --> 00:03:01.806
on the left. And n minus 1 on the right like you said.

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:04.010
&gt;&gt; Right, well then I, that's not a very good question to ask.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.520
&gt;&gt; No, that's right. But I wanted, I

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.430
want to be able to distinguish good from bad questions

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.640
by saying we want questions that, that, that are

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.410
going to leave us with the smallest expected size set.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.190
&gt;&gt; Oh, well then since all possibilities are there, the smallest

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.988
the, the best you can hope for is about a half.

00:03:18.988 --> 00:03:21.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and in particular, eh, with this,

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.532
this particular question's going to do, is it's going to have a probability

00:03:24.532 --> 00:03:26.884
of n over l of going down the left branch and getting

00:03:26.884 --> 00:03:29.646
an l. And it's going to have a probability of n minus l

00:03:29.646 --> 00:03:32.636
over n of going down the right branch and getting n minus

00:03:32.636 --> 00:03:35.990
l. And so that could be one way of actually scoring this,

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.684
this quesiton The question that has the best score, as you pointed

00:03:39.684 --> 00:03:42.063
out, is going to be one where l is about the same as

00:03:42.063 --> 00:03:44.991
n minus l, in fact, half would be a really good choice.

00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:46.213
&gt;&gt; Right, I thought that's what

00:03:46.213 --> 00:03:46.550
I said.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:47.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.640
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay, good.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.260
&gt;&gt; But, but I just wanted to write down the formula.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.330
&gt;&gt; Okay, that makes sense, that makes sense. Okay, no,

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.470
it's always good to write down the formula. Okay, so

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.200
you want to pick questions that roughly split things in half.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.910
And if you can do that every single time, then every

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.146
single time, you will split the set in half. So

00:04:03.146 --> 00:04:05.866
you'll start out with n, then n over 2, then n

00:04:05.866 --> 00:04:08.246
over 4, then n over 8, then n over, and

00:04:08.246 --> 00:04:11.399
eventually you'll get to n over n which will give 1.

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:14.151
So you'll only have one, possible answer. And

00:04:14.151 --> 00:04:17.740
so that'll take you a logarithm amount of time.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.329
&gt;&gt; Right, so the number of times you can divide

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.140
a number in half before you get down to one

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.660
is exactly the log base two. So if we start

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.130
with size of h hypothesis, it will take us like log

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.540
base two to whittle it down to a single question.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.370
This is a lot larger. I mean this is a

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.650
nice small number, but it's a lot larger than one,

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.780
right? You know, one, one is really great. This is you

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.410
know, exponentially, no, this is much, much worse than one. But

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.070
but it's still really good. You can, you know, it's not

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.870
considering all the hypothesis. It's very cleverly whittling it down so

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.323
that it only has to look at the log of that.

00:04:48.323 --> 00:04:48.700
&gt;&gt; Right.
