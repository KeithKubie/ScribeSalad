00:00:00.213 --> 00:00:01.536
- [Voiceover] Alright
so in the last video,

00:00:01.536 --> 00:00:04.253
we were taking a look at
this multiple choice question

00:00:04.253 --> 00:00:06.993
from the AP US History
exam practice booklet

00:00:06.993 --> 00:00:10.034
and trying out some strategies
for making good choices

00:00:10.034 --> 00:00:11.753
as you go through these questions.

00:00:11.753 --> 00:00:14.028
Now the first thing we did was really

00:00:14.028 --> 00:00:16.838
dive into the specifics
of what was happening

00:00:16.838 --> 00:00:19.740
in both of these quotes.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.039
Who James Henry Hammond is,

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.198
he's a governor of South Carolina

00:00:24.198 --> 00:00:27.191
who was in favor of slavery

00:00:27.191 --> 00:00:29.605
in the mid-19th century

00:00:29.605 --> 00:00:32.160
who was giving some religious reasons

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.317
and reasons of kindness for why slavery

00:00:35.317 --> 00:00:39.450
was a institution sanctioned
by God and society,

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.144
and Frederick Douglass,
famous abolitionist,

00:00:42.144 --> 00:00:44.744
who's saying that slavery is the great sin

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:46.695
and shame of America.

00:00:46.695 --> 00:00:50.110
So our first step was
analyzing the documents.

00:00:55.444 --> 00:00:57.464
And then our second step was

00:00:57.464 --> 00:01:01.283
to read each of our
questions really carefully.

00:01:01.283 --> 00:01:05.300
And both the questions and
the possible answer choices,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.111
you need to give them your full attention

00:01:07.111 --> 00:01:09.851
because you might skip
over an important word

00:01:09.851 --> 00:01:11.569
that makes the meaning different than what

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:13.543
you thought it was at first glance.

00:01:13.543 --> 00:01:15.191
The third thing we're doing is going

00:01:15.191 --> 00:01:17.558
through each of the options

00:01:17.558 --> 00:01:20.630
and deciding whether
or not it's a possible

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.186
before eliminating it.

00:01:22.186 --> 00:01:25.018
So let's try an example of
a multiple choice question

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:26.620
related to these documents.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.360
The language used in both excerpts

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.914
most directly reflects the influence

00:01:31.914 --> 00:01:33.818
of which of the following?

00:01:33.818 --> 00:01:35.420
So they're specifically asking us

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.417
about the language.

00:01:37.417 --> 00:01:39.530
That means, the words that they're using,

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.970
their phrases.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.431
Not maybe their political positions

00:01:43.431 --> 00:01:47.146
or the ideas that they're
trying to get across,

00:01:47.146 --> 00:01:49.236
but specifically the words.

00:01:49.236 --> 00:01:52.324
And we're looking for the influence

00:01:52.324 --> 00:01:56.387
of one of these four ideologies.

00:01:56.387 --> 00:01:59.336
OK, option A, The Second Great Awakening.

00:01:59.336 --> 00:02:02.238
Hmm, alright, well, I'm gonna say

00:02:02.238 --> 00:02:05.269
that's a religious movement of some kind.

00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:08.033
And they both talk about God

00:02:08.033 --> 00:02:11.399
and the relationship between
slavery and Christianity

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:13.512
so I'm gonna leave that as a possible.

00:02:13.512 --> 00:02:15.207
Alright, what about States' rights?

00:02:15.207 --> 00:02:16.879
Well, I imagine that both these people

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.572
would've had very different
ideas about states' rights,

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:21.592
but I'm not sure that's
what they're talking about

00:02:21.592 --> 00:02:24.489
in these examples cuz
Hammond is talking about

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.249
the duty of slave owners to be kind,

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:30.548
and maybe the religious reasons why

00:02:30.548 --> 00:02:34.727
God has made the institution
of slavery, in his opinion.

00:02:34.727 --> 00:02:38.233
And Douglass is talking
about how slavery is

00:02:38.233 --> 00:02:41.971
against the Bible and
against the idea of liberty,

00:02:41.971 --> 00:02:45.013
so neither of them is
particularly concerned

00:02:45.013 --> 00:02:47.080
with the political issue
of states' rights here.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.727
So I think we can cross that one out.

00:02:49.727 --> 00:02:51.584
Alright, Manifest Destiny.

00:02:51.584 --> 00:02:55.230
Manifest Destiny was this
idea that the United States

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.798
had a divine mission to occupy

00:02:58.798 --> 00:03:02.606
the North American continent
from Atlantic to Pacific.

00:03:02.606 --> 00:03:05.700
While they both kind of talk
about ideas of divinity,

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.356
I don't think they're interested
in any kind of pioneering.

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:15.018
This is more connected
to the American West

00:03:15.018 --> 00:03:18.579
than it is to any idea about slavery.

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.761
So I think we can get rid of that.

00:03:20.761 --> 00:03:23.640
Alright, option D, American nationalism.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.682
Well, I think Douglass is, if anything,

00:03:26.682 --> 00:03:30.095
he's kind of saying
that slavery challenges

00:03:30.095 --> 00:03:31.744
American nationalism.

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:33.323
Well I guess he talks about it then,

00:03:33.323 --> 00:03:36.922
maybe a nationalist view
of the idea of liberty

00:03:36.922 --> 00:03:39.313
would say that slavery
is a sin and a shame.

00:03:39.313 --> 00:03:40.915
So that's possible for Douglass.

00:03:40.915 --> 00:03:42.448
But what about for Hammond?

00:03:42.448 --> 00:03:45.025
He's really making cultural
and religious arguments

00:03:45.025 --> 00:03:47.510
for slavery, not any argument about

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.389
how slavery enhances the American nation.

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.664
So I'm gonna cross that one out too.

00:03:52.664 --> 00:03:54.891
So that leaves us with The
Second Great Awakening.

00:03:54.891 --> 00:03:56.974
And I think that is a good answer because

00:03:56.974 --> 00:03:59.412
both of them are making
religious arguments.

00:03:59.412 --> 00:04:01.571
They're saying that God would have liked,

00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:03.777
or would not have liked, slavery.

00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:08.138
So their language does reflect
an interest in religion.

00:04:10.108 --> 00:04:13.118
We'll do some other
examples in other videos,

00:04:13.118 --> 00:04:15.509
but I think the big takeaway from this is,

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:18.979
don't worry about having every idea

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.569
and every fact about American history

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:23.492
stored away in your brain somewhere.

00:04:23.492 --> 00:04:27.254
Instead, understand that what
this exam is really going for

00:04:27.254 --> 00:04:31.712
is finding out whether you
have a good overall idea

00:04:31.712 --> 00:04:34.637
of what happened in American history,

00:04:34.637 --> 00:04:37.424
and who might have supported which idea.

00:04:37.424 --> 00:04:39.026
And trust your instincts.

00:04:39.026 --> 00:04:40.442
They're usually right.

00:04:40.442 --> 00:04:43.995
The point is not to test
you on some obscure outlier,

00:04:43.995 --> 00:04:46.038
but rather to get a sense that you know

00:04:46.038 --> 00:04:49.010
what you're talking about
in each era of history,

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.725
and the general idea of what was going on.

00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:54.536
So use that to your advantage.

00:04:54.536 --> 00:04:57.996
Understand the big, underlying themes.

00:04:57.996 --> 00:05:01.409
And don't worry about the
little ticky-tack details.

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:02.580
You know what you're doing.
