00:00:01.115 --> 00:00:04.077
- [Voiceover] Maria has
70 pages in her notebook.

00:00:04.077 --> 00:00:06.099
She made a graph of the kinds of writing

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:08.858
on all the pages she has used so far.

00:00:08.858 --> 00:00:12.190
How many pages are left
in Maria's notebook?

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.760
Down here we have a picture
graph, or pictograph,

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.292
showing all the pages Maria's
used so far in her notebook,

00:00:19.292 --> 00:00:23.174
but we're asked how many pages are left

00:00:23.174 --> 00:00:25.400
in Maria's notebook.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.151
To find that out, we need to know how many

00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:31.235
she started with, which
it tells us right here.

00:00:31.235 --> 00:00:34.858
Her notebook started with 70 pages,

00:00:34.858 --> 00:00:38.594
and then if we take away
the ones she's used so far.

00:00:38.594 --> 00:00:42.092
If we take away however
many pages she's used so far

00:00:42.092 --> 00:00:44.906
that will tell us how many

00:00:44.906 --> 00:00:46.989
are left in her notebook.

00:00:48.474 --> 00:00:51.235
The question here is how
many has she used so far?

00:00:51.235 --> 00:00:54.785
We don't know exactly, but
we have this picture graph

00:00:54.785 --> 00:00:57.783
that will help us find that answer.

00:00:57.783 --> 00:01:00.623
Super important on the
picture graph first,

00:01:00.623 --> 00:01:03.546
is right here, it tells
us that each of these

00:01:03.546 --> 00:01:07.713
pieces of paper represents
two pages in Maria's notebook.

00:01:08.807 --> 00:01:12.727
For poems, she wrote on two
pages and another two pages,

00:01:12.727 --> 00:01:15.810
or she wrote on a total of four pages

00:01:16.684 --> 00:01:17.684
about poems.

00:01:18.853 --> 00:01:23.020
She did reports on two,
four, six, eight, ten pages.

00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:27.992
She wrote stories, she
wrote a lot of stories.

00:01:27.992 --> 00:01:30.625
She wrote stories on
two, four, six, eight,

00:01:30.625 --> 00:01:32.958
10, 12, 14 pages of stories.

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:39.865
She wrote letters on two,
four, six, eight pages.

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:42.239
And finally, she journaled on two, four,

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:44.322
six, eight, 10, 12 pages.

00:01:48.648 --> 00:01:53.268
This here, this is the total
pages she's used so far.

00:01:53.268 --> 00:01:55.805
If we combine all of
these, the four for poems,

00:01:55.805 --> 00:01:58.034
the 10 for reports, and so on,

00:01:58.034 --> 00:02:02.522
this will tell us how many
pages she's used so far.

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:05.468
Then we can substitute that in right here,

00:02:05.468 --> 00:02:07.895
and we can say 70 she started with,

00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:09.715
take away what she used so far,

00:02:09.715 --> 00:02:11.371
and we'll get our final solution

00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:14.535
for the pages left in her notebook.

00:02:14.535 --> 00:02:19.173
Let's find this total,
there's four pages for poems,

00:02:19.173 --> 00:02:22.152
plus 10 pages for reports,

00:02:22.152 --> 00:02:23.319
14 on stories,

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.276
eight more pages to write letters,

00:02:26.276 --> 00:02:28.276
and 12 pages to journal.

00:02:29.977 --> 00:02:32.993
If we add these, I'll start with the ones,

00:02:32.993 --> 00:02:35.993
two ones plus eight ones is 10 ones.

00:02:36.894 --> 00:02:39.311
10 ones plus four ones is 14.

00:02:40.481 --> 00:02:43.625
Plus zero more is still 14 ones.

00:02:43.625 --> 00:02:45.792
Plus four more is 18 ones.

00:02:47.214 --> 00:02:49.716
Plus, now let's add our 10s.

00:02:49.716 --> 00:02:53.133
One 10 plus another 10 is two 10s, or 20.

00:02:54.245 --> 00:02:57.315
Plus one more 10 is three 10s, or 30.

00:02:57.315 --> 00:03:00.131
She's 18 ones plus three 10s,

00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:01.842
so 18 plus 30 pages,

00:03:01.842 --> 00:03:04.259
which is a total of 48 pages.

00:03:06.332 --> 00:03:08.582
She's used 48 pages so far.

00:03:10.547 --> 00:03:13.802
If we take those 48 away from 70,

00:03:13.802 --> 00:03:17.389
we'll know how many pages are left.

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:18.346
One way we could do this,

00:03:18.346 --> 00:03:20.667
is we can think of it as counting up.

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:23.995
We can say there's 48 pages
used, let's count up to 70

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:27.606
to see how many more pages
there still are in the notebook.

00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:31.890
If we count up from 48 to 50,
that's two more pages she has,

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.057
and then from 50 to 70 is 20,
that's 20 more pages she has,

00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:38.717
so she has a total of

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:42.511
22 more pages left in her notebook.
