00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.760
At the Olympic
games, many events

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.790
have several rounds
of competition.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.750
One of these is the men's
100 meter backstroke.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.710
The upper dot plot
shows the times

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.620
in seconds of the
top 8 finishers

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.980
in the semifinal round
at the 2012 Olympics.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.750
The lower dot plot shows the
times of the same 8 swimmers,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.230
but in the final round.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.980
Which pieces of
information can be

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.430
gathered from these dot plots?

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.450
In the semifinal round, we
see that these are the 8 times

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.360
of the 8 swimmers.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.340
We see 3 swimmers finished
in exactly 53.5 seconds.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.480
One swimmer finished in
53.7 seconds right here.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.740
And one swimmer right over
here finished in 52.7 seconds.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.610
And we can think about similar
things for each of these dots.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.840
Now, in the final
round, one swimmer

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.730
here went much,
much, much faster.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.170
So this is in 52.2 seconds.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.010
While this swimmer right
over here went slower.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.150
We don't know which
dot he was up here.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.730
But regardless of which
dot he was up here,

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.740
this dot took more time
than all of these dots.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.490
So his time
definitely got worse.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.390
And this is at 53.8 seconds.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.930
So let's look at the statements
and see which of these apply.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.720
The swimmers had faster times,
on average, in the finals.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.490
Is this true?

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.520
Faster times on
average in the finals?

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.700
So if we look at the
finals right over here,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.780
we could take each
of these times,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.760
add them up, and then divide by
8, the number of times we have.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.330
But let's see if we can get an
intuition for where this is,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.220
because we're really
just comparing these two

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.940
plots, or these two
distributions, we could say.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.350
And so let's see, if all
the data was these three

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.200
points and these
three points, we

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.840
could intuit that the mean
would be right around there.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.040
It would be around 53.2 or 53.3
seconds, right around there.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.394
And then we have this
point and this point,

00:02:00.394 --> 00:02:02.060
if you just found the
mean of that point

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.190
and that point, so
halfway between that point

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.290
and that point, would get
you right around there.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.889
So the mean of those two
points would bring down

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.440
the mean a little bit.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.080
And once again, I'm not
figuring out the exact number.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.830
But maybe it would be around
53.2, 53.1, or 53.2 seconds.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.540
So that's my intuition for
the mean of the final round.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.560
And now let's think about the
mean of the semifinal round.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.286
Let's just look at
these bottom five dots.

00:02:31.286 --> 00:02:32.660
If you find their
mean, you could

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.750
intuit it would be maybe
someplace around here,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.157
pretty close to
around 53.3 seconds.

00:02:41.157 --> 00:02:42.740
And then you have
all these other ones

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.100
that are at 53.5
and 53.3, which will

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.010
bring the mean even higher.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.660
So I think it's fair to say that
the mean in the final around

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.170
and the time is less
than the mean up here.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.670
And you could
calculate it yourself,

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.260
but I'm just trying to
look at the distributions

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.600
and get an intuition here.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.810
And at least in this case,
it looks pretty clear

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.930
that the swimmers had
faster times, on average,

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.610
in the finals.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.740
It took them less time.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.524
One of the swimmers was
disqualified from the finals.

00:03:07.524 --> 00:03:08.440
Well, that's not true.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.420
We have 8 swimmers in
the semifinal round.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.240
And we have 8 swimmers
in the final round.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.930
So that one's not true.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.490
The times in the
finals vary noticeably

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.250
more than the times
in the semifinals.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.880
That does look to be true.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.100
We see in the semifinals,
a lot of the times

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.530
were clumped up
right around here

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.600
at 53.3 seconds
and 53.5 seconds.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.660
The high time isn't
as high as this time.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.460
The low time isn't as low there.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.260
So the final round
is definitely--

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.760
they vary noticeably more.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.087
Individually, the swimmers
all swam faster in the finals

00:03:43.087 --> 00:03:44.420
than they did in the semifinals.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.730
Well, that's not true.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.530
Whoever this was, clearly they
were one of these data points

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.030
up here.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.860
This data point took more time
than all of these data points.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.820
So this represents someone who
took more time in the finals

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.102
than they did in the semifinals.

00:03:57.102 --> 00:03:59.540
And we got it right.
