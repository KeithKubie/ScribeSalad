GRACE TEO: I will say
that one of the things

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.460
that I used be pretty insecure
about as an educator-- to put

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.050
this in context,
I just graduated

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.710
with my Ph.D. over the summer.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.040
And after spending five years
working on one niche problem,

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.450
you're like, all
right, well I don't

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.010
have a lot of usable
skills, I just

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.660
have a lot of knowledge
about this one tiny problem.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.140
What can I possibly teach?

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.830
And so I used to think
about that a lot.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.600
But something this
class showed me

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.465
was that actually just the
ability to be entrepreneurial,

00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:48.890
the ability to be adaptable,
the ability to be a facilitator,

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.790
a communicator, mediator
between people-- which I think

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.150
were all huge parts
of this class--

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.510
was the most important thing
in being an educator here.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.150
So it wasn't so much about
knowledge of subject material,

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.760
or knowledge of a specific
skill, but just the ability

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.700
to facilitate learning, which
a lot of times just comes

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.780
down to knowing how to ask
the right questions of what

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.410
is needed at this moment to help
my student learn and succeed,

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.610
and being able to
answer their questions.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.320
So I didn't need to
know the knowledge.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.750
I didn't need to
have the skills.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.384
But I just needed to
know where to find

00:01:35.384 --> 00:01:37.300
that knowledge and skills
and be able to bring

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.845
my student to that place.

00:01:43.084 --> 00:01:44.000
WILLIAM LI: Yeah, wow.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.070
So I think this is a
challenging question to answer,

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.190
what I learned in terms of
teaching or being an educator.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.280
One thing I'd say-- so I'm
currently a Ph.D. Student.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.480
And so this semester, as
a graduate instructor.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.510
It was a little bit
unexpected certainly,

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:26.210
to be involved in teaching
the course this semester.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:33.510
And to try to carry on and
extend the work that Seth

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.820
Teller had done in this
class was to me, personally

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.420
a very monumental undertaking.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.380
Seth was my master's
thesis adviser,

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.600
and I worked on assistive
technology with him

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.070
and saw him teach the
class the first time,

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.780
and gone to some of the classes
and helped out a little bit

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.340
in the last two years
or three years as well.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.350
So to suddenly be
a co-instructor

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.380
of the class with Grace
was a sudden, almost kind

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.070
of jarring experience.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.870
A baptism of fire, perhaps.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.590
So maybe there's
three things to say.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.570
One is, it was
immensely challenging.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.140
It is different from doing
research, which is mostly what

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.580
I'm doing as a Ph.D. student.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.760
Even working on projects
with different people,

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.010
you sort of have this
one level removed,

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.560
where suddenly-- as
Grace was talking

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.350
about-- working with students,
and trying to encourage them

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.640
in certain directions.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.580
And there's certainly
some uncertainty

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.190
associated with that.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.070
Or whether they will take
your advice, I guess,

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.520
or whether you should nudge
them further in this direction.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.890
Or sometimes they surprise you.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.590
Very often, frankly,
they surprise you.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.160
Very pleasantly,
in terms of what

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.560
they're able to accomplish
over the semester.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.870
So how to inspire
or mentor students

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:33.535
is really something that I
learned over the semester.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.910
I think a part of this is
that it was pretty emotional.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.420
Maybe that's the right word.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.615
In terms of the
history of this class,

00:04:50.615 --> 00:04:53.460
the very personal nature of it.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.270
I think we got to know
our 35 students very

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:04.040
well over the semester,
and certainly the clients

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.390
as well, the 11 clients
that we worked with.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:14.200
And so you really
experience the ups and downs

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.070
with the students over the
course of the projects.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.690
And that's
challenging sometimes,

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.810
or interesting to experience.

00:05:29.344 --> 00:05:30.760
I think the third
thing I'd say is

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.750
that it was, in the end, very
rewarding, to see the results,

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:43.480
and see students excited
about what they had done.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:50.550
To be able to work with a
really great team of people all

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.720
passionate about the course.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.090
So co-instructors,
and our teaching

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.410
and lab assistants who had taken
the class before and really

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:07.100
wanted to make this a positive
experience for students.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.446
I think in a lot of senses,
this is pretty unprecedented.

00:06:10.446 --> 00:06:12.070
I don't know if I
will ever do anything

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:17.510
like this again for
a fairly long time,

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.215
I guess in terms of
the meaningfulness

00:06:21.215 --> 00:06:28.720
and the challenge and
the personal side of it.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.930
I might be waxing poetic.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.890
But I think it was really
exciting to be able to put

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.530
something like this together.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.150
And for that matter, I
think it's one reason

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.960
to try to share our
full experience really.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.570
The things that worked, and
things that maybe didn't work

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.530
as well on something like OCW.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.540
Warts and all, I suppose,
in terms of what we tried,

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.580
and what was successful,
and what guidelines we

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.560
might have to other educators.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.770
So I think really the
focus of our class,

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.560
or if we've delivered a
good class this semester

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.150
and provided a good learning
experience for our students,

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.870
and our students have learned
and taken away something

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.840
from Principles and Practice
of Assistive Technology

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.700
this semester, then I think
that's what we set out to do.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:29.200
If we can inspire educators
and students elsewhere,

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.290
who might be interested
in assistive technology,

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:37.120
or working in this space, if we
can kind of let 1,000 flowers

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.050
bloom when it comes to
assistive technology or the work

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.570
that we're doing,
then maybe we've

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.571
done our job this semester.
