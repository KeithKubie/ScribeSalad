&gt;&gt; So the question is can India become a superpower?
I think India, you know, already is a very

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.769
strong economic power and
will continue to get stronger and also a political

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.050
power.
The reason I feel is um, one is India has

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.880
a big economy and a big
population base.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.869
But more importantly is the the democracy
here which releases a lot of

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:31.179
energy and also potential from its people.
So when the potential is released, and effectively

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:37.270
[INAUDIBLE] that, you know, the power will
the directed to a very positive and [INAUDIBLE].
