00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer is if we just optimize this one over here, we get the original path,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and the reason is obvious. It's already zero for the original setting.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Further minimization doesn't make it any smaller. It's a quadratic error.

00:00:11.000 --> 09:59:59.000
The minimization has no effect. We just get the original path.
