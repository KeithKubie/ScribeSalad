00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
So now that we have an overview of the

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.130
business model canvas in customer development,

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.510
there's some optional reading for the next lecture.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.320
Take a look at business model generation,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.330
pages 86 through 111

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.110
and pages 135-145.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.070
In the Startup Owner's Manual,

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.780
take a look at pages 51 to 84 about market size,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.460
and then take a look at pages 188 to 199

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.950
and pages 457 to 459.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.740
Also take a look at the links below

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.980
and 4 additional readings that don't require any of the textbooks.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.250
So that's the reading,

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.600
but what you should really be doing

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.070
if you want to build a startup

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.480
before the next lecture.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.250
Well, what we want you to do is start working on

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.310
identifying your market size

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.670
of total available market

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.640
and what's your target market?

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.510
and then we want you to think about

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.860
what kind of a experiments would you want to use

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.440
to test your value proposition,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.580
customer segment, channel and revenue model?

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.280
How would you go on about doing this?

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.440
Not just talking to people,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.710
but what would you ask them, and what would be a pass/fail signal

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.440
for each test?

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.690
Some examples for the next class

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.640
are available on the link below.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.230
The other thing you need to be doing

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.280
or the most important thing you need to be doing in between lectures

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.240
is talking to customers,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.040
and if you're not talking to at least 10 potential customers

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.990
between these lectures,

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.240
you're really not gonna have enough mass,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.670
enough to actually get some insights.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.920
You can say, "Well, I've talked to 3,"

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.090
but you know,

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.380
there's no magic number, but it just turns out

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.130
that you want a data set large enough

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.720
that you can actually get not only the mainstream thought,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.610
but some of the out lyers, or some of the interesting answers are.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.700
So the other thing is after you talk to customers,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.350
you want to every week, update your business model canvas

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.570
with what you've learned.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.180
Which hypotheses were wrong and which were right?

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.030
And optionally, if you're using the LaunchPad Central software,

00:01:52.030 --> 99:59:59.000
post your first discovery narratives.
