00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.440
DON DODGE: We have a great panel
today to help us answer

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.800
some of these questions.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.470
First, Jessica Livingston.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.240
Jessica started in investment
banking and then was a

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.890
co-founder of Y Combinator,
and has written a book--

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.030
several books, I think-- but the
one that I read, "Founders

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:27.450
at Work." And Paul Graham, the
other founder of Y Combinator,

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.250
made one of the best decisions
in his life when he proposed

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.210
to marry Jessica.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.360
So they're husband and wife.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.500
Next to Jessica,
Naval Ravikant.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.170
Naval is the founder
of Angel List.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.500
I'm sure you all know
about Angel List.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.780
But he's also an entrepreneur
before that.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.120
He co-founded several companies
before that--

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.690
Genoa, Epinions.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.740
You probably have heard
of Epinions.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:01.680
And he's also a co-author
of "Venture Hacks."

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.240
And next to Naval, Heidi Roizen,
a longtime friend.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.780
Heidi is also an entrepreneur
and founder.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.320
She co-founded T/Maker
back in the PC era.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.800
And she was a venture capitalist
at SoftBank, one of

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.710
the hottest venture capital
firms at the time, and is now

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.650
at Draper Fisher Jurvetson,
and she's also

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.380
a lecturer at Stanford.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.210
So very accomplished panel.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.470
So the way we run this, this
session is for you.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.560
So there are two mics here, and
we want you to come up and

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.940
ask questions throughout.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.600
So I'm going to start with
some questions to get it

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.980
going, but at any point, come up
to the mic, I'll recognize

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.500
you, and you can ask
your question.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.460
Typically, over half
of this session is

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.120
questions from the audience.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.680
So start thinking about your
questions, line up at the mic,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.750
and we'll get as
many as we can.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.220
I'll start with a few
questions here.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.050
So Jessica, Y Combinator, it's
the first and largest

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.630
incubator ever.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.110
How many companies apply to Y
Combinator now, and how many

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.360
do you accept?

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.400
JESSICA LIVINGSTON:
Can you hear me?

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.030
Lately, like the last
application process we had for

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.460
the summer batch, I think we got
about 2,500 applications,

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.180
and this summer's batch
is 52 startups.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.040
DON DODGE: 52 out of 2,500.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.140
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: Out
of 2,500, yeah.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.250
DON DODGE: So that's like 2%.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.660
JESSICA LIVINGSTON:
It's pretty low.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.710
DON DODGE: Cool.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.870
That's harder than Harvard
to get into Y Combinator.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.370
Probably better, too.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.200
How do you decide which
companies to accept?

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.830
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: Well we have
10-minute interviews, so

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.380
it's a big challenge to
choose the startups.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.080
And for those of you who don't
know, we conduct the

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.610
interviews back to back all day
long, and then we contact

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.150
the founders that night to say
whether we'd like to fund them

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.850
or not, so they find
out that very day.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.560
So in the 10 minutes,
what do we do?

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.610
We have three different tracks
of Y Combinator partners doing

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.360
the interviews.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.560
So I'm in a room with Paul and
Robert and Trevor, the

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.360
original founders, and they're
all technical.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.070
I'm not technical.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.490
And so I let them evaluate the
technology and evaluate

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.830
whether the founders are good at
programming, which is very

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:47.580
hard to tell.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.580
But you can sometimes base it
on what they've built if

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.970
they've built something already,
or if they, in their

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.690
application, have built
something in the past, we take

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.710
a long look at that in the
application process.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.440
What I am looking at
specifically in interviews, I

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.460
sort of block out all the other
stuff and I'm looking at

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:12.130
the co-founder dynamic and the
personalities of the founders.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.390
Have they thought deeply about
what their startup idea, the

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.110
area that it's in?

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.550
Do they seem excited about
it, believe it or not?

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.370
Do they get along?

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.680
Are they interrupting
each other?

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.440
That's a bad sign.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.460
Different things like that.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.110
It's sort of hard to describe.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.180
And then literally after the
10 minutes, the four of us

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.430
say, OK, should we
fund them or not?

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.450
And sometimes it's very clear
and we all say absolutely

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.910
because we're excited about
the idea and the people.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.520
Sometimes we have to talk about
it for a few minutes,

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.510
but it's never more than
a few minutes.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.940
DON DODGE: So in 10 minutes, you
can decide whether this is

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.710
a company you're going
to invest in or not.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:52.070
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: Yeah.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.550
It seems pretty crazy, and
sometimes we're wrong.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.880
But when we first started Y
Combinator in 2005, we had

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.050
half an hour interviews.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.850
Of course, we were only
interviewing 25 startups at

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:05.530
that point.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.120
But we realized that we really
did have a sense after the

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.040
first few minutes and a lot
of the time was wasted.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.280
So we make it 10 minutes so we
can talk to more groups.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.000
DON DODGE: Cool.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.410
So Heidi, you're in the venture
capital business and

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.190
you fund companies.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.060
How do you decide who to fund
and who not to fund?

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.440
HEIDI ROIZEN: Well, a lot of the
work gets done before we

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.000
ever meet face to face because
I think for every venture

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.780
capital firm, there are areas
that we are knowledgeable in

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.220
and there are areas we're
not knowledgeable in.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.240
It doesn't make a lot of sense
for us to try to make an

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.640
investment in an area that we
don't know anything about.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.330
I think that's pretty true
of most venture firms.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.020
They'll pick practice areas that
they're interested in.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.570
We look at a lot of deals
that come in.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.470
We get together every Monday,
the partners, and we discuss

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.450
things that we've seen or things
we've heard about.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.370
Obviously, we're batting things
around on email a lot.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.480
If you think about when we're
in a partner meeting,

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.150
collectively among us, we sit
on close to 100 boards, so

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.580
it's a very interesting group
of people because we're in

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.810
there with about 100 company
data points in real time in

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.480
our heads, presuming we're
paying attention to the

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.990
companies we're actually already
invested in, which

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.550
isn't always true of all VCs.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.890
But we have a lot
of data points.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.720
And so part of looking at
funding-- and by the way, I

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.510
was an entrepreneur.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.230
I spent six months on the road
my first time out trying to

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.700
raise money.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.300
No one would fund us.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.900
We self-funded, we
bootstrappped, and we funded

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.780
in my very most favorite way to
be funded way, which is not

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.070
represented by any of us up
here, which is we actually got

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.890
customers to buy our product.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.300
It's this really cool way to
get funding because it's

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.610
non-dilutive and you learn
something and it validates

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:52.710
your business proposition.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.540
So it's cool at many levels,
and that's how we did it.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.990
And so we only raised our first
round six years after we

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.710
started the company, and we were
already about $4 million

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.630
in revenue and profitable when
we did, which really changes

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.170
your dynamics in terms of what
you can negotiate with.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:14.300
So I give you all that to say,
I've been on your side of the

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.560
table, and I've been on
my side of the table.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.920
I've been on both sides the
table and it is a relatively

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.890
random process.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.280
So if you're sitting there
thinking, this sounds

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.440
ridiculous.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.320
How could you possibly make a
decision in 10 minutes, which

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.210
I completely agree.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:29.990
We do the same thing.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.830
How could you read a one pager
and know whether you're going

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.150
to invest or not?

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:33.620
I don't know.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.900
It's a pretty crazy system,
but that's how the vast

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.860
majority of the venture
capitalists I know do it.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.500
It's a lot about gut and feel
and pattern recognition and

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.510
pattern and sensing something
about the team and the mission

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.610
they're on, and it's very hard
to articulate, which is why

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:53.960
also venture is very much a
small team, a business.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:59.130
It's also why you'll take 50
meetings and you'll get 50

00:07:59.130 --> 00:07:59.910
different answers.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:03.150
And when you ask VCs for
feedback, you'll get

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:07.460
diametrically opposed views,
and that doesn't matter.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.310
You just go out and kiss
a bunch of frogs, and

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:11.960
eventually, you will
find one, I think.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.160
If you believe in your idea and
you've got a good idea,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:14.620
you will find one.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.070
But it is a lengthy process
and don't think that the

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.490
people on the other side of the
table from you have some

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:20.690
magic thing.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:21.930
And I'll just close
by saying this.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:26.800
I know some VCs who've tried
over time to quantify this.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.710
In fact, I know this big
initiative going on that one

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.440
person's doing who's super smart
and is trying to do this

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.330
thing about, if you have these
degrees from these places and

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.850
you worked at these places, and
in fact, if you dropped

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.110
out before you finish-- because
that's the current

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.510
lore is it's better to drop out
from Harvard or Stanford

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.940
than it is to actually finish
in any one of those places.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:50.230
So he's actually trying to do
this analysis and say, can I

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.380
figure out which ones
are going to be the

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.900
best based on analysis?

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.230
And just so far, every
one of those

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.090
initiatives has largely failed.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:01.050
So it really is all about
reading, being able to get

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.000
your point across well enough
that you intrigue someone

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.920
enough to take that
first meeting.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.720
It's not about getting all the
way to the finish line.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.870
It's about intriguing us enough
so we'll take the

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.080
meeting, and then it's about
knowing how to make that 10

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.330
minutes really count.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:14.780
DON DODGE: Right.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.270
We have questions
in the audience.

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:17.150
Let's start here.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:17.300
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.640
It's a great panel.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.410
I was recently at a meeting of
VCs where I met somebody who

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:29.030
sort of criticized the idea of
all these different startup

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.900
incubators coming up.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.940
He though, well, they're forced
into a three-month

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.870
program, and at the end of the
time, they have to show that

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:41.230
they're on a hockey stick sort
of curve in terms of the

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:44.670
revenue, and if they don't
do it, then that's it.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:45.590
You don't really get anywhere.

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:50.470
So his criticism was that
these incubators force

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:54.040
businesses to sort of develop
a certain way, and he didn't

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.230
think that was good.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.980
So I was wondering what your
thoughts are on the whole idea

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.450
of all these different
incubators

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:02.304
coming up in general.

00:10:02.304 --> 00:10:04.420
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: I assume
that's for me.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.440
Well, when we started Y
Combinator, I can promise you

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.170
we did not expect there
to be so many people

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.990
doing what we do.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.950
So I don't know.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:16.630
I don't really have a comment
on if it's good or bad.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:22.690
But in terms of our startups,
over this three month period,

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:25.030
we're working very closely with
them to help prepare them

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.580
for Demo Day, which is when
there's a room filled with

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:32.020
investors, 400 investors, to
come and see their two and a

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:32.910
half minute pitches.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:36.340
And again, the goal is to just
create an interest and

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.630
hopefully get a meeting.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.890
And we think that that's a great
idea because it's such

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.940
an efficient way for investors
to spend a couple hours of

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.810
their time and see 40 or
50 companies at once.

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:52.110
It's great if there's a
hockey stick curve.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.310
It's great if after three
months, you have this major

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.890
growth rate because investors
love that.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.700
But it's certainly not true
for everyone, and it's

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.390
certainly not true that every
single startup raises tons of

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.500
money right after Demo Day.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.185
Some of them raise Series A,
some of them raise a few

00:11:09.185 --> 00:11:11.450
hundred thousand dollars and
get back to working on the

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:15.480
product, and then six months
to a year later, we'll help

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:20.190
them go out and they'll
raise funding then.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.290
AUDIENCE: So do you think having
all these incubators is

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.100
a good thing?

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.610
NAVAL RAVIKANT: So the
accelerators are there--

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:28.818
I actually don't like calling
them incubators, so I'm just

00:11:28.818 --> 00:11:30.380
going to switch the terminology
if someone doesn't

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.040
mind, because they're not really
incubating little eggs

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.950
and hatching them.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.750
I just find that's like a
demeaning nomenclature.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.300
The accelerators serve three
incredibly important

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.350
functions, just like schools
do, just like MIT does or

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.910
Harvard does.

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:43.770
One is they filter.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.692
So they help go through all the
noise and say, these are

00:11:45.692 --> 00:11:47.590
the people worth looking at
before they might have a

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:49.500
product or before they
might have traction.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.460
So that 10 minute interview
that Jessica and Paul and

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.190
Robert and Trevor do, people pay
enormous amounts of money

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.420
for the output from those 10
minute interviews, so that's

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:58.870
very important function.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:00.670
The second thing that the
accelerators do is they do the

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:01.590
education function.

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:03.440
Part of that might be, look,
here's how you raise money.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.825
That's kind of an obvious
question people

00:12:04.825 --> 00:12:05.880
are going to ask.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.860
And the third thing they do is
they build an incredible

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.210
alumni network that pulls
resources, educates the

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.540
entrepreneurs, unionizes their
power a little bit, and

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.600
standardizes the things that
they might have had to do one

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.870
off or ad hoc.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:19.730
So these are very valuable
functions, and without the

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:20.890
accelerators today,
I don't think the

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:21.620
angels could function.

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.300
There would be too may deals out
there to look at, and they

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.990
wouldn't know what to look
at and what not to.

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:26.470
And without the angels out
there, I don't think the VCs

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:27.370
could function.

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:30.165
The VCs are using the angels
for signals, and the angels

00:12:30.165 --> 00:12:32.110
are using the accelerators
for signals.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.410
So like it or not, they're a
part of the ecosystem that's

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:35.440
here to stay.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.880
But just like there are lots of
angels and there are good

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.000
ones and bad ones, and just like
there are lots of VCs and

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.690
there are successful ones and
failed ones, there are lots of

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:44.100
accelerators, and there's the
cream of the crop, and there's

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.560
the not so good.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.700
So they're an important part of
infrastructure that's not

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.820
going away.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.570
I would say that today, probably
half of the companies

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:55.320
that we feature on Angel List
have come through some

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.100
accelerator or another, and we
count that signal in as to

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.310
which accelerator they came
from and who they got

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:04.870
associated from that accelerator
and what kind of

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.240
financing they did afterwards
as an input signal.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.360
Everyone in this business is
looking at tons of noise and

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.840
trying to extract signals.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.450
And it is through that
pattern matching.

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:16.230
And to the point earlier, you
cannot systematize that.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:19.060
You can't automate it.

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.720
Think about the combinatorics
of human DNA.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.750
There's six billion, seven
billion people on this planet.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.300
No two are even vaguely
similar if

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.350
you get to know them.

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:28.760
And companies at this stage
are just combinations of

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.090
individuals, so they're
even more unique.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:33.670
So you need all these human
filters who are constantly

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:36.930
quickly assessing everyone to
figure out who gets to make it

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:37.960
to the next stage.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.270
Like it or not, that's
the way it works.

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:40.630
HEIDI ROIZEN: I want to add one
thing because I've heard

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.060
that same thing.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:45.710
If you tell people that they
have to solve a problem with

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:48.450
three months and $50,000, you're
only going to solve

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.760
easy problems, is
the complaint.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:56.080
And number one, I'm a huge fan
of accelerators and of angel

00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:00.280
financing because I think
that they do fill--

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.460
yes, there are problems you can
actually solve in three

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.080
months with $50,000, but there
are also problems you can kind

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.850
of take your first whack at it
with three months and $50,000

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:12.460
and show progression, even if
it's not user metrics because

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.380
you don't get there.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:14.920
At the other end of the
spectrum, there are things,

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.120
like I know Singularity is
trying to mount something

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.870
where they're trying to solve
really big problems.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.180
They're trying to stake out the
area where they say, we're

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.290
actually going to be the
accelerator that solves really

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.300
big problems that take
a long time.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.670
The problem with really big
problems that take a long time

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:32.330
is the funding mechanisms of
both, I think accelerators and

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:37.250
angel investors, they're not
life cycle financing for

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:39.520
really big problems, which is
why you have a whole food

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:44.000
chain of people, including
venture capitalists, all the

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.880
way up through investment
bankers and ultimately the

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.550
public markets-- which there
are periods of time where

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:54.250
public markets actually allow
non-profitable companies to go

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:56.030
public, which is another
way of getting funding.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.100
So I think there's that whole
food chain there.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.980
I think you have to know--

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:02.640
and this is a really important
thing for everybody, not just

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.910
for accelerator or angels
or whatever--

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:08.800
you have to know what you're
trying to do and what kind of

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.630
financing is appropriate for
you, because you can bang your

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:13.810
head against the wall all day
going to people who are just

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.700
the wrong people to fund you.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.920
And people often will take
meetings, especially if you've

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.650
got something interesting,
because they like to get

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:22.450
educated, and you do not want
to spend all your time

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.440
educating the population.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.920
So it's important to
understand that.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:30.120
I do want to say there's
a really great book.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:34.620
It is about venture financing,
but it also covers the other

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.100
areas, by these two guys, Brad
Feld and Jason Mendelson, who

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.960
are partners at Foundry Group,
and it's called "Venture

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.760
Deals, How to be Smarter Than
Your Venture Capitalist," or

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.340
something like that.

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:46.310
And actually, it does a really
nice job laying out the

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:50.320
landscape of financing and how
financing works, which I think

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.050
is super critical.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.830
If you're going to take money
from anyone, you should know

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.680
what the whole end to
end life cycle looks

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.343
like for outside capital.

00:15:57.343 --> 00:15:58.030
DON DODGE: OK, great.

00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:59.860
We have to on to the
next question.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.010
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:01.780
My name's Jake.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.660
I'm from Fargo, North Dakota.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.405
Fargo's a lot different
than California.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.830
HEIDI ROIZEN: I was on the board
at Great Plains for five

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.570
years, so I've been to Fargo
many, many times.

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:14.600
AUDIENCE: And you know
Doug then, I suppose.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.150
So we only have one venture
capitalist group in all of

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.970
North Dakota that I know of, I
believe, and they're in Fargo.

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:22.150
When I was 20, I started
a company doing mobile

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:23.800
development, all the
way through 23

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.270
now, still doing that.

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:28.460
But we did it one of those
unique ways where we didn't

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.340
raise money, we just built a
company that sold stuff and

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.140
made money.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.480
And one of the things I did
realize, though, is I always

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.590
thought venture capital is a bad
idea, this is a bad idea.

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:39.460
But I realized that there are
problems that we'd like to

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:42.720
solve that are bigger than what
we have for resources.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.450
And so in Fargo, those guys are
doing some of that, but

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:50.010
how do we inspire the idea
of venture capitalism--

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.260
there's some angel,
but it's totally

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:52.880
different than out here.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.560
How do we bring that to Fargo?

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.800
And if not that right now, how
can people who are where we're

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:02.900
at work with you guys to
build something great?

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.560
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Well first,
you've got to make a lot of

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.430
money, get rich and then spend
it in North Dakota.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:08.460
AUDIENCE: Working on it.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:11.060
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Or you need to
make so much money that your

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:13.500
neighbors get jealous and then
want to invest in startups.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.430
That's kind of how it works.

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:16.430
So if you look at Estonia,
it's a small country that

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:20.500
punches outside of its weight
in the startup industry

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.260
because they had Skype there
nearby, and so they have a lot

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.109
of ex-Skype people who are
investing into the ecosystem,

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:28.830
and they have accelerators, and
they have angel financing,

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:29.710
and they have venture
financing.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:31.450
All of a sudden, you have all
these cool companies coming

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:34.290
out of this tiny little country
in the Baltics.

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:37.430
So I think it's just success
begets success.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.820
The world is flattening
a little bit.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:43.020
It's not flattening as much or
as quickly as we would like.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:46.010
Angel List, we can be helpful,
but frankly, the bar is higher

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:48.080
if you're outside of Silicon
Valley or New York.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.790
You've got to show a
lot more traction.

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:51.760
It's a rare venture capitalist
who's going to get on a plane

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.210
to fly to North Dakota.

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:54.900
I always though capital
was liquid--

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.680
AUDIENCE: If he was smart,
he would go there.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.880
NAVAL RAVIKANT: By the way,
North Dakota is having its own

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.680
venture capital boom, it's just
around energy and shale.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.020
But I always thought capital
was very liquid.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.300
It turned out capital is liquid,
capitalists are not.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.140
So capitalists don't like
to get on planes, and

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:09.730
they don't have to.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:11.150
They're rich by definition.

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:12.980
So you've got to get on a plane,
you've got to come

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.060
here, you've got to open a
satellite office, you've got

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.120
to network a little bit.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.030
You've got to use every resource
at your disposal

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.890
including Angel List, including
YC, including

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:21.460
whatever you can get to.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:25.020
And I would say 10 years ago, it
was nearly impossible, with

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.290
the occasional exception,
to raise money

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:28.790
outside of Silicon Valley.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:29.670
That's changing.

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:32.360
So now it's probably about
half the activity is in

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.080
Silicon Valley and maybe
half is spread out over

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.400
the rest of the world.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.350
So that's a lot better than it
used to be, and that's thanks

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:40.100
to the internet, that great
equalizer that brings us all

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.500
here today.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:41.955
DON DODGE: Great.

00:18:41.955 --> 00:18:42.410
Thank you.

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.230
Next question.

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:45.020
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.440
My name's Billy and I have
a question of all of you,

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.570
especially for Jessica.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:53.330
I watched videos of you in Y
Combinator last year where you

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:58.750
talked about the Pokemon monster
for the startups.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.100
DON DODGE: Pokemon--

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:00.985
AUDIENCE: The monster
for the startup.

00:19:00.985 --> 00:19:01.830
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: Do
you mean my talk

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:04.000
on what goes wrong?

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:04.740
AUDIENCE: No.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.950
You talked about all the
challenges for the startups in

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:08.910
the YC class last year.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.950
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: Yeah,
[? Mino ?] monsters?

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:15.200
AUDIENCE: It doesn't matter.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:23.140
So my question is for you, one
of the challenges for all the

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:27.680
people who want to start up here
is a lot of us are on H1B

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.950
visa, and I know a lot
of talented people.

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:34.030
They are very highly
motivated.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:36.720
But because of the constraints
of the startup visa, they

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.320
cannot go out and start
their own company.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:44.170
So I want to know, how does
the startup community in

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:46.890
Silicon Valley deal with
this, and how much the

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:48.570
progress are we making?

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.870
And if we cannot make any
progress in the short term, do

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:58.380
you have any advice for anyone
on H1B visa but want to go out

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.270
and start their own company?

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:00.370
So

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:01.900
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: Just so I
make sure I understand your

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.580
question, it has to do with
immigration rules and how hard

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.850
it is to come here and
start a startup?

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:11.920
I know a lot of people care very
much about this topic.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.670
AUDIENCE: And how do we
make progress on this?

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:16.950
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: People,
I promise you-- not me

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:19.510
particularly, even though I
worry about it a lot because a

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:23.070
lot of the people we fund are
from other countries--

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:26.770
but I know that a lot of heavy
hitters in Silicon Valley are

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:30.920
spending a lot of time trying to
make changes with the visas

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.860
and that sort of thing.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:36.650
What I've noticed from the
people we funded, they can

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:41.110
come to Y Combinator for three
months, but it's very

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:43.800
difficult because they'll have
to fly back right before Demo

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.770
Day and they might not get back
into the country, and I

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:47.740
know it's very difficult and
challenging for them.

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:48.890
AUDIENCE: I'm talking about the
people who are in Silicon

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:52.150
Valley or residing
in the US here.

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:53.300
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: OK, I'm--

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.460
AUDIENCE: Still on the H1B,
because of the H1B visa

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:56.720
constraints, they cannot
go out there and

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.790
start their own company.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:58.440
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: They can't
start a startup because

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.565
you're on an H1B?

00:20:59.565 --> 00:21:00.400
AUDIENCE: Yes, exactly.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.560
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: Maybe try
to get a different visa?

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.950
An O1?

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:06.150
DON DODGE: There are other
ways to do it.

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:06.760
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: There
are other ways.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.940
I mean honestly, I'm probably
not the best person to give

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:09.630
advice on that.

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:12.510
I would talk to either other
people who have started

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:16.130
startups and have gotten
different visas or an

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:17.640
immigration lawyer.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.660
DON DODGE: So Steve Case,
the founder of AOL,

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:20.840
is working on this.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.050
Ron Conway is working on it.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:24.670
Google is working on it.

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:27.270
We're trying really hard to
solve this problem, but it's

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:28.120
not an easy one.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.310
It's going to take
a little time.

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:31.370
But believe me, people are
working hard to fix it.

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:33.720
HEIDI ROIZEN: One way to stay in
the country is get accepted

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:37.410
into a Ph.D. program
somewhere.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:38.480
I'm serious.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.750
Get accepted into
a Ph.D. program.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.000
AUDIENCE: My other point would
be apply for Startup Chile and

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.252
get $40,000.

00:21:44.252 --> 00:21:47.310
They give you the visa
on top of it.

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:50.180
DON DODGE: If you want to
go Chile, that's great.

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:51.430
Next question.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.150
AUDIENCE: It struck me as funny
what you said about

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.650
dropping out of school.

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:01.950
What are your views
towards education?

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:05.460
I mean, if I were a 10-year-old
boy who wanted to

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:11.120
be an entrepreneur when I'm an
adult, what you think I should

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.760
be learning to become
an entrepreneur?

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.220
What would be a university
program to become an

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.750
entrepreneur?

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:23.620
HEIDI ROIZEN: First of all,
education is changing, and the

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.840
role of education,
higher education.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.560
I mean, there's massive stuff
on that, and I won't go into

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.630
it except to say I'm the parent
of one college age

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:34.340
student and one person applying
to college, and I'm

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.530
still strongly encouraging them
to go to college and get

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:37.410
their degrees.

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:39.620
And I teach at Stanford, where I
strongly encourage people to

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:42.750
get their degrees because
for better or worse--

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:46.030
first of all, Stanford has a
pretty good filter and so many

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:49.880
of things that apply talking
about accelerators, talking

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.540
about going to a higher
institution of

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.010
education like Stamford.

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:57.385
And also, I believe the degree
is a driver's license, and it

00:22:57.385 --> 00:23:00.300
is a minimum criterion for
certain things and for certain

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.120
places, and it helps you.

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:05.810
I have a few degrees from
there and it helped me.

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:09.020
Stay in school, kids,
if you can.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.820
A little bit of the problem is
some of the very smartest

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:14.990
people I know, school isn't for
everybody, and the lore is

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.720
you look around--

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.790
Mark Zuckerberg, and Bill Gates,
and Steve Jobs, and I

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:19.790
mean, the list there is quite
a few people like that.

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.830
But there are a couple people
who win the lottery every year

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:25.810
too, and that doesn't mean it's
a good strategy for you.

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:27.610
AUDIENCE: No, I already
finished school.

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.190
HEIDI ROIZEN: I think that there
are so many programs and

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:32.270
there are so many universities
now that understand that

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:33.040
entrepreneurship.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.640
And when we say
entrepreneurship, that doesn't

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.300
even just mean founding
companies.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.170
It also means being an
entrepreneur within an

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:41.130
environment, going to work for a
startup, understanding that.

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:41.820
That's what I teach.

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:43.510
I teach entrepreneurship,
but I really teach more.

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:45.460
It's almost like a
psychology class.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.900
So I think you can go do that.

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:48.100
I think there are
many programs.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.470
There are many undergraduate
and graduate institutions

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:54.110
where you can almost do your
entire startup working on the

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:56.290
startup and take classes.

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:58.160
And you take your marketing
class, and you take your

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:02.290
channel class, and you take your
financial modeling class,

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:05.250
and you just use them all to
work on your startup, and so

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:08.720
you could almost get a degree
kind of incidentally.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.880
So I think those things can
happen and I would encourage

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.570
you do that, but I think there's
a tremendous amount of

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:15.060
material that's also
available online.

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:18.690
And particularly as it relates
to the business side of being

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:20.800
an entrepreneur, there's
a lot of material.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.060
Again, Brad Feld has written--

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:26.440
he's been prolific about doing
books and being a great source

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:26.930
of material.

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:29.930
So if you go to feld.com and
poke around, you can find

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:34.610
other ways without having to
pay the expensive tuition.

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:37.620
I'd encourage you to look
at some of the Stanford,

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.700
particularly the Stanford MOOCs
that are going on this

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.410
summer because they're
all free.

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:45.320
DON DODGE: Heidi, this question
came up last year and

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.770
Paul Buchheit answered
the question.

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:49.130
He answered it this way.

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:52.380
The best training for
doing a startup is

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:54.020
to work at a startup.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:58.680
So Paul worked at Google, so
he picked a good startup to

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.500
work with because there were
only just a few people there.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:05.230
But truly, the best training for
starting a company is to

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:06.460
work at a startup.

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:08.010
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Just to riff on
that, I think asking if you

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:10.570
should go to college or not, I
mean, it's highly contextual.

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:13.090
Don't go to the University of
Phoenix and end up in debt.

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:14.960
Do go to Stanford if
you get the chance.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.970
So it does depend on your
opportunity cost, who you are,

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:19.580
where you are, what you want out
of life, and how much it's

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:20.540
going to cost you.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.980
That said, I would say if you
want to be in this business,

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:24.890
learn technology.

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:27.790
Best case, get a CS degree,
double E, mechanical

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:29.630
engineering, math, something
like that.

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:32.740
If not, worst case, go to Code
Academy, spend 12 weeks, bury

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.040
your head, go to Block,
go to Code Monk.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.700
Just learn the code, learn
design, learn the rudimentary

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:38.510
parts of it.

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:40.520
It's a little silly to be in
the business of technology

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.340
without understanding the
technology and the

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.034
tools are all there.

00:25:44.034 --> 00:25:44.441
DON DODGE: Great.

00:25:44.441 --> 00:25:47.310
Next question.

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:49.620
AUDIENCE: Having a successful
startup is really hard, and

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.460
you guys are in the business
of funding startups.

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.420
The success rate is very low.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:57.440
After a few good exits, what
makes you stay in the game and

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.620
what makes you think you'll
have another great exit?

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.360
NAVAL RAVIKANT: I think to get
in the game in the first

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.460
place, you have to
be fundamentally

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.840
broken at some level.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.886
I don't think success
fixes that.

00:26:11.886 --> 00:26:19.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:21.090
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: I don't
know if I'm fundamentally

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:23.310
broken, but I'm maybe
a little crazy.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:26.120
I just love working
with the founders.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.980
I mean, every single day is
different and it's just so

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.850
exciting to be part of their
journey, especially when you

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:36.510
start with them so early on when
they get rejected over

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:39.420
and over and have so many
problems that they face and

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:40.790
they overcome them.

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:42.040
It's exhilarating.

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:47.600
HEIDI ROIZEN: As an older
member of the venture

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:52.600
community, I think that there
are no higher highs and no

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.000
lower lows than being an
entrepreneur, and I will never

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.560
be more proud of anything than
the work I did when I was an

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:58.960
entrepreneur.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.855
But that's a lifestyle that
burns you out, and I did it

00:27:01.855 --> 00:27:02.870
for 14 years.

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:05.320
And so at the end of that I
said, I really love this

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.170
stuff, but it's like being a
parent and then deciding,

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:10.520
maybe it would be easier
to be a grandparent.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.040
You can hand them back
when the diaper

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.610
needs changing or whatever.

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:17.370
So I think that for venture, and
I know a lot of the people

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:20.690
that enjoy venture, they love
the thrill of the entrepreneur

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:23.250
and being with entrepreneurs
and doing fun, interesting

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:26.440
things, but in all honesty, they
just don't want to work

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:29.320
as hard and they don't
necessarily have that

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.650
passionate spark
to be intensely

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:33.610
driven to do one thing.

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:36.560
And so they go into this line
of work and this line of

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.960
work's pretty fun because you
get to be on the sidelines and

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.930
be helping, but you aren't
necessarily the one who's

00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:44.820
having both those high highs
and those low lows.

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.580
DON DODGE: The other thing is
as an entrepreneur, you can

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:47.780
only do one thing.

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:49.980
You're heads down on one idea.

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.720
When you're an investor, you
can invest in 10 different

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:56.810
companies and live vicariously
through them and help them.

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:59.880
So most of the investors
that I know do it

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.840
because they love it.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.380
They don't really do
it for the money.

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.050
They do it because they love it
and they love to help build

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:09.420
companies and build people
and do great things.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.060
And they make money along the
way, too, but it's not the

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.050
driving force.

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:14.990
Ask Ron Conway about that.

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:17.490
He stopped working for money
about 40 years ago.

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:19.410
He does not need
any more money.

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:22.990
But no one works harder than he
does because he just loves

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:25.560
what he does, and most investors
are like that.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.810
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:29.280
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.330
My name is Taylor.

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:33.130
I'm from Costa Rica.

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:36.700
Down there, we have a lot of
smart people, a lot of great

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:41.650
ideas, but sadly, we don't have
a culture of investment

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:46.770
and startup accelerators,
something like that.

00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:51.865
So I wanted to ask if you have
options, or do you offer

00:28:51.865 --> 00:28:56.050
possibilities to companies from
outside of the United

00:28:56.050 --> 00:29:00.220
States, and also if there are
any regulations or something

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:07.100
that might stop investors from
this country to give money to

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:10.400
companies in other countries.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.400
NAVAL RAVIKANT: It's a
super hard problem.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.730
There are regulatory issues, but
that's just one of many,

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:16.540
many, many issues.

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:19.110
Probably the biggest one is just
at a very early stage,

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:20.560
investing is a people
business.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.235
And so you don't know the
people, you don't know the

00:29:23.235 --> 00:29:24.345
network, you don't
know the culture.

00:29:24.345 --> 00:29:26.140
You don't even know what
you don't know.

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.220
So it's very difficult to
invest in an early stage

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:29.810
startup that's overseas.

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:33.800
At Angel List, we do a bit
of overseas matching--

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.270
in fact, that's where I think
we add the most value-- but

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:38.470
generally, those companies need
to have a fair bit of

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:40.470
traction because that's
what it takes to

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:41.800
pull a remote investor.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.170
And even then, it's pretty
rare and difficult.

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:47.540
So surprisingly to me, the way
that most international

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:51.360
companies get funded these days
is they actually move to

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.280
here, which seems backwards.

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.680
But actually, there are
accelerators that do nothing

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.210
but cream skim and import
from entire countries.

00:29:58.210 --> 00:29:59.780
And it's a very valuable
service, but

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:00.610
that's what they do.

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:02.930
UpWest West does it from Israel,
and Startmate does it

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:04.650
from Australia, and there's
a Korean one, a

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:05.850
Japanese one, and so on.

00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:06.290
DON DODGE: Seedcamp.

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:08.900
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Yes, exactly,
Seedcamp from Europe.

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.110
So it's expanding.

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:10.870
It's getting better.

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:13.040
But the good news is, the great

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.950
liberator here is the internet.

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:17.470
Every year that goes by, online
transactions get a

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.400
little bit easier, the knowledge
gets a little bit

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.310
more distributed, remote working
and collaboration gets

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:25.200
a little bit further, and
companies that were trapped

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.500
geographically in one area can
suddenly address markets in

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:29.930
another area thanks
to the internet.

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:31.490
So I think it is improving,
but it's going

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:33.350
to be a long cycle.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:34.770
It's not an overnight thing.

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:38.060
I'm a little pessimistic in
that I actually think the

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.740
internet will solve
the problem before

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.620
the politicians do.

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:45.035
I think the internet will get
there before the visas do.

00:30:45.035 --> 00:30:45.460
DON DODGE: Great.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.390
Next question.

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:48.600
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.820
My name is Marcus.

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:52.870
I'm from Brazil, but it has
been three months that I'm

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:56.960
living in Canada, and there,
we are working on an idea.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:00.730
And we have the prototype, we
have the landing page, we have

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:05.060
a great team, but we
can't afford the

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.840
launching for many reasons.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:12.990
So the question is,
what's next?

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:15.970
DON DODGE: What do you need to
see to fund the company?

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:17.710
So you've got the product,
you've get the

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:19.840
team, you've got--

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.130
AUDIENCE: We just can't afford
the launching for many

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:25.520
reasons, so what's next?

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:26.870
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Is it hardware
or software?

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:27.790
AUDIENCE: Software.

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:30.820
But we need servers
and everything.

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:34.510
We can't afford it if people
start to use it.

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:39.745
So how can we get funding before
launching the project?

00:31:39.745 --> 00:31:41.270
NAVAL RAVIKANT: I mean,
the obvious thing is

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:43.920
just launch it anyway.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:47.100
Come on, what? $250 Hiroku
server or AWS.

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.350
Just get something up there.

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:50.500
At least then you can start
talking to investors and

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.570
accelerators and people who
might be able to help you to

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:53.390
the next step.

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:55.140
And there are accelerators
in Canada.

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:57.660
You can apply to YC from there
as well, and maybe get down

00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.390
here for an interview.

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:00.740
Drive across country
if you had to.

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:04.380
What was it, Brian Chesky, sell
cereal if you have to.

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:05.880
JESSICA LIVINGSTON:
Sell cereal boxes.

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:11.190
Sorry to interrupt you, Naval,
but you brought up and it's

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:12.130
sort of a funny story.

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:16.280
But certainly, you could
apply to Y Combinator.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.530
If you can't do that, I've seen
lots of variations on how

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:20.440
to bootstrap.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:24.530
I mean, if you can't charge
customers, the story from

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:26.590
Airbnb is that they
were destitute.

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:29.210
They could not pay for anything,
and they were

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:30.430
designers from RISD.

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:32.890
So it was around the
presidential campaign here and

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:37.710
they thought, OK, let's design
these kooky cereal boxes.

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:39.540
And they had Captain
McCain cereal

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:41.680
that was Captain Crunch.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.950
Hopefully, you know
what that is.

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:46.320
And Obama Os that were
a take on Cheerios.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:47.930
And they said, gosh,
let's see.

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:50.310
We'll make them a limited
edition and sell

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:52.000
them for $40 each.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.110
And they made thousands and
thousands of dollars, and

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:58.580
that's not only how they paid
their rent, but they actually

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.935
wound up eating the cereal when
they couldn't afford to

00:33:00.935 --> 00:33:02.185
go grocery shopping.

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:06.740
DON DODGE: The other answer is
the natural progression of

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:10.530
funding is your first money
comes from friends and family.

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:14.440
So the first $10,000 or the
first $50,000 comes from

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.460
friends and family, and
that gets you far

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:18.270
enough to get it launched.

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:21.170
And then your second money
comes from angels, former

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:23.720
entrepreneurs or angel
investors or

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:24.600
that kind of thing.

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:28.630
And it's only after that that
VCs will actually get involved

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:30.360
and give you even more money,
so start there.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.210
HEIDI ROIZEN: But I'm going
to jump in on that.

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.460
First of all, don't take any
money from people who cannot

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:38.110
afford to lose it because as
much as you love it and as

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:40.970
much as your parents love you
or whatever, if people give

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:42.890
you money that they can't afford
to lose and you lose

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:45.250
it, I just think it's
a bad way to live.

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:46.580
So number one, that.

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:50.310
Number two, it's funny.

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:52.690
With all due respect to what
you just said, you're not

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:54.250
technical, right?

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:57.160
My undergraduate degree was in
creative writing, so there is

00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.690
a future in technology even
for people who don't code.

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:01.400
I did code.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.840
Nobody would want to buy my
code, but all you guys who

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.550
code and women who can code, you
need people like us to do

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:07.950
all that other stuff you
don't want to do.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:11.880
So there's a future, even for
those of us who don't.

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.260
NAVAL RAVIKANT: To clarify,
my point was you should

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:14.429
understand the technology.

00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:16.520
I don't write the code for Angel
List, but I at least

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.090
know a little bit of
what's going on.

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:19.810
HEIDI ROIZEN: And after this
many years in this business, I

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:22.199
know a little bit
about it, too.

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:24.560
But I will say this.

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:27.350
I'm not a technologist, but I
know some really simple math

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:31.810
about companies and ownership,
and there's only ever 100%.

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:32.790
It never changes.

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:33.820
You can't change it.

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:37.480
You can make the percentages
worth more, but you can't

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:38.280
create more.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.600
So be very careful about
taking money

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.750
on by selling equity.

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:45.100
If you do that, you are diluting
your company, you are

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:48.010
setting up expectations, you
are putting people in a

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:51.639
situation of needing you to get
liquidity so that they can

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:54.730
sell the company or take it
public or whatever, and they

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:58.510
have limited time frames of how
long they're going to wait

00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:59.090
to get that money.

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:02.790
So I just say that to say, try
to think about raising money

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:06.610
and imagining that none of
our categories existed.

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:09.850
And before our categories
existed-- because even venture

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:12.280
is a relatively new thing.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:15.990
I mean, it certainly wasn't
around 100 years ago.

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:18.080
People made money these
kinds of ways.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.090
They did consulting.

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:20.780
They did other products.

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.460
They worked on nights
and weekends.

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:24.790
They stole from their
employers.

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:27.990
I'm not recommending that,
clearly, but I'm just saying

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:30.540
there's all sorts of ways
that people get

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:32.320
companies off the ground.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:35.610
And unfortunately, I think
what's happened, and

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:36.800
particularly here in
Silicon Valley--

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.780
I think it's one of the
downsides of being here with

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:41.430
all the positive things, is
everybody thinks the first

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:44.580
thing you do here is you get
money from other people and

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:45.710
you sell equity to do it.

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:47.780
And I would argue that's
actually not the greatest way

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.860
to start a company, and I would
look at all these other

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.030
ways to do it.

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.300
DON DODGE: OK.

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:52.820
We have four minutes left.

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:53.750
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Email me.

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:54.810
You can guess my email.

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:55.710
AUDIENCE: OK. thank you.

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:57.540
DON DODGE: We have four minutes
left so we're going to

00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:58.720
go into the lightning round.

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:02.250
That means you ask the question
15 seconds, and we

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:04.410
answer in about 30 seconds.

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:05.460
Go ahead.

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:07.470
AUDIENCE: So my question is for
Jessica and Y Combinator.

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:10.740
I know last year, you announced
that you would be

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:12.620
accepting applicants from people
who didn't even have an

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:15.170
idea for a startup yet.

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:16.710
Was that successful?

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:19.890
What are you looking for in
people who have no idea?

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:21.140
And what have you learned
from the process?

00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:23.880
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: Yeah.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:27.230
That was called the No Idea
Track, and we thought, there's

00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:29.700
a lot of smart, talented
people out there.

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.330
We should let them apply even if
they don't have an idea and

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:33.510
we can help them.

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:38.280
It wasn't the best experiment,
to be honest.

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:42.170
But that said, we funded a lot
of people who we didn't like

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:44.350
the idea that they applied with,
and we've worked with

00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:45.800
them, and they have new ideas.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:51.670
So we'll continue to fund people
without ideas, I think.

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:52.100
DON DODGE: Awesome.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.670
Next.

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:54.170
AUDIENCE: I'm Victor.

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:57.120
I'm from Ghana.

00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:00.750
Jessica mentioned earlier that
only 2% of the people that

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:03.190
apply get taken at
Y Combinator.

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:06.960
And you also mentioned that a
lot of people you fund are

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.760
from other countries, from
outside the United States.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:17.270
And Naval mentioned that it's
difficult for you to actually

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:22.750
fund people who are not
based in America.

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:23.830
I come from Africa.

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:25.980
The problem is the
other way around.

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:28.710
You have a lot of people
who have ideas but

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:29.430
who do not have money.

00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:31.640
Here, you have the money but
you don't have the ideas.

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.100
DON DODGE: You need
to ask a question.

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:38.920
AUDIENCE: Don't you think
there's something wrong with

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:39.970
the funding model here?

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:44.370
Don't you think you probably
need to scale it beyond the

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:47.260
shores of America because there
are people there who do

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:49.070
not have the expertise
but have the money.

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:50.695
They want to know
how to invest.

00:37:50.695 --> 00:37:52.670
I've been on both sides
of the table myself.

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:53.850
I've lost money.

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:55.770
I've also been an
entrepreneur.

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:57.130
So what we do not have
there is knowledge.

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:59.620
Don't you think that
model should be

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:01.410
scaled beyond the US?

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:05.480
HEIDI ROIZEN: Yes.

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:06.770
I mean, I think it should.

00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:11.270
But I think the point is if we
don't do it, it's because our

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:12.370
model is working here.

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:14.670
And I would argue that there are
actually a fair number of

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:16.810
ideas here, and part of the
reason is because all of you

00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:17.800
are here in this room.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.280
So just look around the room
and understand you all did

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.380
something to get here.

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:24.720
So this model is working for
this, but I think the model

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.730
needs to be more distributed
and it will over time, and

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:28.680
people will change that.

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.926
You've got to find the right
people to change it.

00:38:30.926 --> 00:38:32.430
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Think of
it as an ecosystem.

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:35.120
People are funding the animals
within the ecosystem to find

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:36.260
the things to eat.

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.460
If the ecosystem isn't there,
you can't fund the animals.

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:42.240
You can't fund the fish
in the desert.

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.662
We have to build the ecosystem
too, and that takes time.

00:38:45.662 --> 00:38:46.110
DON DODGE: Thanks.

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:48.850
Next question.

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:49.170
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:53.720
So in regards to what you said
about equity, what would you

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:56.700
recommend to give up
for investments

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:58.180
instead of an equity?

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:02.520
If you were put in a situation
between giving up equity or

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:06.980
being put in a perpetual
royalty, which would you

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:10.750
believe is more beneficial
to a company?

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:14.040
HEIDI ROIZEN: Never sign up for
anything that's perpetual,

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.510
I mean that doesn't
have an end.

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:18.840
So I mean, things that I think
you can consider doing, for

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.830
example, do a white label
version of the product for a

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:24.440
customer that is going to-- let
them exploit it all they

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:27.620
want, but don't give them rights
to future development

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:30.680
and don't give them rights to
resell it to other people.

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:33.260
One of these we did early on to
bootstrap our company is we

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:35.640
realized that we could
handle two byte code.

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:37.480
I know this is really ancient
history, I'm sorry.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:41.440
Back in the '80s, CPM day,
anybody remember that?

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:43.110
And our biggest competitor
could not.

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:45.560
So even though they were much
bigger than we, we went over

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.680
to Taiwan, Japan, Korea.

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.410
We went places where two byte
code mattered and we did

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:54.270
basically countrywide site
licenses because we could sell

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:57.165
to one OEM and we could bring
in a couple hundred thousand

00:39:57.165 --> 00:39:58.570
dollars and that could
fund the company.

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:00.750
We said, what are the chances
we're actually going to get

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:03.260
over to Korea in any
near term and be

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:04.670
selling directly to consumers?

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:06.510
It was like zero.

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:08.680
But everything should have an
end because someday, you're

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.450
going to want to sell your whole
company and you need to

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:13.470
be able to own the rights to the
core of what you're doing.

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:16.200
Because I've also seen
developers do this where

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.900
they'll say, fund me and I'll
give you a 10% royalty for the

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:21.630
rest of my life on the product,
and they create

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:23.255
unfundable companies.

00:40:23.255 --> 00:40:24.340
DON DODGE: All right,
last question right

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:25.570
here in the red shirt.

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:25.750
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:26.450
My name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:27.690
I'm from New York.

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:30.130
So you mentioned about
college dropouts.

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:34.140
So I'm working with two lovely
ladies who are professors from

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:36.510
New York and they're
past their 40s.

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:41.010
So what do you think about
age and startups and that

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:43.250
collision, because so
far, it's targeting

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:46.670
the 20 years old.

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:48.530
DON DODGE: So age,
does that matter?

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:55.840
AUDIENCE: Yeah two co-founders
in their 50s, not dropouts.

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:59.890
HEIDI ROIZEN: Neither
young nor old.

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.000
I mean, there could
be brilliant

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.240
people who are young.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.890
If anything, I think the
problem around here is

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:06.610
everybody thinks if you're too
old, you must not have

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:08.730
anything good you can do.

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:12.110
I think that there are some
generational differences and

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:14.640
age doesn't matter
to me at all.

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:16.440
It's about what you
know how to do.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:17.900
AUDIENCE: They are
not as agile.

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:19.350
They cannot move.

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:20.145
They have other
responsibilities.

00:41:20.145 --> 00:41:21.395
But OK.

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:25.270
NAVAL RAVIKANT: I would give
them every bit of success,

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:29.230
perceived or actual, for
five years back.

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:29.600
DON DODGE: All right.

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:30.870
I'm sorry, we have to end.

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:31.760
We're out of time.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.300
But thank you all very
much for coming.

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.850
