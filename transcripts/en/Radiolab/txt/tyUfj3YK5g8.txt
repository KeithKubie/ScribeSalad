Speaker 1:          00:04          [inaudible] here with Robert Krulwich today on radio lab, an hour on the self, how it is the debt of a trillion chattering neurons in your brain or as the greatest illusion of all that you are. One thing, one self to extend this a little bit. Uh, another step chat. Well we spent the whole time talking about what it is to be a one or where is our self. There are times when you learn that the self is not got a Berlin Wall around it. We are porous. Our borders are full of the leaks. Robert Sapolsky is a biologist. He studies baboons in, in East Africa. He wrote an essay which I read and the essay is the story of his dad. Robert has a dad like we all do. This. Dad suffered from a condition that resembles Alzheimer's, so his father was forgetting things, what decade it was, where he was, but he was also beginning

Speaker 2:          01:04          to melt into the sun. The Dad was beginning to tell stories that really the sons stories, there's all kinds of things. Things like I had moved from New York to the bay area at that point and suddenly his stories of his immigration changed from when we left Europe and came to Ellis island to when we left Europe and entered the United States to the San Francisco Bay, including his describing the first side of the Golden Gate Bridge, golden gate bridge, which was built decades after he came to the United States. Completely confabulated but San Diego was involved to San Diego. I was in San Diego for a period and he suddenly had spent long periods of time in San Diego, in the navy, in World War II, so that he was able to have the same opinion and share the same, just kind of the edges of him spilling over into me. Did that make you feel a little claustrophobic or a little claustrophobic and being a good scientist? Of course. What I did instantly was try to label it and come up with diagnostic categories and pathologize it and sort of keep it at a safe distance and it was all fairly unnerving. And what this particular essay was about that I had written was amid all of that sort of confident pathologizing it was only after he died that I suddenly found myself doing the same in return.

Speaker 3:          02:25          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          02:25          let me read you some of what Robert Suppose you wrote about this experience. It started manageably enough how you arrange the utensils is heated from a favorite Yiddish tonight is throughout the day. Soon I had forsaken wearing my blue flannel shirts in order to wear the blue sweater ones. Oh he is.

Speaker 2:          02:44          I took a shirt at his, a flannel shirt and light back before global warming would always wear flannel shirts and for awhile I had to wear his flannel shirt instead or he had heart disease and the little bottles of Nitroglycerin all over the house and there was this period where in the immediate aftermath of his dying, I took a bottle of some nitroglycerine back with me and found I had to keep it with me physically all the time. Now you didn't have heart trouble. I had no heart trouble and I was a 30 year old. You're walking around with this Nitroglycerin, like it's your blankie, like you don't want to give it up. No. On some level I needed to have nitroglycerin with me handy in case like I had one of his angina attacks

Speaker 3:          03:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          03:34          he writes, I would make love to my wife, workout in the gym, attend the lecture, and always the bottle would be nearby

Speaker 2:          03:42          on a nightstand, in a sweat jacket, pocket of midnight papers. There was a day when I briefly misplaced it, it everything stopped for an anxious search. It was not that I'd lost a holy relic of his suffering and object to show my children someday to teach them about a man they hadn't known. This was urgent. I felt vulnerable. You're very hard to articulate. But during that period also, I had a large class I was doing on the last day of a lecture. I found, I gave this weird lecture where essentially I was talking to them like an octogenarian. You don't believe it now because you're 20 you're going to get tired and you're going to get tired. You're gonna get tired and it's just gonna get harder and harder just from the tired old 30 year old. Yeah, exactly. I was talking to them as an 80 year old and talking to them. You wake up to that notion in the middle of it. Did you say anything? Hey, what am I doing? I didn't know just how long they can't wait till evening. Trying to figure out the hell was that about instead of telling them about what's going to be on the final telling them you should be happy all your mother and the second call me as long as you're at it,

Speaker 1:          04:51          it could hurt you to call now. And then, um, and when you had finished the lecture to the kids who had been speaking through the voice of your dad, how did you unwind this connection or did it just fade away? Um, interestingly I actually gave that lecture wearing his shirt on and this was a very whole challenged period with the bottle of Nitroglycerin in my pocket cause I had it in my pocket at all times. And it was that night that I was able to put away the bottle and having worn the shirts sense and on some level I was saying goodbye for him. Um, and particularly appropriately to, you know, an auditorium, a wash in 520 year olds with their world ahead of him and Sudu saying goodbye for him a year later that time has begun to make sense. I feel sure that what I went through need not merit a diagnosis.

Speaker 1:          05:54          It's a measure of my training as a scientist that I saw pathology there wasn't there and essentially with that whole period was about, it was a learning. It is, you know, a perfectly normal, non pathological state to feel at times of extreme emotional challenge that interconnected with another person. That in some ways the boundaries slip a little bit. It can only come as an echo. A hint in our armored individuated world did a bit of confusion as to ego. Boundaries can be an act of health, of Hamas and love. It can be a whisper of what it feels like to be swaddled and cut nudity. It is a lesson. I mean our ever expanding array of scientific labels on the risks of over pathologizing most of all. It is a lesson that it wouldn't be so bad. In fact, it would even be a point of pride if in the end someone mistakes you for him. Mike, just post good questions. Is, did you ever, um, say to your dad when he was ill, um, you didn't come to San Francisco. Did you ever like correct him? Not a chance.

Speaker 4:          07:11          Robert Sapolsky is a biologist at Stanford University in California. He's written several collections of essays, but the one we're quoting here is from the trouble with testosterone. That's where you find the story of his dad.
