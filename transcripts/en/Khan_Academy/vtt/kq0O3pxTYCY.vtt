00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.730
- We're gonna go ahead
and grab our Chrome Books,

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.177
we're gonna log in.

00:00:06.177 --> 00:00:07.010
- Good morning.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.843
- Good morning.

00:00:07.843 --> 00:00:08.676
- My name is Brooke Hogan,

00:00:08.676 --> 00:00:10.510
I've been teaching for nine years.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.303
I teach seventh grade
math, science, and health.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.840
I try and get to know each
and every one of my students

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.880
on a personal level.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.260
Good job.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.093
Awesome.

00:00:20.093 --> 00:00:22.740
So that they know that I
recognize them as a human being

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.420
and as a person, not just as
my student within my room.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.370
Log in to Khan Academy.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.710
I use Khan on an almost every day basis,

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.030
at least every other day.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.340
You guys will see that I have assigned

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.120
you guys two assignments.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.880
I will give them as assignments,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.850
I have given them as quizzes.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.130
The kids love using Khan
as quizzes because I allow

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.700
them one retake, so if they
don't like their score,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.350
'cause they get their score at the end,

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.160
then they're like, I wanna retake it.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.440
Alright, let's get to work.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.810
When I assign an assignment,
I go back and I look

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.400
at the data on the reports tab.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.250
With Khan in my classroom
and having that accessibility

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.650
in my classroom on a daily
basis, it really allows me to

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.620
work with small groups within
our instructional time.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.973
- We don't know how to do the ink one.

00:01:07.973 --> 00:01:12.090
- Those kids who need
that reteaching or to be,

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.920
have some concepts reinforced
within my instructional time.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.360
Yeah, nice work.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.193
Good job.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.500
My students love it.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.890
They absolutely love Khan.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.140
When I say, on any given
day, okay guys, we're gonna

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.680
work on Khan today, yes!

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.880
I hear them starting to
challenge each other, like oh

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.770
what are you going to work on?

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.750
Oh I'm gonna work on this,
I'm gonna work on this.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.730
Just in taking practice
tests, their math scores have

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.740
jumped so much.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.070
Not only their math scores,
but I've seen their confidence

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.110
go up a lot.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.110
Perfect!

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.943
Awesome.

00:01:42.943 --> 00:01:43.776
Perfect, perfect.

00:01:43.776 --> 00:01:46.830
I love seeing the light
bulbs go off on my kids'

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.100
faces when they finally
understand a concept

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.540
and they get it.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.760
You see that excitement,
they're like, I got it!

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.743
And I'm like, yes!

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.970
I really want them to be able
to transfer the knowledge

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.160
that they learn in the
classroom and be able to

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.790
transfer it to their real lives.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.100
Yay, perfect.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.343
Perfect, perfect.
