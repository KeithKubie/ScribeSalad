I wonder if we could talk about that a
little bit that is why is freedom of

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:22.340
little bit that is why is freedom of
 

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.539
little bit that is why is freedom of
speech what what made you think that

00:22:24.539 --> 00:22:24.549
speech what what made you think that
 

00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:28.839
speech what what made you think that
freedom of speech is the whole thing and

00:22:28.839 --> 00:22:28.849
freedom of speech is the whole thing and
 

00:22:28.849 --> 00:22:32.080
freedom of speech is the whole thing and
I guess the the larger frame in which I

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:32.090
I guess the the larger frame in which I
 

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:35.259
I guess the the larger frame in which I
I would like to sort of pursue this is

00:22:35.259 --> 00:22:35.269
I would like to sort of pursue this is
 

00:22:35.269 --> 00:22:38.950
I would like to sort of pursue this is
that a hell of a lot of the world does

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960
that a hell of a lot of the world does
 

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.779
that a hell of a lot of the world does
not think that freedom of speech is the

00:22:40.779 --> 00:22:40.789
not think that freedom of speech is the
 

00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:43.899
not think that freedom of speech is the
whole thing and one of the great issues

00:22:43.899 --> 00:22:43.909
whole thing and one of the great issues
 

00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:49.239
whole thing and one of the great issues
of our time is to what extent will sort

00:22:49.239 --> 00:22:49.249
of our time is to what extent will sort
 

00:22:49.249 --> 00:22:53.829
of our time is to what extent will sort
of Western values be insisted upon or

00:22:53.829 --> 00:22:53.839
of Western values be insisted upon or
 

00:22:53.839 --> 00:22:57.729
of Western values be insisted upon or
imposed upon other societies in the

00:22:57.729 --> 00:22:57.739
imposed upon other societies in the
 

00:22:57.739 --> 00:23:00.369
imposed upon other societies in the
world that do not accept those values

00:23:00.369 --> 00:23:00.379
world that do not accept those values
 

00:23:00.379 --> 00:23:03.759

and liberalism has the kind of in free

00:23:03.759 --> 00:23:03.769
and liberalism has the kind of in free
 

00:23:03.769 --> 00:23:05.369
and liberalism has the kind of in free
speech has the kind of paradox in it

00:23:05.369 --> 00:23:05.379
speech has the kind of paradox in it
 

00:23:05.379 --> 00:23:09.039
speech has the kind of paradox in it
because a lot of what freedom of speech

00:23:09.039 --> 00:23:09.049
because a lot of what freedom of speech
 

00:23:09.049 --> 00:23:12.940
because a lot of what freedom of speech
liberalism is about is having very

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:12.950
liberalism is about is having very
 

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:15.609
liberalism is about is having very
active imagination being able to put

00:23:15.609 --> 00:23:15.619
active imagination being able to put
 

00:23:15.619 --> 00:23:17.469
active imagination being able to put
yourself in other people's positions and

00:23:17.469 --> 00:23:17.479
yourself in other people's positions and
 

00:23:17.479 --> 00:23:20.889
yourself in other people's positions and
so on that's the basis of tolerance and

00:23:20.889 --> 00:23:20.899
so on that's the basis of tolerance and
 

00:23:20.899 --> 00:23:24.190
so on that's the basis of tolerance and
that's the basis of of a lot of what we

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:24.200
that's the basis of of a lot of what we
 

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:29.680
that's the basis of of a lot of what we
take to be Western values and yet there

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:29.690
take to be Western values and yet there
 

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:32.049
take to be Western values and yet there
are some things that we think we should

00:23:32.049 --> 00:23:32.059
are some things that we think we should
 

00:23:32.059 --> 00:23:34.389
are some things that we think we should
insist upon and one of those is free

00:23:34.389 --> 00:23:34.399
insist upon and one of those is free
 

00:23:34.399 --> 00:23:37.629

speech the very thing that has is its

00:23:37.629 --> 00:23:37.639
speech the very thing that has is its
 

00:23:37.639 --> 00:23:39.609
speech the very thing that has is its
core sort of trying to understand other

00:23:39.609 --> 00:23:39.619
core sort of trying to understand other
 

00:23:39.619 --> 00:23:41.499
core sort of trying to understand other
points of view is something we're not

00:23:41.499 --> 00:23:41.509
points of view is something we're not
 

00:23:41.509 --> 00:23:45.310
points of view is something we're not
prepared to give up on and that means at

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:45.320
prepared to give up on and that means at
 

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.589
prepared to give up on and that means at
the end of the day we sort of have to

00:23:47.589 --> 00:23:47.599
the end of the day we sort of have to
 

00:23:47.599 --> 00:23:50.889
the end of the day we sort of have to
have an argument for why that kind of

00:23:50.889 --> 00:23:50.899
have an argument for why that kind of
 

00:23:50.899 --> 00:23:53.649
have an argument for why that kind of
value is something that we should insist

00:23:53.649 --> 00:23:53.659
value is something that we should insist
 

00:23:53.659 --> 00:23:57.609
value is something that we should insist
upon and you take that position free

00:23:57.609 --> 00:23:57.619
upon and you take that position free
 

00:23:57.619 --> 00:24:00.909
upon and you take that position free
