1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:05,560
I rarely watch the event live.
Hello? Skanks. What's up? Hello live.

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,970
This is sort of hell. You were
recorded. Could you see boys?

3
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,700
Duggans avenue things got strange.
As soon as I said we're alive,

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,950
everybody's like, whoa. Oh Man.
We were having a great conference.

5
00:00:14,951 --> 00:00:17,950
Now we're listening a little too high
right now. People are listening to what?

6
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:21,010
God Damn Mike Tyson weed and we really
were just having the most natural

7
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:25,510
conversation. Everyone was going back
and forth. Nothing. Yeah, Mike Tyson.

8
00:00:25,511 --> 00:00:27,610
We were talking when you
went to the bathroom.

9
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:31,780
Mike Tyson says he smokes $40,000 of weed.

10
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,820
We also sells weed, so he just
charges it himself. A lot of money.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,200
He gets hired as a supply
slip. $40,000 worth of weed.

12
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,490
I mean maybe like his whole crew.
You have to say this about himself.

13
00:00:45,491 --> 00:00:46,990
There's no way a month.

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,300
How much is 40,000 I want to see what
it looks like in a room like, yeah,

15
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,460
am I buying that? It would be a pile
that you could fall into and take a nap.

16
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,790
Like you could definitely take like bean
bag chair and you could fly through the

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,800
air with confidence. So how much is,
I mean you're getting it in bulk,

18
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:05,980
so it's going to be probably like a
hundred dollars it's getting worse.

19
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,230
Even less than that. If you're
going to spend 40 grand,

20
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,190
they'll give you more than 40 grands
worth just to be like, here, man.

21
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,230
We smoked 10 tons of weed at
the ranch a month. Oh my God,

22
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,820
this is Britain said uh Eban.
Is that how you say his name?

23
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,650
Even Eben. Eben Britton.

24
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,100
So a 10 tons of weed is $40,000
that doesn't seem right,

25
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:34,060
does it? None of that seems
right. [inaudible] pounds
of weed. It's impossible.

26
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:38,260
He obviously could have easily been joking
and laughing while he said this too.

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,370
We're reading it in print, but he's
like, dude, we smoked 10 tons a month.

28
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,040
We talk. That's what I'm saying.

29
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,240
Sounds like something I would say
more than you trying possibly imagine

30
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,800
with the chef. Keep burning
and we brought in all the time.

31
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:56,490
We don't even believe I'm going
to throw out a wild number.

32
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,240
Forty million forty million,

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,100
40,000 someone should maybe
some journalists should do. Oh,

34
00:02:06,101 --> 00:02:06,880
look up.

35
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,880
Do just make an image of this is what
$40,000 worth of weed looks like.

36
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:13,510
Yeah.

37
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,440
It's going to be more than even like Tyson
and his crew can smoke when they fill

38
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:19,730
this whole room. I think
it would. It'd be, yeah.

39
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,730
One of the like shipping crates is, is it?

40
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,590
There's a graph. Is it even possible
to smoke $40,000 a weed a month?

41
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,490
980 [inaudible] not that much, but
with a cro niner I think about it.

42
00:02:33,491 --> 00:02:36,630
If you do a two grand blunts,

43
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,720
that's two blonds per eighth
essentially a little bit less.

44
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,250
This guy's got a broken down baby.

45
00:02:42,251 --> 00:02:44,530
This guy really could just tell
you how much it is in bulk.

46
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:49,510
He's giving you 908th seems a little bit
lazy to even write 1800 blondes between

47
00:02:49,511 --> 00:02:52,600
Mike Tyson's. Crew is not actually that
much for a month. It's not that much.

48
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:55,200
Now when I'm looking at the how
this guy saying it, he's saying it.

49
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:58,510
It's basically four blunts per
hour. That's totally possible.

50
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,100
If you've got a number of people with you.

51
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,850
I will never question Mike Tyson
again. This is it ever Amanda.

52
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,970
Not still not 10 tons. I
think we're being silly.

53
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:10,690
I think they were joking around. I bet a
lot of it they give away too. You know,

54
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:14,140
they might go through a personal
stash of that much weed.

55
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,530
I didn't know we have ranch, right?

56
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,170
Tyson's in the weed game son all in. Dude.

57
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:23,530
He was one of the most fascinating
guys that interview because I couldn't

58
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:25,380
believe I was really
talking to them. So like,

59
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,880
I can't believe that's really Mike
Tyson. Like there's smart people.

60
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:31,930
Like you talk to them like, oh, that's
really Mike Tyson. This is crazy.

61
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:32,800
It doesn't make sense

62
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,290
what he's been through in his life.
Yeah. You're like, and now he's here

63
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,680
knowing him as a kid when he was the
fucking man and you'd see him on the cover

64
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:44,190
of these magazines like kid dynamite
when he was 19 years old on sports

65
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:47,400
illustrated and just smashing everyone
in front of him and then all of a sudden

66
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:50,170
he's hanging with you. Yeah.
It's very strange. She's 10.

67
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,510
It's also just as a fall from grace and
then a resurgence and still weird for

68
00:03:54,511 --> 00:03:57,470
surgeons too. Like nobody ever
saw him becoming like, you know,

69
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,500
cartoon character and like a fucking
Broadway actor and a one man show and now

70
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,860
we'd rancher. That's
[inaudible] who saw that?

71
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:07,840
Nobody said that was going to be Mike
Tyson's trajectory. I just hope it doesn't

72
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,920
started the tech, the uh,

73
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,430
the trajectory of when I found out who
he was when I was a kid and started

74
00:04:13,431 --> 00:04:16,250
getting those bought like very shortly
after you saw it, a monster he was,

75
00:04:16,251 --> 00:04:21,251
was that Robin Givens interview where he
just sat there like a doofus while she

76
00:04:21,531 --> 00:04:24,590
was like gay beats up me and rapes
my mom and he's like, [inaudible]

77
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,850
[inaudible] just go on. Like when
these cameras go off, oh boy,

78
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,200
you better hope that thin if you
go to the phone for four days.

79
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,060
But wasn't there some talk
about them medicating him?

80
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,490
Wasn't that part of what was happening?

81
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,490
Like they were the Mama Rob
given to date him? Maybe.

82
00:04:45,491 --> 00:04:49,480
I just remember him talking about him
in the documentary and he was just like,

83
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,730
he said he was just so, he
couldn't believe she was saying it,

84
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:53,590
so he was just like silent.
But if you watch it,

85
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:58,330
it seems like he's furious and just
trying to not say something angry.

86
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,640
Key to Mike Tyson is that he always
seemed like he was furious. Yeah,

87
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,580
and he even talked about it once. He
goes, I'm just mad. I'm mad at my dog.

88
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:11,340
I'm mad at everything, and that's when
he was at the top of the heat, man.

89
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,680
Fuck how? He's like this
peaceful, friendly guy.

90
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,870
He had to overcompensate for all that.
That's why he needs 40,000 childhood.

91
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:22,180
It was all therapy. Right. He had to
be, he has had like 20 therapists.

92
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,470
He beat up the first seven of them.
I mean, to be a great fighter,

93
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:28,210
you have to be able to look at yourself.

94
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,670
You have to be able to look
at your skills. You still,

95
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,830
it doesn't mean you still
can't make horrific mistakes,

96
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:34,300
but you have to be able
to look at yourself.

97
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,650
It's the only way you get any better.

98
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,600
Those the best fighters
have an understanding. Even
if they have ego problems,

99
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:44,110
they still have a pretty good
understanding of who they are and that's,

100
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,750
that can benefit you if you use it.

101
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,680
I'm sure he probably went through
therapy but he didn't necessarily,

102
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,950
he could probably have figured it out
on his own just cause he's a smart guy.

103
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,560
He's a smart guy that
grew up in a horrible,

104
00:05:56,561 --> 00:06:01,561
horrible where the first love he had was
an old boxing trainer that turned him

105
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:04,820
into a murderer. Then that was the
first love that guy experienced.

106
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:06,350
His life was horrible man.

107
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:11,720
And from him being adopted by custom
motto when he was a little kid and having

108
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:13,970
extreme physical gifts as well.

109
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:19,010
It was this perfect storm did they said
when he was 13 he weighed 190 pounds.

110
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,440
Teddy Atlas used to bring him to boxing
the smoker events and they were like

111
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,200
Dang,

112
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,950
he's fucking 13 and they put him in
with a 16 year old cause nobody wants to

113
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:31,340
believe that a 13 year old could
be jacked like that when Jay would,

114
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,770
when Jason was 13 years old,
they were like two 20 it's true.

115
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,950
[inaudible] different kind of was
it a different build? He be okay.

116
00:06:37,951 --> 00:06:41,460
I got them motherfuckers out
of your Goddamn tank. Yeah.

117
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,130
That's not a 13 year
old. You want to fight.

118
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,400
Also fun fact he is the reason Mike Tyson
solely is the reason why now if you're

119
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:53,030
on TV for even five minutes they start
scurrying about your tattoos being

120
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:57,230
covered or can you get a release for
the mall because when he came on a,

121
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,660
was it the hangover movie,

122
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,430
the company that did where the tattoo
artists that did his face tattoo suit for

123
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:07,190
like and I think one for
like millions of dollars.

124
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,080
How is that possible for doing the movie?

125
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:13,810
Because they used that purchase artwork
without them. Once you put a tattoo on.

126
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,490
Yeah. Nobody is your own, you know,

127
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,810
you claimed part ownership of that
Yeltsin that makes tattoo so much.

128
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,370
Gayer it just, you know, walk around
with some fucking dudes. Oh yeah,

129
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:28,200
this is fine. This is, I married in a
lesbian in Alaska. This is when I became,

130
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:32,320
I guess a a partners in life with
a guy in Montreal who spoke French.

131
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,500
Say how many tattoos did we
have in common? We are the same.

132
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:39,610
You guys have a bunch of 10. One, two,
three. Yeah, we have the day of suicide.

133
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,330
What did, what did, what do you guys
have here we go. Oh, we're doing that.

134
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,810
You guys get, what do you,
what's happening here?

135
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,200
There's a lot of people that can't
hear this. So what are these things?

136
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:52,360
This is notes half hearts. It
says Dave and Smith. Wow. Yeah.

137
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,600
So you are on their arm. Yeah. These
two would make you uncomfortable.

138
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,690
I did not consent to see much of a pussy
to get a tattoo. So we did it for him.

139
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,230
Ah, these are very cute. He's very
Jewish. That's real love, man.

140
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,910
You guys have to stay
friends for life. Now.

141
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,670
I know I was going to be out the
door and they got this tattoo.

142
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,630
No girls want to get married,
guys do that. Oh Bro, Bro,

143
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,900
I'm fucking [inaudible] Bro.
You got to do much. I tried to,

144
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,230
hey, you could have as many guys tattooed
on you. I don't care. I'm not jealous,

145
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,590
but I want my fucking name on your
leg, Bro. There was a Worldstar,

146
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,150
there's a wellstar video yesterday of a
guy catching a girl cheating in a hotel

147
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,730
and the other guy's like naked in the
hallway and she's like in her underwear

148
00:08:32,731 --> 00:08:34,170
and the guy is just screaming at her.

149
00:08:34,171 --> 00:08:37,680
There's a guy there and she just
fucking keeps going. And he's like,

150
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:42,300
I got my fucking your name tatted on me.
And she's doing all of that. I'm sorry.

151
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,070
Calmed down. I'm sorry.

152
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,720
And when she just decides that she
doesn't give a shit anymore, she goes,

153
00:08:45,721 --> 00:08:48,660
well no one told you to get my name
tatted on you. Now you'll get fucking ass.

154
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,610
Oh my damn. Have you ever done anything
for a girl? Like a tattoo? Yeah.

155
00:08:53,611 --> 00:08:56,220
You know, so I've three characters

156
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:56,371
here.

157
00:08:56,371 --> 00:09:00,090
This is back when I was young enough
when a tattoo shop was able to convince

158
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:01,020
you, which I think they still do.

159
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,650
The people that Chinese characters
can say or spell anything,

160
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:08,490
which is just not true. Well, like
what's supposed to be letters. So I got,

161
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,350
when I believed Chinese characters
was CMS, they're still there.

162
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,440
Uh, they're just blended into
something else. But it was

163
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:19,980
Sherilyn Marie Sleeter was, uh,

164
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,340
was the name of my girlfriend when
I was a terrible name. Yeah. Yeah.

165
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,970
All Sleeter she sounds like she's got
shit teeth infamous now. Good teeth.

166
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,081
Sheriffs. Leary says,

167
00:09:29,081 --> 00:09:31,240
I see have fucking teeth pointing
in every which direction. Hot

168
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,620
CIC actually. But, uh, just, I mean,
coming from like a real pack of dummies,

169
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,490
like real stupid and so
stupid. In fact, was she,

170
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,720
that I got those tattooed on me. Thank
God. And Chinese characters, CMS.

171
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,000
Her mom didn't like me and I came,

172
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:49,900
I couldn't wait to tell her mom
that I got this tattoo. I go,

173
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,440
look what I got for your daughter. And
she's like, what does that go to CMS?

174
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,860
And she goes, what's that? I
go, your daughter's initials.

175
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,520
Sherilynn Maria's leader. And
she goes, uh, her mom could,

176
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,650
she was so happy to go. That's not
your name. My girlfriend was so dumb.

177
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,760
She didn't know her name is not, in
fact, she just made up the Murray part.

178
00:10:09,761 --> 00:10:13,410
Her name is Cheryl Lynn
Sleeter and it was that.

179
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:16,960
So I got a wrong tet to have a
girl from that. She was perfect.

180
00:10:16,961 --> 00:10:19,390
She was with me while I got it and
didn't know her own middle name.

181
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,880
Sat there confidently like,
make sure you get the m good.

182
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:26,110
Yeah. That's, that too is
wild large patches of America.

183
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:31,300
That is, that tattoo,
that tattoo like that.

184
00:10:31,301 --> 00:10:35,830
That's that fucked up bodies so
many lives. Oh yeah. So many people.

185
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,600
So many people have made horrendous
choices. Yeah. I had my first tattoo.

186
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,390
It just said, uh, Lew dog. I
gotta cover it out. But Ludo, l,

187
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,940
U. D. O, g, g, nobody has
ever called me Lou dog,

188
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,050
except for afterwards sarcastically to
make fun of me. They're like, all right,

189
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,800
Lou dog is there, but you were so sick
to go tell your friends. Hey guys,

190
00:10:56,801 --> 00:10:59,890
you're calling me Lou dog. It was weird
cause I only had $70 and I was like,

191
00:10:59,891 --> 00:11:00,251
all right dude,

192
00:11:00,251 --> 00:11:05,251
I have $70 I'm 18 I just turned 18 I was
like getting a fucking tattoo and I was

193
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:06,640
like, all right, I'm going
to Ludo no matter what.

194
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,410
But I gotta get like a
little design underneath it.

195
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,180
[inaudible] script and
then underneath it it was,

196
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,470
it was tribal like almost they
had walls look like, like antlers,

197
00:11:17,471 --> 00:11:19,890
like tribal antlers. But
it was because I was poor.

198
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:24,160
Some you would like scribble on a binder
while you're bored in class. Dude.

199
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:25,750
It was just, it was like
there was a tramp stamp.

200
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:29,770
It was like about tiny trash stamp
underneath Lou dog for no reason.

201
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,630
Were you under age? No, I was 18

202
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,430
oh, I was under it.

203
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:36,870
That's why my mind is the word Jay and
old English and it is so high up here to

204
00:11:36,871 --> 00:11:37,860
so my mom wouldn't see it.

205
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,080
Oh right. You sold immediately. Why
was the hide it under your tee shirt?

206
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,290
We were both fat kids and I had a big
fat arms with this little tiny shit that

207
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,430
too. And my big fat arm. And your j
is so tiny, it's so tiny. It's still,

208
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,050
they're all bad. It's bad. It's
bad. Yeah, it's that, yeah.

209
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,890
Then more Chinese stuff here and then
a Pam Anderson Barbwire wire around my

210
00:11:56,891 --> 00:12:00,580
arm. But I've just accepted all my tattoos
of some shitty dumb stories in high

211
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:00,821
school.

212
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:04,450
My friend Jimmy was the first one to get
tattooed and he got this really shitty

213
00:12:04,451 --> 00:12:09,040
like tiger on his arm with his name
case if he gets his name, you know,

214
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:13,590
I think we were like 18 at the time,
maybe 17. And he came home and uh,

215
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:17,170
he had like a little bandaid
peeking out underneath his shirt.

216
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,820
His mom started screaming at him
and if I'm, I hope I'm not re,

217
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,740
I'm fucking this story up. I hope I'm not,

218
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:28,330
but like are I remember thinking that
like, wow, he was the first, like,

219
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,040
everyone's got to get a tattoo eventually.

220
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:34,720
Like the idea that someone's gonna
draw on you permanent. I was like, Ooh,

221
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,480
forever. You've got to keep
it like it's a balls. Funny.

222
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:40,150
It never really hit me like that
hard, but I know it and it's true.

223
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:43,150
And by the way, I wish you know,
talk about having a time machine.

224
00:12:43,151 --> 00:12:47,020
If you can go back and just tell your
teenage self like just wait til even like

225
00:12:47,021 --> 00:12:49,620
your late twenties you're going to
have a lot of good years with awesome

226
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,463
tattoos.

227
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,320
We're going to make this decision now
and have the rest of your life with some

228
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:55,450
pretty shitty. You want money
when you're 18 you don't,

229
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,550
there's no money for good tattoos.

230
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,030
You probably from some Alicia
live in Miami 20 I've have,

231
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,100
I have $20 tattoos on me for sure. I was,

232
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,120
if I was offended by the drawing because
I'm an artist and I was looking at,

233
00:13:06,121 --> 00:13:08,440
I was like this is so
bad. The guy just traits.

234
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,500
I mean the guy was not an artist
at all. Whoever did the tattoo,

235
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:14,110
he was fucking just a guy
who got a job doing tattoos,

236
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,520
who learned how to use the gun on my leg.

237
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:23,290
I have a dragon, like a, another
tribal dragon. I was 19 and Florida.

238
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:27,580
We Miami like we liked like on a boardwalk
tattoo shop with like Chinese people

239
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:30,340
in the front. Like they don't ever
get tired. Never going to tablets.

240
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:33,010
You're in China and they're using the
old like taffy techniques where they

241
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:33,844
fucking do that.

242
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,650
Don't go to like a Shit Bodega Tattoo
shop because that's what I got and it's

243
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,790
all blended together now. And the
guys had no idea. It's painful shit.

244
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,511
They don't know what they're doing.

245
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:47,350
The other problem with it is it's
really painful. They go too deep.

246
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:51,680
They pull it out. Well that's another
thing about [inaudible] ladies. If you uh,

247
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,330
or guys who are in the Henna Tattoos,
if you get those Hanna Tattoos,

248
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:58,420
I can Thailand or something like
that. Sometimes it's not really Henna,

249
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,990
it's hair dye and the hair dye
can be poisonous to your skin.

250
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,190
She's like not good stun. You didn't
even die getting a real tattoo. Wow.

251
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,340
You can die, but I think it fucks you up.
I'm getting painted on with hair dyes.

252
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,480
What a,

253
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,530
I think there was like a warning about
this that I've read where they're saying

254
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:18,310
don't don't get Hannah from places that
aren't using real Henoch cause they,

255
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,210
they use cheap hair dye. They could've
just stopped that dunk at Henna. Yeah,

256
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:24,130
you could have said that.
That's a weird one. Right?

257
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:27,520
It's like I want a tattoo but not
really. Yeah, it looks like a,

258
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:29,890
it looks like a spray
on Tan's wearing off.

259
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,950
It just looks disgusting.

260
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,380
P D is Con in it. Whatever.

261
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:39,970
Black can often contains PPD at high
levels and when that applied to skin can

262
00:14:39,971 --> 00:14:43,090
cause chemical burns and allergic
reactions. And I don't know what PPD is.

263
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,970
I'm trying to find that chemical burns.

264
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,570
Yeah, you gotta be careful out
there. Kids don't do heels on you.

265
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,280
Joe Rogan says steer clear of Hannah,

266
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,100
drill holes in your skin and
pumped some ink in there.

267
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,820
It's apparently there
had to be like a, uh,

268
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,660
some errors made when they
were coming up with like tech.

269
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,920
Like the first tattoos, peoples arms
were fucking falling off their body.

270
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,290
I'm pretty sure the first
tattoos were like in Africa,

271
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:09,680
carving shit into your arm
or something. Scarring thing.

272
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,360
When someone's a great tattoo artists,
I'm always blown. It's the most sloppy,

273
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:17,300
uncomfortable with the fact that I
couldn't do anything near that with like a

274
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:20,060
pencil and art supplies and a set. Yeah.

275
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,030
You know flat surface like was it meant
to have to do that as correct when

276
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:26,710
someone's amazing at it, it makes no
sense. No it doesn't because they always,

277
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,190
also,

278
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,480
there's still just going like and just
scribbling basically it looks like and

279
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:32,420
then they swipe it away and it's like
they're mad at you. It's like, man,

280
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,900
I found the craziest fucking page.
Jamie, I'm gonna send it to you.

281
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:40,730
This is a lady and she does paint on
people's face that makes it look like they

282
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:45,380
have extra eyeballs and the,
the paint is so accurate.

283
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:49,370
You're looking at a video of it and you're
like, what the fuck am I looking at?

284
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,140
I have to say, is it the Asian check?

285
00:15:51,141 --> 00:15:54,950
Cause she makes herself into different
do that. That chick is fucking talented,

286
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:57,950
which he does with makeup and she got
in trouble cause she did black face but

287
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,150
she does everything. She can do blackface.

288
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,580
She made herself into like
an African Nubian princess.

289
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,490
It was the most amazing thing
in the world. Is this her?

290
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,280
But it still has like the outline.
She was shucking and jiving.

291
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,720
She was choice. I'm a Newbie and
princess, whether you're talking

292
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,990
[inaudible] name is Mimi Choi.
This is the shit she does. Whoa,

293
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:21,560
look at that dude. That's
insane. Yeah. Your head.

294
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:27,020
She's got eyeballs drawn. All
those Rogan's perfectly well.

295
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,060
Yeah. That's like a tool
video. She's a fractal.

296
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,270
That is something you would see if you
were on some serious drugs and this is

297
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:37,700
the kind of shit you got to pretend to
enjoy where if you want to fuck a hot

298
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:41,270
Asian chick her, I'm super into
new dance. Like look at that.

299
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,820
Oh this is a different check
than I was thinking of, but yeah,

300
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,950
I guess there's a category.
It's cool. It's crazy.

301
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:49,250
If you go scroll down and look at some
of the eyeball ones where the extra

302
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:53,900
eyeballs are below or face
[inaudible] Jesus Christ.

303
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:58,310
That's a fucking freak out. It's
a fucking freak out. Yeah. Yeah.

304
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,800
That's so weird. Yeah, it's wild.

305
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:05,660
It's that same sort of level of tattoo
art that the really high level Tattoo

306
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,600
guy. Have you seen that Guy Steve
Butcher? I've showed you that guy before,

307
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:10,220
right? That guy walked into a room.

308
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:12,800
I would think that it's a monster
and I would kill it. Yeah. He like,

309
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:16,640
what the fuck? He was terrifying. Someone
drugged you. Yeah. You would see like,

310
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:18,280
Oh my God, Satan is real.

311
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:23,050
I've been budding around arrogant
thinking that Satan's not real. Yeah.

312
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:27,290
This is Steve Butcher. Steve Butcher
does insane shit, man. He did one of me.

313
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:30,360
Somebody got me tattooed on their
leg and it's fucking increase.

314
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,360
Do you feel about that Joe? So
weird. Don't do that. Don't do that.

315
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:40,640
Doesn't mean you can't say it to the guy
when he sends you a fucking just dump

316
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,360
stuff. God got Legion of skanks tattoo
on his face and like you look at you go,

317
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:45,860
that's awesome that you want to do that.

318
00:17:45,861 --> 00:17:50,490
But man you maybe you shouldn't have
bunch of other face tattoos though.

319
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,280
It wasn't the first one. True. Who
that? Kobe Bryant. Scroll up a bit.

320
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,890
Look at that. Kobe Bryant. He's
got the tee shirt. His mouth.

321
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,360
Get the fuck Outta here man. That might
as well be a photograph. That's crazy.

322
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,900
Like look at the resolution. Look
at the sweat. If you said to me,

323
00:18:03,901 --> 00:18:07,080
what's the one thing you can't
draw? I'd say black people sweat.

324
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,510
[inaudible] this guy
pulled it off somehow.

325
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,080
If I was drawing that we just
have white drips. Dennis failing.

326
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:22,200
You got like copied. Make that bigger
Jamie. That guy did that with needles man.

327
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,140
That's insane. How good that is. Yes.

328
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,290
Somehow it doesn't seem nearly as
weird to get athletes tattooed on you.

329
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,070
Is it those comedians does for
now? It's still [inaudible].

330
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,620
I'm sure Kobe's running
around going, damn dude,

331
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,320
that's a little different that
these people grow up on. Like,

332
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,510
I mean that's not true dude. Cause I,

333
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:43,020
the connection that people feel with
like comics and podcasts, it's pretty,

334
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,710
I get it. You know, it's like we
don't want the responsibility.

335
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,390
We want to do it, but we
don't want the response.

336
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,280
But I don't want the
responsibility of being your Shin.

337
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:56,040
I 100% want my fucking face tattooed
on people. So anybody out there I will.

338
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,580
I'll give you a free lesions,
gangs, t-shirts. There's the dude.

339
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:05,160
It's a good tattoo. It loves
it says Lou dog. That is crazy.

340
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,570
That's so that is as accurate
as a photograph. That
would suck my fucking face.

341
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,010
That's my face. That's fucking
intense. It's amazing. Yeah.

342
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,060
I don't remember what, that's fine.
I was probably making a point.

343
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,920
[inaudible] whatever it was. You were
right. [inaudible] problem with me, man.

344
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:25,770
You get any one clip of me or my face
and you could make decisions. That's a,

345
00:19:25,771 --> 00:19:28,680
that's an incredible, ted says the
first time Joe saw always butthole.

346
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,960
There's no way I can remember
that far back. I think fun.

347
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,920
I think always said so many times.

348
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,720
I think he's in process of
getting his butthole fixed.

349
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,190
Is he going to get surgery? He's
been bleeding since I've known him.

350
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,850
It's bizarre that he just lives life like
that. That was shut. That's a problem.

351
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,490
That would shut me off from
going out to the world. What,

352
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:52,440
what causes those things? Hemorrhoids.
What causes hemorrhoids? Hemorrhoids.

353
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,860
Working out. Cause I wasn't breathing
when I was lifting weights and I was just

354
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,550
clenching, just clenching my butt hole.

355
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,940
And it just popped out like
squeezing a balloon animal.

356
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:07,830
You made blisters inside your butthole.
Wheezing it together for a while. Well,

357
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:11,280
this is actually how we got introduced
to Ari's butthole was I was complaining

358
00:20:11,281 --> 00:20:13,920
about me having hemorrhoids
and I'm leaving to skanks.

359
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,350
We opened up my butthole to show
them. I showed all the guys did it.

360
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,810
We didn't call open up. We said, that's
not a ham roll. And we're like, what ax?

361
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:30,420
You call that a hemorrhoid. Oh,
that's step aside. Little ladies,

362
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:34,530
let me show you a hemorrhoid. And it was
like, no, it was like the uh, you know,

363
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,530
and stranger things. The fucking
monster, the way the face opens up,

364
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,630
that's what all always asshole does.
Looks like Yammer. Simpson's mouth. Yeah.

365
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,870
Remember like the blade, remember
the blade vampire mouse. Predator.

366
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,383
Predator.

367
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:52,900
It's baggy but it just cause it
opens a lot the way it opens.

368
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:55,580
How does he get away with what he gets
away with? Dude? He like, he keeps,

369
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,700
he keeps tissues in his
asshole at all times.

370
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,360
And if you're with Ari at one point he
might just throw a bloody tissue at you.

371
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,680
If it got to, I get, I get staying
away from the doctors, I get it.

372
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,650
But if you're actively
bleeding out of your asshole,

373
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:12,400
I'd be on an operating table
face down, click quick.

374
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,730
I think it's a real pain in
the ass to get the surgery.

375
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,720
I liked it and dealing with it as is.

376
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,230
You don't know yet. But I mean it's, I'm
glad he's going to get it fixed though.

377
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,060
It's troublesome. When your friend says,

378
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,960
how many times did that guy send you
a picture of bloody toilet paper?

379
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:35,290
I've seen way too much, way too much

380
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:40,210
[inaudible] people. The height
up thing to me is that, uh,

381
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:45,690
Ari historically is just crushed ass
like hot chicks walking around with the

382
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:50,410
confidence guy. He's confident walking
around with Napkins, weirdly handsome.

383
00:21:50,411 --> 00:21:51,670
Like you don't think you'd
see me? Like, all right,

384
00:21:51,671 --> 00:21:55,440
that's a fucking goofy camel
face. Fucking asshole. Yeah,

385
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,100
but then you look at him again.

386
00:21:57,101 --> 00:22:00,910
He kinda has dreamy eyes dreaming and
he's in good shape. I don't know, man.

387
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:04,900
He got in good shape for sober
October. He's a fucking animal.

388
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,000
I knew that he was going
to be a real problem.

389
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,880
He was trying to win that God damn
thing. That's not right there, dude.

390
00:22:09,881 --> 00:22:13,140
You can't fucking have a athletic
competition with all of your add a shape,

391
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:17,350
fat friends. It's not fair. But

392
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:22,990
they were willing to do it. I'm like,
okay, good luck. I'm like, look,

393
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:26,380
we're gonna, we're gonna work out seven
days, seven days, six hours a day.

394
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:31,540
We're going to have to do that. We're
gonna see who drops. This is not smart,

395
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,580
but I understand it because they're sober.
Ari came the closest, arguing close.

396
00:22:36,581 --> 00:22:39,220
He got close. He went
hard. He went fucking hard.

397
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,290
If Ra was in shape going into it,

398
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,210
he would probably would've at least
what's gotten a lot worse? Winning.

399
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,510
Millie, how do you win? Do you
have this? Uh, this is last year.

400
00:22:49,511 --> 00:22:52,450
Last year was the only time we met at a
competition and I think it's better off

401
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:53,980
not being a competition. Honestly.

402
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,390
I think the first year we had to
do 15 yoga classes over the month,

403
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:03,340
1590 minute hot yoga classes, which
is annoying. Yeah, it's annoying.

404
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,120
Like you don't want to do it, but you
have to do it. Like can you get in there?

405
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,070
All right, number seven, like,

406
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,160
and you're starting to think
how many more days are there?

407
00:23:10,161 --> 00:23:12,610
I'm going to have to do a bunch of work.
I want up having to do nine in a row.

408
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,220
So I did yoga nine fucking days in a row,

409
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,440
but it would know it was no competition,

410
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,740
but we just had a requirement and
everybody met the requirement.

411
00:23:20,741 --> 00:23:22,750
We felt good that we
accomplished the goal together.

412
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:26,840
But then everybody started talking
crazy. They wanted to do a competition.

413
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:31,560
And Tom was like, yeah, let's wear these
a heart rate monitors. I'm like, okay,

414
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:36,430
all right, we're all gonna
die. So what was, how did you,

415
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,140
how would it Ari of one,

416
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:43,141
like what was the point system it
based on 80% of your heart rate,

417
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,070
right? So your [inaudible],
it finds your Max heart

418
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:51,070
rate and then you know 80% of that gets
you x amount of points and 90% of that

419
00:23:52,611 --> 00:23:56,440
gets you y amount of points. I forget
what it is over a course of time. Yeah,

420
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:00,530
but you can't really maintain
90% 90% is like the sprints.

421
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,360
The real smart move is a
stay at 80 and go longterm.

422
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,770
So we were doing these cardio workouts.

423
00:24:06,771 --> 00:24:10,280
It's all just in your head
cause it's not hard to do.

424
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:13,460
It's not hard to do an elliptical
machine. It's an easy motion.

425
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,910
So it's all in your head and all you
do is you wear this fucking heart rate

426
00:24:16,911 --> 00:24:17,271
monitor.

427
00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:21,320
And what I did is I watched the murder
scene from John Wick where it goes into

428
00:24:21,321 --> 00:24:23,140
the Russian bathhouse and over again.

429
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,950
I'm on a loop for five hours and I just
stayed on the fucking elliptical machine

430
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:31,790
for five hours watching that scene and
I get to the end of that and I'd rewind

431
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:36,410
it and I'd watch it. I'd be
like, ah, music fucked up.

432
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:40,580
And I just, I did it for fucking
six, six hours a day, seven hours,

433
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,570
six hours a day. That's psychotic
while we were having a competition.

434
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:50,450
[inaudible] it's probably not healthy
to work, but it's not helpful.

435
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,440
Like [inaudible] we were competing.
Yeah, we know we're going to hell.

436
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,230
We're going to hell. I'm like, we're
going to hell. There's no way. Bert,

437
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,130
Bert Kreischer was the one
who talked the most shit.

438
00:25:01,131 --> 00:25:04,310
So I would think about him while I
was getting tired and I was like,

439
00:25:04,311 --> 00:25:08,330
there's no way bitch. There's no way
you're going to die. We're all gonna die.

440
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:11,870
Let's just go. We're going
to go til there's no sleep.

441
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:16,070
Is there an advantage to starting off
being like one of the fattest guys because

442
00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:18,100
you kind of lose more
instead of, no, no, no.

443
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,060
Your body's going to have
a hard time recovering.

444
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,420
80% of your max heart rate is different
than 80% of my max heart rate.

445
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:26,250
So technically I don't have to
work as hard as you, you know,

446
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,580
you'd have to run on, you
know, seven on a treadmill.

447
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,880
I could run at a 4.5 but no, I think
it's based on your age as well.

448
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,100
So the Max heart rate is different.

449
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:38,210
So it might actually be easier
because it's just used to doing it.

450
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,310
It's all about your body being
used to doing. If you're using,

451
00:25:41,311 --> 00:25:45,380
you're looking out [inaudible] percent
is only like 140 beats a minute,

452
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,440
you know, or maybe a little bit
more like one 46 beats per minute.

453
00:25:48,441 --> 00:25:52,320
That's not that bad. Like you can kind
of do that for a long time. He goes,

454
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,380
sh what's like,

455
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:58,310
she just watched something that's engaging
and make sure you keep breathing at

456
00:25:58,311 --> 00:26:01,790
that rate and you get, you get
trapped in whatever you're watching.

457
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:04,010
And for me it was fights
too. That was a big one.

458
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,840
I just put on some great fights.

459
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:09,770
So I got a TV right in front of me and
I'm on this fucking elliptical machine

460
00:26:09,771 --> 00:26:14,720
watching fights and I would drink gigantic
jugs of water with Himalayan salt and

461
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:19,630
all these different hydrators right up.
No, to keep your hydrated [inaudible].

462
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:23,580
Okay. I see that sweet,
sweet, delicious water.

463
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:27,400
I sweat so much that I set
off the fire alarm. What?

464
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:32,090
I filled the room up with so much
steam that the fire alarm went off.

465
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:37,160
I filmed it good. I put it
on youtube or on Instagram,

466
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,830
but it was ridiculous.
If you make me so mad,

467
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:42,930
Dave's never worked out a day
in his fucking life. He's just,

468
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,310
there's gotta be a few.

469
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:49,710
They look, yeah, he looks good. He's
handsome. My point was, Ari got close.

470
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:53,070
He got close to me. He wasn't even
working out. That's how crazy Ari is.

471
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:56,190
And then you have to deal with the fact
that you're doing this publicly and you

472
00:26:56,191 --> 00:26:59,850
can't allow already to beat you with
this thing. I was in normal hour, Burt,

473
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,210
if our he beat me, I would have said
Mao, man, I would've, I would've said,

474
00:27:03,211 --> 00:27:05,430
wow man, that is really,
really impressive.

475
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:10,440
But there was no fucking way
[inaudible] Tom, if Tom beat me,

476
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:14,670
I'd be like, dude, you did it man. Wow.
I wish I won. But you won Burt. No Way.

477
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,520
There's no way we're going
to hell. You just leave.

478
00:27:17,521 --> 00:27:20,490
We never hear from your
again. Go into the darklands.

479
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,500
I'm wearing that monitor
on me all day long.

480
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,890
I'm just going to be lifting weights
everywhere I go far back was Burton the

481
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:30,810
stairs? He's barely
working out talking shit.

482
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:36,310
What did he do? Was it a marathon he
ran or something? Half Marathon. No, no.

483
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,050
He ran a full marathon and he ran. It
was pretty impressive. It's insane.

484
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:44,160
Burt's tough. All bullshit aside like
Burt talks, tremendous amounts of shit.

485
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:46,410
That's why I didn't want to
lose to him, but person tough.

486
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,590
I think you also talked shit to sort
of set the expectation for himself too.

487
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,700
Cause he says it,

488
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,250
he's going to fucking have to stick
to it because it's a very loose thing.

489
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,350
That's made it [inaudible].
We always talk about,

490
00:27:55,351 --> 00:27:59,580
he speaks very declarative about things
and I'm like, why do you do that?

491
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:00,960
Hold myself to that standard.

492
00:28:00,961 --> 00:28:04,080
If I say I'm going to lose weight publicly
and then I don't ever want to call me

493
00:28:04,081 --> 00:28:07,560
a fucking phony, and if I,
if I keep it in my head,

494
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:11,010
I probably will be more likely to
skip the gym or whatever else it is.

495
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:15,180
That's really wise. That's really wise.
That's a good strategy. If you fail,

496
00:28:15,181 --> 00:28:16,740
it works for better podcasting.

497
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:21,540
He's also true public acknowledgement
of your failings when it comes to like

498
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:23,910
little goals that you set up for you.
It's like lets everybody know, hey man,

499
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:26,460
this is not easy to do
comics and he, I dude,

500
00:28:26,461 --> 00:28:29,610
we live in a social media generation.
It's all like, you need that.

501
00:28:29,611 --> 00:28:31,350
I need people to tell me,
dude, you're losing weight.

502
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:33,780
And when they stopped telling me that I
get fat again and then they're like, oh,

503
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:36,300
you're getting fat. And then I start
losing weight again. I, and I'm,

504
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,740
it's almost that the attention
is sort of what motivates me.

505
00:28:40,741 --> 00:28:44,250
I need something beyond
just being [inaudible].

506
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:48,960
How much time have you spent researching
different methods of losing weight and

507
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:52,140
how much you looked into intermittent
fasting? I've done in a minute. It did.

508
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,090
I've done, I've been assessed
try that. I've never,

509
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,360
I still don't fully
understand what it is. Simple.

510
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:00,540
You just have a small feeding
window like a, for me,

511
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:04,650
I like to fast f I feel at
my best on fasting 14 hours.

512
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,930
So what I'll do is, you know,

513
00:29:06,931 --> 00:29:10,860
if I eat at 8:00 PM then I eat at 10:00
AM the next day. It's not that hard.

514
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,770
I was doing 12:00 PM to
7:00 PM I was eating,

515
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,590
I could eat from 12:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Um,

516
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,030
but I wasn't really eating healthy
things. What I was doing, I

517
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,970
[inaudible] thing I was eating shitty.

518
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:26,700
What I'm better at is if I
just cut out most of the carbs,

519
00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:27,810
I eat fruit and shit like that.

520
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:31,170
But if I cut out all the carbs in the
burgers and the fucking bread and the

521
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:34,650
pasta and the rice, I can manage
that because I can get creative.

522
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,990
And if I'm the mood for pizza,
I can figure out a, you know,

523
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:40,350
a low carb version of pizza, you know,
Callie fire across or whatever it is.

524
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,460
Gay. Yeah. You know what?

525
00:29:42,461 --> 00:29:44,230
You should just come to you
that it's really delicious.

526
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,230
Do all those things but also
lift weights. Yeah. I have been,

527
00:29:47,231 --> 00:29:49,840
I just started again like two
weeks ago. That's a big one.

528
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,480
But lifting weights is huge.
It burns a shit ton of cowers.

529
00:29:52,481 --> 00:29:53,141
And more importantly,

530
00:29:53,141 --> 00:29:56,860
when your body has more muscle than your
body burns more calories so you can eat

531
00:29:56,861 --> 00:30:00,790
the same amount of food and you lose
weight, you could do all that. Or Louis,

532
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:04,740
I know you just fist fight a
comedian. [inaudible] lose weight,

533
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:08,770
you'll lose body fat. Joe, you eat
like tons of meat. I eat a lot of meat.

534
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:12,850
Do you ever get, have you gotten
gout, uh, stuff ever gouts from meat.

535
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,640
Isn't that like a wine disease? What
do you get gout from? A lot of meat,

536
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:21,850
meat and beer on your feet and your
toe. It hits your fucking right big toe.

537
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:25,540
It sucks. I'm sitting in a chair for
too long and eating too much meat.

538
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,600
I think it's all those things. Your
heel too. Doesn't it? Fuck your heels.

539
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,351
Maybe. I don't know.

540
00:30:29,351 --> 00:30:33,790
I haven't tried it hit it hit twice ever
and my toe was awful. But you had gout.

541
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,540
Yeah, but that was like, and by
the way it would hurt so much.

542
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,450
When I went to the doctor I was
like, I'll take, cause there's like,

543
00:30:39,451 --> 00:30:42,310
you know you can get medicine for it
every day you take so you don't get it.

544
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:45,190
And I would have absolutely taken that
as how much it hurt and they go, no,

545
00:30:45,191 --> 00:30:48,460
you don't have like a condition. You
know what I mean? Like I think I just,

546
00:30:48,461 --> 00:30:52,360
I went to like a festival of concerts
one weekend and [inaudible] shit.

547
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,820
Gouty definitely shout it
up. Here's the definition.

548
00:30:54,821 --> 00:30:58,060
Gout occurs when you're eight crystals
accumulate and your joint causing

549
00:30:58,061 --> 00:31:01,120
inflammation and intense
pain of a gout attack.

550
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:05,110
Your eight crystals can form when you
have high levels of uric acid in the,

551
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,510
in your blood, your
body produces uric acid.

552
00:31:07,511 --> 00:31:11,590
When it breaks down Purina substances
that are found naturally in your body.

553
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,620
I got his blood that still didn't answer
my question. What's Jane Cause here it,

554
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:18,640
I got people at ease up on
the foods, meat, poultry,

555
00:31:18,641 --> 00:31:23,641
seafood co chemical compounds that are
high amounts and certain foods like meat,

556
00:31:23,921 --> 00:31:28,090
poultry and seafood. That's interesting.
I think you also have to be fat hypo.

557
00:31:28,091 --> 00:31:31,480
Uremia yeah, my friend was not fat.

558
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:37,390
I'm hyper Yersinia it sounds
like something that a fat
person should only get

559
00:31:37,511 --> 00:31:39,730
though. Dude, I lied. I was on
a flight yesterday and I lied

560
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,050
and uh, because we,

561
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,340
we were on the runway for two and a
half hours and I was just getting really

562
00:31:45,341 --> 00:31:46,780
impatient. I was like, I'm fucking hungry.

563
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,780
I mean I made up that I was
hyperglycemic to get food.

564
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,400
I buzzed, busted thing
and they wouldn't come.

565
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:57,600
So eventually I started just like waving
like a mad man. And Mike [inaudible],

566
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,860
who's a friend of ours, a
comic, he was a few rows up.

567
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,590
This is how he knew what was on the plane
cause I was being a lunatic and I was

568
00:32:02,591 --> 00:32:05,440
like, we've been on here
forever. Oh, I'm hypoglycemic.

569
00:32:05,441 --> 00:32:08,200
I need food right now man. I'm
like, don't get me orange juice.

570
00:32:08,201 --> 00:32:11,780
It was the most fucking embarrassing
thing, but here, suck a lemon.

571
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:18,040
Keep getting me two and a half hours.

572
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,710
When you're angry on a plane
that's not going anywhere. It's,

573
00:32:20,711 --> 00:32:23,110
I'm blown away by the amount of rules.

574
00:32:23,111 --> 00:32:26,290
Like when you've been at the gate
for like two hours before, I'm like,

575
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:28,990
can I just go back into the
airport? And they're like,

576
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,010
now like it doesn't make any sense to
you and not like take the flag and like I

577
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:36,000
want to, I'm off. I
think you can be lifted.

578
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,920
Doors closed a big deal if you
want to. That's a big deal.

579
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,500
But as a Puerto Rican, if you do leave
Louis, you have to twerk on your,

580
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:44,950
I don't know if you watch those videos
when people leave playing, they go fine.

581
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,630
Oh fuck. They all used
to work their way out.

582
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,460
You will get put on a list for sure.

583
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:53,000
If your asshole every
time you fly on a plane.

584
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:57,320
Well Lewis already has that
problems. He flew my guessing.

585
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,580
Do you think that they would probably
check you if you decided I want off the

586
00:33:01,581 --> 00:33:05,330
plane right now and if you make a
scene, pull the plane back into.

587
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:08,040
They'd be like this guy,
that's my [inaudible].

588
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:11,270
You don't think you're not gonna
get off unless you make a scene.

589
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,920
You won't get up once
it's away from the gate.

590
00:33:12,921 --> 00:33:15,770
I'm talking about when they stay at the
gate and they never actually pull away

591
00:33:15,771 --> 00:33:20,210
from like the a Yadda plane. You just
hoping everyone can keep it together.

592
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,880
Yeah. Hoping. Just hoping
everyone can keep it together.

593
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:26,670
What's your craziest playing
experience? I hate, I hate flying and,

594
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,160
and I've had plenty of weird ones.

595
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:33,390
Two dudes [inaudible] almost get after
it once on a plane over overhead space.

596
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,160
This one guy was claiming
the space overhead.

597
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:40,920
There's only four or five arguments
you could have on a plane over space.

598
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:45,710
Middle person gets both armrests
this one guy was on this side, right?

599
00:33:45,711 --> 00:33:47,150
But his shit was all filled up,

600
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:51,920
so he opens up the bin on the other
side and puts his bag in and sits down,

601
00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:55,310
and the guy who was behind him,
that was his side. He goes, hey man,

602
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:59,750
that's my storage space. He goes, no,
it's not. He goes, it storage space.

603
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,650
I put my bag in there first I was in, I
was ahead of you. I put my bag in there.

604
00:34:03,651 --> 00:34:07,490
He's like, no, you have yours and
I have mine and yours is full.

605
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,430
And he goes to grab his shit
and the guy goes, hey man,

606
00:34:10,431 --> 00:34:12,590
don't touch my fucking
bag. Right. By the way,

607
00:34:12,591 --> 00:34:15,800
the guy who took the other source
space, you don't have, it's not,

608
00:34:15,801 --> 00:34:18,170
it's not a personalized
source space. Fuck off dude.

609
00:34:18,171 --> 00:34:20,480
It's just storage space on first-class.

610
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,640
I wish one of those degenerate
fucks from the back.

611
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,170
We'll try to put some shit in my storage
space. I flew first class one time.

612
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,170
They almost went after it though.
The, the waitress had to cut them off.

613
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,840
She cut them up. We're
in the air waitress, Joe,

614
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,310
we're in the air and they're going at
it again, so it's like wheat there.

615
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,000
They were going at it
when they were about,

616
00:34:38,001 --> 00:34:41,900
the plane was about to take off and then
they got through it and then the air,

617
00:34:41,901 --> 00:34:45,440
they were going at it again. The waitress,
the stewardess, she cuts them off.

618
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:48,260
Wouldn't let them have alcohol, but
it was tense, so it's like, you know,

619
00:34:48,261 --> 00:34:48,981
you have to keep an eye on.

620
00:34:48,981 --> 00:34:52,490
I was going to say like the whole time
she fell with me, the lady made me,

621
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,190
she's like, you're going to help me
ride. I'm like, Jesus Christ lady.

622
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,750
Anything's going to happen. Well, you
see my girl, right? The woman behind me,

623
00:34:59,751 --> 00:35:03,140
as I was complaining, she was like, and
I was like, I was like, yeah, you know.

624
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,011
He was like, well, what do you want to do?

625
00:35:04,011 --> 00:35:07,160
I was like some orange juice and coffee,
maybe a kind bar. That'd be nice.

626
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,060
He goes, I should like loud
enough for me to, she goes,

627
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,150
just get him some orange juice, and I
went and turned around and was like,

628
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:18,080
mind your this lady. Shut
the fuck up lady. These guys,

629
00:35:18,081 --> 00:35:22,040
those undercover dudes that are on
planes or Marshall's air marshals, right?

630
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,170
So if you're an air Marshall
and you see these two,

631
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,740
two guys getting after a little bit,
just talking shit, grabbing bags,

632
00:35:27,741 --> 00:35:29,300
just shoot them Dickie to each other.

633
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,990
Wendy move in because you don't want
everybody to know you're an air Marshall.

634
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,950
You're like, they don't have a bomb.

635
00:35:33,951 --> 00:35:36,620
You guys gotta work this out like you
fucking pussies are just going to push

636
00:35:36,621 --> 00:35:38,790
each other like you're not. You
know you guys aren't terrorists.

637
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:42,030
What am I doing here? Just a
an architect and a fucking,

638
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:45,290
if somebody wanted to have a fighter
plane and give up their entire fucking,

639
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,650
it's such a pain in the ass.

640
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,440
What did you're going to deal with
to get into a fist fight on a plane?

641
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,930
I don't know how many different
crimes it is. I have to,

642
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:55,230
but they have to pull this fucking
plane over. You are fucked dude.

643
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,740
You have to really want to fight somebody
in order to do that because you'll

644
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:01,340
deal with a lot of shit, but you're
going to get to that point plane.

645
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,780
You're going to like one
Tonomys they arrest you.

646
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:08,040
You saw that lady smack her boyfriend
in the head. The guy gets up,

647
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:10,610
he's trying to leave and she
throws the laptop and yeah,

648
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:13,300
as as he's walking down
the aisle. Yeah. All right.

649
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:16,680
I didn't see who threw a
laptop right there in the air.

650
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,220
This is going to lady's screaming at
their sewing laptop. Yeah. She's like,

651
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:21,000
you ain't shit.

652
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,840
He'll say she's fine if she catch her
boyfriend cheating on the plane or

653
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,560
something like that. Weird.

654
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,840
But she got super loud and it became
like a huge scene where everybody was

655
00:36:30,841 --> 00:36:34,050
listening to her, talking to him. It
was like, oh my God, this is so crazy.

656
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:36,450
I mean, when they were dragging
the Asian guy out of the planes,

657
00:36:36,451 --> 00:36:40,170
one of the funniest videos of
all time, I wanted to go home.

658
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:44,370
He just wanted to go. He started chanting,
I want to go home, but it was so sad.

659
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,830
They would legitimately have to drag
me out if they were trying to get me to

660
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:51,420
give up my seat, they would have to drag
me out of the plane. They can do that.

661
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,800
Imagine thinking they could do that.

662
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:56,610
We just got to grab you physically and
take you off the show. Like come on,

663
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,950
you're you're, you're on the plane.
The plane's about to take off.

664
00:36:58,951 --> 00:37:03,951
We're going to grab you and just pull
you out of there and [inaudible] I think

665
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,700
they probably just settled with them.

666
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,310
They probably just gave him a ton
of money and said shut the fuck up.

667
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,690
Because at what point it is your price.

668
00:37:09,691 --> 00:37:12,180
Find out what type of business
they do have security.

669
00:37:12,181 --> 00:37:14,310
I mean what point does somebody
wants to leave your private business?

670
00:37:14,311 --> 00:37:15,700
I'm sure it's within the, the,

671
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:19,350
the contract that you fucking the terms
of service for the ticket that they can

672
00:37:19,351 --> 00:37:22,710
do that. So you think so where
the guy's already sitting down?

673
00:37:22,711 --> 00:37:26,280
Well he's saying no after they
asked him to leave a lot of times,

674
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,930
so I don't know what the law is.

675
00:37:27,931 --> 00:37:30,720
I mean if it's his ticket
and he bought the ticket,

676
00:37:30,721 --> 00:37:34,710
you can just decide if you've got times
of service. So ridiculous. Exactly.

677
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:37,140
You're right Logan saying it's
a terms of service. Dumb line.

678
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:39,000
They can do anything they
want. Anything they want.

679
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:42,870
Well what happened is they got
destroyed on social media for like weeks

680
00:37:42,871 --> 00:37:46,230
afterward and they apologized and we're
like, we're changing our policy and

681
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,580
[inaudible] don't even
get me fucking started.

682
00:37:50,581 --> 00:37:54,570
Joe Starbucks or American Airlines says
officially thank God that guy wasn't

683
00:37:54,571 --> 00:37:57,930
black. I fucking,

684
00:37:57,931 --> 00:38:01,800
I live in Harlem and the Starbucks in
Harlem. I mean it looks like a bus depot.

685
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,881
It's crazy.

686
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:06,060
It's just lines of people just sitting
there charging their cell phones,

687
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:09,970
not ordering because they had their
new policy is everyone that walks into

688
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,620
customer, their customer says,

689
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:16,680
what's the fucking all it happened
because of one bad PR Philly,

690
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:17,581
Philly.

691
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:21,500
When these two black dudes would just
trying to sit down and chill out at,

692
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,850
at Starbucks and someone decided to
remove them from the premises. Yeah,

693
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,730
but look now take

694
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:31,740
[inaudible] cause here's what happened.

695
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:36,190
I know that you have opinions on all
I'm saying, the Libertarian perspective,

696
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,470
they might've been Dick.
Starbucks might've been Dick's,

697
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,700
but what I know is they, they asked
them to leave. They called the cops.

698
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:43,990
The cops weren't going to arrest them.

699
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:48,991
The cops told them you have to leave
and they still refuse to leave and then

700
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:50,380
they didn't. Then they let them go.

701
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,530
They literally just cuffed him and took
him to the station and they were like,

702
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,240
we'll just charge him with any,
they also tried to order four loco,

703
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:59,890
so they were out. But here's what I know.

704
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,800
I know that we don't know what happened.
Yes, no, I agree with that completely.

705
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:04,360
You don't know. It was
a human interaction.

706
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:07,030
You don't know who the con was
there. It could've been them.

707
00:39:07,031 --> 00:39:09,330
It could've been the person worked.
I know what fucking happened,

708
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:12,640
but I know exactly what happened. Things
happened. These two guys walked in,

709
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:15,130
they didn't buy anything. They were like,
Oh yeah, you guys gotta buy something.

710
00:39:15,131 --> 00:39:17,220
They were like, no, we don't. They're
like, well, you got to leave that.

711
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:18,640
And they're like, no, we
don't. And it was just weird.

712
00:39:18,641 --> 00:39:22,030
A little Mexican standoff between a
fucking dumb idiot Starbucks employee and

713
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:24,130
two dummy days. It wouldn't leave
a Starbucks. Well, here's the deal.

714
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,430
Here's the screening was around Mexican
standoff between blacks and some

715
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:28,264
Chinese.

716
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,010
Do you think that the influx of homeless
people is bad for their business?

717
00:39:33,011 --> 00:39:35,980
Do you think it's hurting business
at all? Absolutely. I mean,

718
00:39:35,981 --> 00:39:39,880
I imagine like that one
move from that one store,

719
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:44,500
if the wings of the butterfly from that
one little incident creates like a a dip

720
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,000
in the value of the company.

721
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:48,910
I feel like people wouldn't want to hang
out there as long and you probably buy

722
00:39:48,911 --> 00:39:50,590
more shit if you like stay there.

723
00:39:50,591 --> 00:39:53,200
There's probably people who go up
online a couple times if they're there,

724
00:39:53,201 --> 00:39:53,870
you know? Right,

725
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:56,500
and you don't want to write your script
on your laptop while a guy shitting his

726
00:39:56,501 --> 00:39:59,950
pants next to you. I know we're
four morons, but let's solve this.

727
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,030
Like why are there,

728
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:03,400
why are there so many homeless
people and what could be done?

729
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,040
I think that's a real tough area.

730
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:09,050
That's like the thing that they used to
do is just institutionalize them. Right.

731
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:12,100
Just fucking grab them and throw them
and there's some problems with that for

732
00:40:12,101 --> 00:40:16,390
sure. But who decides who's worthy of
being institutionalized and you know,

733
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:20,080
we get hunt them at night,
like Nutria at night.

734
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:23,300
Here's there. They just go around
with the thinking of the shooting.

735
00:40:23,301 --> 00:40:28,140
I didn't tell you that
on his show. [inaudible]

736
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:32,410
you wouldn't do trio hunting. Yeah,
it's bad out here man in New York.

737
00:40:32,411 --> 00:40:36,100
But you guys got real bad here. You
ain't seen shit until you go downtown.

738
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:40,480
Downtown la makes everything. If
post up pass every underpass in La,

739
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:44,740
now you're, you're subject to see
tents. They're all over the place.

740
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:45,760
All over through the valley.

741
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:49,750
Homeless people in La and New York are
pretty friendly though. They're not,

742
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,760
they're not that aggressive.
I was in Seattle.

743
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:55,000
Those fuckers who will come up
to you and they will go at you.

744
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,670
They want like [inaudible]
give them money.

745
00:40:57,671 --> 00:41:00,880
They will like give you an attitude
about it everywhere else too.

746
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:04,870
Like a Cleveland horrible homeless,
like every other city besides San Fran,

747
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,470
like yeah. Really. It's
like the aggressive shit.

748
00:41:08,471 --> 00:41:12,100
The Canadian homeless are the shittiest
and most aggressive where a kid,

749
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,640
what not. Like this was around
when we, when we were kids,

750
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:19,210
you would see those boxes on the side of
the road and it was usually someone who

751
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:21,980
is so fucked up that you know, they,

752
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,900
they just couldn't go anywhere and
they'd have a box and they used,

753
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,560
smelled like shit and
they were covered up.

754
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:29,790
But we're seeing like different
levels. You grow up suburban. Yeah.

755
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:33,260
[inaudible] I grew up in Brooklyn.
I saw homeless people all the time,

756
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,780
but I never saw anything and
I haven't seen it in person,

757
00:41:35,781 --> 00:41:38,720
but I've never seen anything like
the camps and stuff that I've seen.

758
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:42,470
That's insane. Yeah. That's the
new thing. Yeah, that's what's new.

759
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:44,030
It's like the underpasses too. When I,

760
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:47,240
when I first started coming here in
94 there was never any tents on the

761
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:49,580
underpasses, at least I
don't remember that being,

762
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:52,610
I think now there's like almost
some people think it's cool.

763
00:41:52,611 --> 00:41:53,600
I live in east village,

764
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:58,280
New York and there is so many
just kids that you're like,

765
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,940
you're a phone call away from
like solving this problem.

766
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:05,080
You kind of want to be out
here like that. [inaudible]

767
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:08,360
just like there. It's literally
like some the heroin kids,

768
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:10,370
they all like punk rockers, 20 year old,

769
00:42:10,371 --> 00:42:14,160
19 year old white kids who are
clearly on out just like 20 though.

770
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:17,900
[inaudible] that's what I'm saying.
Big Kids. They're a fomo bustle. I bet.

771
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,100
I bet you those kids are from really,

772
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:22,070
really fucked up situations at
home and around the drugs and some,

773
00:42:22,071 --> 00:42:24,980
I think more often than not
they're probably dealing
with the fucked up shit at

774
00:42:24,981 --> 00:42:29,120
home. You don't end up on the streets
to to you know, rebel against your mom.

775
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,140
You're good. Mom and dad,

776
00:42:30,141 --> 00:42:33,680
most of the time I'm sure it happened
also watching a guy like you know who just

777
00:42:33,681 --> 00:42:37,610
looks like a as Crotty is homeless can
be like charging his phone on one of

778
00:42:37,611 --> 00:42:40,170
those stations is pretty
flick. Everyone just doesn't,

779
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,940
where's your address for
bill? Yeah. How is this?

780
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,900
Do you have that too? Yeah.

781
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,200
Who's billing has Verizon get you the
bill every month, prepaid phones anymore.

782
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:55,190
[inaudible] New York is on every corner
now. They have like a big station,

783
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,680
right? And on that station you
could do literally free phone calls.

784
00:42:57,681 --> 00:43:00,200
You could just dial a number.
It's a speaker phone, phone call.

785
00:43:00,201 --> 00:43:03,380
You could charge your phone
and it has like a Wifi station.

786
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:05,810
So everyone on the street has
wifi in New York and you're like,

787
00:43:05,811 --> 00:43:07,520
this is a great idea.

788
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:11,630
Except now there's always a homeless
person literally plugged into it.

789
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:14,210
And that's now their power source
for their little homeless thing.

790
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:19,250
They were jerking off outside. They had
to take the screens off the screens off.

791
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:23,270
There was about a week after they came
out where you'd see regular people using

792
00:43:23,271 --> 00:43:27,110
them and now it's only homeless
people like nobody else touches them.

793
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:33,310
If you had a look at a graph of all the
crimes that were committed using burner

794
00:43:33,801 --> 00:43:37,010
phones, like seven 11 burner phones,

795
00:43:37,011 --> 00:43:41,520
like how many seven 11 burner phones
are used by poor people and how many of

796
00:43:41,521 --> 00:43:46,521
them are used to commit crimes like
serious espionage between like Liz

797
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:50,630
[inaudible], international spies,

798
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:55,670
fucking giant international crime tool
that goes unreported burner phones like

799
00:43:55,881 --> 00:43:59,330
seven 11 burner phones. We get it.
It's in the plastic. You pop it open,

800
00:43:59,331 --> 00:44:02,630
it's got an hour in it. Fuck.

801
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:07,190
Who the fuck is using those things? Some
of them are poor people. It's getting,

802
00:44:07,191 --> 00:44:09,620
I think it's getting more and
more exclusively criminal.

803
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,350
Even pulls like leaving their planes.
Just like leaving an airplane.

804
00:44:12,351 --> 00:44:14,620
If you buy a seven 11 phone,
you're on a list. Well,

805
00:44:14,621 --> 00:44:18,590
you could go to like Verizon and get
a bottom of the line phone that's

806
00:44:18,591 --> 00:44:22,100
affordable. That's better than anything
that existed like five years ago.

807
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:25,820
Like where technology is now. You don't
have to spend like, what's a cheap,

808
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:27,950
what's a cheap android phone?

809
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:30,560
If you were going to [inaudible]
at your pcs right now,

810
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:34,620
get a free android phone sign up
for $40. Right? And then you're out,

811
00:44:34,621 --> 00:44:37,200
you're out the door and then you never
have to pay it again because it's

812
00:44:37,201 --> 00:44:41,040
prepaid. Yeah. So you just have a certain
amount of minutes, right? Well no,

813
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:45,990
it's unlimited. I have, I have metro
pcs guys and I uh, if you're homeless,

814
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,950
you make fun of me. Do you have
the general insurance to you?

815
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:53,940
Just do everything. It's a phone
call. So as online rights online,

816
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:56,880
I get everything unlimited fuck off.

817
00:44:56,881 --> 00:44:59,910
I don't understand why I would ever switch
besides for the fact that my friends

818
00:44:59,911 --> 00:45:03,420
make fun of me. I'll sell your phone
works in places. It works everywhere.

819
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,350
You're doing some sort of a roaming
thing, I guess. No, there's no roaming.

820
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,020
There's no overture over, just
nothing. It's just better. There's,

821
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,140
it really sounds like we're
doing a fucking ad read of
parametric pts right now.

822
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:14,880
It's one of the UFC sponsors.

823
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,650
But people make fun of you like your
hot garbage and then not tell people

824
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:22,950
the truth. Cause you
screenshot everything.

825
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:26,520
Anytime I screened some shots on that.
It says Metro pcs in the corner. Tampons,

826
00:45:26,521 --> 00:45:31,420
pictures, Instagram, scratch down. Put
boost mobile makes it that much better.

827
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,740
Mobile. Even if they're great, they're
embarrassing. Oh yeah. Right. Yeah.

828
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:37,860
Even if they're great. It's
embarrassing that it's great.

829
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:42,630
Like I think Hyundai has a problem with
these new cars that they're making.

830
00:45:42,631 --> 00:45:44,490
So they started calling them the genesis.

831
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:46,830
They started calling them
Hyundai's cause people are like no,

832
00:45:46,831 --> 00:45:50,100
no Hyundai Hyundai's that car that costs,
it's real cheap but it runs forever.

833
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,740
That's a Hyundai. There's no, no,
no Hyundai's luxury. We've got this,

834
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:56,510
lighten that up. Nope. Nope. Can't
have both. Yeah, they got handed. Yeah.

835
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,640
Make sure pcs, even if it's the best
service, you know like the, the,

836
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:03,480
the problem is like anytime
anything is a bargain,

837
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:07,590
even if it really is a great deal and
metro pcs seems like a great deal. It is.

838
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:11,040
It does. Anytime with things that
bargain, people don't want it.

839
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:13,740
Like some people want the shit that
costs a lot and it's hard to get.

840
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,450
And when I was a kid, I remember I would,

841
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,440
I just wouldn't get sneakers that
weren't like Nike's or like, yeah,

842
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:22,890
it even for they were
comfortable sneakers. Even
if they were more expensive.

843
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,910
Yeah. It didn't matter. This kind of
like a loser. I felt the fucking idiot.

844
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:29,160
You got home every day like a rebel.

845
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:34,050
If you want Adidas Grocery store
sneakers, I don't give a shit now.

846
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,810
It's funny how important it
is when you're younger though.

847
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:41,870
It's very important because anything that
could get you just ridiculed when you

848
00:46:42,061 --> 00:46:45,810
were young you had to be always conscious
of like you had to always be aware of

849
00:46:45,811 --> 00:46:47,130
what could fuck up your day.

850
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:50,730
There's not enough of a
delineation between shitty
stuff and like the mid range

851
00:46:50,731 --> 00:46:51,090
stuff,

852
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:54,270
but I think like high end stuff tends
to be like better quality and stuff.

853
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,650
She's always shown that with clothing
and stuff or like my ex wife I remember

854
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:00,810
always was talking about per
how much you spend on a purse,

855
00:47:00,811 --> 00:47:02,610
which I said is ridiculous
and she goes put,

856
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:05,850
it lasts forever and to some degree I
still think it's ridiculous to do that.

857
00:47:05,851 --> 00:47:08,940
For a purse, but my point is paying
for the quality like does last longer.

858
00:47:08,941 --> 00:47:10,920
It's better things are made better Smith.

859
00:47:10,921 --> 00:47:15,921
But the difference between like a knock
off fucking Louis Vuitton bag and like a

860
00:47:16,621 --> 00:47:18,910
bag you'd buy in like a store.
It's like not much difference.

861
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,580
It's not like a fake Ferrari.

862
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,580
There's a huge difference
between those bags I think.

863
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,110
I don't remember seeing a thing. My Dad,

864
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:30,040
my dad used to base it in the
fashion moms are like the stitching.

865
00:47:30,041 --> 00:47:32,260
I mean like I did a check,
it was a fashion check. Yeah,

866
00:47:32,261 --> 00:47:36,130
there's definitely a huge difference in
those bags. Yeah. Yeah. I'm agreeing.

867
00:47:36,131 --> 00:47:37,870
I said, but like high end and I'm saying,

868
00:47:37,871 --> 00:47:41,500
but I'm just saying the difference
between like this one you'd buy it like JC

869
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,150
penny versus like a shitty
one you'd buy on the street.

870
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:46,450
There's not much difference in quality
in that you might as well as buy the fake

871
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,740
Louis Vuitton if you are a kid and
you didn't have like a good name brand

872
00:47:50,741 --> 00:47:55,690
sneaker, you were shamed Bobos
yeah, they call them the Bobo.

873
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,210
I Voight's. I remember when
I was in the sixth grade,

874
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,450
they were voids and there was, that
was the last shitty sneaker I ever had.

875
00:48:01,451 --> 00:48:05,590
It was just vo I t got them at
ch warns, which was this, I mean,

876
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:09,610
as Shitty of a department store as you
could possibly get and a kids would just

877
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,260
make fun of your shitty sneakers.
It was terrible. I had lottos.

878
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:17,470
I had lottos that had velcro on the side
that you could change the lotto symbol.

879
00:48:17,471 --> 00:48:20,230
Different colors, like a
fat fucking cheerleader.

880
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,770
I was dressed like a cheerleader. The
change, the cohorts go my school spirit.

881
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:28,960
If you are, if you are like a runner,
maybe get away with new balance.

882
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,990
Yeah. There were people wore new
balance when I was in high school.

883
00:48:31,991 --> 00:48:35,130
I feel like that was like, okay,
it's okay. You're alternative you,

884
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,090
it's a good quality shoe. Okay.

885
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,360
Marvin Hagler used to wear
them like at a six gels.

886
00:48:40,361 --> 00:48:44,490
People thought you had an arch problem
or you were a wrestler. [inaudible] he's,

887
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:48,580
Oh yeah. 86 wrestling shoes. By
the time high school came around,

888
00:48:48,581 --> 00:48:52,720
I knew I knew well enough
to just change my style,

889
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,630
so I'd saw her on like air walks
and like those shitty like skaters.

890
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:59,060
They were like 45 bucks a pop. Good
move. Yeah. That was very smarter.

891
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:03,940
So it was a big Genco Jean Guy. Converse,
chucks never went out of style. Right.

892
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:07,390
They never went out of style. Also
never been comfortable. Loved them.

893
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:10,440
You think they're comfortable? I have
them, but I like, they're not comfortable.

894
00:49:10,441 --> 00:49:14,620
I don't want smooshy. I don't like
smooshy shoes that much. Sometimes I do,

895
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:17,590
but most of the times I like it where
it's very, it's very little rubber.

896
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,281
That's all it is.

897
00:49:18,281 --> 00:49:21,160
It's like you may imagine that those
guys played basketball and those things

898
00:49:21,161 --> 00:49:23,200
back in the day. It's kind
of crazy. Yeah, that's weird.

899
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,610
It seemed like a lot of support,

900
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:27,760
but maybe that's that they had
stronger ankles that way or something.

901
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:30,430
My mom tried to convince me that
Chuck's were cool and she was right.

902
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:33,640
This was when I was in the sixth
grade. Oh, they weren't? It wasn't. No.

903
00:49:33,641 --> 00:49:38,380
This was when Chuck's had the, you know,
Congress was at the absolute bottom.

904
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:41,230
They fucking, there's not that happened.
Here's the thing, it's cool again,

905
00:49:41,231 --> 00:49:44,200
but it's not, I think I feel
like Chuck Taylor, 27 bucks.

906
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:47,890
I feel like Chuck Taylors were
always in style. A little converse.

907
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:51,010
Like just as a general brown. If you
had to just converse sneakers, dude,

908
00:49:51,011 --> 00:49:53,450
you look like a jerk off quicker.

909
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,690
You're definitely your
family better be Porsche.

910
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:59,650
I have other problems like with your pants
and shirt before we even get to those

911
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:03,850
[inaudible] sneakers if you're
wearing [inaudible] time,

912
00:50:03,851 --> 00:50:06,200
but that period of time is
gone. Right? They, they,

913
00:50:06,201 --> 00:50:10,690
they have the dope leather and Suede
ones. They have all kinds of different,

914
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,950
what's that guy that now it's
like the look now it's like the,

915
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:15,460
so if someone makes feel us back somehow.

916
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:20,470
Tongue feelers in the back for kids.
Yeah. Like for kids is their one,

917
00:50:20,471 --> 00:50:23,800
we don't know. We're so out of the loop,
but is there one brand that's like,

918
00:50:23,801 --> 00:50:28,250
is it still Nike? Like what is Nike
and Jordan? My daughter is 17 so yeah,

919
00:50:28,251 --> 00:50:32,540
that's still still, yeah. Yeah. Nike
is my cake timberlands. My kid has,

920
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:33,853
sure. Yeah. If it's,

921
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:37,610
if it's boots at the timberline gotta
be like the most successful sneaker

922
00:50:37,611 --> 00:50:40,520
campaign in the history of the known
university. Yeah. Without a doubt.

923
00:50:40,521 --> 00:50:43,760
There's nothing that has
the kind of cache as Jordan.

924
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:47,360
The only thing I'd say maybe probably
that sells more than the Jordan is the Air

925
00:50:47,361 --> 00:50:51,500
Force One. But their per unit cheaper
though, right? That's no. Michael Jordan,

926
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:55,940
Nike, Nike Air Force
One. I think of him now.

927
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:59,840
Now the air force ones are the
bottlers at their basic. Yeah.

928
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:03,670
Doesn't the Air Force One have a dude
flying through the air? Duncan? No,

929
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:08,360
that's just the Jordans. I'm so white.
Nike's are fucking uncomfortable.

930
00:51:08,361 --> 00:51:10,400
Every time I wear Nike, they hurt my feet.

931
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:14,960
Like a feat to Vegas to Vegas
statement. These are uh, what are these?

932
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,930
You're in the skate shoes, right?
Minimalist sort of. Yeah. There we go.

933
00:51:17,931 --> 00:51:21,350
So the flexible, I love shoes. Yeah. Yeah.

934
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:25,370
And then I wear new balance.
I wonder balance a lot. Yeah.

935
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,410
Like an old white guy. Yeah.
That's a wide foot shoe. Yeah.

936
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:31,010
You take a bold risk when you
wear those five finger shoes,

937
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:33,470
even though they're good for
you. Oh, those, those good.

938
00:51:33,471 --> 00:51:36,380
I've never showed a pair on there
to walk around in life though,

939
00:51:36,381 --> 00:51:40,010
or just at the gym. My friend Kyle
Kingsbury does it, but he was also life.

940
00:51:40,011 --> 00:51:42,500
He's also a gorilla. He's an enormous guy,

941
00:51:42,501 --> 00:51:45,140
so he's daring you to say that or he's
going to climb a tree. Super Nice Guy,

942
00:51:45,141 --> 00:51:46,500
but he's a former UFC fighter.

943
00:51:46,501 --> 00:51:50,600
Super Nice guy and wears those fucking
five finger shoes. Kyle on Instagram.

944
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,150
He's hilarious. He's great. Great,
great to call. Is He a white guy? Yeah,

945
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,400
I say that only there was a thing.
I saw a clarity ring girl. Right?

946
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:01,430
What's her name? Tasha smoking.
There was a clip the other week.

947
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,190
You have two guys, two black
guys at a tow truck company,

948
00:52:04,191 --> 00:52:09,191
I think it is that start filming this
white guy that called them gorillas and as

949
00:52:09,741 --> 00:52:10,070
he fell,

950
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:13,100
but the white guy backing down as they're
coming at him and it's so funny why

951
00:52:13,101 --> 00:52:17,420
this guy would have said this. Like, I
almost believed the white guy's excuse,

952
00:52:17,421 --> 00:52:20,030
but he has lost cause he was,
I guess he said something like,

953
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:23,300
have one of these two gorillas, bring
it around. And he definitely met there,

954
00:52:23,301 --> 00:52:25,580
big guys. So he definitely
kind of made it like that,

955
00:52:25,581 --> 00:52:28,330
but it just doesn't look
good. So him explaining like,

956
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:32,600
you called me and my black
friends here, girl, he's like, no,

957
00:52:32,601 --> 00:52:34,940
I mentally strong gut. But he just goes
out and I'm a strong guy. She goes,

958
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:39,110
my dentist is a black fella. He
just starts giving. So now he goes,

959
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:42,340
now that's where you're going.
Wrong brothers talking about y'all.

960
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:45,650
Dentists being blessed tend
to mailman's a black fella.

961
00:52:45,651 --> 00:52:47,180
He comes way too far removed.

962
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,700
That's not even I hive high five Tim
several times. I don't even believe them

963
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:57,410
until later. Yes, I do. Sweet.

964
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,040
So wheat. So, uh,

965
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:05,240
I saw the thing where Milo said you guys
cooked out on the show the first time.

966
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:08,360
That's why we're going hard
on new balances this time.

967
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:11,540
It was worth it to have already went
already said fuck you to all three of us

968
00:53:11,541 --> 00:53:12,690
was the hardest. I laughed and

969
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:18,290
[inaudible] fucking
fucking national treasure.

970
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:21,223
National Dude Orients Gang fasted,

971
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:24,950
rich vos and Bonnie Mcfarlane do a
show where they, they, it's cold.

972
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:28,200
You Bang him and they have like four or
five female comedians on stage and then

973
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,260
a male comedian comes out and
does a set at the end of it,

974
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:33,990
the girls have to decide whether or
not they would fucking base off of,

975
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:37,440
you know, a multitude of things and
the set, right. So Ari does his,

976
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:40,530
he just gets naked. It's like literally
take his clothes. I was like, oh,

977
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:42,013
it is set naked.

978
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:45,420
And then he starts chasing the female
Korean comedians around the stage with his

979
00:53:45,421 --> 00:53:47,730
Dick and trying to happen,
hold on, listen, listen.

980
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:49,590
Before you say anything more,

981
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:53,630
but just be aware that other people
are going to listen to this. Yeah.

982
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,480
People are listening. He's like, got it.
Then he held her down against her will.

983
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,290
Then no, this isn't for this on camera.
This is not unknown. That was all,

984
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,160
it was all part of the
theatrical performance.

985
00:54:05,161 --> 00:54:10,161
So it was planned and agreed to
and consented in advance cabaret.

986
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,570
So he's chasing, he's chasing these girls
around and really wink, wink, nudge,

987
00:54:15,571 --> 00:54:17,910
nudge. He could catch them
if he was really chased.

988
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:22,380
Obviously he's a man or a
woman likes, oh my goodness.

989
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,780
He's chasing them around the stage
with his Dick and Louis C K is,

990
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:31,080
they're watching from the sidelines
and he goes, I'm the problem.

991
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:38,330
I think it did a lot to let Louis know
he was in a safe space. That was okay.

992
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,630
Here. There's a lot here.

993
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:43,950
A lot of people gather their panties
in a bunch when a, no pun intended.

994
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:48,530
When he went on stage. Oh yeah dude,
his set was fucking killing the,

995
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,050
they're so happy to
see him, man. Man, I'm,

996
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:55,680
I mean people outside of the people
that were there. Some people never,

997
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:59,820
I mean maybe they feel that the guy
didn't do what they wanted him to do,

998
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,980
but I mean how long do you
want someone to suffer? Well,

999
00:55:01,981 --> 00:55:06,210
the bomber is also the venue saying that
like their workers were like afraid to

1000
00:55:06,211 --> 00:55:10,290
stop it or do anything about it and that
they were upset and it's like me walk

1001
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:14,460
through word static. They don't have
to say that they were jumping around.

1002
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,880
They didn't throw, because a business
doesn't need to have an opinion.

1003
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:19,740
They could just not say
anything for two days.

1004
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:22,590
Nobody was going after this
venue and going like, oh,

1005
00:55:22,591 --> 00:55:24,510
you need to release a
statement. Nobody gave a fuck.

1006
00:55:24,511 --> 00:55:27,120
Here's the thing is those
people are Tori for businesses.

1007
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:31,560
But to understand that the, the idea
of reacting to a journalist is not new,

1008
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:35,740
but the idea of reacting to thousands
and thousands of people make comments on

1009
00:55:35,741 --> 00:55:40,710
your Instagram page that is new.
And for a business that's, you know,

1010
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,880
that that's a big deal. They, they,
they're worried about being boycott,

1011
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:45,843
but that's not what happened.

1012
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:48,720
But the people who are
pissed off that Louise there,

1013
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:52,500
those people will not
like, they will boycott,

1014
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:57,570
they will tweet every day. They, their
thing is to try to ruin someone for,

1015
00:55:57,730 --> 00:56:00,810
you know, committing a like woke
crime or whatever and there,

1016
00:56:00,811 --> 00:56:04,510
so that's what they deal with is
that people like us who are like, ah,

1017
00:56:04,511 --> 00:56:07,710
that sucks that they fucking wrote
that letter. We don't do anything.

1018
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,700
We're not boycotting because they
wrote that letter. We're not like the,

1019
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:13,290
the other side isn't putting
as much pressure on them.

1020
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,580
And that's why all of these companies,

1021
00:56:14,581 --> 00:56:17,280
that's why Gillette's making those
razor commercials and shit cause they're

1022
00:56:17,281 --> 00:56:21,420
scared of that side. You see the
Gillette Razor commercial? Where the,

1023
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:25,180
is it the Gillette one where the
two firemen kiss? I don't think,

1024
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:26,680
I don't think I said
that. That will the cross

1025
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:35,190
[inaudible] Army National
Guard. [inaudible] two firemen.

1026
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:39,970
I wrote it down shit commercial
with who are you going for?

1027
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:41,890
Like do they do gay guys
are gonna go, you know what,

1028
00:56:41,891 --> 00:56:45,310
we want to fight fires now. But it was
like, I get it, you're progressive.

1029
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:47,530
It's like these, this God damn it.

1030
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:50,500
I wanna know what the commercial
offensive though, isn't it like, dude,

1031
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:55,110
if you buy into that like, like, oh my
God, I'm so happy this company is, is,

1032
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:58,390
is woken you just a mark. They're
just taking advantage of you.

1033
00:56:58,391 --> 00:57:01,300
They're just trying to make money
off of you sorta. But it's also hot.

1034
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:06,410
This is like a hot firemen and [inaudible]
friend and they're making out and

1035
00:57:06,581 --> 00:57:09,340
they, you know, the guy comes back from
a fire and he's ready to get some Dick,

1036
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,810
right? Yeah. Holla. It looks fun.
It's a hero. As long as that lesbians,

1037
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:16,450
they're trying to sell you insurance
or whatever the fuck they're selling.

1038
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:20,320
I don't remember who did the commercial,
but I remember saying, oh, okay,

1039
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:24,760
we're being progressive. I love it. Why
not? I don't give a shit. Go for it.

1040
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:29,110
I just find it weird. I find it strange,
the woke capitalism thing that people,

1041
00:57:29,111 --> 00:57:34,111
that companies will take a position that
you think would turn off like 50% of

1042
00:57:34,361 --> 00:57:38,320
the people who buy from them. They do
it to prove they're there. I don't know.

1043
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:42,760
Goodness, but it doesn't hurt.
Does it hurt? Like does anybody go,

1044
00:57:42,761 --> 00:57:47,710
Fuck Blue Cross, I'm getting my fucking
insurance from Spanish, broad, whatever.

1045
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,780
Whatever the cheapest option
is. They're buying that.

1046
00:57:49,781 --> 00:57:51,220
It's like the equinox
thing that just happened.

1047
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,470
Nobody's fucking leaving equinox.
Let me tell you something.

1048
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,740
There's no other option. It's convenient.
You got your fucking gym membership.

1049
00:57:57,130 --> 00:58:00,640
A handful of people are virtue signaling,
but all the people complaining saying,

1050
00:58:00,641 --> 00:58:03,100
boycott Equinox on line. They're
not fucking equinox members,

1051
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,950
so they're fucking fat.
[inaudible] cod equinox,

1052
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:09,460
Steven or one of the owners was a
Trump supporter. He gave him money. Oh,

1053
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:13,480
that's right. He held a
fundraiser last week for Trump.

1054
00:58:13,481 --> 00:58:17,890
So people were freaking out saying
to boycott the brand, but it's like,

1055
00:58:17,891 --> 00:58:18,730
where else are you going to go?

1056
00:58:18,731 --> 00:58:21,600
There's not another high end gym
that's all over the place like that.

1057
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:25,050
Do you know the phrase on the
exact same political beliefs?

1058
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:28,000
Weird runs a business? Like if I
go to, if I go to buy a sandwich,

1059
00:58:28,001 --> 00:58:30,970
do I have to go like, so where
were you on the Iraq war? No. Okay.

1060
00:58:30,971 --> 00:58:32,230
Let me check about this.

1061
00:58:32,231 --> 00:58:36,010
A company that praise on your laziness
is the insurance that you get through.

1062
00:58:36,011 --> 00:58:39,340
Like Sag-aftra. They like it's, you know,

1063
00:58:39,341 --> 00:58:44,260
you get it for free if you qualify and
then when you don't qualify for it,

1064
00:58:44,261 --> 00:58:47,470
you're still enrolled in it and it's
like the most expensive insurance.

1065
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:48,520
Does that make sense? You
know what I mean? Like,

1066
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:51,370
and they kind of praying that kind of
got me almost in that way where a year

1067
00:58:51,371 --> 00:58:53,890
where I, it wasn't taken
care of. I was like, well,

1068
00:58:53,891 --> 00:58:56,220
I don't want to switch out and
then have any doctors saying,

1069
00:58:56,221 --> 00:58:57,670
you know what I mean? Like
we should be different.

1070
00:58:57,671 --> 00:59:02,170
So they kind of get you like that to this
Trump thing is if you support anything

1071
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:05,440
that he does, even just as business
practices, then you're racist.

1072
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:09,590
Like everything that you support, if
he supports it, you're racist. Yeah,

1073
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:12,070
that's crazy. You're, you're
a Nazi, you're racist.

1074
00:59:12,071 --> 00:59:14,020
And when somebody calls
you a racist or a Nazi,

1075
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:16,360
even people that don't believe that,

1076
00:59:16,361 --> 00:59:18,760
they don't want to stand with you and
defend you because then they're being

1077
00:59:18,761 --> 00:59:20,680
perceived as defending a racist or a Nazi.

1078
00:59:20,681 --> 00:59:23,870
And it's a trick and it's very
effective. It was a juicy soap opera.

1079
00:59:23,871 --> 00:59:28,760
I don't know why this guy supports Trump,
but maybe he could explain it. Right.

1080
00:59:28,761 --> 00:59:32,060
And he's a real estate guy. He's a big
real estate guy, related properties.

1081
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:34,130
It has nothing to do with this gym. Okay.

1082
00:59:34,131 --> 00:59:37,070
This has to do with the fact that he
probably has real estate deals for a very,

1083
00:59:37,071 --> 00:59:39,430
very long time with Trump and his, his,

1084
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:43,100
his gym is inconsequential compared to
the billion dollar company that he runs.

1085
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:47,300
Well that makes sense then. That makes
sense why he would support Trump,

1086
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:52,010
especially if he knows Trump, but
it's uh, if you, you can't see that.

1087
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:55,580
I mean if you have a problem with
that and many people would, right.

1088
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:58,790
Many people would have a problem with
that. Like that's a different thing.

1089
00:59:58,791 --> 01:00:01,490
But if you, if you, if you
hear what people are saying,

1090
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:06,120
they're saying if you support
Trump that you support racist.

1091
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:08,000
So you support white
nationalists. You put,

1092
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:12,290
and I think you're leaving so many people
out of the conversation when you do

1093
01:00:12,291 --> 01:00:14,500
that. Oh yeah. I mean
the guy got, what was it,

1094
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:16,940
62 million people to vote for him.

1095
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:20,240
So if you're saying anyone who
supports him is some type of Nazi white

1096
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:24,590
nationalists, then we got bigger
problems. Definitely break up.

1097
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:26,670
No one knows definition of
those things anymore. When my,

1098
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:29,390
we used to be about Milo when he came
up to the things he was called that just

1099
01:00:29,391 --> 01:00:33,020
like, yeah, on paper couldn't
even apply to B, right.

1100
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:36,570
Would never be accepted into
being a Nazi or a white supremacy.

1101
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:38,420
Do you guys remember when we were kids,

1102
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:43,370
we read about McCarthyism and the red
scare. We only always thought like,

1103
01:00:43,371 --> 01:00:46,940
God, we're past that. That kind of
Shit's never going to happen again.

1104
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:51,140
But what that is is like a symptom of
people worried about people defecting from

1105
01:00:51,141 --> 01:00:53,690
their tribe or turning on their tribe.

1106
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:58,370
And we have this like built in fear
of this kind of shit happening. Well,

1107
01:00:58,371 --> 01:00:59,780
there's that aspect to it, right?

1108
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:02,780
It's the people who are worried about
people defecting and then you have the

1109
01:01:02,781 --> 01:01:07,710
opportunists who can play off that instead
of having a win an argument or having

1110
01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:10,490
to, you know, like convince
people, I'm just going to say,

1111
01:01:10,491 --> 01:01:11,870
you're with the other tribe.

1112
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:15,790
You're in this bad group so you're
don't even talk to that person anymore.

1113
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,210
Don't even listen to
what they have to say.

1114
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,270
And if you're in some tribe on
every issue, you're a fucking adult.

1115
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:22,880
I was going to say, why do you have
to be so defined by your choice?

1116
01:01:22,881 --> 01:01:26,230
You know what I mean? Like I would
love to hear the argument about the,

1117
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:30,230
the what, what it does good for
him for his real estate ventures.

1118
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:34,220
I would love to hear it like an honestly
laid out argument of why someone like

1119
01:01:34,221 --> 01:01:35,054
Trump's better.

1120
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,850
If you're a real estate developer and
it might be a significant part of his

1121
01:01:37,851 --> 01:01:40,220
business. I'm like, I'm
not being an apologist.

1122
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:45,010
People all people also will just like,
there's this weird thing where people,

1123
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:48,170
people think that business owners and
people that make a lot of money are

1124
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:49,940
inherently bad, but it's
like, I don't know dude.

1125
01:01:49,941 --> 01:01:52,760
Just cause somebody who's really good
and really successful. He's got kids,

1126
01:01:52,761 --> 01:01:54,800
he wants to feed, he has
grandkids. He wants to watch,

1127
01:01:54,801 --> 01:01:57,170
grow up and go to college.
It's like, I dunno,

1128
01:01:57,230 --> 01:02:00,260
I don't think this isn't necessarily
just bad people that have a lot of money.

1129
01:02:00,261 --> 01:02:02,870
I think that there's a lot of good
people that have a lot of money as well.

1130
01:02:02,871 --> 01:02:06,010
And I think they do a lot of good
shit. Well, I'll just, you know,

1131
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:10,070
whenever someone gets
really upset about an issue,

1132
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:14,640
you always have to wonder like how much
of it going in there was, I mean, what,

1133
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:18,410
what is upsetting to you is upsetting
to that. Anyone who supports Trump,

1134
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:22,860
like Trump rep represents all the things
that are wrong with America today in

1135
01:02:22,861 --> 01:02:26,720
terms of like white nationalists and
terrorist attacks and mass shootings and,

1136
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:30,270
and, and, and massage
and keeping the massage.

1137
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:34,680
They keeping the immigrants out and being
mean and being in America first like,

1138
01:02:34,681 --> 01:02:35,850
fuck, it's, uh,

1139
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:39,780
it's one of those things
today where if you,

1140
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,720
if you support any part
of that, any part of,

1141
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:44,010
even if it's good for your business,

1142
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:48,480
you're just a magnet for fucking people
who are angry at all the things that

1143
01:02:48,481 --> 01:02:52,440
whole list chick-fil-a,
McDonald's like, yeah, man,

1144
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:56,020
epic businesses, successful businesses,

1145
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:00,340
lightbulbs numbers, crazy,
right? People, electricity

1146
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:05,700
diseases. A lot of big
businesses support Trump,

1147
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:10,380
but it's so weird how people like project
their own thing. Onto the situation.

1148
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,780
Cause even like that, you just said
like what everyone hates about Trump,

1149
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,100
but the people who support Trump,

1150
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:17,010
they're not even on the other side of
those issues. It's not like they're like,

1151
01:03:17,011 --> 01:03:18,420
no, we are pro white nationalists.

1152
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:20,580
They just see him as a
completely different thing.

1153
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:24,990
They're like making the country great
and jobs and draining the swamp and all

1154
01:03:24,991 --> 01:03:25,681
these other things.

1155
01:03:25,681 --> 01:03:29,550
Like they f people are looking at the
same thing and seeing very different

1156
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:32,280
realities. Yeah. Yeah they are.

1157
01:03:32,281 --> 01:03:36,750
And people are going in
with their preconceived bias
and getting them confirmed,

1158
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:38,480
you know, with everything. I mean,

1159
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,680
even the way you looked
at the Mueller report,

1160
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:45,330
like the Republicans looked at it as a
victory and the Democrats looked at as

1161
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:49,830
some sort of a like a, an open door
to impeachment. Yeah. But that was,

1162
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:52,890
I don't know if fucking, if
the thing starts off with, uh,

1163
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:56,580
every day you're hearing on the news
that the president is colluding with a

1164
01:03:56,581 --> 01:03:58,860
hostile foreign power.
He's a Russian puppet.

1165
01:03:58,861 --> 01:04:00,910
He's working with Vladimir
Putin and then by the Andrew,

1166
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:04,200
like we have to impeach him because
he thought about obstructing the

1167
01:04:04,201 --> 01:04:08,420
investigation that he was declared
not guilty. And it's like, ah,

1168
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:09,450
this is getting weird.

1169
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:12,540
You guys were going to be upset no matter
what you found a hundred percent Dave

1170
01:04:12,541 --> 01:04:16,700
loves Trump. It's dating. I'm trying
to say. Sounds like he does. He goes,

1171
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:20,550
Trump, I'm going hard Nazi this time
and I'm not coming back on the show.

1172
01:04:20,551 --> 01:04:21,540
I'm going hard this time.

1173
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:26,070
It's the fucked up part is
only having really two choices.

1174
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:28,680
Like we're scrambling to
see who's choice number two,

1175
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,390
who's going to be the
one that opposes Trump?

1176
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:34,080
And you've seen people starting to
crack under pressure or [inaudible] like

1177
01:04:34,081 --> 01:04:35,160
re-entry pressure.

1178
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:39,810
[inaudible] they're trying to figure out
who's going to be [inaudible]. Maybe.

1179
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:42,210
Imagine. Imagine we all get doubted him.

1180
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:47,040
It gets through and becomes
president won't be fucked.

1181
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:50,340
When you look at the people
that are in line though,

1182
01:04:50,341 --> 01:04:54,540
does anybody stand out that you would
think that would be able to, I don't,

1183
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,070
I don't know how much of a
realistic shot, but who I uh,

1184
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:01,620
I love Tulsa Gab and I sent her money
twice already and I disagree with her on

1185
01:05:01,621 --> 01:05:05,160
like 80% of her shit. She
was real interesting person.
She very, she really is.

1186
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:08,790
And her, she's dead on about the
war stuff and she's, you know, yeah.

1187
01:05:08,791 --> 01:05:13,410
About Medicare. Um, she, she's dead on
about a lot of things. She's kind of hot.

1188
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:17,350
Fuck yeah. Dave didn't agree
with something that Medicare, no,

1189
01:05:17,351 --> 01:05:19,660
I don't like her medicare
stuff, but I do like a,

1190
01:05:19,930 --> 01:05:22,840
the most important thing that she
leads with is the war stuff. And she's,

1191
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:26,620
she's got a great position where
she's like, did two tours in Iraq.

1192
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:29,410
She's still active duty.
And so, you know, like the,

1193
01:05:29,411 --> 01:05:32,950
the normal like comeback is like, oh,
you're against the wars. It's like, well,

1194
01:05:32,951 --> 01:05:37,120
you're just kind of a wimp or you're,
you wouldn't want to protect the country.

1195
01:05:37,121 --> 01:05:39,580
And she's like, no
asshole. I actually went,

1196
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:43,810
I'm the one who's willing to go die for
this and I'm telling you we shouldn't be

1197
01:05:43,811 --> 01:05:46,840
dying for this. And what did she do?
What was her job over there though?

1198
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:48,250
Oh she was, it was serious.

1199
01:05:48,251 --> 01:05:52,210
She was like in a medical unit so she
was like dealing with the people who

1200
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:56,880
actually [inaudible] a tree
though. She was making practice.

1201
01:05:57,470 --> 01:06:02,080
She cr the results of edge. It was
the edge of tomorrow to Tom Cruise.

1202
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:07,330
It was her job to clean up the
DVDs. That's a hot subject, right?

1203
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:09,030
Women in combat. Yeah.

1204
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:13,420
I got a bunch of shit about st making
jokes about saying I don't understand what

1205
01:06:13,421 --> 01:06:13,811
a girl,

1206
01:06:13,811 --> 01:06:17,230
I watched the show cops a lot and I
don't understand what a good girl cop has

1207
01:06:17,231 --> 01:06:20,410
ever done in a situation. It's
hostile except for make the,

1208
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,630
the perp get much more hurt.

1209
01:06:22,631 --> 01:06:27,631
Shot or tased because she's in the way
of it happening and people got really

1210
01:06:27,701 --> 01:06:29,590
upset about me saying that but it really,

1211
01:06:30,130 --> 01:06:34,060
I don't understand why you'd send like a
woman to a major fight happening at the

1212
01:06:34,061 --> 01:06:37,030
mall. Get down there ladies.
It really is like a puzzle.

1213
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:40,810
The physical PR with some cops,

1214
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:44,860
the physical aspect of
an altercation is like,

1215
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:49,500
it's going to be a real problem with
plenty of guys. Plenty. You got cops,

1216
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:53,770
the female thing, you can just say
you can't have 110 pound person.

1217
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:58,000
Go and be the physical authority
in a situation. That element,

1218
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:02,200
I'm going to call you
a chick officer chick.

1219
01:07:02,201 --> 01:07:06,880
Here's a terrible video of this guy
getting pulled over by this lady and his

1220
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:09,490
daughter's in the car and the
guy was a criminal apparently,

1221
01:07:09,491 --> 01:07:14,491
and the cop was calling in and the guy
punches her and gets her down on the

1222
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:17,970
ground. She knocks her out,
coats it all video. Yeah.

1223
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:20,890
And starts punching her face and
while she and the daughter screaming,

1224
01:07:20,891 --> 01:07:24,120
stop it Daddy, stop it daddy. And he
beats the fuck out of this lady car.

1225
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:26,260
And you're like, this is why it's problem.

1226
01:07:26,261 --> 01:07:29,110
This lady cops by herself
and she's got a gun,

1227
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:31,900
but she doesn't have the gun out of
the holster polling at the guy. She's,

1228
01:07:31,901 --> 01:07:36,860
it's a routine traffic stop and that guy
pummels her man. It's horrible. Yeah,

1229
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,840
it's a really shit and me
saying the idea's not like
fuck chicks. I'm just like,

1230
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:42,700
don't send them out to
get hurt in the suits.

1231
01:07:42,701 --> 01:07:45,340
I don't understand why it's
not necessarily as your
daughter and you saw your

1232
01:07:45,341 --> 01:07:47,470
daughter beaten. Oh my God.

1233
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:52,480
Because someone thought it was okay
for her to be by herself amongst,

1234
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:56,830
you know, big giant criminals. Typically
they don't match up female cops though.

1235
01:07:56,831 --> 01:08:00,100
Right? I'm assuming most of the
time they put a girl by herself.

1236
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:04,000
[inaudible] you can be on
patrol by yourself lives
just like walking around the

1237
01:08:04,001 --> 01:08:05,200
neighborhood or something for sure.

1238
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:10,540
But I've seen videos where it's like a
dude and a chick partners and the cop

1239
01:08:10,541 --> 01:08:14,230
gets in a fight with another guy and
it's basically just two men fighting with

1240
01:08:14,231 --> 01:08:17,780
this woman kind of grabbing an arm
here or there and it's almost a

1241
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:24,250
[inaudible]. She might try to hit
the guy with a brick and hit you.

1242
01:08:25,650 --> 01:08:27,920
That would be boring and Mace it herself.

1243
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:33,630
But there's a lot of men that would
fall apart in that job too. Yeah,

1244
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,910
sure. Oh definitely. Definitely.
I've seen, I think any small,

1245
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:41,720
whether it's a woman or a man,
any person who's, you know,

1246
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:45,530
not a large person who's not physically
strong is by themselves as a cop.

1247
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:50,090
It's in danger. Any one, doesn't matter
if you're male or you're 150 pound male,

1248
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:50,691
same deal.

1249
01:08:50,691 --> 01:08:54,680
You're in trouble unless you're really
good martial artists who can grab a gun,

1250
01:08:54,681 --> 01:08:57,410
quickly, know how to respond to pressure.

1251
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:01,850
[inaudible] 99% of women, I could
take a gun right out of their hands.

1252
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:05,610
I have no, I have no training,
but like give me your check.

1253
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:08,320
You can point a gun right at
my head. But that said time,

1254
01:09:08,530 --> 01:09:10,730
I'm fucking taking it and putting
it right back at her. That said,

1255
01:09:10,731 --> 01:09:12,260
I should make clear that I myself,

1256
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:16,280
I know where I'm nowhere near
as tough as I think you should.

1257
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:19,460
You should need to be to be a cop.
Oh yeah. Do you know what I mean?

1258
01:09:19,461 --> 01:09:22,760
Like I would never assume that of myself
either. So I'm not like saying, dude,

1259
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,670
I've been doing martial arts my whole
life. I wouldn't want to be a cop.

1260
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:29,420
I don't want to be a cop. It's a crazy
situation. It's hard. It's a hard job.

1261
01:09:29,421 --> 01:09:33,330
It's dangerous. You're supposed to have
to be brave. Well not only that man.

1262
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:36,980
Do you know how much PTSD those guys
are dealing with that is unrecognized.

1263
01:09:36,981 --> 01:09:39,680
If every day you're pulling
people over, that might shoot you.

1264
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,860
Every day you're dealing with someone
who's robbing something or stealing

1265
01:09:42,861 --> 01:09:46,460
something or trying to kill somebody
or did kill somebody every fucking day.

1266
01:09:46,461 --> 01:09:49,010
You're going to see a lot of cops ain't
doing shit though. Some of them are.

1267
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,680
But look, you are wearing a
uniform that makes you the enemy.

1268
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:54,740
You're also the person with power and
you've got to realize how fucking corrupt

1269
01:09:54,741 --> 01:09:58,310
that is that you're able to yell at people
and force people in these situations

1270
01:09:58,311 --> 01:10:01,250
and cuff them and fuck with
them and you've got no window.

1271
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:06,890
Just gentle public like nastiness
because they can guys what you guys do,

1272
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:10,730
here's their way. I get a personal way.

1273
01:10:10,731 --> 01:10:13,670
If you're just blocking their path
where a normal person would go,

1274
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:18,470
excuse me guys, because they're where
the walk guys walk cause it turns out,

1275
01:10:18,471 --> 01:10:19,304
oh shit.

1276
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,240
But sometimes they don't have t luckily
benefit of the doubt right there.

1277
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:24,260
They're in Times Square. They're
dealing with a lot of people.

1278
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:27,860
There's just not time for the [inaudible]
circumstances I'm talking about in

1279
01:10:27,861 --> 01:10:28,531
just a thing like that.

1280
01:10:28,531 --> 01:10:32,030
The same way they put on their lights
to go through a red light just to get,

1281
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:35,220
cause they don't want to wait
at the opportunistic like that.

1282
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:37,480
Of course it's shower beings.

1283
01:10:37,730 --> 01:10:42,500
Human beings don't do well with
authority mixed with impunity.

1284
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:46,340
So like a cop can say that to you and
nothing happens to them if there's no

1285
01:10:46,341 --> 01:10:51,341
repercussions and you have power
10 [inaudible] Guy Jimmy justice.

1286
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:55,310
I had a job as a security guard for a
brief moment in time when I was like 19

1287
01:10:55,311 --> 01:10:59,780
years old and there was an us versus them
mentality between the security and the

1288
01:10:59,781 --> 01:11:02,690
people with the concert goers.
That was clearly evident.

1289
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:05,690
One of the first days I was working
there, this guy, his name was Allie cat,

1290
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:11,140
so to brand security and some dude
had stole one of the golf cards,

1291
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:14,040
so the golf card, one of them
electric golf carts for security.

1292
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:17,610
So they tackled this dude off the golf
cart and he smashes him in the head with

1293
01:11:17,611 --> 01:11:18,720
a fucking walkie talkie.

1294
01:11:18,721 --> 01:11:22,930
It's like a crazy fight with some drunk
asshole who's like violet and stole a

1295
01:11:23,170 --> 01:11:25,050
golf cart. Uh, that
was like the first day,

1296
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:29,130
their first or second day there
on the job. I was like, oh, okay.

1297
01:11:29,131 --> 01:11:33,450
So this is what's going on. And it
became people trying to sneak booze,

1298
01:11:33,451 --> 01:11:35,430
integrate woods and then us.

1299
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:38,940
And then so it was this us versus them
mentality and everybody was lying to you.

1300
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,590
And that was the silliest job.

1301
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:44,790
I'm doing security at a fucking
bill Cosby show. Literally,

1302
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:49,460
I was doing security. I was taking
people's boobs and you know,

1303
01:11:49,461 --> 01:11:50,340
what did you let happen?

1304
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:56,340
You could have stepped in and sucked
them talking about falling asleep on the

1305
01:11:56,341 --> 01:11:59,960
job. Hilarious. It's such a, you know,

1306
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
it's such a simple little job. It's
easy. There's no criminals there.

1307
01:12:04,001 --> 01:12:06,620
There's no bank robbers.
There is no murders there.

1308
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:12,590
That little situation of us versus
them with the liquor and them trying to

1309
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:14,220
smuggle in pot and liquor.

1310
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:19,250
Just that led to this huge fucking rift
between the security people and the way

1311
01:12:20,371 --> 01:12:24,130
they thought was funny because it's
too much of a human emotion in it.

1312
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:27,960
That's something that should be a job
because even if you don't care if people,

1313
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:31,710
when you're not working, you're trying
to get beer and weed into a concert.

1314
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:35,610
It's just that these are your opponents
right now and they're trying to fuck

1315
01:12:35,611 --> 01:12:37,590
with you. Even though some of
you were like, you go like,

1316
01:12:37,591 --> 01:12:39,270
I don't care if you guys
smoke weed. You're like, no,

1317
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:41,640
but I have to say you can't smoke
weed and then when they do it anyway,

1318
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:44,640
like I just fucking said,
you can't smoke weed.

1319
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:46,480
It's like testing your manhood almost.

1320
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:49,350
It's a too much human emotion in
there versus on Netflix. I can't,

1321
01:12:49,351 --> 01:12:52,070
I bet that experiment will college
was that. It's like a famous story.

1322
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:54,930
It's Princeton, the Princeton
prison or no, Stanford.

1323
01:12:54,931 --> 01:12:57,000
I'm still going to Stanford
prison experiment. You know,

1324
01:12:57,001 --> 01:12:59,660
I read something debunking the, yeah,

1325
01:12:59,930 --> 01:13:03,150
they said the methodology was all wrong
on it or something like it's not a legit

1326
01:13:03,151 --> 01:13:03,601
study.

1327
01:13:03,601 --> 01:13:06,660
They also said that people were doing
things just to end the study quickly

1328
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:09,270
because they wanted to go home.
We did that in the movie though.

1329
01:13:09,271 --> 01:13:12,280
They broke that down. They showed that
side of it where they were like the,

1330
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:16,470
they said, I guess the guy who made
the experiment said, yeah, it's a wash.

1331
01:13:16,510 --> 01:13:19,470
The end of it was like, it
wasn't actually good data,

1332
01:13:19,471 --> 01:13:24,150
but it was interesting and I do believe
that Stanford was the Stanford prison

1333
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:28,910
experiment. Students pretended to be some
pretend to be criminals, San Pitocin,

1334
01:13:28,970 --> 01:13:32,370
and they started getting cars to
power positions. Got I came up.

1335
01:13:32,371 --> 01:13:35,310
The interesting things is that the
professor becomes like the warden,

1336
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:38,400
he gets into it too, like
they cut that, they show,

1337
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:41,280
they got it on video and stuff and he's
like walking around with his chest out

1338
01:13:41,281 --> 01:13:44,340
and he's all in. It's just people
get, they fall into these roles,

1339
01:13:44,341 --> 01:13:48,500
into these camps and the authority
goes to people's head. It may,

1340
01:13:48,510 --> 01:13:53,100
it creates a weird dynamic about how
many dickhead cops people have met.

1341
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,700
Right. That's just a thing that happens,

1342
01:13:57,660 --> 01:14:01,110
but it also makes it very nice when
you run into friendly cops. Well,

1343
01:14:01,111 --> 01:14:02,490
that's trout. What a good dude.

1344
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:07,440
It's almost like training the human
interaction so they're there when they act

1345
01:14:07,441 --> 01:14:10,590
like a Dick and people act a certain way
and they move and they get a little bit

1346
01:14:10,591 --> 01:14:12,950
nervous. It's like, oh, that's like
intoxicating and they're like, all right,

1347
01:14:12,951 --> 01:14:13,511
that feels good.

1348
01:14:13,511 --> 01:14:17,500
That power right there said about
no repercussions for your behavior,

1349
01:14:17,501 --> 01:14:19,930
the way you talking with d. You could
just do that with impunity. That's,

1350
01:14:19,931 --> 01:14:21,400
you just nailed it.
That's exactly what it is.

1351
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,040
That's not a normal situation
for people. That's all.

1352
01:14:24,350 --> 01:14:28,960
I mean it's state verse business. If he
asked, here we go. You walk into some,

1353
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:31,990
my Gosh, look, if you walk
into the apple store or you,

1354
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:34,750
they can't do that because
you're a voluntary customer,

1355
01:14:34,751 --> 01:14:37,450
so if they treat you the wrong way,
there's a repercussion right there.

1356
01:14:37,451 --> 01:14:41,140
You're like, well, I'll walk out here
dark stores with the black dudes.

1357
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:42,940
How their homeless camps now

1358
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:46,840
[inaudible] at least
they're not shooting people,

1359
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:50,270
but cell phones has become the great
equalizer because now you see cops there,

1360
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:51,850
they're on it walking on eggshells. Dude,

1361
01:14:52,270 --> 01:14:53,530
pay out their cell phones
now and they're like,

1362
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:55,690
what up bitch ass pussy
cop and the cops like,

1363
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:57,730
well I guess I'm a bitch
ass pussy. You see the

1364
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:01,210
[inaudible] is the battery
runs out on that cell phone.

1365
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:02,980
I'm going to shoot you
in the stomach. Dude.

1366
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:06,510
Did you see the video in New York where
they're throwing water on the cops and

1367
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:08,800
the cops just aren't doing
shit? I Dunno. I think it was.

1368
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:10,270
It might've been in Harlem. I say,

1369
01:15:10,271 --> 01:15:11,740
isn't it like a black
neighborhood in New York?

1370
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:15,100
They're dumping water on the cops and
everyone's got a cell phone camera on them

1371
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:18,240
and you know, in any other
period of time or today

1372
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:21,640
beating the shit out of everyone.

1373
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:24,880
They're throwing water balloons at him
and shit and they're just sitting there

1374
01:15:24,881 --> 01:15:28,690
like, we know I'm going to be in
the news tomorrow. I'm going to be,

1375
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:30,310
you know what I mean?
Like I'll be a famous,

1376
01:15:30,311 --> 01:15:33,740
that cop definitely goes home that
night and like shadow above with two

1377
01:15:33,741 --> 01:15:38,440
nightsticks just practicing like the last
dragon fight that he was in that day.

1378
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:46,650
[inaudible] she had a box
for two hours of homeowners.

1379
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:48,370
Pour water on me. Here's
some water for you.

1380
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:53,410
[inaudible] a lot of them have been on
the forest for 15 years, 20 years today.

1381
01:15:53,690 --> 01:15:56,680
They've just been doing things a certain
way for so long and I'm so close to

1382
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:01,960
[inaudible]. Do you guys ever see
the seven five Oh yeah. Excellent.

1383
01:16:03,210 --> 01:16:06,050
[inaudible] you interviewed Him
Dad. Yeah, he's is he likable? Yeah.

1384
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:09,700
Very nice guy. What's his name?
Michael Dowd. Is that my clo doubt?

1385
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:14,710
Michael Dowd. I didn't see it. It's an
excellent documentary. It's doubt. Doubt,

1386
01:16:15,690 --> 01:16:16,960
doubt. Yeah. You know, he's great.

1387
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:20,350
He's a really nice guy and he's super
open and honest about what happened in the

1388
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,470
documentary. He's fucking compelling
shit. And you realize that.

1389
01:16:23,471 --> 01:16:26,320
How much of it was true when I think
he's not remorseful at all. What I find,

1390
01:16:26,321 --> 01:16:29,830
that's where I find unlikable. He's not
remorseful. I think he's remorseful.

1391
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:34,120
He just look, he just has that
voice just doing coke all day long,

1392
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:39,040
every day as a cop and you know, making
all this money and driving a corvette.

1393
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:41,530
He was out of control
and he was on the, uh,

1394
01:16:41,650 --> 01:16:45,160
the area where he was the 75th
precinct, I think it's east New York,

1395
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:47,620
Brooklyn at the height
of like the New York.

1396
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:51,700
This was like the murder
neighborhood capitol. Like it was,

1397
01:16:51,730 --> 01:16:56,170
it was a wild team were in the chain
of shove a lot of those murders.

1398
01:16:56,171 --> 01:16:58,930
That's what I think is like
crazy. But like they were never,

1399
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:01,900
they were never convicted of a
murder. Right. And there was no,

1400
01:17:02,630 --> 01:17:04,660
admittedly that he was cuddled.
He's like, let me, of course,

1401
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:08,260
like talk about doing one
right. Yeah, never happened.

1402
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:11,480
The whole thing is crazy,
but what it tells you,

1403
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:16,400
I mean forget about pers are judgments
on, you know, the people that were in it.

1404
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:19,610
What it tells you is that this can
happen to someone who just becomes a cop.

1405
01:17:19,611 --> 01:17:20,450
You get on the force.

1406
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:24,500
If it's a bad force word like it was at
the time with him and he seen corruption

1407
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:28,880
from day one. I mean, it was just like
he was roped into it. Like right away,

1408
01:17:28,881 --> 01:17:31,280
when you listen to his story,
it's pretty fucking compelling.

1409
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,250
This is like the first day on
the job, like something happened.

1410
01:17:34,251 --> 01:17:36,930
They threw a guy off a
building or something like
that, but took it personally.

1411
01:17:36,931 --> 01:17:38,260
I don't remember. Yeah, but it was,

1412
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:42,050
and then there's just that personality
chart that you could take. Yup.

1413
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:45,530
You're like, I can just have them.
No one will know there's 50 gs here.

1414
01:17:45,531 --> 01:17:47,920
I could just take this home. And they're
like, oh, we didn't find anything.

1415
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:51,050
It's very easy. It's very telling of the
personality. That becomes a cop though,

1416
01:17:51,051 --> 01:17:54,020
because they're not even
worried that people are getting,

1417
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:58,160
it's amazing that no one whistleblowers
so much earlier than that because one

1418
01:17:58,161 --> 01:17:59,300
person comes in and goes, no guys,

1419
01:17:59,301 --> 01:18:02,530
we're supposed to be fucking
believing in this badge and what we,

1420
01:18:02,670 --> 01:18:04,680
you know what I mean? No. They
all go, what are we doing?

1421
01:18:04,690 --> 01:18:07,340
We good cups are bad cups. He goes, ever
Robyn? Drug dealers like, alright man,

1422
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:08,630
I still do that with the
guys. She said, we'll do that.

1423
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:12,530
I got a phone call and lost this fight
though. So I don't think that, honestly,

1424
01:18:12,531 --> 01:18:13,364
to be honest,

1425
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:18,710
I have almost no problem
with cops skimming off the
top from drug dealer money.

1426
01:18:19,940 --> 01:18:23,240
What do you want me to fucking say?
We're just giving it to the government.

1427
01:18:23,241 --> 01:18:26,020
Why does the government get to have the
money and these cops who are putting

1428
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:29,480
their wives, wait a minute. Not if
they're arresting people for drugs. Yeah.

1429
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:29,811
Look,

1430
01:18:29,811 --> 01:18:33,240
if you're going to do that and you're
going to just ignore everyone else who

1431
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:34,820
selling coke. Okay,

1432
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:37,820
but if you're going to do that and
arrest people for selling coke,

1433
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:42,600
then you're a criminal, then
you're like arrested. Yeah, that's,

1434
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:45,800
that's the repercussion. I don't
have a, almost a moral issue with it.

1435
01:18:46,030 --> 01:18:50,270
If say if he found $50,000 only reported
40,000 put $10,000 in his pocket,

1436
01:18:50,271 --> 01:18:51,470
brought her home to his wife and kids,

1437
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:53,780
I don't really have a
moral issue with that.

1438
01:18:53,781 --> 01:18:57,410
If he brought it home to just fucking
pay for is backed up like porn bill or

1439
01:18:57,411 --> 01:18:59,660
something because we just
brought him the fuck around Jay.

1440
01:18:59,690 --> 01:19:04,670
They won't let you go that long if you
want to get reinstated, there's fees.

1441
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:08,420
If he got arrested, I wouldn't go,
Oh, poor fucking guy. I go, yeah dude,

1442
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:10,780
that's the price you pay. You
committed a crime that that,

1443
01:19:11,390 --> 01:19:15,020
but from my personal perspective,
I don't think he's a piece of shit.

1444
01:19:15,021 --> 01:19:16,160
I don't think he's a bad person.

1445
01:19:16,161 --> 01:19:20,870
I think it's probably stupid if he doesn't
look the cycle of people and drugs is

1446
01:19:20,871 --> 01:19:23,330
never ending. It will go
on to the end of time.

1447
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:28,540
The cycle of making drugs illegal and
propping up gigantic criminal enterprises

1448
01:19:29,151 --> 01:19:33,560
because of that is also
as old as we've had laws.

1449
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:36,020
As long as we've had laws, vet
people breaking those laws.

1450
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:39,830
And if those laws exist because someone
wants to control people's behavior in a

1451
01:19:39,831 --> 01:19:42,710
way that people don't want, folks
are going to find a work around.

1452
01:19:42,890 --> 01:19:46,760
But no drugs are [inaudible] empowers
the Mexican cartels right now.

1453
01:19:46,761 --> 01:19:50,230
And some Mexican cartels
are a huge source of,

1454
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:54,170
of fear for people that live in the
border towns is a huge source of fear for

1455
01:19:54,171 --> 01:19:57,530
people that are forced to
be in communities and it's
propped up because drugs

1456
01:19:57,531 --> 01:19:59,930
are illegal. Nobody seems
to want to recognize that.

1457
01:19:59,931 --> 01:20:04,931
It's one of those ugly things about
being a human that like people want drugs

1458
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:09,480
and you can't tell them they
can't have what they want. Yeah.

1459
01:20:09,481 --> 01:20:12,600
Especially since immigration became such
a huge thing that everyone's talking

1460
01:20:12,601 --> 01:20:15,510
about and that's like the biggest
part of it that no one talks about.

1461
01:20:15,511 --> 01:20:16,890
It's like the violence and it's like,

1462
01:20:16,891 --> 01:20:19,320
well there's people on this side
of this line who want the drugs.

1463
01:20:19,470 --> 01:20:22,560
There's people on this side of the line
who have the drugs and even with all the

1464
01:20:22,561 --> 01:20:25,710
shit you're doing, they're still
trading them to each other.

1465
01:20:25,711 --> 01:20:28,930
So do you really think maybe we
should just let them do it? We're in,

1466
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:32,000
but here's the thing. We don't want
anybody to do it rightly so. I mean, look,

1467
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:34,140
we know you don't want anybody
run around doing heroin.

1468
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,500
Nobody gets through that and goes,
it was amazing. It was my best,

1469
01:20:37,501 --> 01:20:39,710
one of my best moments in life was
when I was addicted to heroin. Yeah.

1470
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:42,900
But even if you do it one time, I bet
it's pretty fucking dope. It's amazing.

1471
01:20:42,901 --> 01:20:46,030
Just one hard too to let it
go. Once you've experienced it,

1472
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:50,010
it's probably fucking incredible. Lenny
Bruce had some crazy description of it,

1473
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:53,760
about something about being hugged
by an angel or something like that.

1474
01:20:55,510 --> 01:20:57,900
Michael Stephano, who died a few
years ago, New York comic had a joke.

1475
01:20:57,901 --> 01:20:59,850
He was like, he was like,
you know, great heroin is,

1476
01:21:00,030 --> 01:21:02,490
it's like taking a bath
in a pool full of kittens.

1477
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:07,580
Metzker Metzker had that joke
about it where he says, uh,

1478
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:09,440
when the families of people go, he goes,

1479
01:21:09,450 --> 01:21:11,940
I don't understand why he would do heroin.

1480
01:21:11,941 --> 01:21:15,490
He's got a family that loves him and
kids who look up to them and love him,

1481
01:21:15,491 --> 01:21:17,120
like, why would he do heroin? He goes, oh,

1482
01:21:17,170 --> 01:21:20,460
I want to tell that family like
you're just so close to the answer.

1483
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:25,830
Heroin is better than all those
things. That is hilarious.

1484
01:21:26,610 --> 01:21:30,390
Yeah, but I mean, I don't think people
should do it, but if you make it illegal,

1485
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,150
it's not, they're not going to stop
doing it. The question would be,

1486
01:21:33,151 --> 01:21:35,310
would people do more
of it if it was legal,

1487
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:38,670
if you could just go to a drug store the
same way you go to a liquor store and

1488
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:41,670
the drug store was actually a drug store
where you could just go buy coke and

1489
01:21:41,671 --> 01:21:45,900
they might, well, look in La, I do think
more people are smoking weed for sure.

1490
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:50,850
Since we became legal like I, that'd be
my guess. I don't know what the date is.

1491
01:21:50,851 --> 01:21:53,730
I'm sure that's fine, but,
but even if that's the case,

1492
01:21:53,731 --> 01:21:56,820
I don't know if that's the answer because
let's say even slightly more people

1493
01:21:56,821 --> 01:22:01,210
did heroin. Hold on. Wait, less
people got murdered. What's that year?

1494
01:22:01,230 --> 01:22:05,620
Heroin. What? Jamie? Just

1495
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:12,180
[inaudible] more. Do people smoke
weed more since legalization? Well,

1496
01:22:12,181 --> 01:22:13,740
that was the most hilarious.

1497
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:18,630
Not Remember when we were talking about
it's gotten cheaper. It's easier to get,

1498
01:22:18,631 --> 01:22:21,150
it's better. It's more
fun. It's in candy form.

1499
01:22:21,151 --> 01:22:26,151
It's in fucking 1818 year old is more
likely to definitely give it a try versus

1500
01:22:28,051 --> 01:22:32,280
maybe would have. When I had gotten weed
for the first time I was 17 years old,

1501
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:35,070
I had to have my uncle Raymond buy
it for us. He skimmed off the bag.

1502
01:22:35,071 --> 01:22:38,640
I remember and he brought us a fucking
dime bag and me and my two best friends,

1503
01:22:38,641 --> 01:22:43,200
we smoked a joint before we were going
to see system of a down and cubis and Mr

1504
01:22:43,201 --> 01:22:46,650
Bungle at snow court, Puerto Rican. So
your uncle like two years older than you,

1505
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:51,170
one of those deals. Is that
why he did that? But to me bro,

1506
01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:54,570
we the night before we want it
to smoke and it took us, we,

1507
01:22:54,571 --> 01:22:55,380
there was no way to get it.

1508
01:22:55,380 --> 01:23:00,300
We were trying to find weed for so long
because we weren't in that world the

1509
01:23:00,301 --> 01:23:01,710
first time you go to get weed,

1510
01:23:01,711 --> 01:23:05,380
if you could just go to a store and
pick it up and it's fun and you know,

1511
01:23:05,381 --> 01:23:09,640
it's like I'm at a mall. I
mean, yeah, I mean astronomical.

1512
01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:13,090
But you know, I love weed, so
I'm on Hayden. It's great. Well,

1513
01:23:13,091 --> 01:23:17,020
it was hard to get on the east coast.
It's just trickier out here still.

1514
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:20,650
But since the nineties once the
past, those laws from medical,

1515
01:23:20,651 --> 01:23:23,210
everybody had a medical card.
It's not hard to get it.

1516
01:23:23,211 --> 01:23:27,370
All the doctors were extremely
unscrupulous and their prescriptions.

1517
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:32,170
So everybody's had weed out here since
the fucking nineties yeah, like strong,

1518
01:23:32,171 --> 01:23:35,230
strong, easy to get women now.
They really don't give a shit.

1519
01:23:35,231 --> 01:23:38,650
If you smoke like outside, you could
smoke a true smoker like a cigarette now.

1520
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:40,960
And none of those. No, I don't
think you get smoking outside.

1521
01:23:41,070 --> 01:23:43,660
It's still think you have to be
indoors. I think smoking outside,

1522
01:23:43,661 --> 01:23:46,030
the problem is other people can smell
it and you're not supposed to do that.

1523
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:50,970
I think in Denver it's like nine feet
from an entrance. You can smoke weed.

1524
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:56,080
I smoke vape. I mean everywhere
inside of a movie theater.

1525
01:23:56,081 --> 01:23:59,050
As I'm walking through a mall, I go to
the bathroom at the airport and I smoke.

1526
01:23:59,051 --> 01:24:00,250
Yes. That's what ethnics do.

1527
01:24:00,251 --> 01:24:04,180
They challenge everyone by being big
in Alpha in a place like Starbucks.

1528
01:24:04,181 --> 01:24:05,680
I'm buying anything. Yeah, I'm smoking.

1529
01:24:05,681 --> 01:24:10,680
What definitely keeps me around
so we can be racist. I go,

1530
01:24:10,690 --> 01:24:12,340
what do you mean my dentist is black,

1531
01:24:12,490 --> 01:24:17,050
Blue Shit. Black dancers to be hilarious.

1532
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:22,390
Gold teeth. Snoop's got
diamond, lower teeth.

1533
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:27,391
Now what am snoop Dogg these diamond
stud or like them creative Donald Grill

1534
01:24:28,701 --> 01:24:31,350
diamond things. He's in this video.

1535
01:24:31,351 --> 01:24:35,440
He's driving around on his Instagram in
a Lamborghini with diamond lower teeth

1536
01:24:36,730 --> 01:24:40,810
50 years ago. Right. I love it. 50 years
old. Diamond teeth. He's living it,

1537
01:24:40,811 --> 01:24:43,030
man. Oh, for sure. He doesn't give a fuck.

1538
01:24:43,210 --> 01:24:46,650
He spends most of his time getting
furious video games online. Does he? Yeah,

1539
01:24:46,690 --> 01:24:49,780
he just yells about Madden like
[inaudible] for a minute. Right.

1540
01:24:49,781 --> 01:24:53,520
He was commentating like, uh,
with your wife or your neighbor.

1541
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:58,050
They would drink and watch the
fight. So he was drinking like tango,

1542
01:24:58,310 --> 01:25:00,420
rained smoking joints and
watch all the fights. Oh,

1543
01:25:00,730 --> 01:25:05,730
these wackos tough because what it was
was there was some commentary that he did

1544
01:25:05,831 --> 01:25:10,831
just independently on one fight and it
was so hilarious because he's so animated

1545
01:25:10,991 --> 01:25:14,140
and screaming and yelling about this
fight that, uh, everybody thought like,

1546
01:25:14,141 --> 01:25:14,351
wow,

1547
01:25:14,351 --> 01:25:17,320
wouldn't it be great if there was an
option to watch the snoop Dogg commentary

1548
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:21,070
on demand? You could click over to
the snoop dog version. That's right.

1549
01:25:21,071 --> 01:25:22,540
And it was probably, I don't
know, I've never watched it,

1550
01:25:22,541 --> 01:25:26,860
but I assume it was fucking horrific.
Oh, let's go go one north south.

1551
01:25:27,070 --> 01:25:28,490
He's got his diesel in this middle.

1552
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:35,640
[inaudible] yeah, just the, uh, I
guess they got bored with it there.

1553
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:37,840
You got bored doing it or
something. I Dunno. It stopped.

1554
01:25:37,870 --> 01:25:40,690
Maybe Snoop's fucking busy. He doesn't
have time to be doing that volunteer.

1555
01:25:40,691 --> 01:25:44,170
He's like Mike Tyson too, in the sense
that I just, I remember when he was like,

1556
01:25:44,171 --> 01:25:48,190
scary. I hear this. Let's
listen to this mother fucker.

1557
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:54,120
Mother fucking ne. Oh, that's
right. It was Colby. I'm sorry.

1558
01:25:54,380 --> 01:25:57,370
I'm sorry. Yeah. Tyrell show up, N***a.

1559
01:25:58,190 --> 01:25:59,990
[inaudible] he thought it
was called [inaudible].

1560
01:26:00,730 --> 01:26:04,010
He thought it was called because
he thought it was cool, but it was

1561
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:07,710
a man from a completely different
part of the world. Yep. Yeah.

1562
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,020
Fuck Donald Trump. That is hilarious.
Thought it was coldly. That's so fun.

1563
01:26:12,021 --> 01:26:15,080
Holy Shit. He was getting some
booze the other night, Huh? Dude.

1564
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:19,310
DACA hears touching. Yep. When those
people are booing [inaudible] emotion,

1565
01:26:19,311 --> 01:26:19,780
dude,

1566
01:26:19,780 --> 01:26:22,660
emotion. You want to get the emotion
out of people, whether it's good or bad,

1567
01:26:22,661 --> 01:26:23,560
it doesn't fucking matter.

1568
01:26:23,561 --> 01:26:25,870
They want to see him fight
and they want to see him lose.

1569
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:30,060
He's going, he'll, he went, he'll
listen. He's a good guy. I'm telling you.

1570
01:26:30,061 --> 01:26:30,900
I know that guy.

1571
01:26:30,901 --> 01:26:35,160
I've met him outside of this crazy thing
that he's doing and this crazy thing

1572
01:26:35,161 --> 01:26:38,400
that he's doing came
about when he was, uh,

1573
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:42,330
like on the verge of getting cut
and people didn't like to style.

1574
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:46,640
And so he went hard. He'll, when he
fought Damien mind, he went hard. Yeah.

1575
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:50,460
We'll chill to dissimilar thing. Shell
wasn't the big mouth guy back in the day.

1576
01:26:50,490 --> 01:26:51,110
No, he was not.

1577
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:54,140
Yeah. And he just made a decision one
day that he's going to be that dude.

1578
01:26:54,141 --> 01:26:56,990
It wasn't right at the Anderson Fife
fucking great marketing decision. Smart.

1579
01:26:57,110 --> 01:27:00,250
Very smart. And Colby too. It's
like, oh, but also Colby, he,

1580
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:04,010
something happened as well. He's really
exciting. The, that last fight, Ooh,

1581
01:27:04,190 --> 01:27:08,060
that last fight was incredible dude.
Um, but yeah, call me is definitely,

1582
01:27:08,061 --> 01:27:08,960
it's contrived.

1583
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:12,630
I appreciate the effort.
Um, but he's not effective.

1584
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:16,050
See the thing about it being contrived
is it makes it obvious that he's putting

1585
01:27:16,051 --> 01:27:20,580
on a show. But the thing is that
putting on a show is fucking,

1586
01:27:20,581 --> 01:27:21,480
he's ruthless.

1587
01:27:21,481 --> 01:27:25,290
He fucks with people's heads legitimately
like they do not want to lose to him.

1588
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:29,370
And then when you get inside the
AUC gun, he's really fucking good.

1589
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:33,060
Like really far. I didn't realize
how good he was until the fight.

1590
01:27:33,090 --> 01:27:34,650
You see the amount of strikes at that guy,

1591
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:37,840
no volume. And then he's an unbelievable
wrestling. It's a really, really,

1592
01:27:37,841 --> 01:27:42,220
really tough matchup for anybody.
And Colby is, it is a, uh, you know,

1593
01:27:42,221 --> 01:27:45,040
an act and it is pro wrestling. He
puts on the Trump hat and people,

1594
01:27:45,041 --> 01:27:48,880
I mean people just see that hat and they
lose their fucking mind and he trolls

1595
01:27:48,881 --> 01:27:51,250
half the country and it's a
similar thing with the other,

1596
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:52,930
with when businesses do
it, I'm going like guys,

1597
01:27:52,931 --> 01:27:57,460
don't be rubes like it's very obvious
that it's just an act and if you're a fan

1598
01:27:57,461 --> 01:27:58,300
of mixed martial arts,

1599
01:27:58,510 --> 01:28:02,020
you have to appreciate the fact that some
guys are taking chances and trying to

1600
01:28:02,021 --> 01:28:03,310
generate interest. You can,

1601
01:28:03,311 --> 01:28:07,060
every guy can't just be put on a suit
and be straight for showcased and I

1602
01:28:07,061 --> 01:28:07,900
respect my show

1603
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:10,830
at some point. You want to go
a little story? Yeah, yeah.

1604
01:28:10,831 --> 01:28:12,390
I mean he makes juice here,

1605
01:28:12,540 --> 01:28:16,980
but the bottom line is we put all that
shit aside and just look at what he's

1606
01:28:16,981 --> 01:28:19,830
doing. You look at it, he's doing
it like that guy's extraordinary.

1607
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:22,910
Like the fact that he could do that to
Robbie Lawler completely shut down his

1608
01:28:23,050 --> 01:28:25,590
off offense and just put a beating
on him. Just stay on top of him.

1609
01:28:25,591 --> 01:28:27,840
Never give them any air.
I never give him any air.

1610
01:28:27,841 --> 01:28:31,350
The pace is smothering and it's
striking. Looked really good. Very good.

1611
01:28:31,410 --> 01:28:34,800
I mean very, very, very takes
a shot. Takes the shot. Great.

1612
01:28:34,801 --> 01:28:37,850
And his cardio is off
the fucking charts. Yeah,

1613
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:40,890
it's a that, that whole one 70 right now.

1614
01:28:40,891 --> 01:28:43,890
That whole division is
looking crazy right now. Yeah.

1615
01:28:43,891 --> 01:28:48,450
Nate Diaz being back in the mix and
a Mazda, Mazda and Nate seems like,

1616
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:52,920
just like if you're a fan of just like
if you're from a poor neighborhood that

1617
01:28:52,921 --> 01:28:55,500
is like the superstar match.
I like where I grew up.

1618
01:28:55,501 --> 01:28:56,880
It's just shitty like environment.

1619
01:28:56,881 --> 01:29:00,840
It's like that was like the perfect who
hood rat fucking guys who are going to

1620
01:29:00,841 --> 01:29:01,980
talk. They're going to go

1621
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:05,370
in there and fight it. God, it's
so awesome. I love so much money.

1622
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:06,780
That's why it's going to be so giant.

1623
01:29:07,290 --> 01:29:10,230
While it was cool that Dana White at
the post-fight press conference he got

1624
01:29:10,231 --> 01:29:12,240
asked, cause you know
he had famously said,

1625
01:29:12,241 --> 01:29:15,810
I think once that Nate Diaz doesn't
move the needle or something like along

1626
01:29:15,811 --> 01:29:20,640
those lines negotiated. But he, he
basically said, he goes, I think Nate,

1627
01:29:20,641 --> 01:29:25,200
besides, uh, Connor and Ronda Rousey
is like about as big a star as MMA has.

1628
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:29,430
Like, they did crazy good
numbers. Everyone, the arena
was going nuts for him.

1629
01:29:29,650 --> 01:29:30,031
He was,

1630
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:34,560
he walked out yesterday or Saturday night
when he walked out the fucking place.

1631
01:29:34,590 --> 01:29:35,520
Roared,

1632
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:39,720
I mean as loud as anybody as
loud as any main event person,

1633
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:41,640
whether it's Steve Bay or DC.

1634
01:29:41,670 --> 01:29:44,820
Nate Diaz got the biggest roar and
then he had a great performance,

1635
01:29:44,930 --> 01:29:45,840
I believe in leading up to it.

1636
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:48,270
People were talking about Nate coming
back more than they were talking about the

1637
01:29:48,271 --> 01:29:49,980
heavyweight title. I don't think,

1638
01:29:50,490 --> 01:29:53,670
I don't think some people in the UFC
realize how big a star he really is.

1639
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:58,050
I think they thought that the Conor
fight, Connor was the big star.

1640
01:29:58,051 --> 01:30:00,150
Nate beat him. The Conor
won the second fight.

1641
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:04,410
Connor still remains the big superstar.
I think Nate is equally as big as star,

1642
01:30:04,710 --> 01:30:08,250
but I think that Scott is, Connor's
maybe an old worldwide's like,

1643
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:12,030
but in America, Nate Diaz is a giant
fucking star. Not as big as Connor,

1644
01:30:12,031 --> 01:30:16,350
but a tier below maybe
the credit Connor levels.

1645
01:30:16,990 --> 01:30:20,940
You have to say he won the two
fights. I mean, if you take,

1646
01:30:20,941 --> 01:30:22,680
who would you rather be
in the two fights? I mean,

1647
01:30:22,681 --> 01:30:26,940
he choked Connor out face down in the
first one and then had like a raise our

1648
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:30,060
clothes. Unbelievable.
Great fight the second time.

1649
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:32,620
So I mean he comes out of that
looking pretty good. Yeah.

1650
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:36,960
But I think it's a testament
to how popular Connor is
because that's the fucking

1651
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:41,010
Connor shine and it was a dance and
Nate brought it and Nate has that story.

1652
01:30:41,011 --> 01:30:44,250
The one on one fight. It's
turning into this star button.

1653
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:47,190
If he never danced with Connor,
would he be that big to know?

1654
01:30:47,191 --> 01:30:50,830
I don't know know that cause Nate
was, but that's him for years before.

1655
01:30:51,570 --> 01:30:53,880
He's always, he's the fucking
like do the double middle fingers.

1656
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:56,010
Like there's so many moments where
you could, where you're like,

1657
01:30:56,011 --> 01:30:58,680
I get goosebumps thinking about nasal
fine. That's your favorite part.

1658
01:30:58,681 --> 01:31:02,940
When he's like, these are the
fingers that take [inaudible].

1659
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:05,700
He said fuck you a,
you're in the triangle.

1660
01:31:06,310 --> 01:31:11,310
You got in the triangle and fucking best
him double fingers and flexed and he

1661
01:31:12,641 --> 01:31:15,990
was losing that fight too. Yeah.
And then he tried was grassed.

1662
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:19,350
Oh and then yeah. Then the Donald
Serone fight third round, they come out.

1663
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:22,410
They're so fucking good dude.
Nate's, once again, it's just,

1664
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:25,080
you don't have to be a mixed martial
arts fan and you got to be a human and go

1665
01:31:25,081 --> 01:31:28,050
like that's a fucking fighter. That is
something that everyone wants to watch.

1666
01:31:28,340 --> 01:31:31,920
I hope he makes it an actual belt
cause he's saying he's got the baddest

1667
01:31:31,921 --> 01:31:34,830
motherfucker in the game belt.
Then who wants to defend, you know,

1668
01:31:34,831 --> 01:31:37,890
who wants to be next to challenge for
the baddest motherfucker in the game belt

1669
01:31:38,190 --> 01:31:41,400
and a, I love that. I love that.
That's his marketing strategy.

1670
01:31:41,401 --> 01:31:45,420
He should really legitimately get a
belt made up bad as motherfucker in the

1671
01:31:45,421 --> 01:31:49,890
game. I'm sure the old UFC belt, UFC
isn't using that old belt anymore.

1672
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:54,120
I'm like you have a bat, UFC baddest
mother fucker in the game belt and just,

1673
01:31:54,150 --> 01:31:55,980
just, just change the
outside a little bit.

1674
01:31:56,250 --> 01:31:59,900
Was He smoking weed for real
in the uh, in open workouts?

1675
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:03,730
Is he going to get in trouble for no,
no, no. It's totally legal in California.

1676
01:32:03,731 --> 01:32:04,451
And when you task,

1677
01:32:04,451 --> 01:32:07,990
do you have to literally be high while
you're fighting for you to test positive?

1678
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:09,910
You saw it dropped it all way, way down.

1679
01:32:10,770 --> 01:32:14,050
Well but so many people use it to sleep.
So many people use it for pain relief.

1680
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:17,710
Particularly with CBD when it's
one to one. This is like these are,

1681
01:32:17,890 --> 01:32:22,660
these are one to one THC and CBD and
they think that it's actually more

1682
01:32:22,661 --> 01:32:23,620
effective for both.

1683
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:28,621
It actually calms you down a little
bit with the CBD along with the THC.

1684
01:32:28,631 --> 01:32:29,350
So it may,

1685
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:33,250
it might actually alleviate some anxiety
that's associated with getting to high

1686
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:36,130
when that makes sense. Cause that's
how it comes in the plant, right.

1687
01:32:36,131 --> 01:32:39,430
Is like both parts. Well yeah.
Yeah, I guess, except it's,

1688
01:32:39,570 --> 01:32:44,320
I think CBD, it doesn't come as
big. So to get one in one, you know.

1689
01:32:44,610 --> 01:32:48,190
Okay. You smoke a joint, how much
CBD you're smoking. I have no idea.

1690
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:51,430
I have no question. Do you even get
CBD when you just smoke a joint?

1691
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:55,570
You have never heard of CBD until it
wasn't in the joint anymore by itself.

1692
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:59,230
Well t THC is one of many,
many cannabinoids, right?

1693
01:32:59,231 --> 01:33:02,200
Isn't there like 19 of them or something
crazy like that? Is that what it was,

1694
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:05,200
Jamie 18 yeah, that's
a, okay. I don't know.

1695
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:10,000
I think the plant itself is what's magic.

1696
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:13,740
It's a crazy goddamn plant that we're
finally getting to appreciate and it's

1697
01:33:13,741 --> 01:33:17,290
still, there's a lot of places where
you still have to buy hemp from Canada.

1698
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:22,710
I'm like large scale hemp production
hasn't really caught on with a good

1699
01:33:22,781 --> 01:33:25,870
percentage of his country cause I used
to be like one of one of the major crops

1700
01:33:25,871 --> 01:33:28,840
that people would grow. You can make
clothes out of it, you could eat it.

1701
01:33:29,050 --> 01:33:31,570
It makes this shit called hempcrete.

1702
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:36,930
It's like this insanely durable concrete
that's made with hemp to fucking nutty

1703
01:33:37,211 --> 01:33:41,020
plant man. It really is like
the stock of a hemp tree.

1704
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:44,740
Like got my friend Todd McCormick had
one sitting on his desk once and you pick

1705
01:33:44,741 --> 01:33:49,030
it up. It's like, what is this from
another world? It's hard like hard,

1706
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:52,190
but light is Balsa Wood.
Lightest Styrofoam. Wait,

1707
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:56,610
does that have any sense than weed?
No, no. I mean there's just the,

1708
01:33:56,611 --> 01:33:58,960
the differences. Hamp is not psychoactive.

1709
01:33:58,990 --> 01:34:03,990
It's like a psychoactive form of
the same sort of a kind of plants.

1710
01:34:04,210 --> 01:34:08,950
But regular marijuana also is hemp,
right? Because what hemp is is the fibers.

1711
01:34:09,190 --> 01:34:11,980
So what we're using to get
high is the buds, right?

1712
01:34:11,981 --> 01:34:13,870
The stems and all the
other leaves and shit.

1713
01:34:13,871 --> 01:34:18,370
But that fiber of the plant itself
is insanely durable and really light.

1714
01:34:18,550 --> 01:34:22,510
And that's the shit they turn into clothes
and to string and to all this and to

1715
01:34:22,511 --> 01:34:27,010
paper canvas. The first canvas was
made with hemp, all that stuff.

1716
01:34:27,070 --> 01:34:31,630
That's why it was can that then the word
cannabis or canvas comes from cannabis.

1717
01:34:31,970 --> 01:34:35,020
That's, that's why it's called canvas.
But they did everything with him.

1718
01:34:35,290 --> 01:34:36,370
But it's just hard to do, man.

1719
01:34:36,371 --> 01:34:39,190
They just have to beat it down like
these slave labor most of the time.

1720
01:34:39,610 --> 01:34:43,420
And then the 1930 some dude came up with
something called a decorticator in is

1721
01:34:43,421 --> 01:34:46,990
a, a machine where you can
effectively process the hemp fiber.

1722
01:34:47,290 --> 01:34:50,140
And that's when they started going
crazy with the reefer madness shit.

1723
01:34:50,290 --> 01:34:55,240
It was all an economic
slave shop, jazz and jazz.

1724
01:34:57,040 --> 01:35:00,140
They already had, everybody was
already doing it. I mean, that was,

1725
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:03,740
that was something that was a
normal thing with people. It was a,

1726
01:35:03,750 --> 01:35:08,750
it wasn't until they decided to make
it illegal that it became this weird

1727
01:35:08,781 --> 01:35:10,440
fucking thing that nobody could, uh,

1728
01:35:10,790 --> 01:35:13,730
nobody could do something that
they'd been doing for so long before.

1729
01:35:13,850 --> 01:35:14,540
Where are they made there?

1730
01:35:14,540 --> 01:35:18,670
Aren't they making mushrooms and
acid legal somewhere, by the way?

1731
01:35:18,671 --> 01:35:22,520
They were [inaudible] fucking heavyweight
champion. The world just called.

1732
01:35:22,610 --> 01:35:26,900
Sorry. Oh Shit. Name-Dropping yeah, he
looks good. One fuck would a crazy fight.

1733
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:31,400
Wow. Did I read that somewhere?
They're going to be their donut. Maybe.

1734
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:35,570
I mean, that guy who's like a
rocky movie. Just the change. Yeah,

1735
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:40,250
the turn and that fight was so crazy.
Look, DC's my very good friend.

1736
01:35:40,251 --> 01:35:42,800
I love him to death. I
love that guy. It's hard.

1737
01:35:42,801 --> 01:35:46,580
It's hard watching a friend
that you really love a get
his ass kicked and that's

1738
01:35:46,581 --> 01:35:49,970
what happened. He was looking great.
Yeah, he was a really great look. He's,

1739
01:35:50,090 --> 01:35:52,230
he's an awesome person,
man. I love that dude.

1740
01:35:52,310 --> 01:35:55,190
And doing commentary with him
is the most hilarious, fun time.

1741
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:58,550
He's such a good guy. He's
great commentary. He's very,

1742
01:35:58,551 --> 01:36:02,780
very articulate and smart. He's one
of the best that does it, Andy. Uh,

1743
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:05,390
yeah, dude, it sucks.
It's just you see that,

1744
01:36:05,391 --> 01:36:08,420
you see the pain on his face when he
loses a fight. He does not like losing.

1745
01:36:08,421 --> 01:36:10,760
He is not, it doesn't, but neither
the steeper, you know what I mean?

1746
01:36:10,761 --> 01:36:12,590
And this is what, that's
what it's all about.

1747
01:36:12,591 --> 01:36:16,040
Those two guys I have deep respect
for Steve Bay too. I've been,

1748
01:36:16,130 --> 01:36:18,650
I was saying forever that
I thought it was fucked up,

1749
01:36:18,651 --> 01:36:22,430
that he was not going to get a title
shot, not going to get a rematch.

1750
01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:24,560
Instead they were going to have him
fight Brock Lesnar. I'm like, look,

1751
01:36:24,561 --> 01:36:26,180
the fight is supposed to be Steve Bay.

1752
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:30,170
He was the most successful heavyweight
ever won four title fights,

1753
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:33,290
won the title and then defended it three
times. No one's ever done that before.

1754
01:36:33,291 --> 01:36:37,820
Right? So that was the giant in the
guys he beat. We're fucking really good.

1755
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:41,360
And it's not just like you gave it
prime, it'd be one thing if you said,

1756
01:36:41,510 --> 01:36:42,230
you know, uh,

1757
01:36:42,230 --> 01:36:45,260
he got knocked out in the first round so
we're going to give the first crack to

1758
01:36:45,261 --> 01:36:48,650
this number one contender who's
like on a, on a tear or something.

1759
01:36:48,830 --> 01:36:52,100
But to just say Brock Lesnar,
because this is a big, it was,

1760
01:36:52,101 --> 01:36:56,390
it was the most naked example of this is
just for pay per view buys is that kind

1761
01:36:56,510 --> 01:37:00,500
of sucks for steep bay. Yeah. It sucks
for Steepbank and I'm glad it didn't,

1762
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:03,890
didn't happen. I'm glad that
Steve Pay got his chance.

1763
01:37:04,130 --> 01:37:08,580
Cause just out of respect for
the sport and respect for the,

1764
01:37:08,581 --> 01:37:13,010
the true champions of the sport, like did
some matter what marketability or not,

1765
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:17,060
that guy is the best champion
that's ever been in the game.

1766
01:37:17,210 --> 01:37:19,250
He's the best heavyweight
champion of all time.

1767
01:37:19,730 --> 01:37:24,730
So like to not what recognize that and
not like that should be a big deal.

1768
01:37:24,890 --> 01:37:27,320
No, I agree with you.
That should be the fight.

1769
01:37:27,321 --> 01:37:30,350
But the money of the Brock Lesnar fight
would have been so immense that if

1770
01:37:30,351 --> 01:37:32,420
you're a company that makes entertainment,

1771
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:36,500
this is why it's kind of
like UFC in some ways.

1772
01:37:36,890 --> 01:37:41,580
There's a marriage of entertainment
and of sport because debate,

1773
01:37:41,670 --> 01:37:44,780
I mean the people are the ones who are
buying the paper views and showing for

1774
01:37:44,781 --> 01:37:45,810
it. So if more of them,

1775
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:49,610
what's good for the goose is good for the
gander because you get Brock Lesnar to

1776
01:37:49,611 --> 01:37:52,770
come on a card, you get massive,
massive eyes on it and then you get,

1777
01:37:53,090 --> 01:37:56,430
every time you do that, there's
a percentage of people who stay

1778
01:37:56,430 --> 01:37:59,510
fans and become hardcore fans and tell
people about it. And then there's,

1779
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:02,700
there's real value there
for everybody. So, um, yeah,

1780
01:38:02,730 --> 01:38:04,890
but the heavyweight championship of
the world is supposed to be the most

1781
01:38:04,891 --> 01:38:09,060
procedures and you don't see that in any
other sport where a guy will be coming

1782
01:38:09,061 --> 01:38:11,580
off a loss before years removed. You know,

1783
01:38:11,610 --> 01:38:15,540
test positive for steroids and then
just get a title shot. Um, and you know,

1784
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:18,240
that's the way of putting it. Yeah,
that is a good, very good point.

1785
01:38:18,241 --> 01:38:20,910
I what I want to see more
even than the DC thing,

1786
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:25,470
I want to see Francis and [inaudible]
to cause Francis and [inaudible] just

1787
01:38:25,471 --> 01:38:30,210
destroyed Cain and junior dos Santos who
if you guys were met just a few years

1788
01:38:30,210 --> 01:38:33,000
ago, those were the guys,
Kim Call Him God zealous,

1789
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:35,670
the heavyweight division and
he just destroyed both of them.

1790
01:38:35,730 --> 01:38:38,250
He looks like he got his confidence
back. He looks at, you know,

1791
01:38:38,251 --> 01:38:41,790
like I want to see that
rematch. Yeah. I'm a,

1792
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:46,650
I'm terrified for everybody who gets
in the octagon every time he fights

1793
01:38:46,651 --> 01:38:48,960
somebody. I'm like, cause I remember,

1794
01:38:48,961 --> 01:38:52,590
I remember I still have like shell shock
for watching Alster Overeem get hit

1795
01:38:52,591 --> 01:38:53,424
with that left hook.

1796
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:56,930
I remember that was the hardest
knockout I've ever seen ever.

1797
01:38:57,540 --> 01:39:00,840
No one's gonna survive that. It
looked like the back of Ellisor.

1798
01:39:00,860 --> 01:39:05,520
Overeem's head touched his
ankles. I was like, no one,

1799
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:08,700
everyone's going out from that. Everyone's
going out cold. That's the payload.

1800
01:39:08,701 --> 01:39:09,330
The heavyweights.

1801
01:39:09,330 --> 01:39:12,900
You just have to like have so much
respect because it's like holy shit dude,

1802
01:39:12,901 --> 01:39:17,901
like you're getting in there and it's
just like at any moment you're just gone.

1803
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:23,010
I'd rather fight a heavyweight than like
135 pound or though just to be hitting

1804
01:39:23,220 --> 01:39:27,180
a thousand times in the
head. That's the punch bro.

1805
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,100
That should be a tee shirt
like just the silhouette.

1806
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:33,090
It's interesting you say
that with the DC we're like,

1807
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:37,920
I just know him and he's like as little
as we know Mickey Gall as much as like

1808
01:39:38,130 --> 01:39:39,840
we've been friends with him
for a short amount of time.

1809
01:39:39,841 --> 01:39:43,830
Even like when he fights there's some
different like stakes on it but as a buddy

1810
01:39:43,831 --> 01:39:48,240
you're like Tommy and you must see that
a lie and you're calling it like you

1811
01:39:48,241 --> 01:39:52,680
can't really put my chart for me when
cowboy fights I root against this bar.

1812
01:39:52,830 --> 01:39:57,210
Actually that was really hard
when Brendan was widening.

1813
01:39:57,370 --> 01:40:01,410
I was really hard cause I'm real tight
with him. We're really good friends.

1814
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:04,710
And when, when he wasn't really doing
it anymore, it was, he was still in it,

1815
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:07,110
but he wasn't really like 100% in,

1816
01:40:07,111 --> 01:40:09,780
he was thinking about other things he
was thinking about when he gets out.

1817
01:40:09,990 --> 01:40:13,020
It wasn't, it didn't have the same focus
and intensity and trainings used to.

1818
01:40:13,410 --> 01:40:16,260
That's hard. That's not the
sport to do that. And you know,

1819
01:40:16,261 --> 01:40:19,470
it's hard when whenever you
thinking about getting out, get out,

1820
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:22,470
get out because there's people that
aren't thinking about getting out and you

1821
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:24,030
got to think about what we
were talking about earlier.

1822
01:40:24,031 --> 01:40:27,300
Like Mike Tyson is prime angry
at everything. Like if you,

1823
01:40:27,330 --> 01:40:30,630
you're thinking about getting out and
you've run in front of a guy like that,

1824
01:40:30,690 --> 01:40:32,010
you know, or a girl like that.

1825
01:40:32,011 --> 01:40:33,990
There's this female kickboxers
that are like that too.

1826
01:40:34,110 --> 01:40:36,840
They're just fucking vicious man. And
they're waiting. You think you're,

1827
01:40:36,990 --> 01:40:40,830
you're half in half out thinking about
cheerleading, wham Shin to the face.

1828
01:40:41,190 --> 01:40:41,431
You know,

1829
01:40:41,431 --> 01:40:44,400
you gotta be all saying at the end for
anything could've been beaten by a woman.

1830
01:40:44,490 --> 01:40:47,280
Yes. Am I following you correctly?

1831
01:40:49,170 --> 01:40:52,740
The fucking highest levels of any
combat sport. You have to be all in.

1832
01:40:52,990 --> 01:40:53,980
I don't think. I don't think

1833
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:55,180
that's something you could dabble in.

1834
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:57,980
Yeah. It's a hard thing though,
because I think in MMA, you know,

1835
01:40:58,790 --> 01:41:00,620
Luckily Brendan is a, you
know, podcast or comedian.

1836
01:41:00,621 --> 01:41:02,600
I think a lot of other guys,
they don't have the same,

1837
01:41:03,530 --> 01:41:06,680
but they could do other stuff like Tyron
Woodley's wrapping Tyron Woodley as

1838
01:41:06,681 --> 01:41:10,340
businesses. I know he's doing
something with CBD. I know he's got a,

1839
01:41:10,341 --> 01:41:14,180
he did a record with Wiz Khalifa.
I know he does a lot of TMZ stuff.

1840
01:41:14,420 --> 01:41:15,230
He's a funny dude.

1841
01:41:15,230 --> 01:41:17,600
I think you have to become the
[inaudible] look tyrants champion,

1842
01:41:17,601 --> 01:41:21,110
smart champion though. It's like he
has a huge name was, but he's still,

1843
01:41:21,140 --> 01:41:23,750
he's working. See, he lost
his title. That was gone,

1844
01:41:23,751 --> 01:41:25,450
but yet he's still doing
all these other things.

1845
01:41:25,470 --> 01:41:27,960
Of course, but I think it's easier
when you, when you have that name,

1846
01:41:27,961 --> 01:41:29,460
you're a former UFC champion.

1847
01:41:29,461 --> 01:41:32,880
I think that alone will probably sort
of set you up as long as you're not an

1848
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:36,390
idiot for the rest of your life. But
they're guys that never get to that very,

1849
01:41:36,391 --> 01:41:40,770
very top. And if they don't sort of
set themselves up for afterwards,

1850
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:42,900
they're going to, you know, when you
think about getting out, you're like,

1851
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:44,170
Shit Dude. The reason they
take those fights there was,

1852
01:41:44,190 --> 01:41:46,380
what was that one documentary
I saw where the guy was like,

1853
01:41:46,950 --> 01:41:50,770
you've got like crazy brain injuries
and, and his family was just like, dude,

1854
01:41:50,771 --> 01:41:52,380
don't take another fight.
And he still had to take it.

1855
01:41:52,381 --> 01:41:55,080
He's had to pay the bills. And it was
just like, there was just no other option.

1856
01:41:55,081 --> 01:41:57,060
He was like barely making money at a gym.

1857
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:00,690
So that's the thing where it's like
is a sport where you're all in.

1858
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:04,710
And then once it kind of shit hits the
fan, I said it reminds me of comedy.

1859
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:08,160
Cause like it takes a minimum five to
10 years to figure out if you're gonna

1860
01:42:08,161 --> 01:42:10,230
even be good enough to do
it professionally. Right.

1861
01:42:10,470 --> 01:42:11,970
And then at that point
it's your whole life.

1862
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:14,540
So this way university people
quitting, nobody quit school.

1863
01:42:14,770 --> 01:42:18,900
You see a lot of people that maybe they
started like 20 and like by 30 they're

1864
01:42:18,901 --> 01:42:21,510
10 years in and if it's
not working out for you,

1865
01:42:21,660 --> 01:42:26,660
you took the 10 years when you were
supposed to be figuring out where the

1866
01:42:26,821 --> 01:42:30,660
trajectory of like everyone you knew
from high school figured out a job,

1867
01:42:30,661 --> 01:42:33,210
got a house, got mad or
whatever, you know, age that now,

1868
01:42:33,211 --> 01:42:38,190
because you could do comedy for six
months and have a youtube video that makes

1869
01:42:38,191 --> 01:42:43,191
you a a where you can make 25 grand on
a Sunday doing one Sunday show at an

1870
01:42:43,411 --> 01:42:46,140
Improv. But have you watched that
guy's youtube channel? That's rare.

1871
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:50,130
That doesn't happen too often.
I think it's rare that there's,

1872
01:42:50,131 --> 01:42:53,340
you know guys who are doing comedy for
six months that are making six months.

1873
01:42:53,341 --> 01:42:55,350
Sure, sure, sure. The extreme
example. Yeah, for sure.

1874
01:42:55,550 --> 01:42:58,590
It should mean thing does.
It doesn't. I'm just saying,

1875
01:42:58,591 --> 01:43:02,180
I'm just making a point that it's not
really, there's so many alternatives now,

1876
01:43:04,790 --> 01:43:09,430
but even with food, like Lewis said, like
I agree technically in like the, the,

1877
01:43:09,431 --> 01:43:11,820
the growth of someone
like 10 years in, they,

1878
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:14,070
they got their legs under
them like good nick.

1879
01:43:14,071 --> 01:43:17,640
Now they can start figuring out
what their is going to be exactly.

1880
01:43:17,790 --> 01:43:21,720
And find their market. That's what
you become like a honed great comic.

1881
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:22,680
Hopefully, you know,

1882
01:43:22,681 --> 01:43:26,880
but like you can get popular and have
to work into the pressure of a soul deaf

1883
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:31,490
theater it three years in the comedy.
That is crazy. It's crazy. I couldn't,

1884
01:43:31,590 --> 01:43:35,010
I couldn't Charlie my possibly
imagine that doing Charlie Murphy a

1885
01:43:35,050 --> 01:43:37,120
d d did it even more insane way.

1886
01:43:37,121 --> 01:43:40,740
He was famous first and then he
became an open miker. That's,

1887
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:41,870
that's gotta be challenging.

1888
01:43:42,580 --> 01:43:46,720
Lot sold out shows all he practices
only is doing giant shows right.

1889
01:43:46,721 --> 01:43:50,680
Where everybody's coming to see him and
Don l and all these other Connell's like

1890
01:43:50,681 --> 01:43:52,030
killer by the way. He's, yeah,

1891
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:55,640
he's going up with like monsters in the
Chappelle show. Right. Jeremy Pivot.

1892
01:43:55,810 --> 01:43:57,940
Hello Jeremy Pivot and
stuff. He's Brandon.

1893
01:43:58,180 --> 01:44:00,590
Brandon was a star when he started
doing comedy. He was already known,

1894
01:44:00,591 --> 01:44:03,770
very know Sue's already
known as a UFC fighter. Yeah.

1895
01:44:03,790 --> 01:44:08,790
But what Charlie Murphy did was do like
these sold out fucking shows and he was

1896
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:11,990
practicing. Yeah. Like
I mean I don't think,

1897
01:44:12,050 --> 01:44:17,050
I don't know how much time he spent before
he went ups on stage the first time,

1898
01:44:18,110 --> 01:44:19,670
like knowing that he was
going to do stand up.

1899
01:44:19,671 --> 01:44:24,671
I think it was also famous
from the Chappelle show and
from two of the greatest

1900
01:44:26,241 --> 01:44:30,620
comedy sketches ever done that Dave
Chappelle was acting out for them and they

1901
01:44:30,621 --> 01:44:34,180
were so funny. And so the is visitation
fee. He's going to be fucking,

1902
01:44:34,510 --> 01:44:36,620
so any expectation when you go in is like,

1903
01:44:36,740 --> 01:44:40,580
I'm going to see like the
greatest comedian in the
country and he's doing like

1904
01:44:40,581 --> 01:44:44,000
his third set that he's
ever done. That's crazy.

1905
01:44:44,410 --> 01:44:48,440
Comedy is the only art form that you
practice in front of the audience.

1906
01:44:48,770 --> 01:44:50,750
There's nothing else or
you ha and you have to,

1907
01:44:50,780 --> 01:44:55,080
the only way to do it is practice in
front of painters apartment in Washington.

1908
01:44:55,870 --> 01:44:59,300
Everyone else gets a master of their
craft by themselves in a fuck, whatever.

1909
01:44:59,301 --> 01:45:01,070
It's, it can be mixed
martial arts in a gym.

1910
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:03,380
It could be in a garage or
in a band, whatever it is.

1911
01:45:03,381 --> 01:45:04,790
Everyone else gets to figure it out.

1912
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:09,080
But we from moment one is this naked
thing where like, all right, well let me,

1913
01:45:09,081 --> 01:45:11,060
and it's so douchey. I think
back to the first time,

1914
01:45:11,061 --> 01:45:14,120
like what fucking type of asshole would
even give it a shot the first time?

1915
01:45:14,150 --> 01:45:16,550
It's like going, hey, I just
wrote this song today and they go,

1916
01:45:16,551 --> 01:45:21,050
well fucking sucks. I'm not going to
clap for that terrible. You just wrote

1917
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:25,310
next. They wouldn't, they would just
go at the end of it, they'd go, yeah,

1918
01:45:25,311 --> 01:45:27,950
you played a song, you can
make a song in a vacuum.

1919
01:45:28,190 --> 01:45:31,730
I mean you can just guys who have created
the most amazing fucking songs and

1920
01:45:31,731 --> 01:45:35,390
then they let you play them or let you
listen to them and you're like, whoa.

1921
01:45:35,510 --> 01:45:36,890
Like how long have you
guys been working on this?

1922
01:45:36,891 --> 01:45:39,500
Like if you have friends that are in
a band and they're like four months,

1923
01:45:39,740 --> 01:45:42,770
like holy shit. They can do it all.

1924
01:45:42,890 --> 01:45:45,770
It put it together from start to finish
without anybody else involved other than

1925
01:45:45,771 --> 01:45:50,660
the producers in them. We can't do
that. No we can't. Anybody tries.

1926
01:45:50,661 --> 01:45:52,590
It's crazy. Did somebody to,

1927
01:45:52,710 --> 01:45:57,380
somebody tried to do a studio stand
up album? I didn't somewhat know.

1928
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:02,960
Well there was this special Carmichael
directed draw Michaels and that's right.

1929
01:46:03,980 --> 01:46:08,030
No, no audience con
show. Yeah, hang on. No,

1930
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:14,430
that room just got quiet. Everyone
trying to not shit under Michael now.

1931
01:46:14,470 --> 01:46:18,530
You know, I was just doing question
of his audience. I was quite confused.

1932
01:46:18,870 --> 01:46:21,440
I was like, it was confusing. But what
are you doing? You're drew Michael.

1933
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:25,430
You're a young comic. 10 years in HBO.
You're like, I gotta deal with fuck,

1934
01:46:25,550 --> 01:46:27,860
I gotta do it. Drunk HOK wants
to produce it and no audience.

1935
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:28,833
Let's see what happens.

1936
01:46:28,850 --> 01:46:32,750
You could feel anything other than weird
doing standard that you used to doing

1937
01:46:32,751 --> 01:46:34,340
in front of an audience to know audience.

1938
01:46:34,341 --> 01:46:37,670
You would be fighting feeling weird
the entire time you were talking.

1939
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:39,620
Cause you know you're,
there's no one there.

1940
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:42,620
So you just taught me into
a camera. You gotta tell.

1941
01:46:42,750 --> 01:46:46,490
So there's two audiences watching to be
honest with you, needs a laugh track.

1942
01:46:46,491 --> 01:46:50,310
The reason laugh tracks exist on TV
shows is because the the audience,

1943
01:46:50,311 --> 01:46:51,840
sometimes they just need to be told die.

1944
01:46:51,860 --> 01:46:55,350
Here's the moment they don't go Caribbean
enthusiasm doesn't have a laugh track.

1945
01:46:55,351 --> 01:46:57,510
It's one of the funny shows them all
the time. I don't know if you need the,

1946
01:46:57,511 --> 01:47:01,490
it's not the laugh track, it's what's
the energy that creates just that.

1947
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:03,630
You're watching like this before,
like you're part of something.

1948
01:47:03,631 --> 01:47:06,810
Everyone's like, you're supposed to be
laughing along with them. Like laughing.

1949
01:47:07,140 --> 01:47:08,310
If a guy, if, if,

1950
01:47:08,430 --> 01:47:11,970
if drew Michael came to you in person
and started saying those funny things to

1951
01:47:11,971 --> 01:47:14,400
you, like with that tone you'd
be like, this is uncomfortable.

1952
01:47:14,401 --> 01:47:17,730
Even the funny thing you took away
from me, dude, you feel weird doing,

1953
01:47:17,731 --> 01:47:19,550
you feel we already hit a punch on the go.

1954
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:24,390
If there's like just you and him
as too, it's too intimate, right?

1955
01:47:24,391 --> 01:47:25,200
You're not even,

1956
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:30,100
but it's not a you when you do in standup
like you and one person, I couldn't,

1957
01:47:30,150 --> 01:47:32,040
right. Who the fuck would
ever talk like that?

1958
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:34,110
That whole works in front of large people.

1959
01:47:34,111 --> 01:47:37,440
So you taking something that only
works in front of groups of pms.

1960
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:40,540
Do you ever go to a convenience store
and the guy working there is looking at

1961
01:47:40,650 --> 01:47:44,430
you like you're not gonna but why are you
saying it like this? This is so weird.

1962
01:47:44,431 --> 01:47:47,880
So I says, I says comedy
is not just talking.

1963
01:47:47,881 --> 01:47:51,360
It is using the pauses and using the
timing and using the moments where they're

1964
01:47:51,361 --> 01:47:55,110
supposed to laugh. There's so much
more to it than just sang the jokes.

1965
01:47:55,590 --> 01:47:57,360
You know that that's the
side of what, where you go.

1966
01:47:57,361 --> 01:48:00,810
It's like I just don't as an experiment,
I get it as like a youtube video.

1967
01:48:00,811 --> 01:48:03,090
I get it. But as as
your first big special,

1968
01:48:03,091 --> 01:48:07,140
I would want there to be an audience
there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Probably upset.

1969
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:12,270
But I think Daraja is just a creative guy
and he had this idea and they just ran

1970
01:48:12,271 --> 01:48:14,040
with it. I heard he wants
to do it for himself.

1971
01:48:14,650 --> 01:48:19,110
Where do you see as the disease one
where Spike Jones on stage and the whole

1972
01:48:19,111 --> 01:48:23,690
time and they filmed it where Lee could
see like the back behind the stuff.

1973
01:48:23,910 --> 01:48:26,910
People like sweeping people
mulling around in the back.

1974
01:48:27,090 --> 01:48:30,090
I found it distracting
six strangely distracting.

1975
01:48:30,290 --> 01:48:33,030
Just I didn't understand why
that would be a good idea.

1976
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:37,320
You don't have to get like you happened
to be filming all we up in the film as

1977
01:48:37,530 --> 01:48:39,870
he's working out here and you see a
bunch of people in the backyard but it

1978
01:48:39,871 --> 01:48:42,090
doesn't matter. The material's
good. You'll enjoy this.

1979
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:47,350
This is a fucking scratch. You're
intentionally making it with concepts.

1980
01:48:47,700 --> 01:48:50,910
If you want of concept to the thing or
concept like kind of bookend the show,

1981
01:48:50,911 --> 01:48:55,480
like the show. It seems like it's all
like, Hey, look over here to be like,

1982
01:48:55,570 --> 01:48:58,830
I really didn't have like a an hour.
I'm super happy with, I'm not even,

1983
01:48:58,831 --> 01:49:01,890
I haven't seen the material of it
to know. I'm not saying as he's,

1984
01:49:01,980 --> 01:49:04,200
it's not a good hour. I just feel
like when you're throwing flour,

1985
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:08,580
I would want less fluff to draw, to draw,
to like, hey, listen to these jokes.

1986
01:49:08,581 --> 01:49:12,420
Like please don't pay attention that like
we have the first ever overhead three

1987
01:49:12,421 --> 01:49:15,990
d camera like on the shot like
Jones. So I think you don't get it.

1988
01:49:15,991 --> 01:49:17,850
I think it's one of those
things where it's like, hey man,

1989
01:49:17,851 --> 01:49:19,860
I'd love it if you directed
it. And he'd be like, okay,

1990
01:49:19,861 --> 01:49:22,620
but I want to do something different.
Right. And then you're like, I trust you.

1991
01:49:22,621 --> 01:49:25,470
You're a master at what you do. I'm a
master when I do, let's collaborate.

1992
01:49:25,770 --> 01:49:28,980
And I get it. It was like, um,
when, uh, Steve Jobs, he, the,

1993
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:30,300
the first apple logo,

1994
01:49:30,700 --> 01:49:34,890
he just paid $250,000 for and the
deal was he didn't get any revisions.

1995
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:38,610
He got to like have a conversation
about what he wanted to feel.

1996
01:49:38,790 --> 01:49:41,490
And then this weird fucking artist
went and created the logo and was like,

1997
01:49:41,491 --> 01:49:46,140
here it is. And that's that.
Hmm. Okay. That's a bad deal.

1998
01:49:47,050 --> 01:49:49,970
Maybe Steve Jobs is not the business
man we imagined because a lot of money,

1999
01:49:50,110 --> 01:49:54,730
if you, he trusts it each may or may not
use your fucking desires. He to see it

2000
01:49:56,770 --> 01:49:58,950
[inaudible] paint Drexciya sketch.

2001
01:49:59,780 --> 01:50:03,190
He was going to do thousand
dollars not even successful yet.

2002
01:50:03,191 --> 01:50:07,690
We don't even have a logo that
people using $50 and if I like it,

2003
01:50:08,620 --> 01:50:12,730
can you create it? You create a logo
for my company. What's it called? Apple.

2004
01:50:14,450 --> 01:50:18,060
Yeah, that Bitch Woo.

2005
01:50:18,790 --> 01:50:21,910
She took a quarter mill and
bang that out in six minutes.

2006
01:50:22,870 --> 01:50:25,690
Fucking thing to divides this
country more than right. Left.

2007
01:50:25,691 --> 01:50:28,610
It might be android versus iPhone. Yeah,

2008
01:50:29,020 --> 01:50:32,530
but people aren't like a boycott and
businesses over it. No, they're not.

2009
01:50:32,740 --> 01:50:35,410
But that people look down on people
with android phones. They sure do.

2010
01:50:36,590 --> 01:50:40,750
They're less time. That's it.
It's just one of those things.

2011
01:50:40,751 --> 01:50:43,600
It's like if you have an iPhone you're
in and if you have an android phone,

2012
01:50:43,601 --> 01:50:46,870
you're on that other fucking
team. The bare minimum.

2013
01:50:46,871 --> 01:50:50,500
If you don't have an iPhone, you, you're
a fucking loser. That's what it is.

2014
01:50:51,110 --> 01:50:53,650
A guy for years and I used to,
I used to be one of the guys,

2015
01:50:53,830 --> 01:50:55,180
what's the big difference?
Who gives a shit?

2016
01:50:55,181 --> 01:50:56,590
And then I got an iPhone
and I was like, oh,

2017
01:50:59,380 --> 01:51:03,320
it's the differences. Just the
way your fingers, I don't know.

2018
01:51:05,350 --> 01:51:08,320
I'm going from one piece,
one thing to the next.

2019
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:10,120
If you're opening up a
tax or going to a phone,

2020
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:14,230
everything is just very seamless and
it's smooth and it feels very natural and

2021
01:51:14,231 --> 01:51:16,770
very nice. And android because somebody,

2022
01:51:16,780 --> 01:51:18,580
different people use that
sort of android platform.

2023
01:51:18,581 --> 01:51:20,920
It's always clunky and
it's not exactly the same,

2024
01:51:20,921 --> 01:51:24,790
so it never feels as smooth once you
get used to your iPhone. That's that.

2025
01:51:25,110 --> 01:51:28,390
And Yeah, I agree. I know very
successful people that stick by Android,

2026
01:51:29,690 --> 01:51:32,530
the newest android phones are
pretty fucking smooth. If you,

2027
01:51:32,531 --> 01:51:36,820
if you picked up like um,
um, galaxies, whatever,

2028
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:40,630
that's like a galaxy s 10 does
those a smooth fucking phone man,

2029
01:51:40,631 --> 01:51:44,020
those things are as good as anything.
There's a bunch of phones now on the,

2030
01:51:44,230 --> 01:51:49,230
the side of android that rival
or are better than iPhones.

2031
01:51:49,510 --> 01:51:52,630
Some of the technologies, a hit
10 the note 10 that just came out.

2032
01:51:52,780 --> 01:51:56,350
Is there one that's not android or
iPhone that's like dope that people just

2033
01:51:56,351 --> 01:51:59,320
don't know about. That's like their
operating system, which is really weird.

2034
01:51:59,350 --> 01:52:03,820
It's like, yeah, you have three operating
systems. You have a, you have iPhones,

2035
01:52:03,970 --> 01:52:07,510
you have android, and there's still a
few people that have windows phones,

2036
01:52:07,511 --> 01:52:10,480
believe it or not blackberry.
Who the fuck uses that?

2037
01:52:12,530 --> 01:52:16,730
[inaudible] Thompson. I
think that's a joke. Well,

2038
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:20,890
I think that's a gag. If I text him and
he goes blue, he's got a fucking iPhone,

2039
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:27,150
pretends to not have a fucking real phone
or he's got multiple phones. Pageants,

2040
01:52:27,190 --> 01:52:30,250
fucking phony asshole. I talked to
him that one time. He does have it,

2041
01:52:30,251 --> 01:52:33,670
but he doesn't use it. Oh,
okay. Yeah, he's got it.

2042
01:52:33,671 --> 01:52:37,180
I think it was a joke though. Okay. I
think he really did miss those little w.

2043
01:52:37,181 --> 01:52:38,680
If you had a blackberry back in the day,

2044
01:52:38,860 --> 01:52:42,640
the thing that texting people you knew
where everything was buttons where you

2045
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:46,100
can text pretty quick, that little ball
would break. It was so annoying. Yeah,

2046
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:47,690
that thing would break, but uh,

2047
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:51,530
the difference between that and
an iPhone is pretty substantial,

2048
01:52:51,531 --> 01:52:55,430
but the difference between iPhones and
android is not substantial anymore.

2049
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:59,560
But don't you like [inaudible]? It's
pretty fucking [inaudible] iPhone.

2050
01:52:59,630 --> 01:53:02,330
I can't go back. I just know it. I
don't want to relearn a new phone.

2051
01:53:02,810 --> 01:53:06,980
I sat down and [inaudible] phone.
Now since Steve Jobs is gone,

2052
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:10,280
that iPhone is catching up
on the technology to android.

2053
01:53:10,281 --> 01:53:13,640
The Android's like getting a lot of
things. You go look on my iPhone does now.

2054
01:53:13,790 --> 01:53:14,630
Some of those android goes,

2055
01:53:14,850 --> 01:53:19,040
but we've had two generations of that
era would be that they wait until the

2056
01:53:19,041 --> 01:53:22,550
technology is out and all the bugs are
knocked out of it and then they give you

2057
01:53:22,551 --> 01:53:25,610
a superior version of it. Yeah.
That's the argument. I mean, look,

2058
01:53:25,611 --> 01:53:28,340
it's the most successful company in the
fucking history, the known universe.

2059
01:53:28,341 --> 01:53:30,690
They have its shit. Fuck tons of cash.

2060
01:53:30,691 --> 01:53:34,310
I can't believe they didn't get
like the folding phone first.

2061
01:53:34,370 --> 01:53:37,610
I don't think that thing is worth
a fuck. I couldn't even guess.

2062
01:53:37,790 --> 01:53:41,840
It looks like it's weird making it fatter
or gummy. How to just give me this.

2063
01:53:41,841 --> 01:53:44,840
This is a good shape. You folks
stopped. They just constantly,

2064
01:53:44,950 --> 01:53:49,370
we've got to figure out how to extend
a brick. Roll it up. Like a little,

2065
01:53:49,371 --> 01:53:53,120
like a little fortune cookie worried
about is the Elon Musk thing.

2066
01:53:53,330 --> 01:53:55,460
The neurolink you hearing about that?

2067
01:53:55,620 --> 01:54:00,620
I'm not sure what the next
step to integrating computers
with your fucking brain

2068
01:54:02,730 --> 01:54:04,250
that's it's going to happen. Right?

2069
01:54:04,251 --> 01:54:07,790
If it's not this Elon Musk's thing doesn't
do that, then the next thing we'll,

2070
01:54:07,791 --> 01:54:12,350
but the ultimate goal is going to be,
we're going to have pieces in our body.

2071
01:54:13,480 --> 01:54:17,700
One thing, some computer, what the
word of like merging with the the body.

2072
01:54:18,410 --> 01:54:22,590
Yeah. Symbiotically Cyborg.
Cyborg. The child Cyborg. Yeah,

2073
01:54:22,980 --> 01:54:26,350
but that's true too. [inaudible] that's
what, that's what I was thinking about.

2074
01:54:26,430 --> 01:54:29,680
The singularity is what they
think would be the ultimate, uh,

2075
01:54:29,870 --> 01:54:33,410
technological innovation that
radically chance forms mankind.

2076
01:54:33,590 --> 01:54:36,470
And they moved that number around
and I think the singularity,

2077
01:54:36,471 --> 01:54:38,210
they think for artificial intelligence.

2078
01:54:38,211 --> 01:54:42,710
There was a symposium in New York a few
years back that Ari and I and Duncan

2079
01:54:42,710 --> 01:54:43,450
Trussell went to.

2080
01:54:43,450 --> 01:54:47,270
It was like the 20 I think it was like
2045 that's when they think they think at

2081
01:54:47,271 --> 01:54:52,271
2045 these things are going to go
alive and there'll be robot just like x

2082
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,310
mocking that type people
walking around with us.

2083
01:54:55,600 --> 01:54:56,081
Oh for sure.

2084
01:54:56,081 --> 01:54:59,230
I mean I think I heard part
of the conversation you
had with the Elon Musk and

2085
01:54:59,231 --> 01:55:01,990
it was one of the most interesting
things because for a while I was going,

2086
01:55:01,991 --> 01:55:04,990
yeah dude, if you just put your phone
down, people don't really give a shit.

2087
01:55:04,991 --> 01:55:07,300
You go to the supermarket. People
aren't arguing about politics,

2088
01:55:07,540 --> 01:55:09,880
but eventually what's going to happen
is the phones are going to be in our

2089
01:55:09,881 --> 01:55:12,700
fucking brains and you're never gonna
be able to put the phone down and it's

2090
01:55:12,701 --> 01:55:13,270
going to be,

2091
01:55:13,270 --> 01:55:16,450
that's the world we live in where we
are just at war and that's where it's

2092
01:55:16,451 --> 01:55:17,620
fucking scary. That's what, I don't know.

2093
01:55:18,180 --> 01:55:19,290
[inaudible] jump in too quick too.

2094
01:55:19,291 --> 01:55:23,880
Hasn't already been like a whole bunch
of like self driving car accidents.

2095
01:55:23,881 --> 01:55:28,260
Terrible things happen. More human
accidents. Yeah, it's better.

2096
01:55:28,490 --> 01:55:32,340
Is it more human accidents per amount of
cars though? You know what I'm saying?

2097
01:55:32,341 --> 01:55:34,800
Like self driving cars. Really A,

2098
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:39,030
you're not supposed to just sit there.
You supposed to hold on to the wheel.

2099
01:55:39,031 --> 01:55:42,810
I keep a hand on the wheel. It makes you
do that. You can't just uh, drive it.

2100
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:44,160
It [inaudible] you can't

2101
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:46,200
just sit back. It needs you to be engaged.

2102
01:55:46,740 --> 01:55:50,010
Like the little Duvall who just takes
videos of him like taking a nap and

2103
01:55:50,420 --> 01:55:52,890
smoking. Joe, what's out the
window? He's not involved at all.

2104
01:55:53,370 --> 01:55:56,760
So you get that like blocked where
the sensors like to take 'em all calm.

2105
01:55:56,930 --> 01:55:57,720
Assuming it's a sensor type,

2106
01:55:57,720 --> 01:56:01,380
is there anything that you can do
that's actually like a uh, iPhone mount?

2107
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:02,580
Like a cell phone mount.

2108
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:05,760
It sits on the handle and it
keeps pressure on the handle.

2109
01:56:05,850 --> 01:56:08,850
So the handle thinks that you're holding
onto the handle and you have your

2110
01:56:08,851 --> 01:56:13,380
iPhone robots an iPhone colder. So
they sell it as an iPhone holder.

2111
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:16,710
But really what it is is something
that squeezes on the handle,

2112
01:56:17,340 --> 01:56:20,190
but they can't sell it as that
because that would be illegal.

2113
01:56:20,610 --> 01:56:22,800
It should be illegal.
It's pretty God damn good.

2114
01:56:22,801 --> 01:56:27,060
That thing that eventually drive shit
eventually I way more trust auto-drive.

2115
01:56:27,120 --> 01:56:30,870
I trust them to be able to come up
with the technology where they have

2116
01:56:30,871 --> 01:56:33,990
everything on perfect grids where we
all get in our cars and the absolute

2117
01:56:33,991 --> 01:56:38,490
fastest way for us to get from point a
to point B is already mapped out traffic,

2118
01:56:38,491 --> 01:56:43,020
all that shit that that's not that
crazy. I feel like that has to be within,

2119
01:56:43,050 --> 01:56:46,350
you know, 2030 year changes lanes
and everything. Oh yeah. Yeah.

2120
01:56:46,351 --> 01:56:47,184
It changes lanes.

2121
01:56:47,250 --> 01:56:49,650
Did it blow your mind the first
time you were on highway where those

2122
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:54,900
[inaudible] that's common. All
that's coming [inaudible] never suck.

2123
01:56:54,901 --> 01:56:58,770
Your Dick would probably just give you
the experience in a chip while your click

2124
01:57:02,010 --> 01:57:05,790
3d Hologram lady appears and
starts bone feels like it's real,

2125
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:07,920
but nothing's there. Whitney
Houston, your celebrities.

2126
01:57:08,250 --> 01:57:11,610
Remember how they made the future in
eighties movies though where the Dick

2127
01:57:11,610 --> 01:57:13,770
Sucking car would actually be like
a hose would come out of the ground.

2128
01:57:13,770 --> 01:57:16,320
That would be the field.
Look at the a mouth hose.

2129
01:57:16,580 --> 01:57:19,190
Would you really trust that mouth?
Always with your cock and what?

2130
01:57:19,230 --> 01:57:21,440
I want to wait until the third
or fourth version. I watched,

2131
01:57:21,930 --> 01:57:24,970
I watched total recall recently,
which is like, you know the new one,

2132
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:28,830
the old one and got to that total recall.
The one a the running man. Oh Wow.

2133
01:57:28,860 --> 01:57:30,990
And it was like when he was
holding the girl hostage,

2134
01:57:30,991 --> 01:57:34,180
she was in the house like let's
look up what flights are right.

2135
01:57:34,190 --> 01:57:37,740
And it's just such obvious like Atari
graphics on the screen and at the year

2136
01:57:37,741 --> 01:57:42,741
2050 the music that really has good
ideas of what the future's going to be.

2137
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:47,160
Even minority report when they're moving
stuff around on the screen. Like maybe,

2138
01:57:47,220 --> 01:57:50,160
maybe someday, but no one's
done anything where you go, wow,

2139
01:57:50,420 --> 01:57:55,230
that would be amazing if that was that.
Was it sort of the apple thing though,

2140
01:57:55,320 --> 01:57:55,411
is it?

2141
01:57:55,411 --> 01:58:00,411
Apple tries to make their stuff live up
to what they made like 1950 space movies

2142
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:05,030
being everything's like very like metal
metallic and sleek looking like the

2143
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:08,850
Gattica the uniform package. I'll
do that. Apple is a great company.

2144
01:58:08,851 --> 01:58:11,400
They really are. But when you open
up an iPhone or an apple product,

2145
01:58:12,050 --> 01:58:14,220
the packaging, they, it
has like an air thing.

2146
01:58:14,370 --> 01:58:17,010
We're in lifts naturally and it's
all based off the experience.

2147
01:58:17,011 --> 01:58:19,950
Like when you open it, you, you go, I've
never opened another product like this.

2148
01:58:19,951 --> 01:58:22,650
And if they do that on purpose and
it's this subconscious thing that they

2149
01:58:22,651 --> 01:58:25,350
fucking put into your mind and
that's why you go, dude, just,

2150
01:58:25,351 --> 01:58:27,870
I don't know what it is, dude.
iPhone, I can't put my finger on it.

2151
01:58:27,871 --> 01:58:31,890
Sweat chicks buy expensive
bags. Yep. Same thing. Ooh,

2152
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:36,960
yeah. Quality lasts forever.

2153
01:58:37,230 --> 01:58:40,830
If you write though, if you write a lot
and type a lot, they're the shittiest.

2154
01:58:41,170 --> 01:58:42,003
They're fucking keyboards

2155
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:42,701
are dog shit.

2156
01:58:42,701 --> 01:58:46,330
The new ones that they're clearly
clickity clickity there's no travel,

2157
01:58:46,540 --> 01:58:49,690
they're just clickity clickity clickity
clickity and shit gets stuck in them.

2158
01:58:49,691 --> 01:58:50,930
And they're trying to
figure out how to fix.

2159
01:58:51,230 --> 01:58:53,290
Mostly this part doesn't
work on my apple so I,

2160
01:58:53,291 --> 01:58:57,910
I've copied the space so whenever
I right after not comfortable

2161
01:58:57,910 --> 01:59:01,990
both for typing on like the whole like
how much fucking thinner doesn't have to

2162
01:59:01,991 --> 01:59:02,890
be Jesus Christ.

2163
01:59:02,891 --> 01:59:05,110
I know you guys are trying to make
them thin but make them so they're

2164
01:59:05,111 --> 01:59:08,740
comfortable to type on it does
make it thicker. Like just make it,

2165
01:59:08,741 --> 01:59:10,260
it doesn't have to be
that thin male. Yeah.

2166
01:59:10,290 --> 01:59:12,990
Big Old Gray keyboard is
the most comfortable thing.

2167
01:59:12,991 --> 01:59:14,520
The old school thing that we love,

2168
01:59:14,521 --> 01:59:16,230
but I think it's because we
learned how to type on that.

2169
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:17,750
No, it's because they're mechanical.

2170
01:59:17,780 --> 01:59:21,980
Your fingers feel the tactile
sensation of pushing in those springs.

2171
01:59:22,130 --> 01:59:25,460
So it was like click, click, click,
click could cook your fingers.

2172
01:59:25,461 --> 01:59:28,250
Know where the keys are. When
you don't get into any feedback,

2173
01:59:28,251 --> 01:59:30,800
you make a lot of errors.
Like it's not as easy.

2174
01:59:30,801 --> 01:59:34,460
It takes a long time to get accustomed
to that short travel keyboard that you

2175
01:59:34,461 --> 01:59:38,630
get on those really thin Mac
books. I have a 2015 mac book.

2176
01:59:39,020 --> 01:59:42,950
I went and got an old one refurbished
because I hate the fucking new keyboard.

2177
01:59:42,951 --> 01:59:46,640
It's like I don't know what I'm touching.
Yeah, it's not, it's not moving.

2178
01:59:46,820 --> 01:59:50,600
It's so, so shallow. But apparently
they gotta fix that dude.

2179
01:59:50,601 --> 01:59:53,780
I have an IBM or not an
IBM and Lenovo thinkpad.

2180
01:59:54,050 --> 01:59:58,630
That thing is like the old IBM think pads
with Lenovo bought the company and now

2181
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:02,770
they make them, they, you feel the keys.
It's like as you're typing, you know,

2182
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:05,980
they have like 1.5 millimeters
of travel, which was like,

2183
02:00:06,030 --> 02:00:08,830
I bet you the next time I call
bet I'm going to, me and Joe,

2184
02:00:08,940 --> 02:00:12,480
we're gonna have a uh, typing
competition. I think I could,

2185
02:00:12,630 --> 02:00:14,940
I have none big no mistakes.
And the new apple, it's fine.

2186
02:00:14,970 --> 02:00:17,770
I think once you're used to it,
you're used to it. How did you,

2187
02:00:17,771 --> 02:00:19,890
you need to let yourself
go to the new technology,

2188
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:24,480
both of them. But I liked the typing way
better on the Lenovo. It's just theirs.

2189
02:00:24,660 --> 02:00:25,950
This is not like just me.

2190
02:00:26,160 --> 02:00:31,110
This is a big thing that people who write
a lot say is that you want something

2191
02:00:31,111 --> 02:00:34,750
that has a lot of key
travel because 1.5 you know,

2192
02:00:34,810 --> 02:00:37,410
preferably maybe even 1.8
millimeter or something like that.

2193
02:00:37,620 --> 02:00:41,340
When you're doing that, you you get a
real good feel of where the keys are.

2194
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:43,960
You don't, you also feel
like you've hit the bar,

2195
02:00:44,040 --> 02:00:45,210
you know you've hit the button,

2196
02:00:45,810 --> 02:00:48,600
you say see this feedback
and you don't think about,

2197
02:00:48,810 --> 02:00:51,330
what I find is that I'm
writing on one of those things.

2198
02:00:51,331 --> 02:00:56,331
I don't think about the keys as much as
I just am concentrating on writing where

2199
02:00:56,371 --> 02:00:58,050
I was like, oh, otherwise
I'm like, oh, did that,

2200
02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:01,710
that little extra thing where
you gotta look down. Oh,

2201
02:01:01,711 --> 02:01:03,480
I fucked up and I hit
that instead of that.

2202
02:01:03,780 --> 02:01:06,030
That doesn't happen as
much [inaudible] way less

2203
02:01:06,330 --> 02:01:11,330
you guys washing your keyboards because
I feel bad every time my son touches my

2204
02:01:11,741 --> 02:01:15,830
computer and it's probably keeping
them healthy. Dude, it's funny.

2205
02:01:16,300 --> 02:01:20,470
There's so much fucking bacteria on that
computer for cover and they use that

2206
02:01:20,770 --> 02:01:24,340
dust blasts thing is great. I
don't use any of that. Just blown.

2207
02:01:24,341 --> 02:01:27,850
Come right in your circuit board. Gross
your fucking kitchen tables. Gross.

2208
02:01:27,851 --> 02:01:28,990
Everything's gross. I know.

2209
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:31,150
Do you think about like homeless
people touching guardrails?

2210
02:01:31,210 --> 02:01:34,930
It's like you go and touch that like
Ah, homeless people. The subway,

2211
02:01:34,931 --> 02:01:39,470
the subway rails must be just, oh,
it's brutal. The amount of times I've,

2212
02:01:39,471 --> 02:01:42,200
I've done this in New York City, like
I'll be going to put my hand on the hand.

2213
02:01:42,201 --> 02:01:44,420
I just don't touch handrails anymore
and I make sure that my son does and,

2214
02:01:44,630 --> 02:01:47,540
but I've just been putting my hand on
the rail and then I just pick up a bugger

2215
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:51,260
like a human booger and I'm
like, okay, that's my week.

2216
02:01:51,320 --> 02:01:53,050
The story just ruined my hour.

2217
02:01:56,990 --> 02:01:58,940
[inaudible] and then it gets stuck
in your thumb. You flick it again.

2218
02:01:59,010 --> 02:02:01,980
It get stuck on that finger. Something
about other dudes boogers. It's really,

2219
02:02:02,170 --> 02:02:04,890
there's no way that that would end
my day. And your own kids booger.

2220
02:02:04,910 --> 02:02:08,650
I'll pick my son's nose in a
heartbeat. It's just a random stuff.

2221
02:02:08,720 --> 02:02:11,360
That's your own son. I mean
he's six now. You should stop,

2222
02:02:11,700 --> 02:02:13,250
but definitely stop picking his nose.

2223
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:17,270
How old is it when you'd
be really concerned if your
son is still sucking their

2224
02:02:17,271 --> 02:02:22,090
thumb? Nobody. You're saying
shit, I wanted to deck wait

2225
02:02:23,750 --> 02:02:28,460
thumb anymore until you
confirm and they go, okay,

2226
02:02:28,580 --> 02:02:31,780
well now I know my son never
sucked his thumb. So yeah,

2227
02:02:32,460 --> 02:02:35,660
like if you had a kid though,
if he had a boy, I have a girl.

2228
02:02:35,910 --> 02:02:38,360
If you should never stop. She loves
second thumb. You don't have any kids.

2229
02:02:38,420 --> 02:02:40,080
I got an eight month old. Oh, you do?

2230
02:02:40,580 --> 02:02:44,420
[inaudible] last time I saw you were out
there breeding. I am. Congratulations.

2231
02:02:44,421 --> 02:02:47,750
Now you become even more libertarian,
correct? Yeah, but not with her.

2232
02:02:47,890 --> 02:02:51,050
I'm going to throw this carry. I'm with
my baby. I make the decisions there.

2233
02:02:51,530 --> 02:02:52,161
That's a good move.

2234
02:02:52,161 --> 02:02:56,720
Don't let babies call the shots now
that'll be just sugar and guns, but I'm

2235
02:03:01,570 --> 02:03:04,940
teaching a baby how to shoot a gun. Let
if a baby could actively shoot a gun,

2236
02:03:05,300 --> 02:03:08,540
like you know how much of a fucking giant
problem that would be like if a baby

2237
02:03:08,541 --> 02:03:12,440
was just like, dude, dude, now I'm feeling
like I'm not enough of a libertarian.

2238
02:03:12,670 --> 02:03:14,640
Yeah, because here's a gun.
Go homestead some land.

2239
02:03:14,690 --> 02:03:18,920
Their body can't really hold a gun and
shoot it. Right. It would go flying.

2240
02:03:19,120 --> 02:03:20,960
There's no way. But if they could,

2241
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:25,430
do you know how what a great time they
would think it would be to shoot fucking

2242
02:03:25,431 --> 02:03:30,380
baby and you let it gotten just like,
dude, dude, dude. Right. They love it.

2243
02:03:30,381 --> 02:03:33,710
That projectiles, my son has, there's
nerf guns. That's how I know he's not gay.

2244
02:03:33,711 --> 02:03:38,260
He loves to shoot things and the lot
of gay people that shoot things now,

2245
02:03:38,300 --> 02:03:40,790
that's how I know he's not good. Like
he kept shooting his friend in the face.

2246
02:03:40,791 --> 02:03:43,850
The other guy you think about bears and
then he was talking the bullets in his

2247
02:03:43,851 --> 02:03:44,510
book.

2248
02:03:44,510 --> 02:03:49,280
If you had a bunch of bears that you
couldn't take them out to like a shotgun

2249
02:03:49,281 --> 02:03:53,450
range and shoot clay pigeons like 15
minutes before they started fucking each

2250
02:03:53,451 --> 02:03:56,420
other. Yeah. Eventually.
Oh my God, this shit.

2251
02:03:56,421 --> 02:03:58,670
But this kind of gave me
some warning. The guys,

2252
02:03:58,790 --> 02:04:01,800
they're just guys with like
guys, they got the wacky winery,

2253
02:04:02,020 --> 02:04:03,500
the gay kids that I grew, I'm sure. Yes,

2254
02:04:03,530 --> 02:04:07,520
there are gay guys who like to do doodly.
Dude things, right? Oh definitely.

2255
02:04:07,970 --> 02:04:11,730
But doodly do you know, not often.

2256
02:04:11,870 --> 02:04:13,850
I mean the how many gay
friends you have, they're like,

2257
02:04:13,970 --> 02:04:16,190
we should really go shooting
guns right now. Let's go hunt.

2258
02:04:17,270 --> 02:04:21,790
I bet there's a bunch of shop and that's
fine. They do. They want to do them.

2259
02:04:21,980 --> 02:04:25,370
But isn't it like girls? Like there's
girls that are like Woodsy, girls,

2260
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:28,760
girls want to live in the woods and
shit. Yeah. I think these are exceptions.

2261
02:04:28,790 --> 02:04:32,280
If you're a gay like mountainy
guy and you're another mountain,

2262
02:04:32,490 --> 02:04:34,710
he guy's probably going to have
an all right life. That's all.

2263
02:04:34,910 --> 02:04:37,740
So also pretty hot. Gay
mountainy guys alone.

2264
02:04:37,741 --> 02:04:41,710
Just fucking Bolton down the door before
they bought Fox looking out to issue.

2265
02:04:41,980 --> 02:04:43,420
Yeah, sure. The neighbors don't know why.

2266
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:47,310
So are you fell as brothers and
sisters or what? Brother and brother,

2267
02:04:47,311 --> 02:04:47,960
what's going on?

2268
02:04:47,960 --> 02:04:51,420
And they wrote a seasonal marina and
then they just suck and fuck in the off

2269
02:04:51,420 --> 02:04:55,830
season. Yeah. You go down the road
where those two homos live, Z , homos,

2270
02:04:56,460 --> 02:05:01,080
there's a couple of what it is as a couple
of dudes living in the oil efficient

2271
02:05:01,081 --> 02:05:04,650
house, don't get me wrong.
Great guys, great guys.

2272
02:05:06,330 --> 02:05:08,010
All they do is chop with them, but fuck,

2273
02:05:08,250 --> 02:05:10,980
that was the Bagel boss guy
when he said that. He goes,

2274
02:05:11,470 --> 02:05:14,190
I got a problem with gay people. He
goes, just don't touch me, you know,

2275
02:05:14,460 --> 02:05:16,860
especially in the private area.
Then we'll have the problem. I go,

2276
02:05:16,861 --> 02:05:18,150
is that what your life's worried about?

2277
02:05:18,750 --> 02:05:20,880
You don't want to hang out with
[inaudible] I property is going to start

2278
02:05:20,881 --> 02:05:23,910
grabbing viciously at your
Dick. Do you think that guy's a,

2279
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,290
he's going to stick in there.
You think he's going to be uh,

2280
02:05:26,580 --> 02:05:29,250
like Joe the plumber or do you think
it's going to have some legs to him? No,

2281
02:05:29,370 --> 02:05:33,520
I think this is going to, Lenny Dykstra
is going to knock him out unconsciously.

2282
02:05:33,710 --> 02:05:35,430
He's five, 10. He's a
former, I know. He's like,

2283
02:05:35,560 --> 02:05:38,790
he ain't got alcohol problems and
shit, but he's got those big hands.

2284
02:05:38,791 --> 02:05:40,230
I see the videos getting arrested.

2285
02:05:40,231 --> 02:05:42,670
The other day he's going to
hit the Bagel boss. He left.

2286
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:46,920
She was fighting Bagel boss boxing. No,

2287
02:05:47,370 --> 02:05:49,110
it's terrible. It's like she
was, you know, older now,

2288
02:05:49,111 --> 02:05:53,040
but I mean he's Lenny Dykstra. He's a
lunatic. He's only 55 so I'm like that.

2289
02:05:53,100 --> 02:05:56,840
He looks like 70 but he's, he's
still a fucking stocky dude, man.

2290
02:05:56,880 --> 02:06:01,860
Like four foot eight.
He's, I mean five was,

2291
02:06:01,861 --> 02:06:06,180
he fell, he's four. He's
really small. [inaudible]

2292
02:06:07,130 --> 02:06:09,690
down. You've seen that guy. I've
seen. He went to one of, uh,

2293
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:13,260
someone's MMA gym and he was hanging
out with a bunch of fighters and he's

2294
02:06:13,261 --> 02:06:16,850
throwing punches and dancing around the
ring. I think. I want to say Matt Serra,

2295
02:06:16,851 --> 02:06:20,190
was it Matt Serra? Chris Weidman.
He was long island guy. Yeah.

2296
02:06:20,191 --> 02:06:23,550
So he was out there.
It's like, he's not like,

2297
02:06:23,730 --> 02:06:25,890
he doesn't have a
background in martial arts.

2298
02:06:25,891 --> 02:06:30,030
Like you could tell
that really fight shape.

2299
02:06:30,320 --> 02:06:33,360
Its probably shape and he's a tiny
little fellow by like a butterfly.

2300
02:06:33,361 --> 02:06:37,100
Sting like a butterfly.
There's, yeah, there's no good,

2301
02:06:37,170 --> 02:06:40,800
there's no learning how to fight, getting
in shape, doing it all like it. Yeah.

2302
02:06:41,160 --> 02:06:45,060
He's too small. It looks like he's
been in a bunch of fist fights.

2303
02:06:45,990 --> 02:06:49,260
He used to be arrested language
jacked at a point in his life.

2304
02:06:49,261 --> 02:06:52,180
I mean like shredded and you're losing
that strength. You're not going leave.

2305
02:06:52,200 --> 02:06:56,430
Even if he's out of shape. Even if
he's still a strong like Boltsy Guy,

2306
02:06:56,431 --> 02:07:00,690
I'm sure even conversation is going to
kill him because he was saying they heavy

2307
02:07:00,980 --> 02:07:05,850
play heavy on Lenny. Push it off.

2308
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:10,320
Lenny Dykstra crazy. He was fucking
pro. I think there's no way.

2309
02:07:10,380 --> 02:07:12,210
There's no integrity in
celebrity boxing though.

2310
02:07:12,211 --> 02:07:15,860
I don't know if you could bet like a
zillion dollars. The top, yeah, Tim now,

2311
02:07:16,580 --> 02:07:20,760
so he's only 55 that's crazy.
Now he's her. That isn't,

2312
02:07:20,761 --> 02:07:22,860
he is. It'd be a little
bit older. He's older.

2313
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:26,550
I just looked it up the other day. He's
not that old. He was a legit wild man.

2314
02:07:26,650 --> 02:07:29,910
Yeah. When he was at right there.
He looks like Mike. I can. Yeah,

2315
02:07:29,911 --> 02:07:33,570
he was fucking, that guy was a
legit wild man. Look at that.

2316
02:07:33,571 --> 02:07:37,840
Lenny Dykstra indicted for drugs,
threats, falling arrest in May. Who? Yeah,

2317
02:07:37,841 --> 02:07:39,340
he's winning. This fight is Uber driver.

2318
02:07:39,341 --> 02:07:42,220
He was high on ecstasy and coke and got
into an argument with his Uber driver

2319
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:46,260
and then threatened his life when
the cops come. Yeah, the cop. Yeah.

2320
02:07:46,330 --> 02:07:48,460
The cops come and they're like, yeah.
This guy's saying, his fear for his life.

2321
02:07:48,461 --> 02:07:53,120
He's like, well, for me it's the base,
please. So innocent. It's hilarious. Oh,

2322
02:07:53,180 --> 02:07:53,770
that's funny.

2323
02:07:53,770 --> 02:07:56,080
And then they start checking his bag and
he starts freaking out about them going

2324
02:07:56,081 --> 02:08:00,670
through his bag. 56 yeah. Wow. Wow.
I thought he was older than that.

2325
02:08:00,671 --> 02:08:05,170
Even these days, living them hard
years, son ahead of celebrity fight.

2326
02:08:05,380 --> 02:08:09,280
Lenny Dykstra, it says, Bagel boss has
one inch penis. That was shit outrageous.

2327
02:08:09,310 --> 02:08:13,840
Click on that, please.
[inaudible] click this.

2328
02:08:13,850 --> 02:08:16,060
So rude. The world we live in,

2329
02:08:16,090 --> 02:08:18,760
Lenny Dykstra went on
Howard stern and did like a,

2330
02:08:19,480 --> 02:08:22,750
he said like he had girls come on to
say how good he pussy and they were like

2331
02:08:22,751 --> 02:08:25,150
swearing down. There we
are. Then it was a comic.

2332
02:08:25,151 --> 02:08:29,230
So he brought comedians from La and then
the community immediately just used it

2333
02:08:29,500 --> 02:08:32,440
for like a credit and that's
just a bumped as whole thing.

2334
02:08:33,160 --> 02:08:35,470
So he flew them in for
nothing. Oh, that's funny.

2335
02:08:36,580 --> 02:08:41,050
It's a crazy that he's going to hit
that little guy because that's so,

2336
02:08:41,230 --> 02:08:46,200
so wrong. I guess the Little Guy, I
wonder if he is going to down quick. Yeah.

2337
02:08:46,201 --> 02:08:50,440
I in celebrity boxing it doesn't usually
get too brutal. I think, you know,

2338
02:08:50,940 --> 02:08:53,100
I think what's his hunch
him once and it might kill

2339
02:08:55,090 --> 02:08:58,930
[inaudible] Bonaduce used to go for it
though. Headgear doesn't help you at all.

2340
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:02,140
Head gear sometimes makes it worse
because you got all this extra weight and

2341
02:09:02,141 --> 02:09:05,290
your head snaps more like you
can get if you get head gear on,

2342
02:09:05,291 --> 02:09:07,000
that's more shit that you have to control.

2343
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:10,570
Like one of the things about having a
strong knack is when you get punched you

2344
02:09:10,571 --> 02:09:14,830
can kind of control your head from moving
around too much and some guys can take

2345
02:09:14,831 --> 02:09:17,110
it better. But if you have a head gear on,

2346
02:09:17,111 --> 02:09:20,950
it's like extra weight and your brain
sloshes around inside your head.

2347
02:09:21,020 --> 02:09:23,890
I made it protects you from
cuts more than anything. This,

2348
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:27,460
there's an argument that it would protect
you from cuts but the protecting it

2349
02:09:27,461 --> 02:09:31,930
from the thud cause it's not, it's
the fucking rocking of your brain.

2350
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:35,950
You know, like it's in some ways
it's, it's a real mixed bag.

2351
02:09:35,951 --> 02:09:38,440
In some ways it's better to have had
gear on cause there's a little more

2352
02:09:38,441 --> 02:09:41,390
cushioning. But in other ways
like it's [inaudible] it makes me

2353
02:09:43,390 --> 02:09:45,710
[inaudible] cause I was surprised you
did that but you're like it just fucked.

2354
02:09:45,740 --> 02:09:46,690
I didn't want to fight with the head guy.

2355
02:09:46,900 --> 02:09:50,470
Tried to change it at the end because I
started sparring with it and it fucking

2356
02:09:50,471 --> 02:09:52,960
sucks. Dick did, you can't
breathe. Can't see that good.

2357
02:09:52,961 --> 02:09:55,390
You can't see when you start grappling
you start feeling like you're being

2358
02:09:55,391 --> 02:09:56,830
smothered right away no matter what.

2359
02:09:56,831 --> 02:09:59,860
As soon as they touch your head you feel
like the starts moving up in your face.

2360
02:10:00,220 --> 02:10:03,430
So I tried to get them to take it off
and they wouldn't and then my head gear

2361
02:10:03,431 --> 02:10:06,310
broke like in the first minute of the
fight and they were like, all right,

2362
02:10:06,311 --> 02:10:07,780
fuck you take it off.
Cause it was a shit show.

2363
02:10:08,080 --> 02:10:12,820
So we both took off our head gear and I
was like, Huh, where's the rules? Yeah,

2364
02:10:13,100 --> 02:10:14,710
head care's a tricky thing. You know,

2365
02:10:14,711 --> 02:10:16,660
it's like they think that
about football helmets too,

2366
02:10:16,870 --> 02:10:19,810
that they would actually be a safer
game if they couldn't clash heads with a

2367
02:10:19,811 --> 02:10:22,510
helmet on that they wouldn't do
it. They wouldn't play like that.

2368
02:10:23,140 --> 02:10:25,330
That's just not true.
Them clashing skulls,

2369
02:10:25,880 --> 02:10:28,160
just not safer to match it.

2370
02:10:28,660 --> 02:10:31,270
But the idea is that the only reason why
they played that way is because of the

2371
02:10:31,271 --> 02:10:34,040
helmets in the foot shoulder
gear. If you took that stuff away,

2372
02:10:34,041 --> 02:10:36,530
they wouldn't play like that.
Yeah. Back in the day they had,

2373
02:10:36,640 --> 02:10:38,110
they barely had any pads and you know,

2374
02:10:38,150 --> 02:10:40,820
thirties or forties or whatever when
they were playing with those little tiny

2375
02:10:40,821 --> 02:10:43,790
helmets, that game, if
you were an outsider,

2376
02:10:43,910 --> 02:10:45,680
like if you didn't know how big it was,

2377
02:10:46,060 --> 02:10:48,640
like if you didn't understand anything
about the cultural significance of

2378
02:10:48,641 --> 02:10:52,040
football and they showed you all the
brain damage and they showed you what it

2379
02:10:52,041 --> 02:10:55,710
is, he'd be like, Oh yeah, make that
illegal. Yeah, probably. If anything,

2380
02:10:55,740 --> 02:10:57,320
it should be illegal. Stop doing that.

2381
02:10:57,321 --> 02:11:01,820
Kids constantly run into each other
and they'll smash heads. That's crazy.

2382
02:11:02,380 --> 02:11:03,680
[inaudible] defensive offensive line.

2383
02:11:03,681 --> 02:11:05,170
Just the idea that it's
the funniest thing.

2384
02:11:05,180 --> 02:11:08,620
Susie say go just clunk heads
with another human beings.

2385
02:11:09,100 --> 02:11:13,340
We want it to be illegal and it's fun
thing to watch and it's a great way for

2386
02:11:13,341 --> 02:11:17,470
some guys to make a fuck load of money
and weigh the risks versus the rules.

2387
02:11:17,620 --> 02:11:17,630
Yeah.

2388
02:11:17,630 --> 02:11:20,930
But then a bunch of middle schoolers
are snapping their necks and my kid will

2389
02:11:20,931 --> 02:11:23,510
never play football.
[inaudible] get stopped.

2390
02:11:23,720 --> 02:11:26,780
They could then they could illegalize
MMA with that justification.

2391
02:11:27,290 --> 02:11:31,220
I don't want that to happen because we
punching and kicking is so inherently

2392
02:11:31,221 --> 02:11:34,970
violent. That's what we see it as being
this violent act, right? That it's,

2393
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:38,210
we go, oh shit fighting. That's like
crazy. That's the most violent sport,

2394
02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:42,740
but it's so much less of a dangerous
sport than football. Football.

2395
02:11:42,741 --> 02:11:46,880
These guys are just running head first
at each other and every one of them,

2396
02:11:46,910 --> 02:11:50,870
every one of them has major, major issue.
You also get blindsided in football.

2397
02:11:51,020 --> 02:11:51,231
You know,

2398
02:11:51,231 --> 02:11:54,110
you'll have your eye on someone and
then you get head to head taken out from

2399
02:11:54,111 --> 02:11:56,990
someone else. That doesn't
happen as much in MMA,

2400
02:11:57,200 --> 02:12:01,640
but I mean when people get like
head kicked, knocked unconscious,

2401
02:12:01,641 --> 02:12:05,630
that's not good for your brain.
[inaudible] players being concussed,

2402
02:12:05,990 --> 02:12:08,200
just like just smashed each at time. Yeah.

2403
02:12:08,201 --> 02:12:10,550
And then they get up and they just
do it again and again and again.

2404
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,850
They're a little bit stricter I think
on like if you get a concussion,

2405
02:12:14,130 --> 02:12:17,690
they won't put you back in. At least the
way they used to like when I was a kid.

2406
02:12:17,960 --> 02:12:22,520
But it's still fighters. We're getting
concussed once every, if you know,

2407
02:12:22,550 --> 02:12:26,450
once a year, if, if they're getting
knocked out once a year. I mean, you know,

2408
02:12:26,990 --> 02:12:31,070
but there's a also sub-concussive trial.
It seems to be the problem with CTE.

2409
02:12:31,660 --> 02:12:33,020
It's not just the knockouts,

2410
02:12:33,021 --> 02:12:36,950
it's just the thumps over and over again
over and over and over and training,

2411
02:12:36,951 --> 02:12:39,800
sparring, you know these guys.
So that's the real problem.

2412
02:12:39,801 --> 02:12:42,620
That's why also soccer players are getting
it and soccer players are starting to

2413
02:12:42,621 --> 02:12:44,390
get CT. What's worse?

2414
02:12:44,391 --> 02:12:48,860
Like getting like a Conor McGregor one
punch knockout or fighting Nick Diaz and

2415
02:12:48,861 --> 02:12:51,840
just getting like [inaudible]
for five rounds probably.

2416
02:12:51,841 --> 02:12:55,970
You're probably better off getting one
punch better than hey you probably up

2417
02:12:55,971 --> 02:12:56,870
better off getting dropped.

2418
02:12:56,880 --> 02:12:59,750
Getting beat up by Nick Diaz
for 15,000 to suck wasn't, this

2419
02:13:01,490 --> 02:13:06,490
wasn't the initial argument about MMA
being safer than boxing is that it's not

2420
02:13:06,860 --> 02:13:07,671
so much. So, you know,

2421
02:13:07,671 --> 02:13:10,220
with the gloves being bigger
in boxing and all that stuff,

2422
02:13:10,440 --> 02:13:13,790
that's actually worse cause you're gonna
keep taking too many shots count as

2423
02:13:13,791 --> 02:13:16,310
well. You can get knocked down
and then get up and go right.

2424
02:13:16,520 --> 02:13:19,520
You're be concussed and like, right.
Keep on fighting. Um, where's in MMA?

2425
02:13:19,521 --> 02:13:21,440
They'll stop it if you, if
you're not defending yourself.

2426
02:13:21,590 --> 02:13:23,390
So that's probably
definitely better. Yeah.

2427
02:13:23,391 --> 02:13:26,000
The thing about eight
counts and 10 counseling,

2428
02:13:26,420 --> 02:13:28,970
the people who've gotten off the
deck and had amazing performances,

2429
02:13:28,971 --> 02:13:31,980
so you'd ever want to stop it.
Like, look at Tyson fury gets off

2430
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:35,700
the deck twice against Deontay wilder and
MMA. That fight would've been stopped.

2431
02:13:35,910 --> 02:13:37,260
Right. So it's like one of those,

2432
02:13:37,470 --> 02:13:39,720
particularly the last
round when he dropped him,

2433
02:13:39,721 --> 02:13:42,600
he would've definitely punched him a few
times and he would have been out cold

2434
02:13:43,020 --> 02:13:45,750
cause he was flat on his back. Um,

2435
02:13:46,080 --> 02:13:50,010
in MMA that would be the end
of the fight. And we are lucky.

2436
02:13:50,011 --> 02:13:55,011
It wasn't cause he got up like a fucking
superhero and even won the rest of the

2437
02:13:55,051 --> 02:13:56,750
round. He outbox him for
the rest of the round.

2438
02:13:57,270 --> 02:14:01,230
You survived the initial barrage and then
started catching him as he was coming

2439
02:14:01,231 --> 02:14:02,670
in and as Deontay was being reckless,

2440
02:14:02,671 --> 02:14:05,250
he caught him one time like stung
him and you're like holy shit,

2441
02:14:05,251 --> 02:14:09,000
he's winning this round now that he's
winning the rest of the round after

2442
02:14:09,001 --> 02:14:12,330
getting almost obliterated. So there's
an argument that that's better,

2443
02:14:12,450 --> 02:14:14,040
that crazy thing, entertainment value.

2444
02:14:14,040 --> 02:14:18,090
But the crazy thing from the CTE like
perspective about boxing to me is that

2445
02:14:18,510 --> 02:14:21,360
your people will get hit and then
they get hit and grab someone.

2446
02:14:21,510 --> 02:14:24,390
Cause that's just everyone's instinct
and they grabbed them and then you have a

2447
02:14:24,391 --> 02:14:27,070
little [inaudible] no, no, no,
no, no. Keep, keep punching.

2448
02:14:27,330 --> 02:14:30,630
Like don't do anything to avoid from
it. No, no, no, no. Step it back out.

2449
02:14:30,720 --> 02:14:32,850
And then they do that in
MMA, you'll see a lot,

2450
02:14:32,851 --> 02:14:34,170
someone get hit and then you know,

2451
02:14:34,171 --> 02:14:37,560
they get into a clinch and you get a few
minutes in a clinch where they're kind

2452
02:14:37,561 --> 02:14:39,840
of like, okay, I'm not taking
all the damage right now.

2453
02:14:39,900 --> 02:14:42,780
But the smart thing about that is
that's how you're supposed to fight.

2454
02:14:43,110 --> 02:14:46,290
Like you're giving people options to
defend themselves. It shouldn't be,

2455
02:14:46,291 --> 02:14:48,930
you can't defend yourself
other than punching back.

2456
02:14:49,140 --> 02:14:51,090
That seems seems kind of crazy. Like,

2457
02:14:51,160 --> 02:14:53,670
but I could grab them and just
stop these punches. No, no, no.

2458
02:14:53,700 --> 02:14:55,950
Against the rules. And what
kind of rules do we have?

2459
02:14:55,951 --> 02:14:59,010
Like you can only beat me up if I let
you beat me. That was one of the points.

2460
02:15:00,360 --> 02:15:03,030
[inaudible] dance around for an half
hour. But do you remember the original,

2461
02:15:03,080 --> 02:15:06,200
there was like Gracie videos that
they'd make an early UFC inaction.

2462
02:15:06,310 --> 02:15:09,030
And what they used to say all
the time was, and it's so true,

2463
02:15:09,110 --> 02:15:12,600
it was so interesting, is that if
two boxers just have a street fight,

2464
02:15:12,900 --> 02:15:16,320
they're going into a clinch and it's
probably going to end up on the ground at

2465
02:15:16,321 --> 02:15:16,780
some points.

2466
02:15:16,780 --> 02:15:20,580
I'm playing because the ref has this
break up a clinch over and over and over

2467
02:15:20,581 --> 02:15:23,040
again to make boxing
happen. Like even when,

2468
02:15:23,220 --> 02:15:25,830
even when you're a professional boxer
and you don't know anything about

2469
02:15:25,831 --> 02:15:26,730
wrestling or grappling,

2470
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:30,240
you still end up grabbing the other guy
cause that's just like the only time

2471
02:15:30,241 --> 02:15:31,290
that doesn't take places.

2472
02:15:31,550 --> 02:15:33,540
When one guy knows how to strike
and the other guy doesn't.

2473
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:37,320
And you see a lot of those videos online
where two dudes decided to get into

2474
02:15:37,321 --> 02:15:40,740
some sort of a street altercation and
one guy actually he's like a boxer and co

2475
02:15:41,140 --> 02:15:44,730
and he catches the guy and the guy falls
and bounces his head off the concrete

2476
02:15:44,970 --> 02:15:47,760
out called. There's a bunch of those
things that's bad. That's different.

2477
02:15:48,200 --> 02:15:51,240
So the thing about the Gracie Jujitsu
is like you got to always be aware of

2478
02:15:51,340 --> 02:15:52,770
this. People like that out there. There's,

2479
02:15:52,800 --> 02:15:55,620
there's always guys who can punch you
in the face and if they know how to

2480
02:15:55,621 --> 02:15:58,590
wrestle too and they can keep you away
and just keep punching you in the face,

2481
02:15:59,340 --> 02:16:01,500
you better know how to take
them down. You're still no dude.

2482
02:16:01,510 --> 02:16:05,500
Fuck the 2019 you have
[inaudible] people, Shit,

2483
02:16:05,690 --> 02:16:08,760
you got to look at their ears. You
got to look for the little signs,

2484
02:16:08,761 --> 02:16:12,850
like look in their eyes
[inaudible] next to infuse it.

2485
02:16:12,890 --> 02:16:17,010
Skinny necks aren't getting choked as
far as like skill like definitely, yeah.

2486
02:16:17,011 --> 02:16:20,700
You don't know weird time for fighting.
You know it's like, and we, we both,

2487
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:23,490
I like both kinds. I like
just stand up only fights.

2488
02:16:23,790 --> 02:16:27,370
I like watching those and I like mixed
martial arts fights but I think like a

2489
02:16:27,720 --> 02:16:31,990
tans Crawford's coming on next. And I
think watching someone like him box,

2490
02:16:32,230 --> 02:16:36,250
like when you see the skill level
that that guy has switching stances,

2491
02:16:36,490 --> 02:16:38,800
doing all kinds of befuddling
people getting their range,

2492
02:16:38,801 --> 02:16:42,010
figuring them out and then just
teeing them up with perfect timing.

2493
02:16:42,280 --> 02:16:46,090
Like that's almost only
possible that kind of artistry.

2494
02:16:46,091 --> 02:16:49,720
If there's no wrestling right, there's
no leg kicks. If there's only the boxing,

2495
02:16:49,750 --> 02:16:51,490
that's the only way
you see that like that,

2496
02:16:51,491 --> 02:16:54,430
that kind of like beautiful comedy cause
otherwise you would do other shit too.

2497
02:16:54,780 --> 02:16:58,890
You would leg kick, you would try to
take them down. And that, so like the,

2498
02:16:58,891 --> 02:17:01,980
the level of dominance that
are real Floyd Mayweather,

2499
02:17:02,030 --> 02:17:05,140
a real world champion
boxer has with their hands.

2500
02:17:05,320 --> 02:17:09,040
It's hard to really appreciate
until you see it live. And you know,

2501
02:17:09,041 --> 02:17:09,940
like what you're seeing.

2502
02:17:09,941 --> 02:17:13,150
Like if you're in the building with
a guy always beating somebody up when

2503
02:17:13,270 --> 02:17:16,510
they're sparring, it's
like, oh, like this is,

2504
02:17:16,720 --> 02:17:20,080
you guys are playing two totally
different games by boxing. It's like,

2505
02:17:20,140 --> 02:17:24,670
I literally look at boxing as like very
much a sport and I think MMA is the

2506
02:17:24,671 --> 02:17:26,110
closest thing that we have.

2507
02:17:26,800 --> 02:17:30,430
Two competitive fighting 100% that's
sort of like the difference. It's,

2508
02:17:30,450 --> 02:17:32,560
you know, all things considered,
it's still not fighting.

2509
02:17:32,620 --> 02:17:35,160
You can't grab somebody's fucking balls
and Yank him off their bodies to bite

2510
02:17:35,380 --> 02:17:39,100
their nose. I know. [inaudible]
the Joe son who good got a,

2511
02:17:39,101 --> 02:17:42,580
you couldn't buy it and you couldn't, I
gouge, hit him with a fucking trash can.

2512
02:17:42,800 --> 02:17:45,520
Lid. We can't, we can't
fish hook and then,

2513
02:17:45,521 --> 02:17:48,820
but you used to be able to punch the
balls. There was a fucking great video of

2514
02:17:50,950 --> 02:17:51,910
Keith Hackney Fighting
Joe Song. Joe Sohn got up,

2515
02:17:52,190 --> 02:17:55,480
got him in a headlock and Keke fat
and he's just hammering his deck.

2516
02:17:55,780 --> 02:17:59,740
I mean full bloods and hunches over and
over and you see like Joe sounds like

2517
02:17:59,741 --> 02:18:02,230
going into shock. He takes
a few of them and he's like,

2518
02:18:02,231 --> 02:18:05,890
I'm not letting go with this joke.
[inaudible] fourth, Fifth Dick Punch.

2519
02:18:05,891 --> 02:18:08,040
It's like this is all over man over.

2520
02:18:08,290 --> 02:18:12,130
He was a drained head. Was it chemo?

2521
02:18:12,380 --> 02:18:17,080
Was He head budding hoists? Crazy. Yeah.
Yeah. Dude, that was fucking brutal.

2522
02:18:17,110 --> 02:18:19,510
Brutal. There was a lot of
head button back in the days.

2523
02:18:19,511 --> 02:18:23,050
It was an effective weapon and it
makes us like, oh, that's awful.

2524
02:18:23,051 --> 02:18:25,990
But small finger locks in
there. All these other bones.

2525
02:18:26,110 --> 02:18:29,050
How come you're allowed to hit with
these bones but you can't hit with that

2526
02:18:29,051 --> 02:18:29,801
bone. You also,

2527
02:18:29,801 --> 02:18:34,180
I would rather be headbutted by a guy
that I don't give a shit of what there's

2528
02:18:34,181 --> 02:18:35,890
no, there's not much
technique and headbutting.

2529
02:18:36,100 --> 02:18:39,160
I would rather be headbutted then be head
kicked by a dude who knows how to head

2530
02:18:39,161 --> 02:18:41,800
kick. You think there's no
tech, but there really is.

2531
02:18:41,830 --> 02:18:46,830
There's guys that spar and they fight and
left way and left the way is a type of

2532
02:18:47,410 --> 02:18:51,160
uh, Moitai where they put
ropes, uh, over their knuckles.

2533
02:18:51,161 --> 02:18:52,480
That's the only thing they have.

2534
02:18:52,510 --> 02:18:56,050
And they're allowed to head butt
and it's some wild ass shit.

2535
02:18:56,051 --> 02:19:00,460
And they do headbutt combinations on
the pad. Like they'll do tap, tap bang.

2536
02:19:00,670 --> 02:19:03,790
They'll like use their
head and train it. Wow.

2537
02:19:03,791 --> 02:19:08,440
Learn how TV and find
that left way. W E I t l.

2538
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:13,390
U. T. H. D, You know, does commentary for
it is our friend Robin Black. He does,

2539
02:19:13,710 --> 02:19:15,340
uh, he does commentary for the left way,

2540
02:19:15,341 --> 02:19:19,840
but this is a brutal form of [inaudible]
where you're allowed to head butt cause

2541
02:19:19,841 --> 02:19:22,930
they already elbow. And I think,
you know, they're thinking, well,

2542
02:19:22,931 --> 02:19:25,240
if I can need and find any
content, I can do all these things.

2543
02:19:25,241 --> 02:19:28,160
Why can't I head button? It's right
there. He's fucking faces right

2544
02:19:28,170 --> 02:19:31,670
there. Ah, well you remember what,
uh, what Mark Coleman used to do?

2545
02:19:31,671 --> 02:19:34,640
Like he got a full year of season
before the headbutts were illegal.

2546
02:19:34,910 --> 02:19:36,920
Do. And he would, he would
smash people with the headbutts.

2547
02:19:36,950 --> 02:19:40,280
So here we'll be this
dude with this combination
[inaudible] so this is a Robin,

2548
02:19:40,610 --> 02:19:45,200
Robin black breakdown when he, he
goes, this dude goes off to the side,

2549
02:19:45,290 --> 02:19:49,430
pushes the dude's head away and then
immediately comes in with a perfect head

2550
02:19:49,670 --> 02:19:50,503
button. Boom.

2551
02:19:50,700 --> 02:19:53,780
It just slamming him in the face on
purpose with the top of his head.

2552
02:19:53,781 --> 02:19:57,290
So he's trying to hit like his eyes
and his nose and the soft tissue.

2553
02:19:57,500 --> 02:19:59,810
He's trying to hit that with
the hard part of his forehead.

2554
02:20:00,220 --> 02:20:02,830
Yeah. I think they do a lot
more damage than a fist.

2555
02:20:04,320 --> 02:20:07,160
But he only works one out
of every thousand times.

2556
02:20:07,800 --> 02:20:11,820
Lynn. No, no, no, no. This dot guy does
it a lot and if you do it this way,

2557
02:20:12,060 --> 02:20:13,020
the way he's doing it,

2558
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:17,700
you taking a really hard part of your
forehead and you're smashing against a

2559
02:20:17,701 --> 02:20:19,920
soft part of the eyes and the nose.

2560
02:20:20,310 --> 02:20:22,710
This part of your forehead
is hard as fuck man.

2561
02:20:23,040 --> 02:20:25,920
Most guys who break their hand
and fights break their hands

2562
02:20:25,950 --> 02:20:28,470
top of the head. Yeah. Especially boxing.

2563
02:20:28,590 --> 02:20:32,730
The Tila Tequila reality show is two guys
were fighting over and that was like a

2564
02:20:33,090 --> 02:20:36,720
reality show that, oh, he
broke his chin, opened a thing,

2565
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:39,300
and like it's separates his teeth.
He takes the head butts to the mouth.

2566
02:20:39,440 --> 02:20:42,210
It's a spitting out. The
blood's not turning. Uh,

2567
02:20:42,600 --> 02:20:44,980
you ever see someone get covered? The
blood's not turning red yet. It's black.

2568
02:20:45,330 --> 02:20:47,880
Black. He was like, yeah, he's playing.

2569
02:20:47,881 --> 02:20:52,080
What happens is his jaw splits down the
middle where you literally see his teeth

2570
02:20:52,081 --> 02:20:54,450
separate because it's
cracks in half like that.

2571
02:20:54,451 --> 02:20:57,570
It's the most horrific thing I've
ever seen. This VH1, by the way,

2572
02:20:57,720 --> 02:21:02,360
I saw that video. Whole classics. Talk
about it. A woman's fight. Really? Yeah.

2573
02:21:02,370 --> 02:21:06,510
Yeah. It was a Randy couture, his
wife Kim coture. Oh yeah. She fought,

2574
02:21:06,511 --> 02:21:10,200
she got her job broken and
it was separated and she
went out and fought the next

2575
02:21:10,201 --> 02:21:14,550
round with the jaw
separate touch, a Predator,

2576
02:21:15,660 --> 02:21:18,510
the the asshole inside and inside.

2577
02:21:18,510 --> 02:21:22,680
He was moving around and then she had
to get it wired up and fixed after the

2578
02:21:22,681 --> 02:21:27,270
fight was crazy. In the
sixth grade. Uh, he was,

2579
02:21:27,271 --> 02:21:29,880
he got into a fist fight with this
other kid and this other kid had brass

2580
02:21:29,881 --> 02:21:32,360
knuckles and Breslin was a wreck.

2581
02:21:32,560 --> 02:21:36,320
You'd buy him at like the mall
when I was a kid. Martial arts shy.

2582
02:21:36,440 --> 02:21:39,750
You'd give get like butterfly
knives. Nunchucks flying stars. Yeah.

2583
02:21:40,070 --> 02:21:44,340
Brass sounded like you could just go in
and start 12th and by deadly weapons.

2584
02:21:44,341 --> 02:21:45,260
Yeah man. They,

2585
02:21:45,330 --> 02:21:50,330
those little stores that would sell
nunchucks the size all the time.

2586
02:21:51,360 --> 02:21:52,370
Number two buttons.

2587
02:21:52,470 --> 02:21:55,770
So this kid had brass knuckles and he
fucking drilled this kid in the face and

2588
02:21:55,771 --> 02:21:59,460
broke his jaw. And for the whole
school year, like half school year,

2589
02:21:59,461 --> 02:22:03,150
he had to have a wire jaw
who should drinking chocolate
milk at lunch every day.

2590
02:22:03,180 --> 02:22:07,780
What happened? They can't even
tell the story. [inaudible]

2591
02:22:07,820 --> 02:22:09,060
punched him. He was a kid.

2592
02:22:09,061 --> 02:22:12,240
So it wasn't like Juvie or anything
that it was just like he got in trouble,

2593
02:22:12,340 --> 02:22:16,160
but that's it. Now you got
arrested? No, no. Didn't get it.

2594
02:22:16,650 --> 02:22:18,780
Didn't get arrested to go to
school together after that,

2595
02:22:20,030 --> 02:22:22,260
remove the brass copper kid from
the school. Didn't happen at school.

2596
02:22:22,261 --> 02:22:24,640
It happened to add a school. I
don't think that the kid who did it,

2597
02:22:24,650 --> 02:22:26,880
I know the who did. I don't think
he went to the same school, man.

2598
02:22:26,910 --> 02:22:30,300
Sorry for hitting you with brass
knuckles. The math homework, dude,

2599
02:22:30,730 --> 02:22:33,450
that's who's cool. That's
just, but that's terrifying.

2600
02:22:33,451 --> 02:22:36,600
That's where it's like you just don't
want to fuck with people like, well,

2601
02:22:36,601 --> 02:22:38,780
kids would get beat up
at home too. The kids,

2602
02:22:38,860 --> 02:22:42,390
the kids who get beat up by their
parents, they're ready to beat people up.

2603
02:22:42,391 --> 02:22:45,930
Of course be, it's becomes a
part of your, your everyday life.

2604
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:46,860
You're mad at people,

2605
02:22:46,861 --> 02:22:49,470
you hit them mad at people that are
smaller than you didn't get away with it.

2606
02:22:49,471 --> 02:22:51,510
You hit him. Yeah. I don't think
people talk about that enough.

2607
02:22:51,540 --> 02:22:54,210
They talk about all the violence in the
world and nobody's talking about the

2608
02:22:54,211 --> 02:22:56,100
fact that since kids are toddlers,

2609
02:22:56,101 --> 02:22:58,650
they're being hit by the people that are
supposed to protect the most and that

2610
02:22:58,651 --> 02:23:01,740
fucks them up psychologically and it
does something to them. It's awful.

2611
02:23:01,741 --> 02:23:02,970
And it's a cycle, right?

2612
02:23:02,971 --> 02:23:06,120
You hit your kids because your dad hit
you and that's what made you the man that

2613
02:23:06,121 --> 02:23:07,820
you are today. That kind of horseshoe.

2614
02:23:07,890 --> 02:23:11,520
But it's so weird that it's the only
relationship where if you bring up this

2615
02:23:11,521 --> 02:23:13,950
topic, people will justify headache.

2616
02:23:14,100 --> 02:23:17,340
It's the only like no one will publicly
justify hitting their chick or hitting

2617
02:23:17,341 --> 02:23:20,430
their grandfather, taking personally.
Like you're attacking their parents.

2618
02:23:20,530 --> 02:23:23,910
They take it like they know, like my
mom's not a bad, my mom's a good mom. She,

2619
02:23:23,911 --> 02:23:26,850
you know, I deserved it. They'll tell
you that I deserved it. It's crazy.

2620
02:23:26,880 --> 02:23:30,040
Isn't it so weird that if anyone,
if you said publicly like, uh,

2621
02:23:30,090 --> 02:23:33,090
you know that you give your girlfriend
a slap, if she acts the wrong way,

2622
02:23:33,240 --> 02:23:35,910
everyone would universally be
like, that is just pure evil.

2623
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:39,360
But if you say the same thing to
my two year old, my three year old,

2624
02:23:39,510 --> 02:23:40,770
everyone's just kinda like, whoa.

2625
02:23:40,830 --> 02:23:44,430
And then even I would do like conventional
questions, daughter, if you say,

2626
02:23:44,431 --> 02:23:47,610
if you grow, if my man talks too
much shit, I smack him in his face.

2627
02:23:47,760 --> 02:23:51,210
Girls would be like, you go girl. Sure.
Yes, that's true. But I also don't care.

2628
02:23:51,340 --> 02:23:52,680
That's like love on the fucking know.

2629
02:23:52,681 --> 02:23:55,650
But that's because the power dynamic
is the opposite. Right. You know,

2630
02:23:55,860 --> 02:23:58,170
like you're talking about the,
I'm not dating Cyborg. You may

2631
02:24:00,050 --> 02:24:02,740
[inaudible] give a shit. That's a serious
problem. If you're dating sideboard,

2632
02:24:03,520 --> 02:24:08,180
she's hitting me. Whatever her hands
are, the fucking real issue we, we catch.

2633
02:24:08,181 --> 02:24:12,420
She's gone. Huh? Out of the UFC
man, they fucked up. That sucks.

2634
02:24:12,450 --> 02:24:16,050
They made a video where it made it look
like Dana White was saying that they

2635
02:24:16,051 --> 02:24:19,950
just docked a added words that he
didn't say that was stupid. So dumb.

2636
02:24:20,340 --> 02:24:23,790
Do you think it was malicious or do think
it was a legitimate mistake in terms

2637
02:24:23,791 --> 02:24:26,790
of translating? There's no way it
could be anything other than stupid.

2638
02:24:27,540 --> 02:24:32,100
Whoever purpose, if it was done on
purpose. So it was just a stupid idea.

2639
02:24:32,370 --> 02:24:35,760
That's all it is. And it's really this
timing, whatever it is, whoever did it,

2640
02:24:35,850 --> 02:24:38,280
it just, that's just a
terrible error and it's,

2641
02:24:38,300 --> 02:24:42,420
it's really bad timing cause she
was almost uncomfortable last year,

2642
02:24:42,660 --> 02:24:47,250
but now Amanda Nunez came and kind of
took that juice and now it's like she's

2643
02:24:47,251 --> 02:24:51,480
damaged goods if she decides to
leave EOC without a Nunez rematch,

2644
02:24:51,780 --> 02:24:54,060
she beats Nunez. She gets
it all back, you know.

2645
02:24:54,061 --> 02:24:58,560
But she still say enough about the
star. She's, she'd go to one FC,

2646
02:24:58,561 --> 02:24:59,580
she'd go to bell tour,

2647
02:24:59,700 --> 02:25:03,020
she'd go to a lot of places and she'd
still be welcomed with open arms. She's,

2648
02:25:03,210 --> 02:25:06,570
she's a walked down the street and
get to huge pop star. Like, like she,

2649
02:25:06,590 --> 02:25:09,800
she shows up at those weigh in
shows and like the crowd flock star.

2650
02:25:09,810 --> 02:25:13,020
I remember just thinking that about
her. I saw her one time and there was,

2651
02:25:14,010 --> 02:25:18,390
I forget what this garden show and just
sat in like the front row of the UFC at

2652
02:25:18,391 --> 02:25:20,320
the garden and the place was like you,

2653
02:25:20,510 --> 02:25:22,920
you're so excited for just like turning
around and waving or because she was the

2654
02:25:22,930 --> 02:25:27,310
first like female terminator.
Yeah, Gina Carano.

2655
02:25:27,440 --> 02:25:29,650
And that was the bell
watching her beat up.

2656
02:25:29,651 --> 02:25:31,840
Gina Carano gives me
nightmares to this day.

2657
02:25:31,841 --> 02:25:35,350
It's crazy fight and the end of it when
there's a photo that we played on this

2658
02:25:35,351 --> 02:25:36,790
podcast before of her

2659
02:25:38,410 --> 02:25:43,410
sideboards hand palming gene has had
with black fingernails and she's punching

2660
02:25:43,421 --> 02:25:46,330
her in the face at the same
time. She's holding her head,

2661
02:25:46,540 --> 02:25:49,860
slamming her fist in the face.
You're like, I want out Jana.

2662
02:25:50,190 --> 02:25:53,390
Gina was queen when it was like
three minute rounds. They're like,

2663
02:25:53,770 --> 02:25:58,460
we all fought three minute rounds back
then for women. Yeah. Was half tops also.

2664
02:26:00,640 --> 02:26:04,600
You know, she was taking some stuff,
you know? For sure. For sure. Yeah,

2665
02:26:04,601 --> 02:26:05,450
for sure. That this,

2666
02:26:05,630 --> 02:26:09,370
that's part of the issue in [inaudible]
positive for some stuff. It's a,

2667
02:26:09,371 --> 02:26:12,160
you know, that's part of what
it is. It's part of what it is.

2668
02:26:12,220 --> 02:26:15,880
The build up to the Gina Carano fight
was when she choked out the news guy,

2669
02:26:15,881 --> 02:26:18,580
right? That was kind of viral was her.

2670
02:26:18,581 --> 02:26:21,430
I got news guy being like to put her
in like a rear naked choke and she had

2671
02:26:21,431 --> 02:26:23,500
choked him unconscious. It comes back to,

2672
02:26:23,660 --> 02:26:26,020
it's like very uncomfortable and
weird shrubs don't want to do it.

2673
02:26:26,021 --> 02:26:28,330
And then he was like, you could
see you could do it, it's fine.

2674
02:26:28,331 --> 02:26:32,590
And then he just looks like he was like,
it was one of those bands on gas for,

2675
02:26:32,730 --> 02:26:36,700
you'd get up and and make noises believe
that they're really gonna go out like

2676
02:26:36,701 --> 02:26:39,670
that. They don't believe they're
going to go out so quick. Yeah.

2677
02:26:40,770 --> 02:26:43,690
In the sixth grade we used to do the
thing where we would hyper Glendale game.

2678
02:26:43,800 --> 02:26:44,410
Yeah.

2679
02:26:44,410 --> 02:26:49,210
So you bend over and you just breathe
really heavy for like a minute, as hard,

2680
02:26:49,211 --> 02:26:51,190
as hard as you can. And then
when you come up really fast,

2681
02:26:51,191 --> 02:26:54,280
you're already light-headed. And
then your friend puts his hands,

2682
02:26:54,281 --> 02:26:57,790
his palms and your carotid arteries
and just presses kinda light.

2683
02:26:58,060 --> 02:27:01,840
And then within three seconds you
just slide down the wall. Whoa.

2684
02:27:01,990 --> 02:27:03,220
It was my first time
I ever got high. Yeah.

2685
02:27:03,221 --> 02:27:07,520
But your friends will let you fall
and hit your fucking head. Yeah. No,

2686
02:27:08,170 --> 02:27:11,590
you fall, bounce your hook and head
off a curve. You gotta catch him.

2687
02:27:12,930 --> 02:27:15,280
I gotta knock him out. I got to get Jim.

2688
02:27:15,850 --> 02:27:18,550
I don't think that's
necessarily that bad for you,

2689
02:27:18,551 --> 02:27:22,210
but it's definitely not good for you,
especially when your [inaudible]. Yeah.

2690
02:27:22,270 --> 02:27:25,960
11 developing your brown
probably shouldn't do it.

2691
02:27:26,380 --> 02:27:31,300
Don't be choking out, but
it's a, it happens all the
time in the gym and no one,

2692
02:27:31,930 --> 02:27:34,120
no one stops that. They
get choked unconscious.

2693
02:27:34,121 --> 02:27:36,400
They wake up and they go back
to rolling again and they,

2694
02:27:36,401 --> 02:27:38,320
the way they talk about it
like it's a garden hose,

2695
02:27:38,321 --> 02:27:41,260
the garden hose shuts off the power
to the brain. Then everything's fine,

2696
02:27:41,500 --> 02:27:43,780
but I'm like, man, you ain't a doctor.

2697
02:27:45,810 --> 02:27:47,200
God knows how to choke people.

2698
02:27:48,190 --> 02:27:51,730
Show me some long term studies on dudes
who've been choked unconscious multiple

2699
02:27:51,731 --> 02:27:55,570
times. Show me a doctor making
garden hose analogy. Call me a bitch.

2700
02:27:55,600 --> 02:27:59,710
I'll tap quick. I'm not going
unconscious, man. Stop. That's silly.

2701
02:27:59,711 --> 02:28:02,350
I don't want it. Yeah, I'd
go an unconscious thing.
Who knows what that's doing?

2702
02:28:02,830 --> 02:28:03,850
You're going into the Netherlands.

2703
02:28:03,910 --> 02:28:06,320
He might come back a totally different
person. Totally different. Life.

2704
02:28:07,950 --> 02:28:12,640
Should have been a hundred years. You
come back with a false memory of the past.

2705
02:28:13,530 --> 02:28:17,470
Totally new dementia. Lived a hundred
lives since then since I was knocked out.

2706
02:28:17,570 --> 02:28:21,980
Dad had that happens to guys because
when they get hit and knocked out, when

2707
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:22,671
they come to,

2708
02:28:22,671 --> 02:28:26,270
they do not know what happened and they
have to be reminded over and over and

2709
02:28:26,271 --> 02:28:30,590
over again. Uh, I mean it must feel like
you woke up and you have the dimension,

2710
02:28:30,591 --> 02:28:32,060
like it must feel surreal.

2711
02:28:32,510 --> 02:28:34,370
[inaudible] told me a story
after the Dan Anderson fight.

2712
02:28:34,371 --> 02:28:36,620
He literally had no idea what happened.

2713
02:28:37,520 --> 02:28:40,850
It was like he had no idea where
he was. He didn't even thought he,

2714
02:28:40,851 --> 02:28:43,850
he thought his fight was a few weeks
out still. Yeah, that's what it was.

2715
02:28:44,020 --> 02:28:45,950
Scary Shit Ben asking.

2716
02:28:46,050 --> 02:28:49,020
We're saying he has no memory of like
anything in the arena. After that,

2717
02:28:49,640 --> 02:28:54,410
Dan was one of the worst. That's what
I was [inaudible] out of the arena.

2718
02:28:54,411 --> 02:28:57,530
So slow. That was one of the
worst knockouts of all time.

2719
02:28:57,590 --> 02:29:02,180
The amount of power that your flying
knee has when you're ducking into it is

2720
02:29:02,181 --> 02:29:05,890
accentuated because he's going in for
the take down and he's got a strong take

2721
02:29:05,891 --> 02:29:06,321
down. Right.

2722
02:29:06,321 --> 02:29:11,321
So he's going in with everything he has
face first and [inaudible] running at

2723
02:29:11,751 --> 02:29:13,760
him. Oh my God. It's the hurt.

2724
02:29:13,940 --> 02:29:17,060
That's the biggest impact I think on
sports ever seen as we're talking about

2725
02:29:17,061 --> 02:29:19,210
football players crushing other.
That's the moment of impact.

2726
02:29:19,260 --> 02:29:22,490
What were the dangerous thing about two
football players crashing their bodies

2727
02:29:22,491 --> 02:29:23,960
into each other. It's exactly that.

2728
02:29:24,290 --> 02:29:28,970
And they are super athletes creating
that momentum. I mean, yes, it's nuts.

2729
02:29:28,971 --> 02:29:32,630
How crazy is it to be undefeated?
Never to lose to anybody.

2730
02:29:32,631 --> 02:29:34,100
And then that's your one.

2731
02:29:34,520 --> 02:29:37,880
Your one blemish is like
the biggest nonsense.

2732
02:29:38,380 --> 02:29:41,870
So much shit that it sucks cause I like
Bam. I'm a big fan. He's really funny.

2733
02:29:41,871 --> 02:29:42,704
I then too,

2734
02:29:43,250 --> 02:29:46,730
he talks so much shit and when you talk
shit like that and then you fucking

2735
02:29:47,150 --> 02:29:49,090
Louis, he's got it. He's
got to eat those words. No,

2736
02:29:49,100 --> 02:29:50,870
he's marketed himself amazingly.

2737
02:29:50,950 --> 02:29:54,980
And then that's part of the marketing
himself is like he has his own down-home

2738
02:29:54,981 --> 02:29:58,340
version talking shit. You know,
like even as boom roasted thing.

2739
02:29:58,341 --> 02:30:02,210
Like you could tell it's like he's almost
kind of playing a doofus character,

2740
02:30:02,570 --> 02:30:03,800
but he's a very smart guy.

2741
02:30:03,830 --> 02:30:07,650
Like I had him on the podcast and he
sends me book recommendations and Shit.

2742
02:30:07,760 --> 02:30:11,240
He's like a really well read,
interesting guy. He just,

2743
02:30:11,241 --> 02:30:14,660
that's his character and his in his part
of his strategy is to know the fuck out

2744
02:30:14,661 --> 02:30:17,960
of you. But when you flatlined
him like that, after a note,

2745
02:30:17,961 --> 02:30:22,260
him annoying the fuck out of, you know
what's that word? Shodan fraud hasn't,

2746
02:30:22,540 --> 02:30:27,290
what does that word? Just desserts.
What does that call did? I don't know.

2747
02:30:27,580 --> 02:30:32,580
Something like the [inaudible] the
pleasure that you feel from someone else's

2748
02:30:34,670 --> 02:30:37,940
obvious demise, right? Is
that how that sounds right?

2749
02:30:38,540 --> 02:30:41,780
Is that pleasure derived from another
person's misfortune and there you go.

2750
02:30:42,140 --> 02:30:46,160
That's what it is. Because with that it's
like, it's almost like in a weird way,

2751
02:30:46,161 --> 02:30:49,430
that's what he was trying to get
mouse but all to do like go crazy.

2752
02:30:49,460 --> 02:30:53,180
So the takedowns are there, but if
it doesn't work out it goes very bad.

2753
02:30:53,450 --> 02:30:56,930
Well Mossville doll just took that
chance with that flying knee entry and he

2754
02:30:56,931 --> 02:31:00,140
practiced it over and over and over
again and he kind of knew what the way he

2755
02:31:00,141 --> 02:31:01,250
circled. See the,

2756
02:31:01,251 --> 02:31:05,230
we circled the circle off to the side
and then came out on that way. We'll see.

2757
02:31:05,390 --> 02:31:09,920
We knew he would go at him with feeding
into him that way and so it perfectly

2758
02:31:10,130 --> 02:31:11,420
taught cause he was
coming down from the side.

2759
02:31:11,600 --> 02:31:14,570
He knew he was going to lean in that
way, but he also mounts with all said,

2760
02:31:14,571 --> 02:31:15,110
he was like,

2761
02:31:15,110 --> 02:31:17,870
I w I was real confident if he took
me down I was going to get back up.

2762
02:31:17,960 --> 02:31:20,970
And that does kind of demonstrate that
like if you're a real concerned about the

2763
02:31:20,980 --> 02:31:24,540
takedown, you're probably not going to
open with sprinting into a flying name,

2764
02:31:24,541 --> 02:31:25,081
which is one it goes.

2765
02:31:25,081 --> 02:31:29,610
Mazda doll is not even a dude who is known
for being this unbelievable wrestler.

2766
02:31:29,880 --> 02:31:34,860
But first time I saw Mazda doll was an
old school Kimbo slice a Miami backyard

2767
02:31:34,861 --> 02:31:36,060
fighting video. Yeah,

2768
02:31:36,150 --> 02:31:38,790
he did those dude [inaudible] he
came out and he fought this guy,

2769
02:31:38,791 --> 02:31:43,500
I think his name was big ray and was guy
was like 230 pounds and it was George

2770
02:31:43,501 --> 02:31:47,700
and it was like 180 pounds. And
he can not just boxes dude up.

2771
02:31:47,730 --> 02:31:50,040
And it was so bad. Like all
the kids were followers,

2772
02:31:50,060 --> 02:31:52,920
like chickens running around the
backyard. It was so hardcore.

2773
02:31:52,921 --> 02:31:53,754
And then he ends up being a,

2774
02:31:53,950 --> 02:31:57,540
someone to I think Strikeforce a few
years later is when I saw him in MMA and

2775
02:31:57,770 --> 02:32:00,570
uh, he's had a pretty crazy trajectory
to be where he's at right now.

2776
02:32:00,570 --> 02:32:04,350
He is right on the cusp of being, you
know, if he, if he give him the title,

2777
02:32:04,490 --> 02:32:05,970
he'll be one of the
biggest stars in the sport.

2778
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,370
He's one of the best motherfuckers
in the sport for sure.

2779
02:32:08,371 --> 02:32:11,110
There's no doubt about it with
everything. He's super well-rounded.

2780
02:32:11,130 --> 02:32:13,440
He can do everything. His
take down defense is amazing.

2781
02:32:13,750 --> 02:32:16,860
He's got some of the best hands
in the division period. I mean,

2782
02:32:16,861 --> 02:32:21,360
you look at him knocking out Darren till
with that leap in left hook. The way,

2783
02:32:21,361 --> 02:32:22,710
the way he did it, the way he set it up,

2784
02:32:22,711 --> 02:32:25,740
he landed it earlier and then he
landed again. He figured it out.

2785
02:32:25,741 --> 02:32:28,230
He figured out a spot with this guys open.

2786
02:32:28,410 --> 02:32:31,860
There's like this dip in what he
does. And he found that opening,

2787
02:32:32,040 --> 02:32:35,330
he's gotten better, right? Like he's
definitely like, he's decimal syndicated,

2788
02:32:35,490 --> 02:32:37,020
he's more dedicated, you know,

2789
02:32:37,021 --> 02:32:40,110
and now he wants a big payday and so
they're probably talking about doing that.

2790
02:32:40,500 --> 02:32:43,980
Nate Diaz, he'll get a big pay down
on that one. That's a big fight.

2791
02:32:43,981 --> 02:32:46,910
That fight will be huge. Isn't it?

2792
02:32:46,920 --> 02:32:49,890
Fucked up that it was one is the one
that I'm almost out of all of the guys

2793
02:32:49,891 --> 02:32:53,250
we're talking about, I'm least intrigued
to watch fight next. Oh Man, I'm not,

2794
02:32:53,310 --> 02:32:57,600
I fucking love watching that guy fight
cause he's got this marauding relentless

2795
02:32:57,601 --> 02:33:01,860
style that's very similar to Colbys
except he hits harder and he'll,

2796
02:33:01,861 --> 02:33:05,220
he'll try to take people out. Like
Colby Colby just keeps that heat on you.

2797
02:33:05,250 --> 02:33:08,190
Yeah. But Colby striking technique
might be a little bit better.

2798
02:33:08,191 --> 02:33:09,270
It doesn't hit quite as hard.

2799
02:33:09,271 --> 02:33:11,400
But the stuff he was showing
against Robbie Lawler,

2800
02:33:11,610 --> 02:33:14,730
those jabs and body kicks and stuff,
I mean that was pretty impressive.

2801
02:33:14,800 --> 02:33:18,960
So he's friends with my buddy cam
Hanes and they trained together and uh,

2802
02:33:19,440 --> 02:33:21,270
can't Cam's description
of him. He said, listen,

2803
02:33:21,300 --> 02:33:23,190
the guy talks all this crazy
shit. Right. He's doing it,

2804
02:33:23,191 --> 02:33:26,730
but he never stopped training.
He's just constantly training.

2805
02:33:26,760 --> 02:33:29,820
That's why he's got that insane cardio.
He knows that's as big as weapon.

2806
02:33:30,150 --> 02:33:33,780
His biggest weapon is he's like,
he's like, ready, keep up. Wait,

2807
02:33:33,781 --> 02:33:35,220
hey,

2808
02:33:35,570 --> 02:33:38,490
you got to try to keep up and he's fucking
going and going and going and going

2809
02:33:38,640 --> 02:33:39,630
and everybody wills.

2810
02:33:39,960 --> 02:33:42,660
That's why I'm so interested to see who
spawn fight cause he's gonna fight him

2811
02:33:42,990 --> 02:33:46,650
and Ooh, smog does the same thing to
people. That's what he did. I think Tyron,

2812
02:33:46,680 --> 02:33:48,510
I think there was issues with
Tyler and going into that fight.

2813
02:33:48,511 --> 02:33:51,060
He looks like a shell of
himself. It wasn't firing back,

2814
02:33:51,150 --> 02:33:54,810
but some of that you got to give credit
to Ou Swan, that fucking pressure,

2815
02:33:54,811 --> 02:33:59,610
that relentless pressure is striking,
which is just, he knows how to fight long.

2816
02:33:59,730 --> 02:34:02,820
He's got an incredible
fucking ground and pound game.

2817
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:06,450
He's got real knockout power and Colby
did a similar thing to Robbie Lawler

2818
02:34:06,451 --> 02:34:08,730
where it kind of looked like,
why isn't he firing back?

2819
02:34:08,731 --> 02:34:11,460
Why isn't hit because he's caught, his
back's on the cage getting taken down.

2820
02:34:11,461 --> 02:34:12,510
He's getting jabbed constantly.

2821
02:34:12,511 --> 02:34:17,070
I never has a moment to just reset and
take a deep breath cause like he's just

2822
02:34:17,110 --> 02:34:20,940
on you. The whole fight guys didn't
use to fight that way. And I,

2823
02:34:20,990 --> 02:34:22,270
I talked to Colby about this,

2824
02:34:22,271 --> 02:34:25,810
we were talking about the principle of
like how like how hard do you do when you

2825
02:34:25,811 --> 02:34:26,790
punch in, how already punching.

2826
02:34:26,800 --> 02:34:31,800
He's like 70% so he just hit him with a
steady stream of 70% you never see him

2827
02:34:32,351 --> 02:34:35,930
bite down and fucking, you
never see that those would,

2828
02:34:35,940 --> 02:34:39,160
DC always likes to call big
actions, those big actions,

2829
02:34:39,460 --> 02:34:42,550
those cost a lot of energy and you've
got to figure out when to do those.

2830
02:34:42,940 --> 02:34:46,260
Maybe you're Francis and Ghana and
those big actions lead to ouster Overeem

2831
02:34:46,270 --> 02:34:49,810
getting knocked into the
Netherlands. But if not,

2832
02:34:50,050 --> 02:34:53,980
then you're going to blow out your gas.
Like we saw him with steep Emile church,

2833
02:34:54,640 --> 02:34:56,410
lifted them over the
head in the first round.

2834
02:34:56,411 --> 02:34:59,350
And how cool does that look that you're
holding this huge guy over your head and

2835
02:34:59,351 --> 02:34:59,980
dropping them.

2836
02:34:59,980 --> 02:35:03,100
But then after that you kind of just get
to take down and he gets back up to his

2837
02:35:03,101 --> 02:35:05,350
feet. And then by the fourth
round you're kind of wondering,

2838
02:35:05,740 --> 02:35:08,310
is that really good strategy
to be lifting these guys over?

2839
02:35:09,330 --> 02:35:11,800
[inaudible] paid when Steve Bay fought
Francis and Ghana. Oh, that one.

2840
02:35:12,210 --> 02:35:16,690
I managed to avoid the big actions of
in Ghana and then wear them out and then

2841
02:35:16,691 --> 02:35:18,550
take it down and beat him
up and retain the title.

2842
02:35:18,640 --> 02:35:20,290
The only guy that's been
able to survive in Ghana,

2843
02:35:20,680 --> 02:35:24,910
the DC fight is a hard one to watch man,
because he's the best guy in the world.

2844
02:35:24,940 --> 02:35:27,100
He's so nice. I love that guy to death,

2845
02:35:27,280 --> 02:35:31,720
so watching him get his body destroyed
because he kept digging those left hooks

2846
02:35:31,830 --> 02:35:34,090
the body. I was like, Ooh.
Part of me was like, damn,

2847
02:35:34,091 --> 02:35:38,080
that's a pretty powerful album. Those
fucking loud, but it's, it's, it wasn't,

2848
02:35:38,380 --> 02:35:41,890
it was the crispness of it. He was,
he was standing in front of him,

2849
02:35:41,891 --> 02:35:46,120
popping them and then sliding back and
he would just stick that fucking left

2850
02:35:46,121 --> 02:35:49,870
hook into the liver and he kept
hitting it. Part of me was like, man,

2851
02:35:49,871 --> 02:35:54,460
that is a beautiful left hook, nasty body
shots, but pardon me? He's like, damn,

2852
02:35:54,461 --> 02:35:56,980
DC, you got to get away from
that. You got to get outta there.

2853
02:35:57,070 --> 02:35:59,170
You got to take this guy
down. It's hard when you're,

2854
02:35:59,410 --> 02:36:02,830
when you really love a guy and you
watched him fight, it's hard. It's very,

2855
02:36:02,831 --> 02:36:06,550
very difficult to do commentary.
Just what's the pain on the,

2856
02:36:06,560 --> 02:36:07,690
on the liver punches.

2857
02:36:08,120 --> 02:36:10,750
What could that or what's the damage
that can do this shut shoe that makes you

2858
02:36:10,751 --> 02:36:15,280
like, I've seen people crumble on,
I'm going to hit you with one punch,

2859
02:36:15,580 --> 02:36:19,480
but show me on a little, you don't want
it. It's a horrible feeling where like,

2860
02:36:19,540 --> 02:36:22,390
like shocks your body, your body goes like

2861
02:36:23,920 --> 02:36:27,660
it's or show. How about that show Dave,
where to hit right here. It's right.

2862
02:36:27,770 --> 02:36:30,330
You're almost getting shocked. Like
electrical lower. If you, if you,

2863
02:36:30,910 --> 02:36:34,660
if someone is standing in front of
you and they hit you with a left hook,

2864
02:36:34,661 --> 02:36:36,490
most likely they'd be
hitting you in the liver.

2865
02:36:36,730 --> 02:36:40,000
And it's like right where these
floating ribs are tucked in.

2866
02:36:40,630 --> 02:36:44,120
And when you slam someone hard like right
around the low, you know, it was um,

2867
02:36:44,230 --> 02:36:49,230
one of the masters of it is Canelo
Alvarez show Canelo Alvarez body shots.

2868
02:36:50,140 --> 02:36:52,660
Like maybe there's a video we could
look, he's got a beautiful one.

2869
02:36:52,661 --> 02:36:56,800
We steps in and just fucking rips that
left hook to the liver and just your body

2870
02:36:56,801 --> 02:37:00,700
just goes d it just fucking shots down.

2871
02:37:01,090 --> 02:37:03,730
It's the weirdest feeling man.
It's like your legs stop working.

2872
02:37:03,731 --> 02:37:06,640
Everything stops working
your whole body. Just see

2873
02:37:08,230 --> 02:37:11,590
it looks like it didn't happen
to them until that last one. Um,

2874
02:37:11,591 --> 02:37:15,290
I think he was playing poker face.
I think he was playing poker face.

2875
02:37:15,630 --> 02:37:17,690
[inaudible] Canelo is a
fucking master at this shit.

2876
02:37:17,691 --> 02:37:20,240
He would just dig this
thing, look at this. Whoa.

2877
02:37:20,300 --> 02:37:23,030
That one's only going the kid side
and that's going into the side.

2878
02:37:23,031 --> 02:37:25,450
But most of the time it's go into
the liver. Most of the time it,

2879
02:37:25,460 --> 02:37:28,010
well he's going to anything that's
open. Right. But that's the liver.

2880
02:37:28,040 --> 02:37:30,800
She's going for the liver against
Golovkin but Koloff Ken's got that lower,

2881
02:37:31,130 --> 02:37:34,490
that low guard with his right arm.
He's blocking it from happening.

2882
02:37:35,390 --> 02:37:38,630
The guy was coming up
next toxin. So much fun.

2883
02:37:38,840 --> 02:37:42,110
Like it's a fun sport to do. Well
when these kinds of guys are fighting,

2884
02:37:42,111 --> 02:37:44,930
when triple g and Canelo
are fighting like fuck.

2885
02:37:44,931 --> 02:37:46,760
It's like if you're a fan of the sport,

2886
02:37:46,761 --> 02:37:50,530
you've seen the highest
level two champions in their
prime going after it. It's,

2887
02:37:50,550 --> 02:37:51,890
it's amazing to watch,

2888
02:37:52,340 --> 02:37:55,490
but that punches a t like and getting
hit there is a terrible feeling.

2889
02:37:55,760 --> 02:38:00,230
And DC got hit there multiple times and
he was from like the second round on,

2890
02:38:00,620 --> 02:38:02,570
he was at, you were talking
about it when he was there,

2891
02:38:02,571 --> 02:38:05,600
but he was just putting his hands down
and kind of letting Steve Bay hit him as

2892
02:38:05,601 --> 02:38:08,630
hard, dangerous way to
fight steep Emile church.

2893
02:38:08,631 --> 02:38:13,040
Like I think he just wanted
to put pressure on him and
make steep a feel like he

2894
02:38:13,041 --> 02:38:14,600
didn't deserve to be in there with them.

2895
02:38:14,660 --> 02:38:19,280
I think maybe in that approach he
was, uh, trying to wear him out,

2896
02:38:19,310 --> 02:38:21,860
which keep the pressure on
them and make them discouraged.

2897
02:38:22,010 --> 02:38:25,760
Or maybe he had genuine
disdain for his abilities.

2898
02:38:25,761 --> 02:38:27,650
Maybe he really didn't think
too steep it could hurt him.

2899
02:38:27,860 --> 02:38:29,360
And he was just eventually
going to catch him.

2900
02:38:29,780 --> 02:38:32,960
And then there was a lot of people that
thought because of the way he knocks DP

2901
02:38:32,961 --> 02:38:36,110
out, maybe Steve Bay isn't as
durable as he used to be, right?

2902
02:38:36,111 --> 02:38:39,290
Because Steve Bay used to take
tremendous shots from everybody,

2903
02:38:39,291 --> 02:38:43,460
but then he got knocked out in one punch
by DC after taking tremendous shots in

2904
02:38:43,461 --> 02:38:45,470
the Ingando fight. So the
question would be like,

2905
02:38:45,471 --> 02:38:47,480
how much damage have they
taken that in Gando fight?

2906
02:38:48,050 --> 02:38:50,660
But then he came back and he ate
everything that DC had offer him.

2907
02:38:50,990 --> 02:38:53,720
He just kept beating him to kid to
take it on the Chin and eating it.

2908
02:38:53,720 --> 02:38:56,150
And eventually he started
taking over the fight.

2909
02:38:56,151 --> 02:39:00,830
And when he started ripping the body in
the fourth round, it was like, whoa. He,

2910
02:39:00,831 --> 02:39:02,000
it was perfect. I mean,

2911
02:39:02,001 --> 02:39:05,550
I've never seen anybody have better body
punches in a championship. That was,

2912
02:39:05,750 --> 02:39:06,310
that was the thing.

2913
02:39:06,310 --> 02:39:09,880
There was like a corner call or you
think he just like improvise and saw that

2914
02:39:09,881 --> 02:39:13,550
that was open and he knows how to
fight. He saw an opening. Everybody,

2915
02:39:13,551 --> 02:39:15,500
everybody knows. I mean that's
such a standard technique.

2916
02:39:15,501 --> 02:39:19,640
That's like a corner call. Someone's
throwing a leg kick. So it was working.

2917
02:39:19,720 --> 02:39:22,760
So yeah, it never got blocked.
Once he didn't have an answer,

2918
02:39:22,950 --> 02:39:25,580
it didn't have an answer to it. He
didn't duck it. He didn't block it.

2919
02:39:25,581 --> 02:39:29,310
He didn't, he didn't try to take him
down. He just Kinda got stuck stance.

2920
02:39:29,340 --> 02:39:33,300
The problem with those liver shots too
is they SAP your energy so bad and you,

2921
02:39:33,301 --> 02:39:35,270
you can't make a big move anymore.

2922
02:39:35,420 --> 02:39:38,510
So you have to kind of pretend like
everything's okay. And then Bam,

2923
02:39:38,580 --> 02:39:41,540
he hits you again and you're like,
oh shit, we're in trouble here.

2924
02:39:41,541 --> 02:39:45,580
But still you're looking like nothing's
wrong, but your gas tank is, fuck,

2925
02:39:46,280 --> 02:39:49,460
everything's on empty and you're
fucked. You really can't fire back.

2926
02:39:49,550 --> 02:39:53,260
That's why DC didn't fire back and he
kept getting shot to that body bang.

2927
02:39:53,660 --> 02:39:56,510
And every time bang, he gets shot
to that body. You see it in us.

2928
02:39:56,720 --> 02:39:59,570
And then Steve [inaudible] got him
against the cage and started uncorking

2929
02:39:59,571 --> 02:40:03,080
punches and DC just didn't have
anything. His body was shutting down,

2930
02:40:03,280 --> 02:40:06,380
didn't have anything in him to
stop that onslaught. I mean,

2931
02:40:06,381 --> 02:40:07,600
it's amazing that guy's the,

2932
02:40:07,850 --> 02:40:11,150
this deep is the most successful
heavyweight in the history of the sport.

2933
02:40:11,420 --> 02:40:14,000
And during the Cormier, whether he
fights again or not, he'll go down.

2934
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:16,920
He's one of the greatest ever,
you know? But he also is,

2935
02:40:17,070 --> 02:40:20,910
what is he 42 it's 40 40 40 is that true?

2936
02:40:21,230 --> 02:40:24,600
I was 48 so that might be two.

2937
02:40:24,660 --> 02:40:28,830
It could be 42 yeah. You asked 42
when you look at like, you know,

2938
02:40:28,980 --> 02:40:33,890
do you see what he's done?
It's incredible. I mean,

2939
02:40:33,980 --> 02:40:36,650
and nobody else has ever done
that. It's just, it's Kinda,

2940
02:40:37,210 --> 02:40:38,790
it's probably hard to
convince him of that.

2941
02:40:38,790 --> 02:40:41,010
The big fight is the
Steve Bay fight, honestly,

2942
02:40:41,190 --> 02:40:46,190
because beating guys for the vacated
crown with enlight heavyweight is not the

2943
02:40:46,831 --> 02:40:48,090
same as beating Jon Jones.

2944
02:40:48,360 --> 02:40:51,930
But beating Steve pay is like being the
heavyweight version of Jon Jones. Yeah.

2945
02:40:52,130 --> 02:40:54,090
That's, that's the biggest
accomplishment ever.

2946
02:40:54,270 --> 02:40:57,210
And I'd liked him at heavyweight
because he wasn't getting drained.

2947
02:40:57,570 --> 02:41:00,180
But I just don't think that was, I
mean I don't think, I don't know,

2948
02:41:00,181 --> 02:41:02,040
maybe couldn't have
fought him any other way,

2949
02:41:02,041 --> 02:41:04,140
but I don't think that
was the best strategy,

2950
02:41:04,230 --> 02:41:07,080
the dropping of the hands and the
moving toward him with the stain,

2951
02:41:07,081 --> 02:41:11,130
but me maybe that would have worked on
some guys and maybe that has worked on

2952
02:41:11,131 --> 02:41:13,700
other guys like rumble Johnson
and worked on him. You know,

2953
02:41:13,710 --> 02:41:16,980
he mean he eventually puts that heat on
you and so many guys crack under that

2954
02:41:16,981 --> 02:41:18,630
heat. Do you want to see as a friend,

2955
02:41:18,631 --> 02:41:23,490
do you want to see him fight a third fight
that is entirely dependent upon where

2956
02:41:23,491 --> 02:41:25,860
his head's at? I mean if he, first of all,

2957
02:41:25,861 --> 02:41:30,861
I'm sure he's a very intelligent guy
with a lot of years of competition under

2958
02:41:31,351 --> 02:41:35,850
his belt, whether it's Olympics, PR, you
know, wrestling at the highest level,

2959
02:41:35,851 --> 02:41:39,960
whether it's UFC strike force before
that he's fought for a long time.

2960
02:41:39,961 --> 02:41:42,440
Nobody needs to tell him when
to make decisions when not.

2961
02:41:42,450 --> 02:41:43,620
He's emotional right now.

2962
02:41:43,830 --> 02:41:46,890
I'm sure he's going to take some time
off and he'll probably consult with his

2963
02:41:46,891 --> 02:41:48,840
family and probably figure
out what he wants to do.

2964
02:41:48,841 --> 02:41:53,841
But I bet if I had to guess
his competitive instincts
are going to tell him that

2965
02:41:54,301 --> 02:41:58,140
he could have at least one more fight
and that it would be a rematch with Steve

2966
02:41:58,140 --> 02:42:02,550
Bay because he was dominating the first
round and he let it get away from him

2967
02:42:02,551 --> 02:42:04,920
and he wasn't listening to
his corner, you know, crazy.

2968
02:42:04,921 --> 02:42:08,250
Bob Cook was yelling in his corner,
keep your damn hands up. You know,

2969
02:42:08,251 --> 02:42:11,200
he didn't like it. Bob Cook didn't
like it. He respected [inaudible].

2970
02:42:11,280 --> 02:42:15,630
He's a giant man. He's a fucking
big motherfucker. Big Long,

2971
02:42:15,631 --> 02:42:18,500
tall Croatian. And he's tough as shit man.

2972
02:42:18,600 --> 02:42:22,410
And I think because Daniel knocked him
out in the first round and the first

2973
02:42:22,411 --> 02:42:26,670
fight, you know, uh, he, he believed
he could knock 'em out again,

2974
02:42:26,700 --> 02:42:29,990
but Steve Bay could take a Goddamn
shot this time. You know, I mean, yeah.

2975
02:42:30,720 --> 02:42:34,410
You never know why a guy gets knocked
out that way with one punch. I mean,

2976
02:42:34,411 --> 02:42:37,500
it was a perfect punch for sure.
I mean, the way he threw it,

2977
02:42:37,501 --> 02:42:40,140
it was beautiful the way he
threw it from inside the clench.

2978
02:42:40,230 --> 02:42:43,020
It comes over the top of the shoulder
blam and lends that perfect punch,

2979
02:42:43,200 --> 02:42:45,900
that chaos. I mean it
was amazing. Yeah. But

2980
02:42:46,050 --> 02:42:48,870
it was also such a competitive fight
that I'm super intrigued to see a third

2981
02:42:48,871 --> 02:42:51,420
fight. You know, it's not like
it's not a foregone conclusion.

2982
02:42:51,421 --> 02:42:53,160
The CPA is going to be
able to do that again.

2983
02:42:53,161 --> 02:42:55,530
Daniel could be adjusted and
come out with a better game plan.

2984
02:42:55,560 --> 02:42:58,800
100% he could win that fight.
Um, and it's, in my opinion,

2985
02:42:58,801 --> 02:43:01,760
the best fighter heavyweight
competitively. I don't
think, I ain't gone,

2986
02:43:01,860 --> 02:43:05,820
it'd be a good fight, but I think the
CPA wants that. Again, I'm not convinced.

2987
02:43:05,821 --> 02:43:09,240
I mean I think in gone who
might be the next guy? I mean,

2988
02:43:09,710 --> 02:43:12,640
I think he might be the champ
for while he's definitely

2989
02:43:12,640 --> 02:43:17,640
got what it takes because he's got one
thing that 100% one punch knockout power,

2990
02:43:19,781 --> 02:43:24,781
100% not a fucking humans going to be
there if he full-on connects and smashes

2991
02:43:26,411 --> 02:43:29,050
one through your guard. Everyone
goes, night-night everyone,

2992
02:43:29,140 --> 02:43:31,970
100% of the humans that
have ever walked here,

2993
02:43:33,250 --> 02:43:35,050
if that guy punches you full blast,

2994
02:43:35,230 --> 02:43:37,360
but it's whether or not he's gonna
be able to do that to steep back.

2995
02:43:37,390 --> 02:43:39,890
We all thought he had a chance of
doing it the first time, but Steve,

2996
02:43:39,891 --> 02:43:43,360
I shut it down and you know,
maybe, maybe he's better now,

2997
02:43:43,361 --> 02:43:46,870
but maybe Steve Bay is going to come
into this fight even more energized ever

2998
02:43:46,871 --> 02:43:50,500
after beating DC and winning his
title back. I mean, maybe he's gonna.

2999
02:43:50,830 --> 02:43:53,440
Maybe he saw something from that
fight that if he had to do it again,

3000
02:43:53,441 --> 02:43:55,590
he would have implemented
really quickly. You know,

3001
02:43:56,770 --> 02:43:58,510
Deep Abd Dude, he did not
want to take another fight.

3002
02:43:58,540 --> 02:44:02,670
He was do whatever place he was in.
He was fucking in his firehouse list,

3003
02:44:02,671 --> 02:44:04,930
hit up his boots. Everybody's thinking
about getting that title back.

3004
02:44:05,230 --> 02:44:06,790
He does not want to lose that title again

3005
02:44:07,130 --> 02:44:08,380
for ignore. No Man was weird.

3006
02:44:08,381 --> 02:44:13,381
Everybody was so concentrated on the
Brock Lesnar idea that they were ignoring

3007
02:44:13,720 --> 02:44:14,060
them.

3008
02:44:14,060 --> 02:44:16,950
It was, it's weird because when
somebody said that the other day,

3009
02:44:16,951 --> 02:44:20,430
whatever publication was talking about
CBD being the greatest heavyweight of all

3010
02:44:20,431 --> 02:44:22,230
time, this is before the fight. Um,

3011
02:44:22,650 --> 02:44:27,120
I remember going like Izzy and then you
start listing off his credentials and

3012
02:44:27,150 --> 02:44:29,160
you realize that he has the most defenses.

3013
02:44:29,190 --> 02:44:32,250
He's also fought the most competitive, um,

3014
02:44:33,050 --> 02:44:35,760
titled Defensive as title
defenses as well. Um,

3015
02:44:36,150 --> 02:44:38,640
then u s it becomes a little more
apparent, but I kind of under,

3016
02:44:39,060 --> 02:44:40,560
I almost understand it
because even as the,

3017
02:44:40,710 --> 02:44:44,730
and I'm a pretty big fan of
the sport, but I remember just,

3018
02:44:44,880 --> 02:44:47,730
I wasn't like chomping at the
bit for the rematch for him.

3019
02:44:47,731 --> 02:44:50,440
It wasn't like I was like, oh I really
want to see that. Steepy damn corny.

3020
02:44:50,441 --> 02:44:52,350
I remember mentioned, I can't
even put my finger on why.

3021
02:44:52,740 --> 02:44:54,570
Oh I did. I wanted to see it bad.

3022
02:44:55,230 --> 02:44:57,300
I wanted to see real bad
cause I wanted to see,

3023
02:44:57,500 --> 02:44:59,280
and I liked the fact
it was 13 months later.

3024
02:44:59,490 --> 02:45:03,480
So I think it gave his body some time
to heal up. I think you fight in Ghana,

3025
02:45:03,620 --> 02:45:05,910
it's like getting hit by a
train. I mean, you might live

3026
02:45:06,020 --> 02:45:06,853
Michael

3027
02:45:08,570 --> 02:45:13,070
[inaudible] wine into a fucking tree and
come down a day later. What happened?

3028
02:45:13,540 --> 02:45:15,780
Like when DJ Jazzy Jeff will
get thrown out of the club.

3029
02:45:18,640 --> 02:45:20,060
Yeah, but I think he's,

3030
02:45:20,110 --> 02:45:22,090
if he keeps it together,
he's the next guy.

3031
02:45:22,450 --> 02:45:25,090
I mean he's the next guy
in line to be the champion.

3032
02:45:25,330 --> 02:45:27,160
I mean he has everything to lose his,

3033
02:45:27,170 --> 02:45:30,940
he has the championship to lose if it
steep bay retires. When Steve Bay's done,

3034
02:45:31,630 --> 02:45:35,080
Frances is the fucking man and maybe,
maybe Francis beats him in a rematch.

3035
02:45:35,081 --> 02:45:37,630
Who knows? Again, all
he has to do is connect.

3036
02:45:38,110 --> 02:45:39,510
He'd be a different guy in the rematch.

3037
02:45:39,580 --> 02:45:41,860
He would understand what it's like to go
five hard rounds with the guy who could

3038
02:45:41,861 --> 02:45:43,030
take you down and beat you up.

3039
02:45:43,210 --> 02:45:45,370
He would understand that his
wrestling has to be on point.

3040
02:45:45,520 --> 02:45:48,790
His Cardio has to be on point and there's
not going to be times where he can

3041
02:45:48,791 --> 02:45:52,720
100% unload and know for sure the guy's
not gonna be there because the guy

3042
02:45:52,730 --> 02:45:55,630
survived and he didn't have the gas
tank for the remaining four rounds.

3043
02:45:56,020 --> 02:46:00,370
And so this is going to be a new guy
that Steve Bay fights and he might very

3044
02:46:00,371 --> 02:46:04,750
well just play it smooth and just stay
on the outside and pick his shots.

3045
02:46:04,900 --> 02:46:08,500
And then when he gets him hurt
then uncork. I mean we don't know,

3046
02:46:08,650 --> 02:46:10,970
but we know Steve Bay might take
them down quicker this time.

3047
02:46:11,200 --> 02:46:14,870
Maybe CPA mid say fuck all this standup
dude, let's just wrestle. You know,

3048
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:16,340
he just like come at him a couple,

3049
02:46:16,341 --> 02:46:19,970
pump a few jabs and shoot a fucking
double on him and take it down. Dude,

3050
02:46:19,971 --> 02:46:23,330
he took down D C Steve paid
took down d c that's giant.

3051
02:46:23,360 --> 02:46:26,150
The only other guy I've ever, who's
ever done that as John Jones and Steve,

3052
02:46:26,151 --> 02:46:29,480
I did it more emphatically, you know? I
mean it was pretty God damn impressive.

3053
02:46:29,960 --> 02:46:32,300
Well that's the other one
at uh, at heavyweight.

3054
02:46:32,301 --> 02:46:34,910
I want to see I before
John John's retires.

3055
02:46:34,910 --> 02:46:36,980
I want to see him play at heavyweight.
Yes. That's what I want to see.

3056
02:46:37,730 --> 02:46:41,240
Sean John's at 235 pounds. Fuck
yes. Steroids to the gills.

3057
02:46:42,650 --> 02:46:46,460
Graham's fallen on his ass.
Just fucking monster. Dude.

3058
02:46:46,670 --> 02:46:51,670
I would love to see if he could handle
steep a m or if Cormier one of that fight

3059
02:46:51,801 --> 02:46:54,080
I if day in court, me and John
Jones wanted to fight again,

3060
02:46:54,081 --> 02:46:55,640
I'd want to see that fight at heavyweight.

3061
02:46:55,670 --> 02:46:58,490
Well I guarantee you if John
Jones fights at heavyweight,

3062
02:46:58,491 --> 02:47:02,900
he'll probably be at just what he
walks around at because the word around

3063
02:47:02,901 --> 02:47:06,800
Jackson's was that he would wrestle
with heavyweights and just ranked all of

3064
02:47:06,801 --> 02:47:08,820
them. That he would throw
people around the gym.

3065
02:47:08,821 --> 02:47:11,750
I mean when I talked to Tate Fletcher
when he was down there and other guys who

3066
02:47:11,751 --> 02:47:15,920
trained with John when John was down
at Jackson's a as a light heavyweight

3067
02:47:15,921 --> 02:47:17,900
champion was just
ragdoll and heavyweights.

3068
02:47:18,050 --> 02:47:21,260
He's a phenomenally powerful
guy and you really saw them,

3069
02:47:21,261 --> 02:47:24,560
the Cormier fight like I think for me it
was shocked in that first fight of how

3070
02:47:24,561 --> 02:47:28,040
fucking strong John Is. I
mean he's a long thin guy,

3071
02:47:28,041 --> 02:47:32,390
but he is ridiculously strong and I
think as a heavyweight EBL fuck load to

3072
02:47:32,391 --> 02:47:35,180
handle for a lot of guys. I want
to say and I think he actually,

3073
02:47:35,181 --> 02:47:36,980
he has a star power too.

3074
02:47:37,580 --> 02:47:40,910
I think that puts the UFC on the map in
a weird way cause they haven't really

3075
02:47:40,911 --> 02:47:44,420
had the major star as
a heavyweight champion.

3076
02:47:44,421 --> 02:47:48,320
Like that fucking dude who is like
best in the world, pound for pound,

3077
02:47:48,321 --> 02:47:50,960
best as a heavyweight champion
as the heavyweight champion.

3078
02:47:50,961 --> 02:47:54,440
But if John could be [inaudible]
that would be that. Cause he's,

3079
02:47:54,610 --> 02:47:58,070
he's definitely the best pound for
pound fighter in the UFC right now.

3080
02:47:58,100 --> 02:48:00,020
Definitely. You look
at his accomplishments,

3081
02:48:00,320 --> 02:48:02,390
it's arguably he's the best
pound for pound fighter ever.

3082
02:48:02,510 --> 02:48:03,830
Cause he's really never lost that one.

3083
02:48:04,370 --> 02:48:06,680
Matt Hamill fight to try to reverse
that cause it was a bad decision.

3084
02:48:07,220 --> 02:48:09,920
It was a bad decision. Dude was a
bad decision. This is a bad decision.

3085
02:48:10,030 --> 02:48:13,850
There's disqualify. Yeah, make it a
no contest. So he's still undefeated.

3086
02:48:13,880 --> 02:48:15,210
That's what it really should have gone.

3087
02:48:15,211 --> 02:48:18,420
My only problem with it is it really
should be a victory. Crushed him. Oh yeah.

3088
02:48:18,440 --> 02:48:20,810
It was ridiculous. She doesn't
feel like it's a waste.

3089
02:48:20,920 --> 02:48:23,970
The thing is like the guy's never
really lost. So if you look at his,

3090
02:48:23,971 --> 02:48:26,240
his career, like who
the fuck can say that?

3091
02:48:26,420 --> 02:48:30,890
Who the fuck has fought like Leo
Machida, Rashad Evans, rampage Jackson,

3092
02:48:31,040 --> 02:48:34,260
the top of the food chain over and
over generations, three generations,

3093
02:48:35,170 --> 02:48:39,320
four different generations of the best
guys. Gustafson, everybody look at that.

3094
02:48:39,321 --> 02:48:42,980
There's actually a number like there,
the, that one loss on his record.

3095
02:48:43,490 --> 02:48:44,660
If you could really break it down.

3096
02:48:44,661 --> 02:48:47,150
There was some sort of like statistics
that could come in and really look at it.

3097
02:48:47,180 --> 02:48:48,380
There's a number,

3098
02:48:49,200 --> 02:48:53,180
an amount of money that he's lost
because he has that loss on his record.

3099
02:48:53,450 --> 02:48:56,770
Whether whatever, is it more
marketability? Maybe? Who
knows? There's something.

3100
02:48:56,780 --> 02:48:59,780
It definitely, there has to be some
things. Otherwise I have to go.

3101
02:48:59,830 --> 02:49:04,580
You do have to go to shit or wrap this
pitch up. All right gentlemen, thank you.

3102
02:49:04,581 --> 02:49:07,670
As always, you cucked out
again until now. That was good.

3103
02:49:07,830 --> 02:49:11,440
I was going to come in Bob face, they
wouldn't let me so we stopped it,

3104
02:49:11,470 --> 02:49:13,800
so I appreciate you guys.
I appreciate it. Gang fest.

3105
02:49:13,801 --> 02:49:16,170
I think it's awesome what you guys
are doing for comedy. I really do.

3106
02:49:16,200 --> 02:49:20,100
You're right. You're just going for
it and that's what we need more of.

3107
02:49:20,101 --> 02:49:23,910
We need more of people that are doing
real comedy, and you guys do it.

3108
02:49:23,911 --> 02:49:26,590
I appreciate the fuck out of it and I
support you at every turn. Oh, thanks.

3109
02:49:27,270 --> 02:49:29,580
[inaudible] the man. We really appreciate
it. Love you buddy. Bye fuckers.

3110
02:49:32,480 --> 02:49:32,810
That's fine.
