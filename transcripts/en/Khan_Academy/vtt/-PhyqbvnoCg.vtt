00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.320
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians,

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.550
let's talk about the progressive aspect.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.760
So we talked about the
simple aspect as something

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.860
that is just most bare form.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:09.770
It's what you see here,

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.920
I walk, I will walk, I walked.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.960
But aspect allows us

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.873
to talk about things that are ongoing.

00:00:17.873 --> 00:00:19.760
And that's what we call the progressive

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.707
because it's progressing,
it's going, it's happening.

00:00:22.707 --> 00:00:27.317
So if we are telling a story
and we are inside that moment,

00:00:27.317 --> 00:00:29.750
we can use the progressive aspect.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.800
So I walk becomes, in the present,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.240
I am walking.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.960
So the way the progressive
works is that it takes the form

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.760
of to be for whatever the
subject of the sentence is,

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.440
in this case I, and it changes
the verb into an ING verb.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.380
That's what it does.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.520
That's what the progressive does.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.730
And its effect is to say
that something is ongoing.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.575
This is also called the continuous aspect,

00:00:55.575 --> 00:00:57.752
but I like to call it
the progressive aspect.

00:00:57.752 --> 00:01:01.080
Let's try this in all the
different basic conjugations.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.347
So we call this the present progressive.

00:01:03.347 --> 00:01:04.830
Let's try the past progressive.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.270
So if it says I walked,

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.360
we would just take the verb to be

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.480
and then put it in the past.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.040
So this part doesn't change,
the walking doesn't change.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.350
You would say, I was walking.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.633
Likewise, for the future,

00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:27.400
so we're not gonna
change the walking part,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.490
we're just gonna put this
am part into the future,

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.340
which is like so, I will be walking.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.780
That's the future progressive.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.860
So the way to remember
the progressive aspect

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.040
is for me to hideously butcher
the writing of David Mamet

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.370
and tell you to always remember your ABCs.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.700
Always

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.440
be

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.080
conjugating.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.950
And conjugating here is
just a word that means

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.650
to put verbs in different
tenses and aspects,

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.490
but I really want you to focus on the fact

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.871
that we've got this be and this ING.

00:02:10.871 --> 00:02:13.050
So just remember be and ING

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.880
and that's how you form the progressive.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.599
So no matter whether or not
it's happening in the past,

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.780
it's still I was walking.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.880
So the part that changes is
the be, is the verb to be.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.720
I was walking, I am
walking, I will be walking.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.824
The part that doesn't
change is the walking

00:02:31.824 --> 00:02:34.960
and that's how you express
that something is ongoing,

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.050
that something is continuously happening

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.494
in the telling of the story.

00:02:38.494 --> 00:02:41.834
Understanding this will
enable you to master time.

00:02:41.834 --> 00:02:43.223
You can learn anything.

00:02:43.223 --> 00:02:44.240
David out.
