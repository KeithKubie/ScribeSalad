00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
You saw in the simple lexer that we wrote

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that tokens come, not just with a type of token in their value,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but also their line number and column number.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
That sort of information is very handy

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to keep track of for users.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
At some point, you may have written an incorrect Python program--nah.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I've only written about a million of them.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And it's really nice when the interpreter tells you

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
which line the mistake is on.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Unfortunately, the lexer won't do this for us--entirely automatically.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It will keep track of columns,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but it won't keep track of lines--

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
unless we do some work.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Here's an example of a rule

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that matches new lines.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You may not have seen this before,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
but we've already seen how the backslash can be used

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
to Escape special characters, like the quote.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And this basically just means: quote.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
However, when paired with something else,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
the backslash often has a special meaning.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
\ N is the string equivalent of pressing the Return

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
or Enter key on your keyboard, and we call this the "newline" key.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It advances your Editor, by 1 line.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So this rule--t_newline--

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
matches a new line that appears.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And when we see it,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
we take the token and increment its line number by 1,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and then we pass over the new line, as if it were Whitespace.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Here you can see that I've added

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
the newline rule,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
just as I described on the previous slide,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
to our old lexer from before.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Let's go all the way to the bottom,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and now I'm going to make my Web page

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
much more complicated.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And here, I'm using triple-quoted strings,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
showing line1 on the first line

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and line2 on the second.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Unfortunately, the output shows

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Line1, followed by the new line.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I'm going to have to go up here

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and remove newline from the list of things

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that it's possible to have in a Word--just like we had to remove space.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And now we see that Line1 starts on LIne1

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and Line2 starts on Line2,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and it's the seventh character from the beginning of the file.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Zero, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is the newline,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
6 is the space, 7 is the capital L. All right.
