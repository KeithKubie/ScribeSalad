00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740
No doubt about it, your heart is a champion.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.520
It electrifies itself, it maintains your blood
pressure, it keeps your blood moving, and

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.060
it’s got like a nice shape you can put some
chocolates inside of and give to people you like.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.060
But the circulatory system is much, much more
than just that pump.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.160
Because the heart also needs a network to
actually send all that blood through, right?

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.640
Cue the blood vessels.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.760
Although it’s easy to think of them as a
glorified plumbing system for your body, that’s

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.030
not a very good analogy. These aren’t just
passive tubes made merely to carry liquid

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.600
around, like the pipes behind your walls at
your home.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.160
Blood vessels are actually active, dynamic
organs, capable of contracting and expanding

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.340
as they deliver oxygen and nutrients to cells
throughout the body; carry away waste products;

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.300
and do their part in maintaining that all
important blood pressure.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.750
You already know about the three major types
of blood vessels: the arteries that carry

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.200
blood away from the heart, the veins that
bring it back, and the little capillaries

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.550
that act as the transfer station between the
two.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.989
But you’ve also got arterioles -- which
are like mini-arteries that branch out into

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.680
those capillaries -- and venules, the smallest
vein components that suck blood back out of

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.760
the capillaries and merge into the larger
veins that head home to the heart.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.790
And it’s quite an incredible journey, really.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.450
If all your blood vessels could be strung
together in a single line, they’d stretch

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.229
out for 100,000 kilometers!

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.520
That’s like...if you...and then...carry the two --
that’s like two and a half times around the Earth.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.560
And together this extensive network forms a
closed system that begins and ends in the heart.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.000
That means that all of the five or so liters
of blood in your body are contained within

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.740
it at all times, unless you’re bleeding,
which I hope you’re not.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.090
If you prick a finger and watch a drop of
blood pop up, you know that you’ve nicked

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.150
a blood vessel, and that blood is leaking
out of its closed system.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.110
Likewise, if you slam your shin against a
corner of the coffee table on your way to

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.700
the bathroom, and an hour later you see a
big nasty bruise forming, then you know you’ve

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.420
damaged your blood vessels again, because bruising
is internal bleeding, usually into loose connective tissue.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.450
And, if you’re embarrassed about the piercing
shriek that you let out when you bumped your

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.590
leg, and you start to blush. Well, that’s your
blood vessels, too, expanding just to say hello.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.020
Blood vessels are another great example of
how anatomy and physiology go together like

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.060
peanut butter and jelly. How they look and
what they do go hand in hand.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.940
Most of your blood vessels share a similar
structure consisting of three layers of tissue

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.540
surrounding the open space, or lumen, that
actually holds the blood.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.840
Anatomists call these layers “tunics,”
and the innermost section is the tunica intima

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.180
-- which should be pretty easy to remember
because, you know, it has like intimate contact

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.100
with the lumen. It’s like your circulatory
underpants.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.580
The cool thing about this layer is that it
contains the endothelium, which you may remember

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.190
is made up of simple squamous epithelium tissue
and is continuous with the lining of the heart.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.680
These cells form a slick surface that helps
the blood move without friction.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.470
Surrounding the tunica intima is the middle
layer, the tunica media, made of smooth muscle

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.730
cells and sheets of the protein elastin.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.160
That smooth muscle tissue is regulated in
part by the nerve fibers of the autonomic

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.090
nervous system, which can decrease the diameter
of the lumen by contracting this middle layer

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.060
during vasoconstriction, or expand it by relaxing
during vasodilation.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.780
That right there should tell you that the
tunica media plays a key role in blood flow

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.280
and blood pressure, because the smaller the
diameter of the blood vessel, the harder it

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.700
is for blood to move through it -- kinda like trying to
drink milk through a cocktail straw versus a soda straw.

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.260
And finally, the outermost layer of your blood
vessels is the tunica externa.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.640
It’s like an overcoat, if that coat were
made mostly of loosely woven collagen-fiber.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.790
Actually, if your coat happens to be made of leather,
it is made of collagen. And like a coat, this

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.040
outer layer is what protects and reinforces
the whole blood vessel.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.360
Now the ratio of the thicknesses of three
layers varies between blood vessels of different

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.110
types -- because, guess what?!

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.340
Yes, form follows function! Let’s take a
look.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.530
Say you’re gearing up for a big tournament
of thumb wrestling, or what has been called

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.590
the “miniature golf of martial arts.”

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.340
How does blood move through your systemic
circulatory loop, to get from your heart to

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.120
your champion right thumb-flexing muscle,
the flexor pollicis brevis, and back again?

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.090
Well, you will remember from our lessons on
the heart that blood leaves the left ventricle

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.240
through the aorta -- the biggest and toughest artery
in your body, roughly the diameter of a garden hose.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.540
The aorta and its major branches are elastic
arteries -- they contain more elastin than

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.719
any other blood vessel type, so they can absorb the
large pressure fluctuations as blood leaves the heart.

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:22.029
What’s more, that elasticity actually dampens
that pressure so that big surges don’t reach

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:24.279
the smaller vessels, where they could cause
damage.

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:26.779
This is really where that whole pipe analogy
falls apart.

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:30.800
These arteries are really more like a balloons
-- they’re pressure reservoirs, able to

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.490
expand and recoil with every heartbeat. If
they were rigid like pipes, they’d eventually

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.139
leak or burst after being battered by so many
waves of pressure.

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.189
So that blood leaves your aorta, and since
it’s headed to your thumb, it travels along

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:46.520
the elastic subclavian artery, which gives
way to a series of muscular arteries -- in

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.680
this case, the brachial artery in your upper
arm, and the radial artery in the lower arm.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.720
Muscular arteries distribute blood to specific
body parts, and account for most of your named

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.680
arteries. They’re less elastic and more
muscular.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.180
These arteries invest in additional smooth
muscle tissue, and proportionally, have the

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.560
thickest tunica media of any blood vessel. This allows
them to contract or relax through vasoconstriction

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.700
and vasodilation, which we’ve talked about a lot in
terms of the nervous system’s stress response.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.920
These arteries keep tapering down until they
turn into the nearly microscopic arterioles

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.379
that feed into the smallest of your blood
vessels, your tiny, extremely thin-walled

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:25.339
capillaries which serve as a sort of exchange or
bridge between your arterial and venous systems.

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:30.449
They may be little, but your capillaries are where the
big, important exchange of materials actually happens.

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:34.160
Capillary walls are made of just a single
layer of epithelial tissue, which form only

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:38.169
the tunic intima, so they’re able to deliver
the oxygen and other nutrients in your blood

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:40.879
to their cellular destinations through diffusion.

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:44.460
The capillaries are also where those cells
can dump their carbon dioxide and other waste

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.469
back into the blood and send it away, through
the veins to the lungs and kidneys. But I

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:49.919
will come back to that in a second.

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:54.469
Unlike arteries and veins, capillaries don’t
operate on their own, but rather form interweaving

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:56.789
groups called capillary beds.

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:01.520
Besides exchanging nutrients and gases, your
capillary beds also help regulate blood pressure,

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.539
and play a role in thermoregulation.

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:07.460
Say you’re in the room where you’re, like,
practicing thumb calisthenics -- which probably

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.689
isn’t a thing -- but the room is a little
chilly, so the blood feeding your dermis loses

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:13.379
a lot of heat to that cold air.

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:17.369
Well, smooth muscle forms tiny sphincters
-- yeah, you’ve got sphincters everywhere

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:21.520
-- around the vessels that lead to each of
your capillary beds. When they tighten up,

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.580
they force blood to bypass some of those capillaries,
which means less blood is exposed to the cold,

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.680
and you lose less heat.

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:31.839
If it’s really cold, the smooth muscles
around your larger arterioles and muscular

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:36.569
arteries -- like that radial artery in your
lower arm -- will also squeeze, slowing blood

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:40.119
flow to your whole hand. Which is no way to
win at thumb wrestling.

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:43.449
But it’s one reason why your fingers get
all stiff and numb in the cold -- they’re

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:47.490
not getting as much warm blood, because your
blood vessels are trying to conserve heat.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.429
Conversely, if your thumb is working really
hard and producing heat from all that exertion,

00:06:51.429 --> 00:06:55.919
those capillary sphincters relax and open
wide, flooding the capillary bed with blood

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:59.819
to help disperse heat -- which is part of
the reason that you might get red-faced when

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:01.709
you’re hot or exercising hard.

00:07:01.709 --> 00:07:06.219
So anyway, now your thumb muscles have just
feasted on a batch of oxygen and glucose served

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:09.610
up on a fresh bed of capillary, and they’re
ready to take out the trash.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.599
The cells send their CO2 and other junk out
to the venal end of the capillary exchange

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:18.099
where the capillaries unite into venules, and then
merge into veins that head back to the heart.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.919
Remember that the pressure in these vessels
has to be dropping, since fluids always flow

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:23.610
from higher to lower pressure.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.629
But since the pressure is so low in your veins
-- it’s like one 12th of the pressure in

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:31.610
your arteries -- there isn’t much pressure
gradient left to push the blood back to your

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.490
heart. So veins require some extra adaptations
to keep the blood moving in the right direction.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.860
That’s why some of them -- especially veins
in the arms and legs that have to work against

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.899
gravity -- have venous valves that help keep
the blood from flowing backward.

00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:46.759
If those valves leak, or a vein experiences
too much pressure, the backflow of blood can

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:50.999
stretch and twist the vein, leaving you with
varicose veins, or if this happens in another

00:07:50.999 --> 00:07:52.110
part of the body, hemorrhoids.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:56.209
But, anyway, we’ve gotten pretty far from your
thumb at this point. We’ve got a loop to finish here!

00:07:56.209 --> 00:08:00.610
From the capillaries and venules in your thumb,
that low-pressure blood flows from the radial

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:05.309
vein to the brachial vein to the subclavian
vein, where it dumps into the superior vena

00:08:05.309 --> 00:08:09.779
cava and settles for a second in the right
atria, before dropping into the right ventricle.

00:08:09.779 --> 00:08:12.889
From there it’s sent to the lungs, where
it gets oxygenated, and then comes back into

00:08:12.889 --> 00:08:16.699
into the left atria, before sliding down into
the left ventricle, where it builds up pressure

00:08:16.699 --> 00:08:18.869
again, and spurts back out into your aorta.

00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:22.270
It takes about a minute for all the blood
in your body to complete that circuit, which

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:26.149
means, even if you’re mostly at rest, your
hardworking circulatory system moves about

00:08:26.149 --> 00:08:29.899
7,500 liters of blood through your heart every
day.

00:08:29.899 --> 00:08:34.759
Just in the time that you’ve been sitting there listening
to me, probably about 52 liters has coursed through.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.200
So yes. Much like the Internet, your blood
vessels are more than just “a series of tubes.”

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.080
During the time that you’ve been circulating
all that blood, you learned about the basic

00:08:42.089 --> 00:08:46.639
three-layer structure of your blood vessels;
how those structures differ slightly in different

00:08:46.639 --> 00:08:50.769
types of vessels; and you followed the flow
of blood from your heart to capillaries in

00:08:50.769 --> 00:08:53.269
your right thumb, and all the way back to
your heart again.

00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:56.170
