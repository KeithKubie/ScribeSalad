00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.220
I'm going to take a moment here now
to talk about the problem we're going

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.360
to focus on for the rest of this class.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.560
We're going to look at a certain period
of data, train our models over that

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.810
period, and then make forecasts and
trade over some other period.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.820
So here's our historical data.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.780
We're going to use the period of
2009 as our data to train our model.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.050
You'll be implementing several
machine learning algorithms

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.570
to create different models and will be
comparing them one against another.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.890
Then we'll test over the years 2010 and
2011.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.990
So those testing values will become our
X which will push through the model

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.560
to create a Y or a forecast.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.490
And using this forecast you'll
generate an orders.txt file

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.980
which you can push through
your market simulator.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.000
We'll see how that strategy performs,
measure it's sharp ratio and

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.030
its total return and so on.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.580
And that way we'll be able to compare

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.740
different machine learning algorithms
that generate these orders.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.120
That's it for this lesson.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.480
Our introduction to machine learning and
how it works at hedge funds and

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.450
other financial institutions.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.115
I will see you online again soon.

00:01:16.115 --> 00:01:17.304
Bye-bye.
