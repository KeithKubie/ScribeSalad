00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.840
After we connect the client in
the onStart, it takes some time for

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.220
the connection to happen.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.340
And when it does,
the onConnected callback will fire.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.820
This is the meat of our app.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.590
We've connected to location services,
so we should be

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.610
able to get the last location
from the fused location provider.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.480
And if we do get something,
then we can read the latitude and

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.940
the longitude from it.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.540
We convert that to a string and

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.250
then load it into the appropriate
text field as you can see here.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.690
Now, remember, all this will happen
if last location is not null.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.020
So, here I've just checked if
mLastLocation is not equal to null,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.480
then I will do all of this.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.320
Because if it was equal to null,
then getting the latitude and

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.990
getting the longitude
might produce an error.
