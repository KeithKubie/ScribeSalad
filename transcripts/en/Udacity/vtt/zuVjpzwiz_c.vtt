00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.484
So let's revisit this inclusive scan example.

00:00:02.484 --> 00:00:05.483
We have again a 6-element input sequence,

00:00:05.483 --> 00:00:09.891
and we're going to reduce it with the plus operator to generate this output sequence.

00:00:09.891 --> 00:00:16.059
Let's think about it this way. What is this output element as a function of all these input elements?

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.632
Well, really what it is is just a reduction of the 1st element.

00:00:19.632 --> 00:00:24.761
The 2nd output element is simply a reduction of the 1st 2 input elements,

00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:29.854
the 3rd output element is a reduction of the first 3 inputs, and so on.

00:00:29.854 --> 00:00:34.491
In general, the nth output element is the reduction of the 1st n input elements.

00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:38.988
So if we want to go ahead and compute this output as a function of the input,

00:00:38.988 --> 00:00:42.021
we can do that with the tools that we already have at our disposal.

00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:46.724
To compute all n outputs, we simply run n separate reductions,

00:00:46.724 --> 00:00:49.796
and then we can run all n of these reductions in parallel.

00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:52.376
So let's take a quiz on this.

00:00:52.376 --> 00:00:56.605
As a function of n, how many steps is it going to take to scan in this way,

00:00:56.605 --> 00:01:00.745
with n reductions, and how much work is it going to take overall?

00:01:00.745 --> 00:01:03.738
And our choices are constant amount of steps or work,

00:01:03.738 --> 00:01:09.115
amount of steps or work proportional to the logarithm of the size of the input,

00:01:09.115 --> 00:01:12.807
a linear relationship between the size of the input and the number of steps

00:01:12.807 --> 00:01:14.475
or the amount of work,

00:01:14.475 --> 00:01:16.716
and a quadratic relationship between the size of the input

00:01:16.716 --> 00:01:19.067
and the number of steps and the number of work.

00:01:19.067 --> 00:01:23.718
So what I'd like you to do is check the right box in the steps row and check the right box in the work row

00:01:23.718 --> 00:01:26.672
that corresponds to the relationship between the size of the input

00:01:26.672 --> 00:01:29.072
and the number of steps or the amount of work.
