JANET CONRAD: My primary
research interest

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.370
is in neutrino physics.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.030
Neutrinos are one of the
standard model particles.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.400
The thing that's
interesting about neutrinos

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.260
is that the standard
model that we have

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.810
tells us how particles
are supposed to behave.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.120
And the neutrinos are
not following the rules

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.870
of our standard model.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.500
We don't completely
understand why,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.120
but it's one of our first
clues that we have had,

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.380
of the particles that we
really know and understand,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.690
that there must be beyond
the standard model physics.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.640
So we are using that to try to
look for beyond standard model

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.972
physics, and that's
what I love to do.
