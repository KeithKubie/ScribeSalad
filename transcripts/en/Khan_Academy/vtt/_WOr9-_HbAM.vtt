00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.767
So we have a function, f of
x, graphed right over here.

00:00:03.767 --> 00:00:05.350
And then we have a
bunch of statements

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.789
about the limit of f of x, as
x approaches different values.

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:11.330
And what I want to do is figure
out which of these statements

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.140
are true and which
of these are false.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.400
So let's look at
this first statement.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.350
Limit of f of x, as x approaches
1 from the positive direction,

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.580
is equal to 0.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.220
So is this true or false?

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.670
So let's look at it.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.860
So we're talking about
as x approaches 1

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.290
from the positive direction,
so for values greater than 1.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.690
So as x approaches 1 from
the positive direction,

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.530
what is f of x?

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.620
Well, when x is, let's say 1
and 1/2, f of x is up here,

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.730
as x gets closer and closer
to 1, f of x stays right at 1.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.480
So as x approaches 1 from
the positive direction,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.510
it looks like the limit of
f of x as x approaches 1

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.030
from the positive
direction isn't 0.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.100
It looks like it is 1.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.346
So this is not true.

00:01:04.346 --> 00:01:05.970
This would be true
if instead of saying

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.390
from the positive
direction, we said

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.556
from the negative direction.

00:01:08.556 --> 00:01:12.870
From the negative direction,
the value of the function

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.580
really does look like
it is approaching 0.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.430
For approaching 1 from the
negative direction, when

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.370
x is right over
here, this is f of x.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.650
When x is right over
here, this is f of x.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.280
When x is right over
here, this is f of x.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.880
And we see that
the value of f of x

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.484
seems to get closer
and closer to 0.

00:01:29.484 --> 00:01:30.900
So this would only
be true if they

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.410
were approaching from
the negative direction.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.660
Next question.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.010
Limit of f of x, as x approaches
0 from the negative direction,

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.634
is the same as limit of
f of x as x approaches 0

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:41.800
from the positive direction.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.700
Is this statement true?

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.420
Well, let's look.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.060
Our function, f of
x, as we approach 0

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.530
from the negative
direction-- I'm

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.720
using a new color--
as we approach 0

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.350
from the negative direction,
so right over here,

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.730
this is our value of f of x.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.580
Then as we get closer, this
is our value of f of x.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.400
As we get even closer, this
is our value of f of x.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.410
So it seems from the
negative direction

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.560
like it is approaching
positive 1.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.050
From the positive direction,
when x is greater than 0,

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.070
let's try it out.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.980
So if, say, x is 1/2,
this is our f of x.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.820
If x is, let's say,
1/4, this is our f of x.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.070
If x is just barely larger
than 0, this is our f of x.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.050
So it also seems
to be approaching

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.120
f of x is equal to 1.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.240
So this looks true.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.320
They both seem to be
approaching the limit of 1.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.460
The limit here is 1.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.010
So this is absolutely true.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.860
Now let's look at
this statement.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.740
The limit of f of
x, as x approaches 0

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.365
from the negative
direction, is equal to 1.

00:02:44.365 --> 00:02:45.990
Well, we've already
thought about that.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.080
The limit of f of
x, as x approaches 0

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.760
from the negative
direction, we see

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.570
that we're getting
closer and closer to 1.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.120
As x gets closer and
closer to 0, f of x

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.470
gets closer and closer to 1.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.520
So this is also true.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.235
Limit of f of x, as x
approaches 0 exists.

00:03:05.235 --> 00:03:06.360
Well, it definitely exists.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.690
We've already established
that it's equal to 1.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.730
So that's true.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.880
Now the limit of f of x
as x approaches 1 exists,

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.300
is that true?

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.570
Well, we already saw that
when we were approaching 1

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.380
from the positive
direction, the limit

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.670
seems to be approaching 1.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.880
We get when x is 1
and 1/2, f of x is 1.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.031
When x is a little bit
more than 1, it's 1.

00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:30.280
So it seems like we're getting
closer and closer to 1.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.363
So let me write that down.

00:03:31.363 --> 00:03:36.140
The limit of f of
x, as x approaches 1

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.680
from the positive
direction, is equal to 1.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.950
And now what's the limit
of f of x as x approaches 1

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.910
from the negative direction?

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.290
Well, here, this is our f of x.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.780
Here, this is our f of x.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.190
It seems like our f of x is
getting closer and closer to 0,

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.050
when we approach 1 from
values less than 1.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.140
So over here it equals 0.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.670
So if the limit from
the right-hand side

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.170
is a different value than the
limit from the left-hand side,

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.330
then the limit does not exist.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.830
So this is not true.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.620
Now finally, the limit of f
of x, as x approaches 1.5,

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.920
is equal to 1.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.015
So right over here.

00:04:16.015 --> 00:04:17.890
So everything we've been
dealing with so far,

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.848
we've always looked at
points of discontinuity,

00:04:19.848 --> 00:04:22.930
or points where maybe the
function isn't quite defined.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.000
But here, this is kind
of a plain vanilla point.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.890
When x is equal to 1.5,
that's maybe right over here,

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.052
this is f of 1.5.

00:04:30.052 --> 00:04:31.510
That right over
there is the point,

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.380
well, this is the
value f of 1.5.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.770
We could say f of, we could see
that f of 1.5 is equal to 1,

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.800
that this right here is
the point 1.5 comma 1.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.700
And if we approach it
from the left-hand side,

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.071
from values less than it, it's
1, the limit seems to be 1.

00:04:50.071 --> 00:04:51.820
When we approach from
the right-hand side,

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.850
the limit seems to be 1.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.830
So this is a pretty
straightforward thing.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.500
The graph is continuous
right there, and so really,

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.210
if we just substitute
at that point,

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.200
or we just look at
the graph, the limit

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.870
is the value of
the function there.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.390
You don't have to have a
function be undefined in order

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.730
to find a limit there.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.350
So it is, indeed, the
case that the limit

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:15.630
of f of x, as x approaches
1.5, is equal to 1.
