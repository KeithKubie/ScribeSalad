00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.160
Vsauce!

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.160
Kevin here.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.149
In the U.S. you may be able to order Cinnabon
balls filled with frosting but Taco Bell in

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:09.480
Guatemala offers the Chocodilla.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.799
A dessert quesadilla filled with chocolate.

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.789
And if you want a taco in India you can find
that at Domino's.

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.150
The McDonald's menu in India features drastically
different items because the people of India

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.410
have a largely vegetarian diet.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.130
So they have the Veg McMuffin instead of the
Egg McMuffin and rather than a traditional

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.329
Big Mac there's the Chicken Maharaja Mac.

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.829
There's also the McAloo Tiki which is a fried
potato and pea patty in a bun.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.030
While KFC India features a deep-fried cheese
patty called the Paneer Zinger.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.610
As well as chicken and veggie rice bowls.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.609
KFC in China serves spins on the classics
ranging from Golden Curry pork chop rice to

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:54.730
chicken sandwiches topped with prawns.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.469
Also the website features fun translations
like bacon chicken oats fort and suck that

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:01.469
chicken flavor.

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.900
Yeah, I'll have the nine suck that chicken
flavor!

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.880
McDonald's in China as part of their manly
man campaign offered a mashed potato burger.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.880
And instead of french fries you can get corn
and instead of an apple pie you can get taro

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.880
pie.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:36.060
Now let's take a quick look at Pizza Hut pizza
crust stuffed with things.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.520
Also Singapore had a pizza on top of a pizza
and for dessert Thailand has the chocolate

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.080
almond pizza.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.900
Pizza Hut and Domino's in Japan offers several
types of pizza with mayonnaise.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.110
Japanese mayonnaise is thinner and sweeter
than American and made with apple and malt

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.200
vinegar and egg yolks instead of whole eggs.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.500
Japanese KFC not only has soy sauce flavored
rice balls and deep-fried soup fritters but

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.950
a sweet and spicy soy sauce chicken sandwich.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.310
The Japanese McDonald's menu piles huge chunks
of avocado on several burgers.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.280
Another burger has meat sauce that looks like
this and they also have a burger made with

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.500
shrimp.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.780
McDonald's in Italy serves creamy stars that
are filled with cheese and they also have

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.780
calzones.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.650
Apparently there you can also just get a block
of parmesan cheese.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.200
While Spain offers up a nice cup of McDonald's
gazpacho and Arabic countries feature the

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.890
McArabia chicken - which is folded in Arabic
bread.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.840
KFC Arabia has a chicken poppers sandwich
which has chicken and deep fried cheese-stuffed

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.100
jalapeÃ±o poppers on bread.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.630
Germans burger can be very long as witnessed
by their Burger King's x-tra long chili cheese

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.760
burger and x-tra long spring bbq burger.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.400
They also have chicken nugget burgers.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.520
And a waffle covered in chocolate for dessert.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.790
Here's a quick look at some promotional items
from around the world.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.740
Rolled cheeseburgers.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.319
Dark Vader Burger.

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.450
Popcorn chicken Nachos and Nacho chicken sandwich.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.710
Donut pizza that features a hollow center
and pizza-sized burger.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.120
And while here in the US we've had things
like Friendly's Grilled Cheese Burger Melt

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.990
or the Bacon Insider withbacon inside the
burger.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:31.120
They don't compare to Japan's 10 patty titan
burger served with a jumbo bucket of fries.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.680
Which for Lotteria and their tower burger
and shrimp burger is actually no big deal...

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:45.459
And as always - thanks for watching.
