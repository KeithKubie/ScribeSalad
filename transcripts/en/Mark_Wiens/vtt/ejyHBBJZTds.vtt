00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.230
Hey, everyone its Mark Weins with Migrationology.com Good morning from Manila

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.720
I had an amazing sleep last night and just woke up and had a quick breakfast

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.760
But the plan for the day

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.880
Is that Ying and I have been invited to eat at the spiral buffet here at The Sofitel

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.440
which is supposed to be one of the ultimate buffets in Manila

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.920
in the Philippines as well as in Asia and after having breakfast at sofitel yesterday

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.329
I can only imagine how amazing the lunch buffet is gonna be so that's the plan for the day, but for right now

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.630
I've got a lot of work to do. I'm gonna start video editing

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.679
Now this is a toy that I really love to have at home someday

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:02.000
Well that is some excellent espresso and now I'm gonna start some serious video editing

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.979
Give you a view of this hard rain out here

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.669
Before in the morning when I showed that view you can see all the skyline and the ocean over here and almost

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.400
It's almost completely invisible now

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.130
It's right at noon it is buffet time. We're walking down to the spiral buffet. I can't wait for this

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.468
So they have 21 dining ateliers

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:40.508
Which are kind of like different dining stations or food stations, and you can see there's hot japanese. There's wood fire pizza

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.090
oven there is

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.869
Picking duck all Sorts of amazing sounding

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.490
things to eat

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.490
Hello. Thank you

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.909
We arrived to the spiral Buffet and this is the most

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.729
Unbelievable display of food that I think I have ever seen in my entire life

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.029
I don't know if I've ever seen so much food in one

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.269
Place as this buffet. They literally have everything you can imagine from

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:24.700
Sushi to bread to an entire cheese room and an entire chocolate room to the Asian and Filipino section. There's Thai food there's

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:33.489
roast duck and chicken there's an Indian station, and so we just walked through every station, but have not started eating yet, and

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.629
It's it's just ridiculous ridiculous

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:49.828
And not to mention where we are seating king and I each have an entire like three person sofa to ourselves

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.409
and an entire table, which I

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.509
think they know that we're gonna accumulate a lot of plates at one time so we have like a

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.419
Like a six person table all to ourselves

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.870
They said this is their signature olive bread at spiral buffet and now I don't want to eat too much of this

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.060
But it does all that is hot and fresh

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.670
It's so crisp on the edges so crusty

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.729
I have absolutely no idea where to start so I'm just gonna start with the first thing in my path, and that is the Japanese

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.550
station

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.899
I decided to go straight in for some

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:48.769
Sashimi and some sushi, and then some oysters the oysters are flown in from France and

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.099
Pop open the head you Paul. You can eat oysters

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:09.109
Well, that's ridiculously good. Oh, it's just so smooth and silky soft and just

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.710
Disintegrates on my tongue oh Sashimi, and I actually forgot to get my Wasabi and and soy sauce

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.589
But I cannot wait I gotta go back for it later

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.959
Just so pure and so fresh

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.530
I'm not even sure how to eat caviar correctly

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.879
But I think I'll eat it with bread and I got some kind of green caviar in some kind of Black Caviar

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.939
Which I will put onto this little piece of bread

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.420
nice and salty

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.890
and very Seafoody tasting, but I love that like

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.640
Those little like bead. It tastes like you're eating little beads

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.160
This one is the crocodile

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.040
Okay

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.370
For my second plate I decided to go Filipino

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.190
It's normally of course this has to be eaten with rice and I like to eat it with rice but in order to save space

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.260
I just had to forego the rice that's a sacrifice. I'm having to make today. This is a dish

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.139
He said is stingray with coconut milk

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.990
Oh wow

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.910
It's so soft and tender

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.910
it tastes like shredded chicken and

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.410
then with that Chilli

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.260
That's wonderful. Oh that's so good and the other interesting thing. They have her is

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:54.240
Adobo, but this is not pork or chicken adobo. This is crocodile Adobo. Which is very attractive

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.489
Oh, I've had crocodile before that is very chewy and rubbery

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.630
Rubbery that is incredibly tender crocodile

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.650
very

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.880
like a kind of a cross between fish and meat and

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:20.439
That's awesome. Another thing they have in the filipino food section of the buffet is balloon. Which is the famous?

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.879
Fertilized egg, I can't remember if I should open it from this side, or this side

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:31.540
But I know there's there's soup inside of it. There's juice inside of it. So you want to crack it and

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.270
Try to break off the top

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.499
Oh, no, I think I got the dry side okay. I think I made a mistake. I think I'll go the other side

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.080
There's a little bit of soup in there

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:54.010
Oh, that's like. That's like chicken juice running down my chicken soup. Oh, that's chicken juice

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.409
Do you run running down my can that just tastes like chicken soup though?

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.519
We can see that the embryo there and all those feathers

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.749
There we go. I'm gonna dip this guy in vinegar and

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:12.919
then

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:14.919
Dip it in a little bit of salt?

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:17.829
And then I think I can one bite the whole thing

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.480
Hmm. It's kind of just like a hard-boiled egg

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:32.170
But with a lot more textures going on another thing is that it does kind of have a stronger like eggy flavor

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:33.820
So if you've thought of it

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:39.700
If you haven't if you think about it the flavor of a hard-boiled egg and just kind of magnify that flavor times a couple times

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:46.210
You'll have that and add some more textures to it like feathers you have a balloon

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.890
but yeah, I think it's really not as bad as many people say it is I

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.980
I enjoyed that and I think it's makes a fantastic protein snack

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:13.620
For my next course I went to the Indian station and they have just a full selection of Indian food

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.340
I got one piece of naan and then one of my favorite forms of Dal

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:22.889
Which is dal Makhani and then got some prawns some butter chicken

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.139
Some paneer, and then I threw on a piece of prime rib there just for good measure

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.560
into the Naan

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:41.419
so creamy and

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:48.200
Dal Makhani is superb and I think this one is buttered chicken if I remember correctly

00:08:55.490 --> 00:09:02.570
I am taking a little time out after that plate of Indian food to post a photo of the oyster on Instagram

00:09:04.089 --> 00:09:06.089
That should be good

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:11.709
next course, I think I'm going in for a little bit of European station and

00:09:12.259 --> 00:09:19.688
Got some a bunch of things cooked in butter and cream which look amazing and these are mushrooms and mashed potatoes

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:31.239
Oh, I love mushrooms and those I think they're just sauteed in butter and thyme

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.359
Okay, then. I had to get some mussels. Which I think are oh

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:41.980
Once lit up. I think these are just cooked in cream and butter as well two muscles in one shell

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:55.669
That is extremely rich, but that's that does taste good there might be there might be cheese in there as well. I'm not sure

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.890
I really wish I was 22 years old again

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:07.349
I cannot eat as much as I used to I'm really starting to get full, but I think I'm Gonna go

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.549
To the Japanese hot station and get some Japanese hot dishes

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.319
But I might take a five-minute breather right here on this couch

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:23.820
I got some Japanese Sukiyaki in the bowl, and then I got some Kimchi

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:27.570
One more oysters for good measure and some sashimi

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:39.780
That is nice and salty and just a little bit sweet and chaste that with some Kimchi

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:50.309
I love compute. We just received word of the final call for the buffet because it closes at 3:00 p.m.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:56.129
So we managed to eat here for almost three hours, and I enjoyed every minute of it

00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:00.270
but I'm very impressed with the buffet just an Incredible quantity and

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.080
Diversity of things available and what I like is that a lot of the food

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:09.930
You know while some buffets the food sits there for a long time and starts to not taste so good here they really

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:15.300
Put an emphasis on Fresh food. So you'll see them cooking in small portions, and then adding it to the

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.290
serving pans

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:23.790
Which is really nice eating at the spiral buffet was included in our stay at the sofitel which was sponsored?

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.070
Because we spoke at the event yesterday

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:31.019
But I want to say a big thank you for to spiral buffet for having us here

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.270
And that was delicious

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:38.100
and this is by all means the most impressive and diverse and

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:43.800
Grandest buffet that I have ever eaten at in my life. I'm gonna end the video for today here

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:48.990
Because I'm about to go take a nap for the rest of the day. Maybe oh, yeah another thing

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:52.680
I think it might be worth it to have a room at so if you tell when you eat at this buffet because

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:57.509
If I had to drive somewhere now, I like to go home. I don't actually think I could do it

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:03.389
But nice to have a room here. Yeah, I'm gonna end the video here, and I want to say a big

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.440
Thank you for watching this video

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:10.950
