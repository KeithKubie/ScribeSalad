You are listening to radiolab radiolab

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.620
from [inaudible], w.N y.

00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:11.790
S. T. E. N. N. P. R.

4
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.430
Okay. So let's just do something. Okay. Off the top of our head. Hey,

5
00:00:16.431 --> 00:00:20.700
I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab, the podcast, podcasts.

6
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:24.980
And on this podcast just short, we're thinking back to our falling show.

7
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.410
Do you want to just briefly describe that show?

8
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.440
The falling show was a show just to dwell on the word or the idea of falling,

9
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.780
right? So it included falling in love and falling down,

10
00:00:35.781 --> 00:00:38.830
falling over waterfalls in a barrel, falling apart when you're parked, you know,

11
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.760
a place we didn't really get to go in the falling shit,

12
00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:44.480
which I liked to take us. Now they're grabbing,

13
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.260
you know,

14
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.770
the force that makes one fall [inaudible] me.

15
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.740
So no one can really explain why gravity works the way it does,

16
00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:57.080
but we all basically trust that it works. Right?

17
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.660
When you put your foot up in you, you will create the Google, hit the ground,

18
00:00:59.661 --> 00:01:03.080
throw a ball up and in the ground. Yeah. And gravity. And you just get along.

19
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.970
You and gravity have an agreement. Yes,

20
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.850
but we're going to start off with this tail that we ran into.

21
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.050
Amazing tale of a woman who lost that agreement. Oh,

22
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.260
stay the hell away from me. This is actually a true story,

23
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.830
a that comes from an essay written many years ago by a guy named Burton Rue

24
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.320
Shay, who is this great, how would you describe it? Britain Rochet.

25
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.580
He was a great essayist journal of Journalism. Ses.

26
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.630
<v 1>Yeah. And this essay was published in 1958 in the New Yorker and it's kind of an</v>

27
00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:43.680
interesting essay because it's essentially one long quote from this woman that

28
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.760
burden interviewed Rosemary Morton. It reads like a novel,

29
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.530
even though it's nonfiction. So we asked an actress a, he's been in some movies,

30
00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:56.350
Hope Davis, to read excerpts from Rosemary's story,

31
00:01:56.351 --> 00:01:59.420
and the story begins on a normal night.

32
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.080
Rosemary's at home with her husband, frank, and everything's fine.

33
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.410
[inaudible] for the moment, I've been home about an hour.

34
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.370
Dinner was ready and waiting in the oven and I was sitting at the piano,

35
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.460
not really playing, just amusing myself.

36
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.830
That's something I often do at the end of the day. It helps me relax.

37
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.460
My husband was in the kitchen making us a cocktail,

38
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.590
which is another Morton custom.

39
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.830
We'll usually have a drink or two before dinner.

40
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.310
So everything was quite ordinary and normal until frank came in with the drinks.

41
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.010
<v 0>I got up to join him on the Sofa and as I did, as I started across the room,</v>

42
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.560
I felt the floor sort of

43
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.290
<v 2>mm</v>

44
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.130
<v 0>shake. Is that because there's an earthquake going on?</v>

45
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.580
Well in the essay she looks at frank and she's like, good heavens. I said,

46
00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:56.670
what was that? Frank just looked at me,

47
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.220
his face was a perfect blank. He made some remark

48
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.270
<v 3>about old buildings stretching and settling and handed me my drink.</v>

49
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.010
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

50
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.490
<v 1>so she doesn't really think too much of this cause it was very momentary. Okay.</v>

51
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.550
But a week later she's at work. She's asking the library,

52
00:03:13.551 --> 00:03:15.500
cause she's a librarian. She's at her desk.

53
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.690
I worked at my desk for about an hour and he was having so quiet, so peaceful.

54
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.310
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

55
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.310
<v 1>Then I got up to get a book from the stacks or a drink of water or something and</v>

56
00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:30.310
it happens. The floor,

57
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.510
<v 0>a shake</v>

58
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.420
<v 1>and sank. It went down on up just one</v>

59
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.140
<v 3>lurch, maybe a little more pronounced than the first time,</v>

60
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.660
and then everything was back to normal

61
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.350
<v 1>suck for my state of mind. I didn't know what to think the best</v>

62
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.480
<v 0>do was tell myself that this was an old building too. It was built around nine</v>

63
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.600
<v 1>1500 so that was your sense at first,</v>

64
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.890
just old buildings.

65
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.010
It never occurred to me that there might be any other explanation.

66
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.660
<v 3>I suppose I didn't want it to,</v>

67
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.820
but then over the next few days, very odd things began to happen.

68
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.380
I don't know how to describe it,

69
00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:22.180
but I had the feeling that my sense of touch was getting more and more acute,

70
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.470
<v 0>especially in the souls of my feet.</v>

71
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.920
I could feel a little tremors,

72
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.580
<v 4>no,</v>

73
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.690
<v 0>that other people couldn't.</v>

74
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.950
<v 4>Wow.</v>

75
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.150
<v 0>I didn't tell frank until the middle of the following week on Wednesday night to</v>

76
00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:45.660
be exact. By then I had to,

77
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.390
I couldn't keep it to myself any longer.

78
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.640
<v 3>There was something wrong with me.</v>

79
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:55.703
<v 4>Ooh,</v>

80
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.930
<v 3>there just wasn't any word for the awful sensations I've been having.</v>

81
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.260
The floor shaking feeling was only one of them.

82
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.230
I don't know how many times that happened over the weekend.

83
00:05:07.231 --> 00:05:10.830
Seven or eight at least. But even that began to have a different feeling.

84
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.840
At first the floor had moved or sagged as a whole.

85
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.580
It still did.

86
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.360
Only now I could feel another movement to kind of counter that.

87
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.360
<v 0>Sometimes it was as if I were sinking into the floor.</v>

88
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.580
The room would tilt and I take a step and the floor was like snow.

89
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.900
<v 3>It would give under my foot and I would sink</v>

90
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.863
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

91
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.090
<v 3>and other times it was just the reverse. A floor would rise up to meet me.</v>

92
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.530
By then,

93
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.530
it wasn't simply the floor that moved when the floor tilted the walls of the

94
00:05:53.531 --> 00:05:57.860
room tilted with it and the ceiling, I mean the shape of the room never changed.

95
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.140
Only its position in space.

96
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.793
<v 4>Okay,</v>

97
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.470
<v 0>so rosemary went to see her doctor and her doctor, her just some specialists,</v>

98
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:14.360
and they ran some tests and then a short while later she went back to her doctor

99
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.400
to get the results. He read me their conclusions and they were all the same.

100
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.420
They even used the same phrase, impression,

101
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.490
essentially normal.

102
00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.350
<v 3>I'll never forget that phrase. Normal, essentially normal</v>

103
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.860
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

104
00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.920
<v 3>It sounds so reassuring, so comforting,</v>

105
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.130
but it isn't. At least it wasn't to me. It was terrifying.

106
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.480
After this diagnosis or non diagnosis,

107
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.990
things really take a turn. Fast forward a few months.

108
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.020
There were times in March and early April when I was absolutely certain I was

109
00:06:58.301 --> 00:06:59.200
going to die,

110
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.430
but my reaction to death was peculiar.

111
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.590
I don't remember feeling afraid.

112
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.900
All I remember is an overwhelming sense of urgency.

113
00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.250
So little time, so little done so much I wanted to do

114
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:16.993
<v 4>okay.</v>

115
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:23.270
<v 3>I dragged frank to the theater more than once and I never thought of refusing</v>

116
00:07:23.281 --> 00:07:25.890
when he suggested the philharmonic or the metropolitan.

117
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.020
My response to music has never been so complete.

118
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:34.080
I spent hours listening to records.

119
00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:39.770
I'd play some old favorites like Beecham conducting Haydn's London symphony and

120
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.270
it was amazing.

121
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:50.310
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

122
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:54.250
<v 3>seem to me that I could hear the inner structure more clearly than ever before.</v>

123
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.620
So the idea of a dinner and a concert wasn't at all

124
00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.633
<v 4>the usual.</v>

125
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:04.520
<v 3>My only mistake was to take that dreadful underground passage</v>

126
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.010
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

127
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.780
<v 3>it was raining and I was in a hurry,</v>

128
00:08:11.781 --> 00:08:16.540
but even so I should've realized when I did it was too late. Wait,

129
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:22.030
the passage was jammed with commuters shoving,

130
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.660
pushing and surging towards me, but I didn't dare to.

131
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:32.080
Fluor was beginning to wobble and I knew if I tried to swing around,

132
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:36.010
it would tip me head over heels. All I could do was go on.

133
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:42.340
The traffic was still all against me. People kept looming up, towering up.

134
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.990
The came charging at me like John

135
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.533
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

136
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.740
<v 3>and then I felt something right out of a nightmare.</v>

137
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:57.090
I was almost at the end of the passage when I felt the movement change

138
00:08:59.280 --> 00:08:59.600
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

139
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.660
<v 3>it was as if someone had pulled 11</v>

140
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.150
there was a little jolt

141
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:12.940
and the floor was moving very slowly backwards down the passage.

142
00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:19.130
I was walking on a treadmill only for a minute though.

143
00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.350
Then I reached the stairs.

144
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:25.640
I drove myself up to the lobby and collapsed in a chair.

145
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:28.400
I was jelly

146
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:32.143
<v 4>mm mm.</v>

147
00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:37.100
<v 0>From early April, I began to move in a different world.</v>

148
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:42.050
I was conscious of a new dimension, a new plane.

149
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:46.640
I had a new relationship to space, my legs,

150
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:51.860
my arms, my face. My whole body felt different.

151
00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.210
It had no permanent shape.

152
00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.960
It changed by the minute I seem to be completely at the mercy of some outside

153
00:10:04.901 --> 00:10:07.960
force, some atmospheric pressure.

154
00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.630
I was a morphous.

155
00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:15.840
My left leg would seem to lengthen or my right arm or my neck.

156
00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.750
Oh one whole side of me. It would double or triple in size,

157
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.190
<v 3>and yet that doesn't fully describe it.</v>

158
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.140
There were times when the forest seemed to be the rotation of the earth.

159
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.990
I would have the feeling that I was vertically aligned with the Earth's axis.

160
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.740
I could feel a sort of winding movement startup inside me.

161
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:42.740
Then one of my legs would begin to shorten as if it were an anchor being drawn

162
00:10:42.741 --> 00:10:44.310
slowly up by a week.

163
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:49.130
The other leg would dangle after a minute. The winch,

164
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:54.160
which shift it would engage the dangling like and justice slowly bring it up to

165
00:10:55.941 --> 00:10:56.774
match the other

166
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.260
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

167
00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.860
<v 3>just feels like I'm kind of a nightmare cartoon of some kind. Yeah. So, so what,</v>

168
00:11:06.861 --> 00:11:10.250
what is it, what is wrong with her? Well, after months of this,

169
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:11.840
at the end of the year essay,

170
00:11:11.841 --> 00:11:16.220
she does finally learn that this condition she has has an aim.

171
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:21.370
My trouble was a disturbance of the internal ear called labyrinthitis labyrinth

172
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:26.750
hiatus. The suffix [inaudible] meant inflammation, swelling.

173
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:32.020
So the meaning of Librarian situs as a word was simply an inflammation of the

174
00:11:32.031 --> 00:11:33.620
oral labyrinth. You know,

175
00:11:33.621 --> 00:11:37.250
I think people in science and medicine love to give big fat names to,

176
00:11:37.251 --> 00:11:41.540
I don't know. Well actually this condition you should know goes by another name.

177
00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.920
What? Vertigo. [inaudible]

178
00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:54.773
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

179
00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.450
<v 0>that's why I liked the story cause like I didn't know,</v>

180
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.450
I mean like I always thought a vertigo like from the movie. Yeah.

181
00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.130
Like you're on a stairs and you're like, yeah,

182
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.823
<v 5>Woo.</v>

183
00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:16.230
<v 0>Like it's just a thing with heights, you know,</v>

184
00:12:16.231 --> 00:12:17.850
like that's what it was in the Hitchcock film.

185
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.400
But what Rosemary Morton goes through in this story,

186
00:12:20.401 --> 00:12:22.830
it's like it seems way deeper.

187
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.180
And at some point in the essay,

188
00:12:27.181 --> 00:12:31.500
she actually refers to her situation as a case of gravitational anarchy.

189
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:37.590
That's an interesting phrase. I kinda, I kinda like, yeah,

190
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:43.600
well does she get better? Yup. It's impossible to say exactly what it all ended,

191
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.820
but I think it was frank who really sensed it first. It was after

192
00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:53.860
<v 1>dinner one night in late August and he suddenly smiled and remarked that I must</v>

193
00:12:54.081 --> 00:12:57.800
be feeling much better. I asked him what he meant.

194
00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:01.220
You never look scared anymore.

195
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:04.520
He said it, it's very mysterious,

196
00:13:04.521 --> 00:13:09.521
but your vertigo just went away without explanation for the coming and no

197
00:13:10.071 --> 00:13:13.760
explanation for the going. Some things just don't have explanations, Robert,

198
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.580
but they have wonderful sound design

199
00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:22.070
and that's Radiolab. No explanation. It's pretty salads.

200
00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.910
I buy it, taking the vitamins. I am crazy for founders,

201
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:34.960
<v 0>just speaking of not knowing anything. Um, a few weeks ago on this very program,</v>

202
00:13:34.961 --> 00:13:39.010
we decided to take up the question of falling, you know, falling in love,

203
00:13:39.011 --> 00:13:42.430
falling apart, all that. And one of our topics at which we did with the,

204
00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:43.390
the great,

205
00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.600
I have to say this now with a certain fierceness because of what's about to

206
00:13:46.601 --> 00:13:49.830
happen with the great journalist David Quam.

207
00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:52.780
And we were talking about falling cats.

208
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.650
And just to summarize the whole thing started for David and therefore for us

209
00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:59.800
when he read this study written by two vets,

210
00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:03.880
Wayne Whitney and Cheryl Mel Hoff who worked in um,

211
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:07.390
the mid town veterinary hospital and they noticed that, um,

212
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:12.960
that in Manhattan there were a lot of cats falling out of windows high windows,

213
00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:17.410
falling off ledges falling off roofs. And when they looked at the data,

214
00:14:17.411 --> 00:14:21.210
they found something a little strange that cats who fell on the first two fifth

215
00:14:21.211 --> 00:14:24.030
floors were lightly injured, which makes sense.

216
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:28.960
Cats that felt from the 10th floor up. They also didn't get hurt so much,

217
00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:33.430
which doesn't make sense. It's cats who fell from the fifth to the ninth floor.

218
00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.490
Those were the ones that really got banged up.

219
00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.110
And we thought this was super interesting.

220
00:14:38.111 --> 00:14:43.111
I mean like why would a cat falling 42 floors not get hurt more than a cat

221
00:14:43.481 --> 00:14:45.520
falling nine floors doesn't make any sense.

222
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.370
And David gave us what we thought it was a very plausible answer,

223
00:14:48.371 --> 00:14:51.770
but it was one that made a lot of listeners go,

224
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.330
<v 6>hmm, I'm not buying it. Like Ryan said, that guy, that's Neil degrasse Tyson,</v>

225
00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.260
astrophysicist frequent guests. I laid out the general idea of the program.

226
00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.040
We said they had, I dunno. Was it six? How many cats?

227
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:09.190
Oh boy. I don't remember cats. This building was hundreds, but it was, no, no,

228
00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:12.740
it was hung. Those two was, yeah. Only hundreds of cats. You want,

229
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:16.040
you want a bigger number? You Ain't no, I'm just a hundreds. Yes, that's a lot.

230
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:18.660
They kept a careful, uh, sort of record.

231
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.880
It's hundreds of cats who fell and were taken to the vet. That's right.

232
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:24.350
That's a different number. Right?

233
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:28.730
The ones who died didn't probably get taken to the hospital or the ones who

234
00:15:28.731 --> 00:15:33.100
survived without need of medical care. Well, it's too bad, Phil,

235
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.760
from the 40th floor. Wouldn't you take him to the doctors?

236
00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.740
He stands up and does the Jig. No, it's fun. Catch up. Nine lies.

237
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:45.160
So this is a highly biased dataset among all cats that fell from a window of the

238
00:15:46.581 --> 00:15:51.581
cats who fell we or rather these vets noticed the cats who fell and were taken

239
00:15:51.831 --> 00:15:56.480
to the vet. So I'm betting that the high floors, most of them just simply died.

240
00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:01.310
And you don't take a dead cat to the vet. I mean you might, but why? All right,

241
00:16:01.311 --> 00:16:05.540
so you started with completely biased sample.

242
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.331
So I don't,

243
00:16:06.331 --> 00:16:10.790
I try not to spend much brain power analyzing flawed data.

244
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.500
<v 7>Okay. We can deal with that.</v>

245
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:16.050
<v 6>Okay. That's our guy in the fight. That's David Coleman.</v>

246
00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.230
<v 7>Clearly Dr. Tyson, ease of, he's a smart guy,</v>

247
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.750
but Tyson is missing the point.

248
00:16:21.751 --> 00:16:25.860
I think the point is within this admittedly biased sample,

249
00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:26.761
there's a really,

250
00:16:26.761 --> 00:16:31.620
really interesting pattern that begs to be explained and that is among the cats

251
00:16:31.621 --> 00:16:35.130
that have fallen and have gotten injured somewhat,

252
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:39.810
the ones that sell five stories got injured worse than the ones that fell 25

253
00:16:39.811 --> 00:16:40.890
stories. Why?

254
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:43.920
<v 6>That's an interesting question. No matter how many cats died,</v>

255
00:16:43.921 --> 00:16:47.550
there's still this interesting skew in the injured cat population that's not

256
00:16:47.551 --> 00:16:48.220
going away.

257
00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.740
<v 7>And he's saying your Dataset is incomplete.</v>

258
00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:56.190
And what I say in response is it's a very interesting dataset and let's try and

259
00:16:56.201 --> 00:16:56.950
understand it.

260
00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:57.850
<v 6>Incomplete or not.</v>

261
00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:01.810
<v 7>All data sets are incomplete. What is, what does he study?</v>

262
00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.570
<v 6>He studies physics. Yeah.</v>

263
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:05.770
<v 7>Did he study stars? Distant stars.</v>

264
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:07.730
<v 6>Justin star is actually an astrophysicist.</v>

265
00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.400
<v 7>Oh, okay. Well he's looked at a few</v>

266
00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:10.323
<v 6>dark</v>

267
00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:13.750
<v 7>and he's drawn conclusions about him based on what he's seen.</v>

268
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.780
<v 6>Well wait, let me back up. If your data though,</v>

269
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:21.760
incomplete suggested something that made sense, given the laws of physics,

270
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:25.150
then you'd have less urge to question it.

271
00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:30.480
But you're telling me something that conflicts with my understanding of Physics

272
00:17:30.941 --> 00:17:33.030
One oh one we haven't yet told you. But I'll tell you where.

273
00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:37.930
Got To tell you now, let me tell you it. No, no. So you invent and you invent

274
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:44.740
[inaudible] I feel an invention come back to the, well, I feel alive.

275
00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.200
We need to call a perfectly reasonable interpretation.

276
00:17:47.201 --> 00:17:50.340
But what you might call it, an invention goes as follows. So

277
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:53.610
<v 0>the cat falls out of the 42nd floor window, let's say,</v>

278
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.840
and it begins to accelerate. So for one, two, three, four,

279
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.060
five floors, it is accelerating.

280
00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:04.090
And then something happens around nine floors where the pole of gravity gets

281
00:18:04.091 --> 00:18:08.470
balanced out by the push of the air against its belly and it hits terminal

282
00:18:08.471 --> 00:18:12.430
velocity, which irregular words is it? It's continued to drop at the same speed.

283
00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.160
So then it's at cruising speed.

284
00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:19.330
After the cat's hit terminal velocity and the sensation of acceleration was

285
00:18:19.331 --> 00:18:21.070
gone, they relaxed

286
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:23.983
<v 4>[inaudible],</v>

287
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:26.740
<v 0>they sort of stretch out like a flying squirrel</v>

288
00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.820
and then they hit the ground belly flop.

289
00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.410
And you're saying that because they hit the screws and speed and then relax into

290
00:18:35.411 --> 00:18:37.960
the flying squirrel? The impact is less.

291
00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:38.920
<v 6>Yes.</v>

292
00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:43.920
There's no obvious reason to me why a cat at terminal velocity is more relaxed

293
00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.920
than a cat. In Free Fall, you're essentially in free fall, you're weightless,

294
00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.290
you're, you're weightless. Your speed actually doesn't matter.

295
00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.510
While you're weightless, you don't even know what you're speeding.

296
00:18:52.511 --> 00:18:55.150
What do you mean? Well, you're speeding up. So things are changing.

297
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.650
If you're speeding up, it is an unnoticeable phenomenon. Yeah.

298
00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:02.950
The cat is as weightless at the moment. They leave the window as they are,

299
00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.400
as they approached the, the terminal velocity speed.

300
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:09.970
Do you have a cat by the way? No, but I, I've, I've,

301
00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:13.290
I've explored the behavior of cats. Okay.

302
00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:18.160
Under the laws of physics in my youth violence,

303
00:19:18.161 --> 00:19:22.570
but just I'm learning, I said discretely look away.

304
00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:25.330
So, uh,

305
00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:29.170
the cat freaks instantly when there's no ground under it,

306
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:33.400
it gets its legs underneath within a fraction of a second after that.

307
00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.670
Now you try to go psycho on the cat and say, oh,

308
00:19:36.671 --> 00:19:39.910
well it's thinking about it's fall and it's free. It's accelerating.

309
00:19:39.911 --> 00:19:43.330
Then it's in terminal velocity. It's already legs pointed down at that point.

310
00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:44.870
<v 7>Well, um,</v>

311
00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:49.340
the part about you are essentially weightless when you're falling.

312
00:19:49.341 --> 00:19:54.020
Whether you're accelerating or not is something that he's more likely to know

313
00:19:54.021 --> 00:19:57.890
about than we are. And I, I give him credit for that.

314
00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:02.090
On the other hand, he's a physicist. He's not an animal behaviorist,

315
00:20:02.091 --> 00:20:06.260
so he really doesn't know any better than we do what a cat thinks or what a cat

316
00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.070
feels.

317
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:10.070
Probably there are a lot of cat owners out there who could help us as much as

318
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:12.620
this, um, brainy, brainy physicist.

319
00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.250
<v 0>So maybe we should ask our listeners,</v>

320
00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:15.770
<v 7>but ladies and gentlemen,</v>

321
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:19.310
do not approach this as an experimentally addressable yes.

322
00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:22.130
<v 6>Question. Do not throw your cat out of a window. Do not do that.</v>

323
00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.630
We will come into rescue if you do that.

324
00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:28.970
<v 7>One of the things that makes us kind of a tricky, um, opaque,</v>

325
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:29.990
intractable question.

326
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.600
<v 6>So here's what we suggest. We should cast it.</v>

327
00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:38.820
You go to your cat if you have one, if you speak cat, just ask them. Tell me.

328
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.810
It's accelerating. Different from just lighting to the ground.

329
00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:47.620
Do you know the famous Cat Jelly toast experiment? No. What's that?

330
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:49.900
It's your cat always lands on its feet, right?

331
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.960
A slice of Jelly toast always lands jelly side down.

332
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:57.460
So you should have trap jelly toast to the back of a cat thinking they might

333
00:20:57.461 --> 00:20:58.480
cancel each other at.

334
00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:03.510
And so there's a research paper on it that says you take the cat with the jelly

335
00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:08.470
toast trapped on his bed, and then you toss it and it falls,

336
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:12.040
and then it stops. Then it hovers above the ground

337
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.920
and just illustrate the land. There's no, no,

338
00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.890
it doesn't land at all because it can't know which way to learn.

339
00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:26.350
It's the jelly toast is fighting the urge to land on its feet.

340
00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.440
This is a well known experiments and the Journal of irreproducible results

341
00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.080
are such a result. Belongs Gary, let's get out of here.

342
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:38.560
Thank you to Neil degrasse Tyson subject. Here's the six.

343
00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.440
You actually have the Hayden Planetarium. Thank you to David Quammen,

344
00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:45.880
Big d and uh, thank you Robert. Thank you jack

345
00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:52.080
<v 0>gravity. And while we're giving thanks, um, thanks to Burton roof, Shea</v>

346
00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:56.560
[inaudible], he's not alive anymore, but uh,

347
00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:00.910
but you can find his story essentially normal in the awesome book medical

348
00:22:00.911 --> 00:22:03.670
detectives, which was published in 1984 by Dutton.

349
00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:09.160
Our sincere thanks to actress Hope Davis and to Sarah Montague and Ellen Horn

350
00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:11.050
for directing hope in the studio.

351
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:14.190
And thanks to Tim Howard and Douglas Smith for, uh,

352
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:19.000
the scoring help with that piece. And lastly, thanks to you for listening.
