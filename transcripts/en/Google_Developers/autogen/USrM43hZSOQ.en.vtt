00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.800
 Carsten Schmidt 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:03.960
 &lt;i&gt;(London)&lt;/i&gt; 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.520
 Thirteen years old 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.760
 For the first time, I really have the practical experience of using a computer. 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.560
 For me it was a decisive moment in my life. 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.600
 No doubt I will embark on a magical journey. 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.840
 I usually work in the park in the morning. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.600
 If you think about the world from the perspective of a programmer 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.960
 Then began to break down the things around me. 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.880
 For example, when I observe in the park, I donâ€™t just see a tree. 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.000
 Also consider what happens inside the trunk 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.720
 How does the sap flow through the whole tree? 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.600
 What is the actual growth process of the branches? 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.360
 Here we only have one line 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.720
 At each specific moment of its growth 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.080
 It will start to fork 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.920
 After rotating 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.040
 You will soon see it develop into a structure 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.200
 If you look at my work from a macro perspective 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.160
 Will find a major feature is 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.880
 I like to use the thinking system of the generation system to solve the problem. 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.320
 Generated design means 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.080
 By defining processes and the rules of interaction of these processes 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.000
 The process of creating a work 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.880
 There is a long history of generating designs in the art world. 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.160
 Generate design as a process 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.600
 Providing a new form like never before 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.360
 In fact, we can use this method to generate the entire building. 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.400
 My proposed DevArt project 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.640
 Will be a design tool that uses the build process 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.520
 It allows people to design objects together 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.640
 Then these objects will be on the 3D printer of the show. 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.880
 Being assembled 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.480
 A key part of this proposal is 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.240
 Questioning "What is art" and the way art is created 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.240
 Authorship is not particularly important 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.480
 The result of his work is the most important 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.360
 By letting people really see the build process from scratch 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.800
 Not just showing them the final object 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.360
 We are able to show the whole process from start to finish 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.240
 The computer is just a silicon component that is powered 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.440
 But this combination is created by humans. 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.080
 One of the most powerful and most powerful technologies 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.320
 After being appointed 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.400
 You will be working side by side with Carsten Schmidt at the Barbican Arts Centre in London. 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.600
 The art of code creation
