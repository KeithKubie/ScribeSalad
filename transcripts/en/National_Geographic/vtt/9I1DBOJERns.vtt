- By now it's March.

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:07.473 align:start size:97% position:3%
Winter's over, the weather's
starting to warm up.

00:00:07.473 --> 00:00:09.242 line:0%
Starting to feel vestiges,

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:10.744 line:0%
signs of heat again,

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:14.981 line:0%
and Pete and I are about
to pass through a doorway.

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:17.116
We're about to step
across a threshold

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:19.518
into a section of the canyon

00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:21.687
that is rumored by
those who know it,

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:23.689 align:start size:88% position:13%
and those who know it
are very small in number

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.426
to be, perhaps,
the most isolated

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.964 align:start size:97% position:3%
and the most pristine
section of the canyon of all.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:33.066
The Western Grand Canyon.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.601
A world of its own,

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:38.872
and we're gonna begin
moving through it.

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:42.575
(water gurgling)

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.713
(grunting)

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:49.182
- [Pete] Stay.

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:54.821 align:start size:81% position:19%
The last source
was dry as a bone.

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:56.322
Anything out there?

00:00:57.456 --> 00:00:59.793
- [Kevin] Bone dry out here.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:06.032
- [Pete] It looks like a
swimming pool from here.

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:06.866
Ooh.

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:09.402
- [Kevin] Not good.

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:13.440
- Bone dry.

00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:19.111
If you don't know
if there's water,

00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:21.847
makes you a little stressed

00:01:21.847 --> 00:01:23.249
to say the least.

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.356 align:start size:88% position:13%
When we started this
walk across Grand Canyon

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:33.592
some 500 miles to
the east of here,

00:01:33.592 --> 00:01:35.261
a friend told us we'd
learn the difference

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:38.364 align:start size:84% position:16%
between what we want
and what we need.

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:42.602 align:start size:94% position:6%
As Kevin and I marched
into Western Grand Canyon,

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.203
we'd felt like we passed

00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:46.973
through a secret passageway

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:50.477 align:start size:88% position:13%
into what some describe
as the Gods' Gate,

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.513
a place very few visit.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.451 line:0%
It's day 45 of walking.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.689
No precipitation in sight,

00:02:03.822 --> 00:02:06.625
even though it's mid-February,

00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:09.195
and we are back in full desert.

00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:14.433
(rock clattering)

00:02:14.433 --> 00:02:16.202
Did you step on that?

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:27.280 align:start size:97% position:3%
Western Grand Canyon is
incredibly remote and immense

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:30.383
and then some.

00:02:31.283 --> 00:02:33.786
And water is extremely scarce.

00:02:34.753 --> 00:02:37.523
That scarcity reminded us daily

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:40.359 align:start size:88% position:13%
that the park and all
the development projects

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:42.762
surrounding its landscape

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:46.366
share this major, often
overlooked obstacle,

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:47.534
limited water.

00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:51.770 align:start size:94% position:6%
Finding water when you're
far from the river,

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.774
sometimes 3,000 feet
above it, isn't easy.

00:02:55.774 --> 00:02:59.912
So we depended on very
thin, very unpredictable

00:02:59.912 --> 00:03:02.448
potholes of rainwater.
- See how deep it is.

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:03.883
- [Kevin] It's pretty nice.

00:03:03.883 --> 00:03:05.985 align:start size:88% position:13%
And we have two syringes
with us this time.

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:08.020
That's like a swimming pool.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.522 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Pete] Just
don't fall in there

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:13.192
'cause there's no bottom in
that thing that I can see.

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:15.595
That's got four liters in it.

00:03:16.762 --> 00:03:20.232
They were the key
to our survival.

00:03:20.232 --> 00:03:22.769 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Kevin] The water challenge
is a day-by-day thing.

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.005 align:start size:84% position:16%
Every morning we
start the search anew.

00:03:28.807 --> 00:03:32.644 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Pete] Just constantly
amazed by the liquid silence

00:03:32.644 --> 00:03:35.114 align:start size:84% position:16%
that seems to
blanket us down here.

00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:37.784
(dramatic music)

00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:45.692
- [Pete] Is there any water?

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:46.793
- [Kevin] No!

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:55.835
- [Pete] You alright?

00:03:57.203 --> 00:03:59.805 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Kevin] You have a
clean pair of underwear?

00:03:59.805 --> 00:04:02.308
- [Pete] Now's not
the time right now

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:03.977
to be joking around.

00:04:05.478 --> 00:04:06.912 align:start size:72% position:28% line:0%
- Did you hear that?

00:04:06.912 --> 00:04:07.946 line:0%
- [Pete] Are you okay?

00:04:07.946 --> 00:04:09.482 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- Yeah. Good.
- I thought you fell.

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:10.749 line:0%
- [Kevin] No.

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:11.917
- [Pete] You scared
the hell out of me.

00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:13.719 size:84% position:42%
- Just the rocks.

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:16.289 align:start position:0%
(mumbles) challenging with 
this pack.

00:04:17.522 --> 00:04:19.692
Pack makes it a little harder.

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:22.928 align:start size:94% position:6%
- [Pete] After hiking
some 12 to 15 miles a day

00:04:22.928 --> 00:04:24.364
for over a month,

00:04:28.734 --> 00:04:33.472
and some days hiking over
20 miles to reach water,

00:04:33.472 --> 00:04:36.042
let's just say it wore us down.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.545
What's up with your feet?

00:04:39.545 --> 00:04:41.381
- They really hurt.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.419
- My body's falling apart.

00:04:49.155 --> 00:04:52.258
- I feel like I'm
in a Swedish sauna.

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:55.561
- Nice, our 50th day,

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:57.630
on the trail of whatever.

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:03.936
It may have been the
brushiest, scratchiest,

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:08.374
longest day, wow.

00:05:09.275 --> 00:05:10.543
At times--

00:05:10.543 --> 00:05:11.844
- I feel like woo-woo.

00:05:11.844 --> 00:05:13.980 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Pete] Kevin
might've even become

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.515
a tad grouchy.

00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:19.285 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Sublime, Obi-Wan Kenobi
style, jiu jitsu wilderness,

00:05:21.887 --> 00:05:25.024 align:start size:84% position:16%
hoo-ha, I'm like
(bleep) that, (bleep) that.

00:05:25.024 --> 00:05:26.359
This just blows.

00:05:27.526 --> 00:05:29.094
- [Pete] Look where
we've come from.

00:05:29.094 --> 00:05:30.329
- [Kevin] Yeah, look
where we've come from,

00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:31.464
(bleep)ing nowhere!

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:33.466
(audience laughing)

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:37.403
- [Pete] Our encounters
with cactus didn't help.

00:05:38.904 --> 00:05:40.540 size:88% position:56%
I'll get em.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.710 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Kevin] I fell
into a barrel cactus,

00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:50.382 align:start size:97% position:3%
and now I got all these weird
lumps on my arm. (grunts)

00:05:50.382 --> 00:05:52.885
OK, let's put the camera away.

00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:01.627
(audience groans)

00:06:02.662 --> 00:06:03.962
Whoo, they hurt.

00:06:03.962 --> 00:06:05.365
- [Pete] Oh, God.

00:06:06.465 --> 00:06:10.402 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Kevin] Grand Canyon
bites literally.

00:06:10.402 --> 00:06:12.305
- Made my calf go numb.

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:14.439
Ooh!

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:15.675
I got ya, I got ya on the spot.

00:06:15.675 --> 00:06:17.809 align:start position:0%
- [Kevin] I really don't like 
this.

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:20.746
- [Pete] Physical
challenges aside,

00:06:20.746 --> 00:06:21.581
careful,

00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:25.684 align:start size:84% position:16%
we discovered a
solitude and stillness

00:06:25.684 --> 00:06:28.087 align:start size:84% position:16%
that we've experienced
nowhere else.

00:06:28.087 --> 00:06:31.290
As we approached the end
of the park and our walk

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.226
we discovered and heard

00:06:34.593 --> 00:06:36.562
a different Grand Canyon.

00:06:36.562 --> 00:06:39.665
(helicopter whirring)

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:45.738
A tourist boom has
followed the success

00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:48.107 align:start size:84% position:16%
of the recent
Skywalk development

00:06:48.107 --> 00:06:49.441
on the Hualapai reservation

00:06:49.441 --> 00:06:52.277
on the southwest
corner of the park.

00:06:52.277 --> 00:06:54.246
Over a decade ago,

00:06:54.246 --> 00:06:56.482 align:start size:84% position:16%
the FAA granted
the approval to fly

00:06:56.482 --> 00:06:59.785 align:start size:84% position:16%
and land helicopters
below the rim,

00:06:59.785 --> 00:07:02.254
what is now called
Helicopter Alley,

00:07:02.254 --> 00:07:04.990
located on the border
of the national park.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.994 align:start size:97% position:3%
It is now one of the busiest
heliports in the world.

00:07:08.994 --> 00:07:11.931
(helicopter whirring)

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:13.099
- This wave of

00:07:15.467 --> 00:07:18.304 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
industrialized
high volume tourism

00:07:19.371 --> 00:07:21.606 line:0%
coming to the national park.

00:07:21.606 --> 00:07:23.509
The acceleration of
this kind of activity

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:25.344
has been incredible.

00:07:25.344 --> 00:07:28.147
- Economic enterprise
of these tribal nations

00:07:28.147 --> 00:07:30.349 line:0%
is important for them.

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:32.384 line:0%
They basically starved
for a hundred years,

00:07:32.384 --> 00:07:34.453 line:0%
now they have something.

00:07:34.453 --> 00:07:37.557
(deep rhythmic music)

00:07:41.726 --> 00:07:44.163 line:0%
- The helicopters are a mess.

00:07:45.197 --> 00:07:48.034 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
There's just
constant air traffic,

00:07:49.201 --> 00:07:51.537
and it affects the wildlife.

00:07:52.471 --> 00:07:54.307
We're a hunting tribe.

00:07:55.841 --> 00:07:57.276
- Propagate forward 15 years,

00:07:57.276 --> 00:07:59.544
is there anything left here?

00:07:59.544 --> 00:08:03.415 align:start size:84% position:16%
Have we really done
what we set out to do,

00:08:03.415 --> 00:08:06.385 align:start size:84% position:16%
what Teddy Roosevelt
set out to do,

00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:09.655 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
in letting mainly
the rest of the world

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.192 line:0%
come fly over Grand
Canyon National Park

00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:17.363 align:start position:0% line:0%
and negate the laws that we
created to protect these places.

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:20.633
- So this amazes me,

00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:24.436 line:0%
because this is
our national park.

00:08:24.436 --> 00:08:27.540 line:0%
And I think what amazes
me most about this

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.409 line:0%
is that 10 years ago
this didn't exist.

00:08:31.409 --> 00:08:33.112
Now this, I want to be clear,

00:08:33.112 --> 00:08:35.981
this is something I
worked very hard on,

00:08:35.981 --> 00:08:38.417
this is a photographic merge.

00:08:39.618 --> 00:08:41.787
I went out there,
I spent all day,

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:43.021
this was July 9th,

00:08:43.021 --> 00:08:45.224 align:start size:88% position:13%
I took a picture of
every single helicopter

00:08:45.224 --> 00:08:47.459
that flew through my frame.

00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:49.528
In an eight-hour period,

00:08:49.528 --> 00:08:52.364
I counted 363 helicopters,

00:08:52.364 --> 00:08:53.966
and then all those that
flew through my frame,

00:08:53.966 --> 00:08:55.367
some flew above the frame,

00:08:55.367 --> 00:08:58.871 align:start size:88% position:13%
some flew illegally
into the park air space,

00:08:58.871 --> 00:09:00.038
but I stitched them together

00:09:00.038 --> 00:09:02.508
just to show what the impact is

00:09:02.508 --> 00:09:05.277 align:start size:97% position:3%
of a day's worth of
traffic inside Grand Canyon

00:09:05.277 --> 00:09:06.779
in a place that didn't exist.

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:09.048
And they're landing on
the Hualapai reservation,

00:09:09.048 --> 00:09:12.084
and the Hualapai deserve to
have viability, of course,

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:14.653
but it's raising
the question on,

00:09:14.653 --> 00:09:16.088 align:start size:84% position:16%
we just want to raise
the questions on

00:09:16.088 --> 00:09:17.890
how do we find that balance

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:21.827
between what's too
much and not enough.

00:09:21.827 --> 00:09:23.695 align:start size:84% position:16%
I was curious about
how this works,

00:09:23.695 --> 00:09:25.163
what's the experience like,

00:09:25.163 --> 00:09:26.732
I actually went to Las Vegas,

00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:29.168
the proximity to Las Vegas
is driving a lot of this,

00:09:29.168 --> 00:09:30.702
it's a half-hour flight.

00:09:30.702 --> 00:09:33.573
They'll pick you up in
your hotel with a limo,

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:35.774 align:start size:94% position:6%
you'll do a 10-minute
limo ride to the airport,

00:09:35.774 --> 00:09:38.944
you do a 22-minute ride
out to the Grand Canyon,

00:09:38.944 --> 00:09:41.113
you come have a small
bottle of champagne

00:09:41.113 --> 00:09:42.348
and a yogurt

00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:44.616
and by the time,
when I was there,

00:09:44.616 --> 00:09:46.051
it was a crowded day,

00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:48.353 align:start size:94% position:6%
there were 16 helicopters
parked around me.

00:09:48.353 --> 00:09:50.289
When I was trying
to have my yogurt,

00:09:50.289 --> 00:09:51.757
four helicopters
flew over my head

00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:53.092
and blew me with yogurt.

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:55.828
(audience laughing)

00:09:55.828 --> 00:09:57.763
Then we were raced back
into the helicopter,

00:09:57.763 --> 00:09:59.898
28-minute flight back,

00:09:59.898 --> 00:10:00.865
limo back to the hotel,

00:10:00.865 --> 00:10:02.335
and I was ready to have brunch

00:10:02.335 --> 00:10:06.705
and check my Grand Canyon
box that I had done it

00:10:06.705 --> 00:10:08.740
by 11:30 in the morning.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.743
Now I understand access,

00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:13.045 align:start size:97% position:3%
I understand some people
don't live near Grand Canyon,

00:10:13.045 --> 00:10:15.514 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I understand that
nobody's gonna be dumb enough

00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:18.150
to do a walk like
Kevin and I did.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.754 align:start size:84% position:16%
But it is remarkable
to me to think

00:10:21.754 --> 00:10:23.255
how we look at wilderness,

00:10:23.255 --> 00:10:25.457
and we're trying to
raise the question,

00:10:25.457 --> 00:10:27.359 align:start size:84% position:16%
how do we appreciate
these places,

00:10:27.359 --> 00:10:30.295
and this may not be
the way to appreciate

00:10:30.295 --> 00:10:33.766
its great asset like
silence and humility.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.537 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, and it's hard,
really, to sort of

00:10:38.537 --> 00:10:39.939
express in words.

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:45.977
The violence of the contrast

00:10:45.977 --> 00:10:50.182
between the noise that's
generated by these machines

00:10:50.182 --> 00:10:54.453
and the tranquility of
the landscape itself,

00:10:54.453 --> 00:10:58.457
as you move though this
section of the park.

00:10:58.457 --> 00:11:01.059
And I just want to
take a moment to say

00:11:01.059 --> 00:11:02.061
as a writer,

00:11:03.495 --> 00:11:05.531
what a privilege it is to
work with a photographer

00:11:05.531 --> 00:11:08.033
who's capable of
capturing an image

00:11:08.033 --> 00:11:10.269 align:start size:84% position:16%
like the one that just
preceded this one.

00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:12.504
I think it's such
an amazing thing

00:11:12.504 --> 00:11:16.641 align:start size:97% position:3%
to somehow be able to layer
information so densely

00:11:16.641 --> 00:11:18.977
that you can communicate
it in a single instant

00:11:18.977 --> 00:11:22.715 align:start size:88% position:13%
what might take me pages
upon pages to relay.

00:11:24.616 --> 00:11:28.788
Now that contrast is really
harsh as you move across

00:11:29.955 --> 00:11:32.858
the westernmost section
of the Grand Canyon.

00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:34.993
And the thing about the
canyon, too, is that

00:11:34.993 --> 00:11:36.695
you'd think that the
further out you get

00:11:36.695 --> 00:11:38.597
and the closer to
the end you get,

00:11:38.597 --> 00:11:41.266 align:start size:94% position:6%
that it might begin to
kinda let you down easily,

00:11:41.266 --> 00:11:44.369 align:start size:84% position:16%
but that's definitely
not the case.

00:11:44.369 --> 00:11:46.204
I never knew that
it was possible

00:11:46.204 --> 00:11:49.307
for cactuses to grow
in the form of forests,

00:11:49.307 --> 00:11:50.276
but they do.

00:11:50.276 --> 00:11:52.344
(audience chuckling)

00:11:52.344 --> 00:11:53.745 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's very difficult
and unpleasant

00:11:53.745 --> 00:11:55.414 align:start size:84% position:16%
to move through
this sort of thing.

00:11:55.414 --> 00:11:58.049
It's also challenging
out there in the west

00:11:58.049 --> 00:12:00.653
to realize how much up and down

00:12:02.354 --> 00:12:04.590 align:start size:88% position:13%
descending and ascending
is demanded of you,

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:07.893 align:start size:88% position:13%
tens of thousands of
feet each and every day.

00:12:07.893 --> 00:12:09.194
You need to climb
and then descend

00:12:09.194 --> 00:12:11.196
in order to keep
moving laterally

00:12:11.196 --> 00:12:13.798
downstream, down canyon.

00:12:13.798 --> 00:12:15.234
Then you need, too, to perform

00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:16.768
a level of rock climbing

00:12:16.768 --> 00:12:18.169
that I'm really not capable of,

00:12:18.169 --> 00:12:20.406 align:start size:84% position:16%
technical moves
that lie far beyond

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:22.808 align:start size:97% position:3%
my ability and exist
outside of my comfort zone,

00:12:22.808 --> 00:12:25.277 align:start size:94% position:6%
and then for whatever
reason, we also found that

00:12:25.277 --> 00:12:27.446
we're seeing more
and more animals

00:12:27.446 --> 00:12:30.548 align:start size:97% position:3%
on this westernmost section
of the Grand Canyon.

00:12:30.548 --> 00:12:32.685 align:start size:84% position:16%
Unpleasant animals,
animals that I was not

00:12:32.685 --> 00:12:34.520
super into, I have to say.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.523
(audience laughing)

00:12:39.157 --> 00:12:40.693
- Sorry.

00:12:40.693 --> 00:12:44.864
Yeah, there are some critters
that like to bite down there.

00:12:46.298 --> 00:12:48.867
But we generally
leave them alone.

00:12:48.867 --> 00:12:50.702
Another interesting thing for me

00:12:50.702 --> 00:12:52.237
when we got to this part
of the western canyon,

00:12:52.237 --> 00:12:54.006
a lot of people, if you've
been down the Grand Canyon

00:12:54.006 --> 00:12:55.140
by a boat,

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:56.074
a lot of the rafting trip

00:12:56.074 --> 00:12:57.442
ends in this part of the canyon.

00:12:57.442 --> 00:12:59.778 align:start size:88% position:13%
We're at about mile 250
on the river,

00:12:59.778 --> 00:13:02.681 align:start size:84% position:16%
most ship you out either
on a night rift

00:13:02.681 --> 00:13:05.851 align:start size:94% position:6%
or you hike out or you
can take a helicopter out.

00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:08.020
But these sections
here were daunting,

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.988 align:start size:84% position:16%
we're climbing 3,000
feet to the river

00:13:09.988 --> 00:13:11.423
to try to document things,

00:13:11.423 --> 00:13:12.891
we're coming 3,000 feet up,

00:13:12.891 --> 00:13:15.360
but it amazed me is that

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.397
despite the challenges
and the rigor of this,

00:13:18.397 --> 00:13:21.633 align:start size:97% position:3%
is that we're coming up
these ancient Anasazi routes.

00:13:21.633 --> 00:13:23.034
This was a route that

00:13:23.034 --> 00:13:24.636 align:start size:88% position:13%
I would've never have
guessed we could get out

00:13:24.636 --> 00:13:26.371 align:start size:84% position:16%
and get back up onto
the sanup level,

00:13:26.371 --> 00:13:27.706
3,000 feet above the river,

00:13:27.706 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start size:97% position:3%
but when when we
approached this little tiny

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.343
break in the rock at the top,

00:13:31.343 --> 00:13:33.011
which I'm standing on,

00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:34.145
you come around the corner

00:13:34.145 --> 00:13:36.081
and you see a tiny pictograph,

00:13:36.081 --> 00:13:37.449
and then you come
a little closer,

00:13:37.449 --> 00:13:39.751 align:start size:88% position:13%
and you see a cedar
log that has been there

00:13:39.751 --> 00:13:42.154 align:start size:97% position:3%
with no other logs, no other
trees anywhere in sight,

00:13:42.154 --> 00:13:44.623
it's been there for
probably 800 years.

00:13:44.623 --> 00:13:47.125
And you can see where it had
been chipped a little bit,

00:13:47.125 --> 00:13:49.895 align:start size:84% position:16%
where they had notched
it into this spot

00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:50.796
so they could climb up.

00:13:50.796 --> 00:13:51.997
It's now since fallen

00:13:51.997 --> 00:13:53.866 align:start size:84% position:16%
and we have to perform
a climbing move,

00:13:53.866 --> 00:13:55.333
but it's remarkable.

00:13:55.333 --> 00:13:57.169 align:start size:97% position:3%
And then as we move up these
ancient Anasazi routes,

00:13:57.169 --> 00:13:58.903 align:start size:88% position:13%
we've conditioned
ourselves a little bit,

00:13:58.903 --> 00:14:00.472
where we're moving now at night.

00:14:00.472 --> 00:14:02.007
We're realizing that
we can keep moving,

00:14:02.007 --> 00:14:03.242
we can make more miles,

00:14:03.242 --> 00:14:04.910
we have to make more
miles here because

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.779 align:start size:94% position:6%
the water sources are
further and further apart.

00:14:07.779 --> 00:14:09.648 align:start size:84% position:16%
Sometimes when they
do show up, of course,

00:14:09.648 --> 00:14:11.683 align:start size:81% position:19%
they're deeper
than we want them.

00:14:11.683 --> 00:14:14.119
But we also realize it
has changed our bodies.

00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:15.821 align:start size:88% position:13%
We've not only
psychologically changed

00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:18.957 align:start size:94% position:6%
on some level, but
physically we've changed.

00:14:18.957 --> 00:14:20.592 align:start size:84% position:16%
We've gotten more used
to carrying weight,

00:14:20.592 --> 00:14:21.726
we've gotten more nimble,

00:14:21.726 --> 00:14:23.428 align:start size:84% position:16%
we've gotten a
little more balanced.

00:14:23.428 --> 00:14:26.465 align:start size:88% position:13%
And apparently I lost
my beer belly somewhere.

00:14:26.465 --> 00:14:28.733
(audience laughing)

00:14:28.733 --> 00:14:30.702
Part of this is due
to the diet we're on,

00:14:30.702 --> 00:14:33.739
we're carrying roughly
2,000 calories a day

00:14:33.739 --> 00:14:35.740 align:start size:81% position:19%
and we're probably
burning 5,000.

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.177
I lost 30 pounds on the trip.

00:14:39.511 --> 00:14:42.047 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Yeah, it's no
overstatement to say that

00:14:42.047 --> 00:14:46.551
the canyon is transforming
and reshaping our bodies.

00:14:46.551 --> 00:14:49.454
It's also transforming
and reshaping our minds

00:14:49.454 --> 00:14:51.290
and our sensibilities.

00:14:52.424 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I think it's fair
to say, too, that

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.397
I'm 51 years old, you're
four years younger than me.

00:14:58.397 --> 00:14:59.564
- Something like that.

00:14:59.564 --> 00:15:00.866
14 years younger.

00:15:00.866 --> 00:15:02.700
(audience laughing)

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:03.935
I'm gonna move us up this slide,

00:15:03.935 --> 00:15:05.104
'cause I get gross
looking at that.

00:15:05.104 --> 00:15:08.707
(audience laughing)

00:15:08.707 --> 00:15:09.641
- At this point,

00:15:09.641 --> 00:15:11.276
we are probably in what we will

00:15:11.276 --> 00:15:13.479 align:start size:81% position:19%
later look back
upon and recognize

00:15:13.479 --> 00:15:16.048
as the shape of our lives.

00:15:16.048 --> 00:15:18.149
And we're also seeing
signs that the canyon

00:15:18.149 --> 00:15:21.186
is about to start letting us go.

00:15:21.186 --> 00:15:23.956
Because it's out
here in the West

00:15:25.424 --> 00:15:26.759 align:start size:84% position:16%
that the Grand
Canyon National Park

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:27.693
comes to an end.

00:15:27.693 --> 00:15:29.627
It's a testament

00:15:29.627 --> 00:15:30.963
to the remoteness

00:15:32.697 --> 00:15:35.333
and just how pristine
this place actually is.

00:15:35.333 --> 00:15:37.635
That when you get to
the far end of this,

00:15:37.635 --> 00:15:39.971 align:start size:97% position:3%
the crown jewel of American's
national park system,

00:15:39.971 --> 00:15:42.140
the only thing that
marks the border

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.043
are three metal stakes,

00:15:45.577 --> 00:15:47.712
driven into the sage brush

00:15:47.712 --> 00:15:50.682 align:start size:84% position:16%
in what feels like
the middle of nowhere.

00:15:50.682 --> 00:15:52.450
- So that's our final step

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:54.219
in Grand Canyon National Park.

00:15:54.219 --> 00:15:56.321 align:start size:94% position:6%
But of course, boundaries
weren't always drawn

00:15:56.321 --> 00:15:58.723
by geography or watersheds.

00:15:58.723 --> 00:16:01.259 align:start size:88% position:13%
So we still had 3,500
vertical feet to descend

00:16:01.259 --> 00:16:02.594
through Pearce Canyon,

00:16:02.594 --> 00:16:05.363
where the actual canyon itself

00:16:05.363 --> 00:16:08.167
lets you out through
this gentle release

00:16:08.167 --> 00:16:09.735
out into the desert.

00:16:09.735 --> 00:16:11.937
And we come down and we
blow up our pack rafts,

00:16:11.937 --> 00:16:13.538 align:start size:84% position:16%
which are these
two-pound little items

00:16:13.538 --> 00:16:16.809
that are like paddling
a pool toy with a Q-Tip.

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:20.579
(audience laughing)

00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:22.814 align:start size:94% position:6%
I probably could blow
Kevin and knock him over,

00:16:22.814 --> 00:16:24.449
so it's a little bit tenuous,

00:16:24.449 --> 00:16:25.717
but to be honest,

00:16:25.717 --> 00:16:27.518
this was probably
the most luxurious

00:16:27.518 --> 00:16:29.922
three miles left of the trip.

00:16:30.855 --> 00:16:32.524
This was we're out of the park,

00:16:32.524 --> 00:16:33.992
the walk is complete.

00:16:33.992 --> 00:16:37.195
So just three weeks
ago in November,

00:16:37.195 --> 00:16:39.798
we both emerged on Pearce Ferry

00:16:39.798 --> 00:16:43.001
and one of us had
completed the walk.

00:16:43.001 --> 00:16:44.202
I say one of us because

00:16:44.202 --> 00:16:47.505
we decided to do
this walk as a team

00:16:47.505 --> 00:16:49.641
and to do something unusual.

00:16:49.641 --> 00:16:51.376
One of us is the 34th person

00:16:51.376 --> 00:16:53.212 align:start size:84% position:16%
to ever walk through
Grand Canyon.

00:16:53.212 --> 00:16:55.914
But we realized that this
isn't about walking a park,

00:16:55.914 --> 00:16:57.449
and it's not about
being on a list.

00:16:57.449 --> 00:16:59.083
So the other one of us

00:16:59.083 --> 00:17:01.986 align:start size:88% position:13%
floated a hundred yards,
only know between us,

00:17:01.986 --> 00:17:04.556 align:start size:84% position:16%
and left that section
undone because

00:17:04.556 --> 00:17:07.058 align:start size:84% position:16%
the reality is, this
place is too big,

00:17:07.058 --> 00:17:08.827
it's too grand, it's too vast,

00:17:08.827 --> 00:17:11.163
it's too remarkable to know,

00:17:12.464 --> 00:17:15.867 align:start size:88% position:13%
to conquer, to
understand with one line

00:17:15.867 --> 00:17:18.403
even by foot through it.

00:17:18.403 --> 00:17:20.405 align:start size:81% position:19%
It would take more
than a lifetime

00:17:20.405 --> 00:17:22.340
to understand this place.

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:23.575 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It does take more
than a lifetime

00:17:23.575 --> 00:17:24.742
to understand this place.

00:17:24.742 --> 00:17:26.778
It is complex, it is enormous.

00:17:26.778 --> 00:17:29.047
But that doesn't mean that
we can't apply ourselves

00:17:29.047 --> 00:17:30.382
to the question,

00:17:31.516 --> 00:17:34.620 align:start size:84% position:16%
what did it mean,
what did it teach us.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:37.522
And when Pete and
I sat down together

00:17:37.522 --> 00:17:39.892
and we grappled with that,

00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:43.395 align:start size:84% position:16%
we realized that
there were four things

00:17:43.395 --> 00:17:44.596
that the canyon did.

00:17:44.596 --> 00:17:46.298 align:start size:81% position:19%
They're really
sort of four gifts

00:17:46.298 --> 00:17:47.599
that the canyon gave us

00:17:47.599 --> 00:17:49.768
in the form of insight.

00:17:49.768 --> 00:17:54.639
And tonight, we're gonna
share those four with you.

00:17:54.639 --> 00:17:56.708 align:start size:88% position:13%
The first of them has
to do with the fact that

00:17:56.708 --> 00:17:59.545 align:start size:81% position:19%
this place is a
national treasure.

00:18:00.879 --> 00:18:03.648 align:start size:97% position:3%
And its assets are normally
framed and described

00:18:03.648 --> 00:18:07.519 align:start size:97% position:3%
and articulated in terms that
are fundamentally visual.

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:08.687
Think about it for a moment.

00:18:08.687 --> 00:18:09.988
If you've been to the canyon

00:18:09.988 --> 00:18:11.490
or if you've never
been to the canyon

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:15.494
but you're speaking about or
thinking about the canyon,

00:18:15.494 --> 00:18:17.663 align:start size:81% position:19%
the vocabulary
that you reach for

00:18:17.663 --> 00:18:19.831
has to do with the
color of the light,

00:18:19.831 --> 00:18:21.466
the texture of the rock,

00:18:21.466 --> 00:18:24.302
the lines of the canyon itself.

00:18:24.302 --> 00:18:26.138
The odd and unexpected

00:18:27.071 --> 00:18:28.439
thing that Pete and I discovered

00:18:28.439 --> 00:18:30.542
that amounted to a
kind of epiphany,

00:18:30.542 --> 00:18:32.411 align:start size:84% position:16%
was that we gradually
began to realize

00:18:32.411 --> 00:18:36.981 align:start size:97% position:3%
at some point, some
indeterminable point between

00:18:36.981 --> 00:18:38.683 size:88% position:44%
Lees Ferry and the
Grand Wash Cliffs,

00:18:38.683 --> 00:18:41.186
we realized that the greatest,

00:18:43.488 --> 00:18:46.891 align:start size:88% position:13%
least appreciated and
most vulnerable treasure

00:18:46.891 --> 00:18:49.827 align:start size:84% position:16%
that Grand Canyon
National Park contains

00:18:49.827 --> 00:18:51.930
is not visual, it's auditory.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.531
Because it is out there

00:18:53.531 --> 00:18:55.033
that you are able to encounter

00:18:55.033 --> 00:18:56.535
a level of silence

00:18:57.602 --> 00:18:59.637
that you can find nowhere else.

00:18:59.637 --> 00:19:02.207 align:start size:88% position:13%
Why is that precious and
why does that matter?

00:19:02.207 --> 00:19:03.742
Among other reasons
because it stands

00:19:03.742 --> 00:19:06.377
in such profound contrast

00:19:06.377 --> 00:19:07.879
to everything that surrounds us

00:19:07.879 --> 00:19:10.715
in the world beyond the rims.

00:19:10.715 --> 00:19:15.019 align:start size:88% position:13%
A world that is governed
and defined by noise.

00:19:15.019 --> 00:19:17.522
A world whose noise prevents us

00:19:17.522 --> 00:19:20.492
from articulating and framing

00:19:20.492 --> 00:19:23.094 align:start size:84% position:16%
and contemplating
things that we don't

00:19:23.094 --> 00:19:27.266 align:start size:97% position:3%
have the time or the
attention span to appreciate.

00:19:28.533 --> 00:19:30.335
And so that is one of
the greatest things

00:19:30.335 --> 00:19:31.603
that the park has to offer,

00:19:31.603 --> 00:19:34.005
and it's one of the
things that we feel

00:19:34.005 --> 00:19:36.975
is most necessary to protect.

00:19:36.975 --> 00:19:39.110
- The second lesson
we learned is that

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:41.246
whatever happens on the rim,

00:19:41.246 --> 00:19:42.947 align:start size:84% position:16%
we often think that's
a separate world

00:19:42.947 --> 00:19:44.916
from the canyon itself.

00:19:44.916 --> 00:19:46.918
And the reality is,
no matter how you see

00:19:46.918 --> 00:19:48.086
or enjoy the park,

00:19:48.086 --> 00:19:49.888
if you come to the Skywalk,

00:19:49.888 --> 00:19:51.222 align:start size:84% position:16%
this is in the western
side of the park

00:19:51.222 --> 00:19:52.624
that now gets a
million visitors,

00:19:52.624 --> 00:19:54.325 align:start size:88% position:13%
if you come to the South
Rim or the North Rim

00:19:54.325 --> 00:19:56.427
or you're two hikers
that come and do it,

00:19:56.427 --> 00:19:58.596
whatever happens on the rim

00:19:58.596 --> 00:20:02.033
or whatever small impact
it may seem on the rim

00:20:02.033 --> 00:20:05.870
is directly related to what
happens inside the park.

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:08.106
It is this remarkable rock maze

00:20:08.106 --> 00:20:09.841
that is all interconnected.

00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:11.777
This little spring here

00:20:12.978 --> 00:20:16.348
flows out of the rock
3,000 feet downstream,

00:20:16.348 --> 00:20:19.116 align:start size:84% position:16%
about 40 miles
from the South Rim.

00:20:19.116 --> 00:20:21.419
And it just suddenly emerges.

00:20:21.419 --> 00:20:22.854
But it's directly linked

00:20:22.854 --> 00:20:25.290
to the water table
on the South Rim.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:26.992
And biologists say that

00:20:26.992 --> 00:20:29.027 align:start size:81% position:19%
the ecosystem that
survives here,

00:20:29.027 --> 00:20:30.629 align:start size:88% position:13%
they say the ecosystems
in Grand Canyon

00:20:30.629 --> 00:20:32.931
are some of the greatest
in all our national parks.

00:20:32.931 --> 00:20:35.166
It survives in some
places nowhere else.

00:20:35.166 --> 00:20:36.968 align:start size:84% position:16%
You find endangered
species of fish

00:20:36.968 --> 00:20:40.305
and creatures that they
are just learning exist.

00:20:40.305 --> 00:20:43.375
So it is entirely
connected, the rim,

00:20:44.476 --> 00:20:47.045 align:start size:84% position:16%
to these small
secret worlds below.

00:20:47.045 --> 00:20:48.346
- Incredibly complicated

00:20:48.346 --> 00:20:53.017
and incredibly delicate,
interconnected matrix.

00:20:53.017 --> 00:20:55.286 align:start size:88% position:13%
The third gift, the
third gift is something

00:20:55.286 --> 00:20:58.189
that you encounter
at the moment when

00:20:58.189 --> 00:21:00.458
you realize that your first
impression of this place

00:21:00.458 --> 00:21:02.693
when you move into it and
you're unfamiliar with it,

00:21:02.693 --> 00:21:04.529
the impression that it is empty,

00:21:04.529 --> 00:21:07.465
that it is devoid
of human beings

00:21:07.465 --> 00:21:09.300
is fundamentally wrong.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.269 align:start size:88% position:13%
Because as you move
through this landscape,

00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:13.838 align:start size:81% position:19%
as you move across
the arc of days

00:21:13.838 --> 00:21:16.208
and weeks and months
and entire seasons,

00:21:16.208 --> 00:21:18.677 align:start size:94% position:6%
as you spend an entire
year inside of this place,

00:21:18.677 --> 00:21:20.211
you begin to realize

00:21:20.211 --> 00:21:23.214
that it is a space that was
once filled with people,

00:21:23.214 --> 00:21:25.283
people who existed inside of it

00:21:25.283 --> 00:21:28.420 align:start size:97% position:3%
and called it home for
tens of thousands of years,

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.955
and the evidence
of their presence

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:32.023
is absolutely everywhere.

00:21:32.023 --> 00:21:33.591
It exists on the ground,

00:21:33.591 --> 00:21:35.894 align:start size:84% position:16%
you can see the tools
and the artifacts

00:21:35.894 --> 00:21:37.428
that they left behind,

00:21:37.428 --> 00:21:39.965 align:start size:84% position:16%
you could see places
that they lived,

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:42.367 align:start size:81% position:19%
the homes that
they dwelt inside,

00:21:42.367 --> 00:21:45.170
and at very special and
very secret locations

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.439 align:start size:88% position:13%
that you are
privileged to encounter

00:21:47.439 --> 00:21:49.473
only if you are
very, very lucky,

00:21:49.473 --> 00:21:52.076
you may see on the rock itself,

00:21:52.076 --> 00:21:54.112
imprinted on the rock itself

00:21:54.112 --> 00:21:57.082 align:start size:94% position:6%
a vision that these people
created which suggests

00:21:57.082 --> 00:22:00.018
something about how they
understood their position

00:22:00.018 --> 00:22:02.587
in the universe itself.

00:22:02.587 --> 00:22:06.558 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Their art, which you
can find in certain areas,

00:22:06.558 --> 00:22:07.758
I want to give you
a little description

00:22:07.758 --> 00:22:10.261
of how remarkable this piece is.

00:22:10.261 --> 00:22:11.596
I can't tell you where it is,

00:22:11.596 --> 00:22:13.998
I was given permission
to share it with you,

00:22:13.998 --> 00:22:16.835 align:start size:88% position:13%
but this a
4,000-year-old painting

00:22:18.069 --> 00:22:19.870
that's called a polychrome.

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:22.007
Basically has four colors on it,

00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:22.841
there's quite a few
of them scattered

00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:23.975
throughout Grand Canyon,

00:22:23.975 --> 00:22:25.810
people aren't exactly sure of

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:28.112
who did it or how they did it.

00:22:28.112 --> 00:22:30.448
And then there's the question of

00:22:30.448 --> 00:22:31.382
where did they go,

00:22:31.382 --> 00:22:32.917
where did all these people,

00:22:32.917 --> 00:22:37.255
this vast population that
lived inside Grand Canyon.

00:22:37.255 --> 00:22:38.856
And the truth is,

00:22:38.856 --> 00:22:40.392
they haven't gone anywhere.

00:22:40.392 --> 00:22:41.893
They're right here,

00:22:41.893 --> 00:22:43.528
they're living all around
Grand Canyon National Park.

00:22:43.528 --> 00:22:44.796 align:start size:84% position:16%
There's nine Native
American tribes

00:22:44.796 --> 00:22:48.133
that live around Grand
Canyon National Park.

00:22:48.133 --> 00:22:50.702 align:start size:97% position:3%
And they're active and
engaged in all sides of it.

00:22:50.702 --> 00:22:52.104
They're active on all fronts

00:22:52.104 --> 00:22:54.372 align:start size:97% position:3%
of the development pressures
that are happening.

00:22:54.372 --> 00:22:55.874
Some are for it and
actively involved

00:22:55.874 --> 00:22:57.776
in the economics of it,

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:02.280
some are opposed to it and
fighting for their lives

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:06.485 align:start size:97% position:3%
and trying to keep what
they consider sacred alive.

00:23:06.485 --> 00:23:10.555 align:start size:94% position:6%
And it is very complex
and important to note that

00:23:11.723 --> 00:23:15.193
what's happening now
is driving a lot of it,

00:23:15.193 --> 00:23:17.795 align:start size:97% position:3%
it's pitting certain tribes
against other tribes,

00:23:17.795 --> 00:23:19.164
this is where the tram would go,

00:23:19.164 --> 00:23:22.333
this is where you would
have 10,000 people a day

00:23:22.333 --> 00:23:24.936
coming down to a food emporium.

00:23:24.936 --> 00:23:29.107
And it's as complex as the
geology of the canyon itself.

00:23:31.208 --> 00:23:35.113
- Which brings us to the
fourth and final gift.

00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:39.317
You think about
the Grand Canyon,

00:23:40.719 --> 00:23:42.420 align:start size:94% position:6%
these sorts of things
are incredibly important,

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:45.891
the politics, the issues
that surround this place,

00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:48.193
the fundamental questions
about environmentalism

00:23:48.193 --> 00:23:51.762
and preservation
and conservation.

00:23:51.762 --> 00:23:54.666 align:start size:84% position:16%
But ultimately,
you come up against

00:23:57.535 --> 00:23:58.970 align:start size:84% position:16%
an idea that's very,
very different,

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.838
which is that,

00:24:00.838 --> 00:24:02.407
and it's really not an idea

00:24:02.407 --> 00:24:03.608
as much as a possibility,

00:24:03.608 --> 00:24:07.845
it's the possibility
expressed in the notion

00:24:07.845 --> 00:24:09.013
that what this place contains

00:24:09.013 --> 00:24:10.849
that may be the most important

00:24:10.849 --> 00:24:13.150
resides in an opportunity.

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:14.418
It's an opportunity that we have

00:24:14.418 --> 00:24:17.988
when we move into
these landscapes.

00:24:17.988 --> 00:24:19.491
And the opportunity has to do,

00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:21.560
not with the land itself,

00:24:23.094 --> 00:24:24.729
not with the threats
that may hang over,

00:24:24.729 --> 00:24:27.465 align:start size:94% position:6%
the debates about
whether those things that

00:24:27.465 --> 00:24:30.334
are being proposed
are right or wrong.

00:24:30.334 --> 00:24:32.804
It's about the connections
that happen between people

00:24:32.804 --> 00:24:35.773
when they come to
our national parks.

00:24:35.773 --> 00:24:37.642 align:start size:81% position:19%
Ultimately, the
story of our parks

00:24:37.642 --> 00:24:39.277
is the story of people,

00:24:39.277 --> 00:24:41.645 align:start size:97% position:3%
it's the story of experiences
that we have in them,

00:24:41.645 --> 00:24:44.049
it's the story of friendship.

00:24:44.049 --> 00:24:46.618 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's also a story
about how friendship

00:24:46.618 --> 00:24:49.521 align:start size:84% position:16%
matures and blossoms
into community

00:24:50.688 --> 00:24:53.258
and how community
becomes family.

00:24:56.761 --> 00:24:58.163
And when you try to
wrap your head around

00:24:58.163 --> 00:24:59.897
all of those things,

00:24:59.897 --> 00:25:01.333
the connectivity,

00:25:02.734 --> 00:25:06.571 align:start size:94% position:6%
the idea that silence
may be the most important

00:25:06.571 --> 00:25:07.906
treasure of all,

00:25:09.107 --> 00:25:11.142
the notion that the
connections between

00:25:11.142 --> 00:25:13.744
human beings may
express themselves

00:25:13.744 --> 00:25:15.780
and come to matter more
than the land itself.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.549 align:start size:88% position:13%
You find yourself coming
up against an idea

00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:20.885
that the park is greater

00:25:20.885 --> 00:25:23.054
than the sum of its parts.

00:25:24.722 --> 00:25:26.124
And I think that's an idea that

00:25:26.124 --> 00:25:28.192
Pete has really sort of

00:25:28.192 --> 00:25:29.861
brought to the fore beautifully

00:25:29.861 --> 00:25:33.131
in the final video that we'd
like to share with you tonight.

00:25:33.131 --> 00:25:35.566
- [Pete] When we
started this walk,

00:25:35.566 --> 00:25:38.503
we had no idea what
we'd gotten into

00:25:38.503 --> 00:25:41.740 align:start size:84% position:16%
nor how hard this
undertaking would be.

00:25:43.073 --> 00:25:46.578 align:start size:94% position:6%
Our 60-day, over
650-mile hiking immersion

00:25:48.279 --> 00:25:51.382
was not about being on a list.

00:25:51.382 --> 00:25:54.919 align:start size:94% position:6%
It was about understanding
a shared resource,

00:25:54.919 --> 00:25:58.590
the crown jewel of our
national park system.

00:25:59.657 --> 00:26:01.892 align:start size:84% position:16%
While it was a
journey to find a line

00:26:01.892 --> 00:26:04.895 align:start size:97% position:3%
through one of the seven
natural wonders of the world

00:26:04.895 --> 00:26:07.699
between the river and the rim,

00:26:07.699 --> 00:26:10.568 align:start size:97% position:3%
it was also a quest to
understand what might change

00:26:10.568 --> 00:26:13.405 align:start size:81% position:19%
or be lost in this
rock cathedral.

00:26:16.074 --> 00:26:17.342
If we don't find a balance

00:26:17.342 --> 00:26:20.512 align:start size:84% position:16%
between growing
development pressures,

00:26:21.679 --> 00:26:23.348
resource extraction,

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:27.752
and the sublime beauty

00:26:27.752 --> 00:26:30.589
that defines this
iconic landscape.

00:26:32.357 --> 00:26:34.793
And how we decide to
use and experience

00:26:34.793 --> 00:26:36.895
our last wild places

00:26:36.895 --> 00:26:41.066 align:start size:97% position:3%
will dictate what the future
of this place looks like.

00:26:45.936 --> 00:26:48.306
the story that we've spent
the last year of our lives

00:26:48.306 --> 00:26:50.408
working on comes down
to a single question,

00:26:50.408 --> 00:26:52.010
that question is this,

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:53.577
how do we view this space?

00:26:53.577 --> 00:26:54.612
How do we view it as citizens,

00:26:54.612 --> 00:26:56.047
how do we view it as Americans.

00:26:56.047 --> 00:26:59.083 align:start size:88% position:13%
Do we view it as a
place that is sacrosanct

00:26:59.083 --> 00:27:01.086
and holy and inviolable,

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:06.891 align:start size:97% position:3%
or do we view it as a theater
for our own amusement?

00:27:06.891 --> 00:27:09.226
A place that titillates us,

00:27:09.226 --> 00:27:11.729 align:start size:94% position:6%
provides us with
recreation and enjoyment.

00:27:11.729 --> 00:27:14.031
And Pete and I are not proposing

00:27:14.031 --> 00:27:16.801 align:start size:97% position:3%
that we have an answer to
that question to you tonight.

00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:19.470 align:start position:0%
We're merely placing the
question in front of all of you

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:20.605
for your consideration,

00:27:20.605 --> 00:27:22.774
but we will say one thing.

00:27:23.908 --> 00:27:25.310
There's a lot of places
in the United States

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:27.078
that look like this.

00:27:27.078 --> 00:27:30.248
Wanna know how many
of them there are?

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:36.987 align:start size:97% position:3%
- There are a lot of amusement
parks in this country.

00:27:36.987 --> 00:27:39.624
And one thing we have
learned after sweating,

00:27:39.624 --> 00:27:41.859
bleeding, crying, whining,

00:27:41.859 --> 00:27:44.062 align:start size:84% position:16%
and crawling through
the Grand Canyon

00:27:44.062 --> 00:27:45.730
is there's only one place

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:49.901
that looks like the seventh
natural wonder of the world.

00:27:52.636 --> 00:27:55.106
So thank you very much
for coming out tonight.

00:27:55.106 --> 00:27:56.774
(audience applauding)

00:27:56.774 --> 00:27:57.776
- Thank you.
