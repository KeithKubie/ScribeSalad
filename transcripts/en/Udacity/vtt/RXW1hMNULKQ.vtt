00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.570
In this lesson you learned
about your target users and

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.240
how to build great experience for them.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.310
&gt;&gt; A great user experience
is really good design.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.020
It's something that is functional and
emotionally satisfying.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.820
I showed you many examples of the
components that go into a great design.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.580
There's so much more to learn than
mentioned here, and we hope you have

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.010
some basics for what to think about
in the design of your own product.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.230
&gt;&gt; In the next lesson,
you will learn how to use

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.640
Zionsprints to test the riskiest
assumptions in your product.
