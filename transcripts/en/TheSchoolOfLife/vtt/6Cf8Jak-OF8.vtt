00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.720
LEGO has many exciting ranges

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.140
including 'Star Wars', 'Harry Potter' and 'Indiana Jones'.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.980
Now we're proud to announce a new range,

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.900
one of the most exciting and action-packed ever:

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.680
LEGO 'Philosophy'!

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.500
Inside the box you'll find everything you need to get your exclusive philosophy world up and running.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.620
Your exclusive philosopher comes with... no accessories whatsoever.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.700
Their main purpose is to be made to sit in the corner and think.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.280
They do nothing.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.900
They make no money.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.920
They can't operate machinery.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.420
They couldn't drive something like this

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.820
or fly that.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.220
But they do have a purpose:

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.900
they take our thoughts, which are often lying in a tangled mess,

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.540
and they order them into beautiful manageable chunks

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.320
so that we can hopefully understand ourselves and the difficulties facing us a little better.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.720
Think of them as the cleaners and the rangers of our minds.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.420
Every LEGO collection, and every society, should have a figure of these philosophers somewhere in the background

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.500
ready to clean up our thoughts.
