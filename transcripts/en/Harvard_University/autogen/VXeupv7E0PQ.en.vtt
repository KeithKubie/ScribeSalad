00:09:14.759 --> 00:09:14.769
any more like more on terms of economic
 

00:09:14.769 --> 00:09:16.049
any more like more on terms of economic
models that people might choose from I

00:09:16.049 --> 00:09:16.059
models that people might choose from I
 

00:09:16.059 --> 00:09:17.549
models that people might choose from I
was just thinking like so like the

00:09:17.549 --> 00:09:17.559
was just thinking like so like the
 

00:09:17.559 --> 00:09:19.139
was just thinking like so like the
chicken game where you in essence

00:09:19.139 --> 00:09:19.149
chicken game where you in essence
 

00:09:19.149 --> 00:09:21.569
chicken game where you in essence
veering toward one another and if one

00:09:21.569 --> 00:09:21.579
veering toward one another and if one
 

00:09:21.579 --> 00:09:25.559
veering toward one another and if one
doesn't give out they uh you know I

00:09:25.559 --> 00:09:25.569
doesn't give out they uh you know I
 

00:09:25.569 --> 00:09:28.019
doesn't give out they uh you know I
guess like here the competitive behavior

00:09:28.019 --> 00:09:28.029
guess like here the competitive behavior
 

00:09:28.029 --> 00:09:30.259
guess like here the competitive behavior
is only coming from north of the

00:09:30.259 --> 00:09:30.269
is only coming from north of the
 

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:32.280
is only coming from north of the
behavior that aims to hurt the other

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:32.290
behavior that aims to hurt the other
 

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:33.840
behavior that aims to hurt the other
content there is only coming from one

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:33.850
content there is only coming from one
 

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.119
content there is only coming from one
side okay okay so you know it's

00:09:36.119 --> 00:09:36.129
side okay okay so you know it's
 

00:09:36.129 --> 00:09:38.039
side okay okay so you know it's
unidirectional yeah and it's just so

00:09:38.039 --> 00:09:38.049
unidirectional yeah and it's just so
 

00:09:38.049 --> 00:09:40.169
unidirectional yeah and it's just so
it's really sabotage is it is the

00:09:40.169 --> 00:09:40.179
it's really sabotage is it is the
 

00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:42.389
it's really sabotage is it is the
essence of what your focus primarily on

00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:42.399
essence of what your focus primarily on
 

00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:44.789
essence of what your focus primarily on
yeah it's a professionally with residual

00:09:44.789 --> 00:09:44.799
yeah it's a professionally with residual
 

00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:46.829
yeah it's a professionally with residual
cough like behavior that that has the

00:09:46.829 --> 00:09:46.839
cough like behavior that that has the
 

00:09:46.839 --> 00:09:49.499
cough like behavior that that has the
potential to hurt the saboteur it's

00:09:49.499 --> 00:09:49.509
potential to hurt the saboteur it's
 

00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:52.859
potential to hurt the saboteur it's
tough the risky risky sabotages

00:09:52.859 --> 00:09:52.869
tough the risky risky sabotages
 

00:09:52.869 --> 00:09:55.079
tough the risky risky sabotages
unidirectional risky sounds just trying

00:09:55.079 --> 00:09:55.089
unidirectional risky sounds just trying
 

00:09:55.089 --> 00:09:57.919
unidirectional risky sounds just trying
to understand exactly what you're doing

00:09:57.919 --> 00:09:57.929
to understand exactly what you're doing
 

00:09:57.929 --> 00:10:01.409

so as I mentioned our aim in doing all

00:10:01.409 --> 00:10:01.419
so as I mentioned our aim in doing all
 

00:10:01.419 --> 00:10:03.449
so as I mentioned our aim in doing all
of this was to figure out our gender

00:10:03.449 --> 00:10:03.459
of this was to figure out our gender
 

00:10:03.459 --> 00:10:06.059

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:56.790
takes all with high comparison or
variable with Logan there's and I'm

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800
variable with Logan there's and I'm
 

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.220
variable with Logan there's and I'm
thinking about you know making partner

00:13:59.220 --> 00:13:59.230
thinking about you know making partner
 

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:00.990
thinking about you know making partner
or making tender where at the end

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:01.000
or making tender where at the end
 

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.900
or making tender where at the end
there's certainly

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:03.910
there's certainly
 

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.550
there's certainly
a winner-take-all but along the way

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:05.560
a winner-take-all but along the way
 

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.200
a winner-take-all but along the way
there's not necessarily high social

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:07.210
there's not necessarily high social
 

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:11.520
there's not necessarily high social
comparison yeah so we are essentially

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:11.530
comparison yeah so we are essentially
 

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:12.900
comparison yeah so we are essentially
focused on these two competitive

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:12.910
focused on these two competitive
 

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:14.250
focused on these two competitive
contacts and they don't look bad

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:14.260
contacts and they don't look bad
 

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.900
contacts and they don't look bad
yourself again yeah they don't have to

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:15.910
yourself again yeah they don't have to
 

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:17.820
yourself again yeah they don't have to
go together but you can see that how

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:17.830
go together but you can see that how
 

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:19.740
go together but you can see that how
they can actually go together in terms

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:19.750
they can actually go together in terms
 

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.660
they can actually go together in terms
of analyzing performance relative to

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:21.670
of analyzing performance relative to
 

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.570
of analyzing performance relative to
others so what we did must be this was

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:24.580
others so what we did must be this was
 

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.550
others so what we did must be this was
our initial focus on different

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:26.560
our initial focus on different
 

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:37.470
our initial focus on different
combinations so so I guess back to low

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:37.480
combinations so so I guess back to low
 

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.270
combinations so so I guess back to low
intensity competitions and what I mean

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:39.280
intensity competitions and what I mean
 

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.480
intensity competitions and what I mean
by non-impaired to know social

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:41.490
by non-impaired to know social
 

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.790
by non-impaired to know social
comparison performance feedback systems

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800
comparison performance feedback systems
 

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.670
comparison performance feedback systems
so here an individual will get argues or

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680
so here an individual will get argues or
 

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.910
so here an individual will get argues or
get feedback in relation to how key or

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:50.920
get feedback in relation to how key or
 

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:54.600
get feedback in relation to how key or
she did overtime or relative to a more

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:54.610
she did overtime or relative to a more
 

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:56.880
she did overtime or relative to a more
objective defined performance platinum

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:56.890
objective defined performance platinum
 

00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:59.840
objective defined performance platinum
are such and such as an organization

00:14:59.840 --> 00:14:59.850
are such and such as an organization
 

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.410
are such and such as an organization
personal phone

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:02.420
 
 

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.950
 
so

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:05.960
 
 

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.480
 
to clarify that a little bit further

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:07.490
to clarify that a little bit further
 

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.820
to clarify that a little bit further
let's say and there's a sales

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:09.830
let's say and there's a sales
 

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:11.560
let's say and there's a sales
organization on this salesperson the

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:11.570
organization on this salesperson the
 

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:14.230
organization on this salesperson the
salesperson what he told you solve X

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240
salesperson what he told you solve X
 

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.210
salesperson what he told you solve X
this year versus you sold why last year

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:18.220
this year versus you sold why last year
 

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.740
this year versus you sold why last year
whereas in the high social comparison

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:20.750
whereas in the high social comparison
 

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:22.390
whereas in the high social comparison
performs feedback the same person he

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:22.400
performs feedback the same person he
 

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.830
performs feedback the same person he
told you hold X this year whereas you're

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:26.840
told you hold X this year whereas you're
 

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.550
told you hold X this year whereas you're
here or your peers why

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.560
 
 

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.980
 
um

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:33.990
 
 

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:37.269
 
so in high-intensity competitions

00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:37.279
so in high-intensity competitions
 

00:15:37.279 --> 00:15:40.210
so in high-intensity competitions
individuals get strong clear cues that

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:40.220
individuals get strong clear cues that
 

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.590
individuals get strong clear cues that
winning and eating their competitors

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.600
winning and eating their competitors
 

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.150
winning and eating their competitors
doing better than their competitors is

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160
doing better than their competitors is
 

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:49.280
doing better than their competitors is

00:15:55.679 --> 00:15:55.689
the start of a career and trying to trip
 

00:15:55.689 --> 00:15:59.599
the start of a career and trying to trip

up your competitor has a relatively high
 

00:15:59.609 --> 00:16:04.139
up your competitor has a relatively high
expected benefits and secondly it has a

because of the incentive scheme and
 

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.810
because of the incentive scheme and
because of the high social comparison

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:16.820
because of the high social comparison
 

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.740

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:25.890
competitions you're getting more week
 

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:30.220
competitions you're getting more week
and because signals as to

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:30.230

bidding is good but even if you don't do
 

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:43.430
bidding is good but even if you don't do
better than others that's okay as long

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440
better than others that's okay as long
 

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.590
better than others that's okay as long
as you maximize your own potential

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600
as you maximize your own potential
 

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.629
as you maximize your own potential
because you're still getting paid

00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639
because you're still getting paid

they got two or three cents until the

00:30:50.509 --> 00:30:50.519
they got two or three cents until the
 

00:30:50.519 --> 00:30:52.279
they got two or three cents until the
end yeah yeah I thought that's where I

00:30:52.279 --> 00:30:52.289
end yeah yeah I thought that's where I
 

00:30:52.289 --> 00:30:53.539

yeah hi intestinal audiences so as you

00:30:59.720 --> 00:30:59.730
yeah hi intestinal audiences so as you
 

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:01.490
yeah hi intestinal audiences so as you
say they're both getting information

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:01.500
say they're both getting information
 

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.139
say they're both getting information
about who they're competing and for now

00:31:03.139 --> 00:31:03.149
about who they're competing and for now
 

00:31:03.149 --> 00:31:05.299
about who they're competing and for now
I gotta both getting information about

00:31:05.299 --> 00:31:05.309
I gotta both getting information about
 

00:31:05.309 --> 00:31:06.769
I gotta both getting information about
like four they're competing against you

00:31:06.769 --> 00:31:06.779
like four they're competing against you
 

00:31:06.779 --> 00:31:11.000
like four they're competing against you
say that so everything knew that they

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:11.010
say that so everything knew that they
 

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:13.310
say that so everything knew that they
were competing against somebody like it

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:13.320
were competing against somebody like it
 

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.529
were competing against somebody like it
in a pool of something they could really

00:31:15.529 --> 00:31:15.539
in a pool of something they could really
 

00:31:15.539 --> 00:31:17.560
in a pool of something they could really
are they just know that this in person

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:17.570
are they just know that this in person
 

00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:19.879
are they just know that this in person
participating the same study on the same

00:31:19.879 --> 00:31:19.889
participating the same study on the same
 

00:31:19.889 --> 00:31:22.009
participating the same study on the same
conditions but already on the same

00:31:22.009 --> 00:31:22.019
conditions but already on the same
 

00:31:22.019 --> 00:31:23.990
conditions but already on the same
instructions bubble so many structures

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000
instructions bubble so many structures
 

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.880
instructions bubble so many structures
on the same set of rules okay

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:28.890
 
 

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:31.470
 
so this was a floor of the experiment

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:31.480
so this was a floor of the experiment
 

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:34.800
so this was a floor of the experiment
participants complete the practice round

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:34.810
participants complete the practice round
 

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:39.060
participants complete the practice round
round one round two and then just before

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:39.070
round one round two and then just before
 

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:42.720
round one round two and then just before
they started round three they were asked

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:42.730
they started round three they were asked
 

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:46.230
they started round three they were asked
to make a decision essentially so this

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.240
to make a decision essentially so this
 

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.830
to make a decision essentially so this
was our main dependent variable where we

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840
was our main dependent variable where we
 

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:51.870
was our main dependent variable where we
studied the propensity for destructive

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:51.880
studied the propensity for destructive
 

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:55.620
studied the propensity for destructive
competition essentially what they could

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:55.630
competition essentially what they could
 

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:58.320
competition essentially what they could
deduct up to 16 points from their

00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:58.330
deduct up to 16 points from their
 

00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:01.830
deduct up to 16 points from their
competitors next round score but if they

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:01.840
competitors next round score but if they
 

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.740
competitors next round score but if they
do so they lost points from their own

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:04.750
do so they lost points from their own
 

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:07.200
do so they lost points from their own
score up to five points and higher point

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:07.210
score up to five points and higher point
 

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:09.390
score up to five points and higher point
deductions were more closely so the one

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:09.400
deductions were more closely so the one
 

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.280
deductions were more closely so the one
extreme they could deduct up to 16

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:11.290

points from participants next door but
 

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.170
points from participants next door but
then they would lose five points from

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:16.180
then they would lose five points from
 

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:20.220
then they would lose five points from
their own score and at the other end of

their own score and at the other end of
 

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:21.840

would this type of situation look like
 

00:34:47.419 --> 00:34:50.540
would this type of situation look like
so yeah thank you for reminding me

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:50.550
so yeah thank you for reminding me

so yeah thank you for reminding me
talk about that so so i guess i'll talk

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:56.520
talk about that so so i guess i'll talk
 

00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:00.130
talk about that so so i guess i'll talk
about some extreme examples

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:00.140
about some extreme examples
 

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:02.290
about some extreme examples
we'll make a little more sense of you

00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:02.300
we'll make a little more sense of you
 

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.090
we'll make a little more sense of you

are
work if you're on the working if you're

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680
work if you're on the working if you're
 

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.349
work if you're on the working if you're
in a complete high competition intensity

00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359
in a complete high competition intensity
 

00:35:17.359 --> 00:35:20.880
in a complete high competition intensity
condition and you're working on the

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:20.890
condition and you're working on the
 

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:27.770
condition and you're working on the
and you deduct points

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:27.780
 
 

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:29.230
 
you win

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:29.240
you win
 

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:34.090
you win
and you

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:34.100
 
 

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:37.650
 
because

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:37.660
 
 

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:41.900
 
you are making

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:41.910
 
 

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:44.940

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:47.220
 
so I guess and

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:47.230
so I guess and
 

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:50.500
so I guess and
the real world let's say

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:50.510
the real world let's say
 

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:53.680
the real world let's say
I know that's

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:53.690
 
 

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:59.230
 
she wears like it

00:35:59.230 --> 00:35:59.240
 
 

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.730
 
they're expected to

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:02.740
they're expected to
 

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:05.750
they're expected to
prepare a proposal

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760
prepare a proposal
 

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:11.290
prepare a proposal
and you know that the person actually

00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:11.300
and you know that the person actually
 

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.670
and you know that the person actually
creates the defending solution for

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680
creates the defending solution for
 

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.570
creates the defending solution for
client they're going to get a promotion

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:16.580
client they're going to get a promotion
 

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.309
client they're going to get a promotion
so

00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:18.319
so
 

00:36:18.319 --> 00:36:21.249
so
you prepare it undone you know like your

00:36:21.249 --> 00:36:21.259
you prepare it undone you know like your
 

00:36:21.259 --> 00:36:23.559
you prepare it undone you know like your
main competitor chief will get there you

00:36:23.559 --> 00:36:23.569
main competitor chief will get there you
 

00:36:23.569 --> 00:36:26.020
main competitor chief will get there you
know repairs on

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:26.030
know repairs on
 

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:29.020
know repairs on
just before the day of presentation you

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:29.030
just before the day of presentation you
 

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:32.059
just before the day of presentation you
go here

00:36:32.059 --> 00:36:32.069
go here
 

00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:34.489
go here
or numbers or something or you just like

00:36:34.489 --> 00:36:34.499
or numbers or something or you just like
 

00:36:34.499 --> 00:36:35.959
or numbers or something or you just like
completely destroyed believe whatever

00:36:35.959 --> 00:36:35.969
completely destroyed believe whatever
 

00:36:35.969 --> 00:36:39.439
completely destroyed believe whatever
for presentation because of that you get

00:36:39.439 --> 00:36:39.449
for presentation because of that you get
 

00:36:39.449 --> 00:36:44.810
for presentation because of that you get
the promotion and she loses out so

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:44.820
 
 

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:47.060
 
you lose points to write in the game

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:47.070
you lose points to write in the game
 

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:51.680
you lose points to write in the game
right yeah so and do so you do lose

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:51.690
right yeah so and do so you do lose
 

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:57.339
right yeah so and do so you do lose
points but

00:36:57.339 --> 00:36:57.349
 
 

00:36:57.349 --> 00:37:00.720
 
but you would have made 0 anyway

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:00.730
but you would have made 0 anyway
 

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:03.540
but you would have made 0 anyway
situation so essentially the post is

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:03.550
situation so essentially the post is
 

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:04.410
situation so essentially the post is
zero

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:04.420
zero
 

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:07.010
zero
so the real world example

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:07.020
so the real world example
 

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:11.109
so the real world example
you work off

00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119
 
 

00:37:11.119 --> 00:37:19.600
 
fire because

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:19.610
 
 

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:22.310
 
how analogous it really is because if I

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.320
how analogous it really is because if I
 

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.020
how analogous it really is because if I
was playing a game and put like hard to

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:24.030
was playing a game and put like hard to
 

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:25.970
was playing a game and put like hard to
strategy the game was to deduct points

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:25.980
strategy the game was to deduct points
 

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:27.560
strategy the game was to deduct points
from other people that wouldn't be like

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:27.570
from other people that wouldn't be like
 

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:28.880
from other people that wouldn't be like
an ethical question for me I would just

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:28.890
an ethical question for me I would just
 

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:30.830
an ethical question for me I would just
be like oh I'm planning this game where

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:30.840
be like oh I'm planning this game where
 

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:33.440
be like oh I'm planning this game where
is like just deleting my competitors

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:33.450
is like just deleting my competitors
 

00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:35.570
is like just deleting my competitors
presentation would be this huge like

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:35.580
presentation would be this huge like
 

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.430
presentation would be this huge like
there's no way evidence that are doing

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440
there's no way evidence that are doing
 

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.220
there's no way evidence that are doing
that so to me in the game I can totally

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:40.230
that so to me in the game I can totally
 

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:41.780
that so to me in the game I can totally
see my something like what's that a

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:41.790
see my something like what's that a
 

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:44.090
see my something like what's that a
strategy here i'm playing a game so now

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:44.100
strategy here i'm playing a game so now
 

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:46.340
strategy here i'm playing a game so now
cos early you know this is abstract show

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:46.350
cos early you know this is abstract show
 

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:48.830
cos early you know this is abstract show
you know experiment that's why I've been

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:48.840
you know experiment that's why I've been
 

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.480
you know experiment that's why I've been
treating my horse they're carefully and

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:50.490
treating my horse they're carefully and
 

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:52.250
treating my horse they're carefully and
I actually did not use the courts of

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:52.260
I actually did not use the courts of
 

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:56.039
I actually did not use the courts of
Etosha for like a sabotage my behavior

00:37:56.039 --> 00:37:56.049
Etosha for like a sabotage my behavior
 

00:37:56.049 --> 00:37:57.770
Etosha for like a sabotage my behavior
because apart because

00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:57.780
because apart because
 

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:00.470
because apart because
because it's almost like you know kind

00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480
because it's almost like you know kind
 

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:16.010
because it's almost like you know kind
of like a llama

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:16.020
 
 

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.630
 
so to think maybe another analogy would

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640
so to think maybe another analogy would
 

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.430
so to think maybe another analogy would
be going negative in a campaign so

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:20.440
be going negative in a campaign so
 

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.230
be going negative in a campaign so
winner-takes-all campaign doing negative

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240
winner-takes-all campaign doing negative
 

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.000
winner-takes-all campaign doing negative
campaigning negative campaigning is

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:24.010
campaigning negative campaigning is
 

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:26.250
campaigning negative campaigning is
risky to me because it's not that

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:26.260
risky to me because it's not that
 

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:27.810
risky to me because it's not that
positively perceived but I get to hurt

00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:27.820
positively perceived but I get to hurt
 

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:30.000
positively perceived but I get to hurt
the other thing that might be maybe

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:30.010
the other thing that might be maybe
 

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:32.550
the other thing that might be maybe
that's a stronger real-life analogy yeah

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:32.560
that's a stronger real-life analogy yeah
 

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:34.710
that's a stronger real-life analogy yeah
can you go back though to your just the

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720
can you go back though to your just the
 

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.510
can you go back though to your just the
slide right before this like why are the

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:36.520
slide right before this like why are the
 

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.550
slide right before this like why are the
women doing better in high-intensity if

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:38.560
women doing better in high-intensity if
 

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.560
women doing better in high-intensity if
there's no gender difference in behavior

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:40.570
there's no gender difference in behavior
 

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:45.780
there's no gender difference in behavior
and high intensity so the second

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:45.790
and high intensity so the second
 

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:48.150
and high intensity so the second
experiment will explain why Oh Graham

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160
experiment will explain why Oh Graham
 

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.380
experiment will explain why Oh Graham
you know just to give you a preview is

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:49.390
you know just to give you a preview is
 

00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:51.480
you know just to give you a preview is
because they're paying attention to

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:51.490
because they're paying attention to
 

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:52.710
because they're paying attention to

pictures of men are just not paying any

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:54.940
pictures of men are just not paying any
 

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:57.180
pictures of men are just not paying any
attention okay okay so so what do you

00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:57.190
attention okay okay so so what do you
 

00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:59.450
attention okay okay so so what do you
see okay so that you are a gamer

00:38:59.450 --> 00:38:59.460
see okay so that you are a gamer
 

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:02.340

sabotaging devices were sabotage

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:02.350
sabotaging devices were sabotage
 

00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:05.340
sabotaging devices were sabotage
whenever we use for exactly you manage

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:05.350
whenever we use for exactly you manage
 

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:33.999
whenever we use for exactly you manage
us yeah just looks like subway

00:39:33.999 --> 00:39:34.009
 
 

00:39:34.009 --> 00:39:38.989
 
it'd be fascinating I have a propensity

00:39:38.989 --> 00:39:38.999
it'd be fascinating I have a propensity
 

00:39:38.999 --> 00:39:41.359
it'd be fascinating I have a propensity
at all why they should be fascinating to

00:39:41.359 --> 00:39:41.369
at all why they should be fascinating to
 

00:39:41.369 --> 00:39:44.420
at all why they should be fascinating to
actually look at the two further to go

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:44.430
actually look at the two further to go
 

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:48.019
actually look at the two further to go
back one slide 54 lost hand side to see

00:39:48.019 --> 00:39:48.029
back one slide 54 lost hand side to see
 

00:39:48.029 --> 00:39:49.729
back one slide 54 lost hand side to see
the frequency distributions of the

00:39:49.729 --> 00:39:49.739
the frequency distributions of the
 

00:39:49.739 --> 00:39:54.890
the frequency distributions of the
impact of the sabotage rules

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:54.900
 
 

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:57.620
 
to just get a slightly better feel for

00:39:57.620 --> 00:39:57.630
to just get a slightly better feel for
 

00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:06.540
to just get a slightly better feel for
this yes yeah

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:06.550
 
 

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:12.180
 
so wrap up the final sorry well whatever

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:12.190
so wrap up the final sorry well whatever
 

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:16.360
so wrap up the final sorry well whatever
and so this has benefits read from

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:16.370
and so this has benefits read from
 

00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:20.700
and so this has benefits read from
destructive competition so is this only

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:20.710
destructive competition so is this only
 

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:23.680
destructive competition so is this only
incorporating the data points where the

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:23.690
incorporating the data points where the
 

00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:27.250
incorporating the data points where the
person who did engage in the yeah so so

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:27.260
person who did engage in the yeah so so
 

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.130
person who did engage in the yeah so so
how we calculated at this what I should

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:30.140
how we calculated at this what I should
 

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:32.190
how we calculated at this what I should
have actually said the night before

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:32.200
have actually said the night before
 

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:36.320
have actually said the night before
sources so this is a bonus

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:36.330
sources so this is a bonus
 

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:37.970
sources so this is a bonus
that participant additional ones

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:37.980
that participant additional ones
 

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:40.070
that participant additional ones
partisans are able to meet from district

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:40.080
partisans are able to meet from district
 

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.200
partisans are able to meet from district
competition lines any bonus that they

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:42.210
competition lines any bonus that they
 

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:44.450
competition lines any bonus that they
fall down because they deducted points

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:44.460
fall down because they deducted points
 

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:47.120
fall down because they deducted points
from the other person so if you have not

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:47.130
from the other person so if you have not
 

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:50.660
from the other person so if you have not
engaged in any point deductions in space

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:50.670
engaged in any point deductions in space
 

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:56.470
engaged in any point deductions in space
of a 0-0 0 so they're a bunch of zeroes

00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480
of a 0-0 0 so they're a bunch of zeroes
 

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.900
of a 0-0 0 so they're a bunch of zeroes
about fifty percent up to people

00:40:58.900 --> 00:40:58.910
about fifty percent up to people
 

00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:01.319
about fifty percent up to people

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:11.750
 
 

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:15.070
 
so just to wrap up these findings it

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:15.080
so just to wrap up these findings it
 

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:20.110
so just to wrap up these findings it
seems like women there they're more

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:20.120
seems like women there they're more
 

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:21.580
seems like women there they're more

effective behavior and gross competition

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:42.320
effective behavior and gross competition
 

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.710
effective behavior and gross competition
conditions

because of that

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:45.860
because of that
 

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:50.690
because of that
women are weeping more net benefits

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:50.700
women are weeping more net benefits
 

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:53.569
women are weeping more net benefits
were more net payoffs from engaging in

00:41:53.569 --> 00:41:53.579
were more net payoffs from engaging in
 

00:41:53.579 --> 00:41:58.150
were more net payoffs from engaging in
such behavior than men

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:03.760
 
so you study to go factor question we

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:03.770
so you study to go factor question we
 

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:05.750
so you study to go factor question we
separated the incentive scheme

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760
separated the incentive scheme
 

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:09.430
separated the incentive scheme

so what that end up what we ended up it

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920
so what that end up what we ended up it
 

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.160

within the group of man and the group

00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:25.300
 
 

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:28.890
 
differences I don't

00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:28.900
 
 

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:32.100
 
thank you fine oh oh oh I see they're

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:32.110
thank you fine oh oh oh I see they're
 

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:35.490
thank you fine oh oh oh I see they're
like age I I didn't look at that at all

00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:35.500
like age I I didn't look at that at all
 

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:38.040
like age I I didn't look at that at all
yeah i know and i guess like one more

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:38.050
yeah i know and i guess like one more
 

00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:40.200
yeah i know and i guess like one more
thing they come to be white no but we're

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:40.210
thing they come to be white no but we're
 

00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:46.470
thing they come to be white no but we're
bombing white so our next study did

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:46.480
bombing white so our next study did
 

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:52.520
bombing white so our next study did
actually at Harvard's lab

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:52.530
 
 

00:47:52.530 --> 00:48:13.210
 
so

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:13.220
 
 

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:16.839
 
so um

00:48:16.839 --> 00:48:16.849
 
 

00:48:16.849 --> 00:48:19.660
 
as I mentioned another tool that

00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:19.670
as I mentioned another tool that
 

00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:22.839
as I mentioned another tool that
organizations used to regulate this kind

00:48:22.839 --> 00:48:22.849
organizations used to regulate this kind
 

00:48:22.849 --> 00:48:26.760
organizations used to regulate this kind
of behavior

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:26.770
of behavior
 

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:29.630

00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:29.640
looks like an even type of the behavior
 

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:32.880
looks like an even type of the behavior
is through establishing camera presence

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:32.890
is through establishing camera presence
 

00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:34.730
is through establishing camera presence
or

00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:34.740
or
 

00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:37.410
or
as I mentioned past research shows that

00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:37.420
as I mentioned past research shows that
 

00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:39.180
as I mentioned past research shows that
they can be effective in the moment a

they can be effective in the moment a
 

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:41.340
they can be effective in the moment a
city officials in each situation so

00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:41.350
city officials in each situation so
 

00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:44.880
city officials in each situation so
that's what we looked at as a reminder

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:44.890
that's what we looked at as a reminder
 

00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:48.150
that's what we looked at as a reminder
we expected

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.160
 
 

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:53.779
 
presidents to be hated by observers and

00:48:53.779 --> 00:48:53.789
presidents to be hated by observers and
 

00:48:53.789 --> 00:48:56.460
presidents to be hated by observers and
expected to find gender differences

00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:56.470
expected to find gender differences
 

00:48:56.470 --> 00:49:01.740
expected to find gender differences
given the situation lately

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:01.750
 
 

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:07.800
 
so in this study we took male and female

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:07.810
so in this study we took male and female
 

00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:10.590
so in this study we took male and female
participants and they were randomly

00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:10.600
participants and they were randomly
 

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:12.960
participants and they were randomly
assigned to one of the three

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:12.970
assigned to one of the three
 

00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:16.530
assigned to one of the three
determinations so this is essentially a

00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:16.540
determinations so this is essentially a
 

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:20.730
determinations so this is essentially a
22 by trade in subjects designed so the

00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:20.740
22 by trade in subjects designed so the
 

00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:22.560
22 by trade in subjects designed so the
null behavior normal conditions

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:22.570
null behavior normal conditions
 

00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:24.540
null behavior normal conditions
essential for cultural foundation and

00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:24.550
essential for cultural foundation and
 

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:25.809
essential for cultural foundation and
this is

00:49:25.809 --> 00:49:25.819
this is
 

00:49:25.819 --> 00:49:29.680
this is
exactly the same same condition as in

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:29.690
exactly the same same condition as in
 

00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:32.549
exactly the same same condition as in
the low intensity competition commission

00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559
the low intensity competition commission
 

00:49:32.559 --> 00:49:39.670
the low intensity competition commission
in the previous two studies

00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680
 
 

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:41.950
 
so this is what we're doing different

00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:41.960
so this is what we're doing different
 

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:47.049
so this is what we're doing different

participants thought that the

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920
participants thought that the
 

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:19.660
participants thought that the
participant was given an option to

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:19.670
participant was given an option to
 

00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:21.569
participant was given an option to
engage in destructive competition and

00:50:21.569 --> 00:50:21.579
engage in destructive competition and
 

00:50:21.579 --> 00:50:24.250
engage in destructive competition and
they did so to the fullest extent they

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:24.260
they did so to the fullest extent they
 

00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:27.470
they did so to the fullest extent they
deducted

00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:27.480
 
 

00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:31.520
 
so this was the flow of the experiment

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:31.530
so this was the flow of the experiment
 

00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:34.800
so this was the flow of the experiment
again they did seem task practice round

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:34.810
again they did seem task practice round
 

00:50:34.810 --> 00:50:38.240
again they did seem task practice round
round one and then just before round two

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:38.250
round one and then just before round two
 

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:42.330
round one and then just before round two
we asked them to make a decision about

00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:42.340
we asked them to make a decision about
 

00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:44.670
we asked them to make a decision about
point deductions again exactly the same

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:44.680
point deductions again exactly the same
 

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:48.480
point deductions again exactly the same
way using the same options so here you

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:48.490
way using the same options so here you
 

00:50:48.490 --> 00:50:50.550
way using the same options so here you
measure their baseline propensity for

00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:50.560
measure their baseline propensity for
 

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:53.340
measure their baseline propensity for
destructive competition and then they

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:53.350
destructive competition and then they
 

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:56.130
destructive competition and then they
point lead around too and then they were

00:50:56.130 --> 00:50:56.140
point lead around too and then they were
 

00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:58.890
point lead around too and then they were
assigned to one of the three DeHaven on

00:50:58.890 --> 00:50:58.900
assigned to one of the three DeHaven on

just you know content on experiment but
 

00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:10.620
just you know content on experiment but
if they were in one of the competitive

00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:12.630
or non-competitive behavioral conditions
 

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:15.450
or non-competitive behavioral conditions
they made that observation about the

they made that observation about the
 

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:18.570
they made that observation about the
other person's behavior and then they

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:18.580
other person's behavior and then they
 

00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:20.940
other person's behavior and then they
were given the decision to engage or not

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:20.950
were given the decision to engage or not

00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:29.000
running 30
so this is our main area of interest

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:29.010
so this is our main area of interest
 

00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:32.390
so this is our main area of interest
here we want to see how their behavior

00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400
here we want to see how their behavior
 

00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:36.109
here we want to see how their behavior
changed from the baseline that's after

00:51:36.109 --> 00:51:36.119

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:52.319
 
so

00:51:52.319 --> 00:51:52.329
 
 

00:51:52.329 --> 00:51:55.799
 
this is the main high-quality alarm

capacity for they start the competition
 

00:51:58.869 --> 00:52:03.640
capacity for they start the competition
so this here is our patrol condition is

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:03.650
so this here is our patrol condition is
 

00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:06.220
so this here is our patrol condition is

see if you can to decrease their
capacity for distracted competition

00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:18.450
capacity for distracted competition
 

00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:22.470

compare the behavioral norms and as you

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:01.450
compare the behavioral norms and as you
 

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:03.420
compare the behavioral norms and as you
can see just this is control condition

00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:03.430
can see just this is control condition
 

00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:08.830
can see just this is control condition
the gap actually decreases

that's like explicitly gender &amp; like

00:54:32.830 --> 00:54:32.840
that's like explicitly gender &amp; like
 

00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:34.450
that's like explicitly gender &amp; like

we had done anything like that we just

00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:39.290
we had done anything like that we just
 

00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:42.010
we had done anything like that we just
talked about the other person in general

00:54:42.010 --> 00:54:42.020
talked about the other person in general
 

00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:47.930
talked about the other person in general
terms here I'm just that

00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:47.940
 
 

00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:52.110
 
I don't even like

00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:52.120
 
 

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:53.880
 
you have the cities like the math tests

00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:53.890
you have the cities like the math tests
 

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:55.380
you have the cities like the math tests
and stuff where they tell girls

00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:55.390
and stuff where they tell girls
 

00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:57.660
and stuff where they tell girls
beforehand like girls are really good at

00:54:57.660 --> 00:54:57.670
beforehand like girls are really good at
 

00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:59.820
beforehand like girls are really good at
this task is it actually sounds like you

00:54:59.820 --> 00:54:59.830
this task is it actually sounds like you
 

00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:01.770
this task is it actually sounds like you
are like so I wondered if you like gave

00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:01.780
are like so I wondered if you like gave
 

00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:04.859
are like so I wondered if you like gave
exclusively gendered cubes about yeah

00:55:04.859 --> 00:55:04.869
exclusively gendered cubes about yeah
 

00:55:04.869 --> 00:55:07.680
exclusively gendered cubes about yeah
interesting so what we find about how

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:07.690
interesting so what we find about how
 

00:55:07.690 --> 00:55:14.920
interesting so what we find about how
people think about gender without

00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:14.930
 
 

00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:18.550
 
there we find that

00:55:18.550 --> 00:55:18.560
there we find that
 

00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:22.160
 
they actually say the gender of the

00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:22.170
they actually say the gender of the
 

00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:29.620
they actually say the gender of the
other person at all and so the rest 20

00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:29.630
 
 

00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:34.350
 
so those we assume something there

00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:34.360
so those we assume something there
 

00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:39.849
so those we assume something there
the other person's male and

00:55:39.849 --> 00:55:39.859

interest in the linguistics so that's it

00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:44.700
interest in the linguistics so that's it
 

00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:50.789
interest in the linguistics so that's it
really like a little white in

00:55:50.789 --> 00:55:50.799
 
 

00:55:50.799 --> 00:55:54.150
 
I

00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160
 
 

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:55.920
 
um

00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:55.930
um
 

00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:59.539
um
but the interesting thing is

00:55:59.539 --> 00:55:59.549
but the interesting thing is
 

00:55:59.549 --> 00:56:03.310
but the interesting thing is
despite the defects

00:56:03.310 --> 00:56:03.320
 
 

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:10.089
 
think of their competitors

00:56:10.089 --> 00:56:10.099
 
 

00:56:10.099 --> 00:56:15.370
 
I don't know but yeah so it doesn't of

00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:15.380
I don't know but yeah so it doesn't of
 

00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:18.720
I don't know but yeah so it doesn't of
interesting

00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:18.730
 
 

00:56:18.730 --> 00:56:21.810
 
yeah I was just wondering nobody

00:56:21.810 --> 00:56:21.820
yeah I was just wondering nobody
 

00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:24.310
yeah I was just wondering nobody
air-conditioned

00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:24.320
air-conditioned
 

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:30.660
air-conditioned
you're sort of stuff

00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:30.670
 
 

00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:34.950
 
yeah but I think so that is not the

00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:34.960
yeah but I think so that is not the
 

00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.370
yeah but I think so that is not the
significant difference

00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:36.380
significant difference
 

00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:40.280
significant difference
but either format known for women but I

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:40.290
but either format known for women but I
 

00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:43.370
but either format known for women but I
think if you kept on doing that but i

00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:43.380
think if you kept on doing that but i
 

00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:46.500
think if you kept on doing that but i
think or

00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:46.510
 
 

00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:56.839
 
start

00:56:56.839 --> 00:56:56.849
 
 

00:56:56.849 --> 00:57:00.079
 
so it seems like at these two times in

00:57:00.079 --> 00:57:00.089
so it seems like at these two times in
 

00:57:00.089 --> 00:57:02.600
so it seems like at these two times in
quick succession it doesn't

00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:02.610
quick succession it doesn't
 

00:57:02.610 --> 00:57:06.360
quick succession it doesn't
Jessica but that doesn't mean that

00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:06.370
Jessica but that doesn't mean that
 

00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:09.850
Jessica but that doesn't mean that
she won't enough but i have to say that

00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:09.860
she won't enough but i have to say that
 

00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:11.830
she won't enough but i have to say that
I would be careful about that because I

00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:11.840
I would be careful about that because I
 

00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:13.930
I would be careful about that because I
mean I want to study that I don't know

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:13.940
mean I want to study that I don't know
 

00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:17.470
mean I want to study that I don't know
what the answer is but you need to be

00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:17.480
what the answer is but you need to be
 

00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:19.090
what the answer is but you need to be
able to careful about the conclusion too

00:57:19.090 --> 00:57:19.100
able to careful about the conclusion too
 

00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:22.090
able to careful about the conclusion too

go back to cities one and two I think

00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:35.560
go back to cities one and two I think
 

00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:44.550
go back to cities one and two I think
your enormous result and women do better

00:57:44.550 --> 00:57:44.560

I know you don't know the answer but

00:57:58.440 --> 00:57:58.450
I know you don't know the answer but
 

00:57:58.450 --> 00:58:01.080
I know you don't know the answer but
yeah I don't know the answer but I know

00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:01.090
yeah I don't know the answer but I know
 

00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:04.020
yeah I don't know the answer but I know
that I did the same experiments and

00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:04.030
that I did the same experiments and

whether this is the sabotage result or
women are dramatically more sensitive

00:58:18.090 --> 00:58:18.100
women are dramatically more sensitive

correlate with lots of different things

00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:39.780

if you only have Harvard undergraduates

00:58:42.290 --> 00:58:42.300
if you only have Harvard undergraduates
 

00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:45.740
if you only have Harvard undergraduates
and you control for most of these things

00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:45.750
and you control for most of these things
 

00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:50.400
and you control for most of these things
and so they do something kind of

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:50.410
and so they do something kind of
 

00:58:50.410 --> 00:58:53.250
and so they do something kind of
fascinating about this

00:58:53.250 --> 00:58:53.260

Mia yeah so that's the question we're

00:58:58.380 --> 00:58:58.390
Mia yeah so that's the question we're
 

00:58:58.390 --> 00:59:01.560
Mia yeah so that's the question we're
not answering you are saying

00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:01.570
not answering you are saying
 

00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:03.120

conclusion we're drawing is that women

00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:03.130
conclusion we're drawing is that women
 

00:59:03.130 --> 00:59:05.160
conclusion we're drawing is that women
are more sensitive to the competitive

00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:05.170
are more sensitive to the competitive
 

00:59:05.170 --> 00:59:07.350
are more sensitive to the competitive
environment or it could be that they're

00:59:07.350 --> 00:59:07.360
environment or it could be that they're
 

00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:09.330
environment or it could be that they're
just more sensitive to their social

00:59:09.330 --> 00:59:09.340
just more sensitive to their social
 

00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:11.640
just more sensitive to their social

you have here on the left-hand side is

00:59:13.350 --> 00:59:13.360
you have here on the left-hand side is
 

00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:16.710
you have here on the left-hand side is
is an enormous result for the

00:59:16.710 --> 00:59:16.720
is an enormous result for the
 

00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:20.370
is an enormous result for the
superiority of women in a profit making

00:59:20.370 --> 00:59:20.380
superiority of women in a profit making

00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:24.300
contacts based on their social
sensitivity I don't think that I've ever

00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:24.310
sensitivity I don't think that I've ever
 

00:59:24.310 --> 00:59:28.350
sensitivity I don't think that I've ever
seen that in any environment and the

00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:28.360
seen that in any environment and the
 

00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:30.000
seen that in any environment and the
question is whether that that

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:30.010
question is whether that that
 

00:59:30.010 --> 00:59:33.240
question is whether that that
generalizes the lots of other tasks

00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:33.250

where you need to wear the behavior of
the other side might be predictable

00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:37.510
the other side might be predictable
 

00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:39.810
the other side might be predictable
based on the past where women would pay

00:59:39.810 --> 00:59:39.820
based on the past where women would pay
 

00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:41.790
based on the past where women would pay
attention to that and men would lose

00:59:41.790 --> 00:59:41.800
attention to that and men would lose
 

00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:44.700
attention to that and men would lose
that and I'm thinking about them so you

00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:44.710
that and I'm thinking about them so you
 

00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:46.380
that and I'm thinking about them so you
know about you know what the

00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:46.390
know about you know what the
 

00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:47.850
know about you know what the
Brandenburger have this book on

00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:47.860
Brandenburger have this book on
 

00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:49.320
Brandenburger have this book on
cooperation which is all about

00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:49.330
cooperation which is all about
 

00:59:49.330 --> 00:59:51.060
cooperation which is all about
identifying when you need to cooperate

00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:51.070
identifying when you need to cooperate
 

00:59:51.070 --> 00:59:53.970
identifying when you need to cooperate
with your dependents yeah and sort of

00:59:53.970 --> 00:59:53.980
with your dependents yeah and sort of
 

00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:56.010
with your dependents yeah and sort of

and people think I'm good women do a

01:00:01.650 --> 01:00:01.660
and people think I'm good women do a
 

01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:03.660
and people think I'm good women do a
better job if you gave them some

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:03.670
better job if you gave them some
 

01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:08.010

information about yeah that's a very

01:00:08.010 --> 01:00:08.020
information about yeah that's a very
 

01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:10.590
information about yeah that's a very
interesting question like it somewhat

01:00:10.590 --> 01:00:10.600
interesting question like it somewhat
 

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:13.560

they
did something bad

01:00:28.059 --> 01:00:28.069

a lot less likely to mention that to

think I mean that's you know like just
 

01:00:53.530 --> 01:00:55.470

very preliminary research so I don't

01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:55.480
very preliminary research so I don't
 

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.720
very preliminary research so I don't
think it you know expense these results

01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:57.730
think it you know expense these results
 

01:00:57.730 --> 01:01:00.750

investor ones research they show that

they make bad decisions before they

that so I don't think it these results

01:01:41.449 --> 01:01:41.459
that so I don't think it these results
 

01:01:41.459 --> 01:01:44.239
that so I don't think it these results
cannot be like generalize to everything

01:01:44.239 --> 01:01:44.249
cannot be like generalize to everything

cannot be like generalize to everything
I don't know yeah

01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:49.799
I don't know yeah
 

01:01:49.799 --> 01:01:51.709
 
I think there's other I think even if

01:01:51.709 --> 01:01:51.719
I think there's other I think even if
 

01:01:51.719 --> 01:01:53.509
I think there's other I think even if
you go back to like the old like Ruben

01:01:53.509 --> 01:01:53.519
you go back to like the old like Ruben
 

01:01:53.519 --> 01:01:55.729
you go back to like the old like Ruben
and brown maybe this they look at least

01:01:55.729 --> 01:01:55.739
and brown maybe this they look at least
 

01:01:55.739 --> 01:01:57.919
and brown maybe this they look at least
they did all these um kind of like you

01:01:57.919 --> 01:01:57.929
they did all these um kind of like you
 

01:01:57.929 --> 01:01:59.839
they did all these um kind of like you
know genders personality studies and

01:01:59.839 --> 01:01:59.849
know genders personality studies and
 

01:01:59.849 --> 01:02:02.029
know genders personality studies and
actually women that the results are very

01:02:02.029 --> 01:02:02.039
actually women that the results are very
 

01:02:02.039 --> 01:02:03.949
actually women that the results are very
similar to what you described you know

01:02:03.949 --> 01:02:03.959
similar to what you described you know
 

01:02:03.959 --> 01:02:06.679
similar to what you described you know
with women not men men actually changing

01:02:06.679 --> 01:02:06.689
with women not men men actually changing

with women not men men actually changing
their play in games with you know

01:02:10.609 --> 01:02:10.619
their play in games with you know
 

01:02:10.619 --> 01:02:12.589
their play in games with you know
cooperative potential and women not you

know like persisting in retaliation

01:02:14.059 --> 01:02:14.069
know like persisting in retaliation
 

01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:16.789

after after defection and stuff like
 

01:02:16.799 --> 01:02:18.289

that so I mean it so you don't and you

01:02:18.289 --> 01:02:18.299
that so I mean it so you don't and you
 

01:02:18.299 --> 01:02:21.529
that so I mean it so you don't and you
also actually the results on gender and

01:02:21.529 --> 01:02:21.539
also actually the results on gender and
 

01:02:21.539 --> 01:02:23.209
also actually the results on gender and
integrative problem-solving don't really

01:06:26.579 --> 01:06:34.030
just be pulling back because I hold on
there so I'm not sure so the the next

01:06:34.030 --> 01:06:34.040
 
 

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.830
 
people mashup rational people mentioned

01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:35.840
people mashup rational people mentioned
 

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:39.970
people mashup rational people mentioned
which are the very high overlap that the

01:06:39.970 --> 01:06:39.980
which are the very high overlap that the
 

01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:42.700
which are the very high overlap that the
first category was a concern for the

01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:42.710
first category was a concern for the
 

01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:44.430
first category was a concern for the
other

01:06:44.430 --> 01:06:44.440
other
 

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:48.090
other
this was like typically national

01:06:48.090 --> 01:06:48.100
this was like typically national
 

01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:50.420
this was like typically national
like oh you know like I wanted to repair

01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:50.430
like oh you know like I wanted to repair
 

01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:52.980
like oh you know like I wanted to repair
don't they tackle the census like I

01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:52.990
don't they tackle the census like I
 

01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:57.329
don't they tackle the census like I
don't know what to do that person

01:06:57.329 --> 01:06:57.339
 
 

01:06:57.339 --> 01:07:01.589
 
another person and then the third

01:07:01.589 --> 01:07:01.599
another person and then the third
 

01:07:01.599 --> 01:07:03.329
another person and then the third
explanation which is I think pretty

01:07:03.329 --> 01:07:03.339
explanation which is I think pretty
 

01:07:03.339 --> 01:07:05.450
explanation which is I think pretty
interesting is like a utilitarian

01:07:05.450 --> 01:07:05.460
interesting is like a utilitarian
 

01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:09.259
interesting is like a utilitarian
pragmatic reason for not engaging in

01:07:09.259 --> 01:07:09.269
pragmatic reason for not engaging in
 

01:07:09.269 --> 01:07:13.079
pragmatic reason for not engaging in
distracted competition so this was about

01:07:13.079 --> 01:07:13.089
distracted competition so this was about
 

01:07:13.089 --> 01:07:15.950
distracted competition so this was about
twenty five percent of the participant

01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:15.960
twenty five percent of the participant
 

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:18.900
twenty five percent of the participant
so this is like oh i thought i was going

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:18.910
so this is like oh i thought i was going
 

01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:22.440
so this is like oh i thought i was going
to win anyway or I was winning anyway so

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:22.450
to win anyway or I was winning anyway so
 

01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:27.109
to win anyway or I was winning anyway so
why would I engage in

01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119
 
 

01:07:27.119 --> 01:07:29.900
 
I think so we're a lot more likely done

01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:29.910
I think so we're a lot more likely done
 

01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:30.510
I think so we're a lot more likely done

I just want a question propagation maybe

01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079
I just want a question propagation maybe
 

01:08:00.079 --> 01:08:01.390
I just want a question propagation maybe
i missed the explain so i missed this

01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:01.400
i missed the explain so i missed this
 

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.160
i missed the explain so i missed this
but they're playing against the same

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:03.170
but they're playing against the same
 

01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:05.499
but they're playing against the same
person all the time and then they see

01:08:05.499 --> 01:08:05.509
person all the time and then they see
 

01:08:05.509 --> 01:08:08.349
person all the time and then they see
how they did but today today which out

01:08:08.349 --> 01:08:08.359
how they did but today today which out
 

01:08:08.359 --> 01:08:10.539
how they did but today today which out
today they deduct points from the other

01:08:10.539 --> 01:08:10.549
today they deduct points from the other
 

01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:14.620
today they deduct points from the other
side but is it like it is that the point

01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:14.630
side but is it like it is that the point
 

01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:16.450
side but is it like it is that the point
reduction are they do they presume

01:08:16.450 --> 01:08:16.460
reduction are they do they presume
 

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:18.669

that's invisible liked it or like in the

that's invisible liked it or like in the
end the other side because the other

01:08:19.599 --> 01:08:19.609
end the other side because the other
 

01:08:19.609 --> 01:08:22.120
end the other side because the other
side never reduces points right so that

01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:22.130
side never reduces points right so that
 

01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:23.620
side never reduces points right so that
so they don't that be so they're kind of

01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:23.630
so they don't that be so they're kind of
 

01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:25.629
so they don't that be so they're kind of
doing point reductions blindly without

01:08:25.629 --> 01:08:25.639
doing point reductions blindly without
 

01:08:25.639 --> 01:08:27.430
doing point reductions blindly without
knowing whether the other side is

01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:27.440
knowing whether the other side is
 

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:28.870
knowing whether the other side is
reducing points on them and the other

01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:28.880
reducing points on them and the other
 

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:30.760
reducing points on them and the other
side never reduces points on them yeah

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:30.770
side never reduces points on them yeah
 

01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:38.079

01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:11.530
 
so I already talked about this a little

01:09:11.530 --> 01:09:11.540
so I already talked about this a little
 

01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:14.140
so I already talked about this a little
bit it seemed like most people to issue

01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:14.150
bit it seemed like most people to issue
 

01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:15.550
bit it seemed like most people to issue

those who assume something
 

01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:26.610
those who assume something
then I seem to have any effect

01:09:26.610 --> 01:09:26.620
 
 

01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:30.450
 
so

01:09:30.450 --> 01:09:30.460
 
 

01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:32.270

01:09:32.270 --> 01:09:32.280
too I guess
 

01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:35.270
too I guess
I mean cab all of our findings we're

from their less selective and higher

01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:15.680
 
 

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:18.130
 
we also think that our results of my

01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:23.160
might shed some light into seemingly
contradictory findings in the literature

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:23.170
contradictory findings in the literature
 

01:10:23.170 --> 01:10:26.080
contradictory findings in the literature
so passage searcher found that past

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:26.090

01:10:26.090 --> 01:10:29.890
so passage searcher found that past
research found that women they do not

01:10:29.890 --> 01:10:29.900
research found that women they do not
 

01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:31.360
research found that women they do not
like to compete they shy away from

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:31.370
like to compete they shy away from
 

01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:34.030
like to compete they shy away from
competitive environments but they can be

01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:34.040
competitive environments but they can be
 

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:36.250
competitive environments but they can be
very competitive with each other the

01:10:36.250 --> 01:10:36.260
very competitive with each other the
 

01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:37.960
very competitive with each other the
point of blocking or sabotaging each

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:37.970
point of blocking or sabotaging each
 

01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:41.440
point of blocking or sabotaging each
other isms so

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:41.450
 
 

01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:45.740
 
so we think that actually there is

01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:45.750
so we think that actually there is
 

01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:47.420
so we think that actually there is
research by rogue analysis shows that

this kind of these type of behavior

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:50.210
this kind of these type of behavior
 

01:10:50.210 --> 01:10:53.100
this kind of these type of behavior
sabotaging each other women

01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:53.110
sabotaging each other women
 

01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:55.530
sabotaging each other women
be kind to happen a male-dominated lot

so as a result ironically they might be

01:11:26.610 --> 01:11:26.620
so as a result ironically they might be
 

01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:28.410
so as a result ironically they might be
more likely to engagements of a posh

01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:28.420
more likely to engagements of a posh
 

01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:34.580

01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:39.300
 
and that would actually ironically exist

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:39.310
and that would actually ironically exist
 

01:11:39.310 --> 01:11:40.800

we rate though the gender gap in these

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:40.810
we rate though the gender gap in these

01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:49.200
 
and finally I guess more generally these

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:49.210
and finally I guess more generally these
 

01:11:49.210 --> 01:11:51.540
and finally I guess more generally these
results we'll see then show some money

extent seems like organizations might be

01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560
extent seems like organizations might be
 

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.100
extent seems like organizations might be
better off with structuring their

01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:07.110
better off with structuring their
 

01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:11.340
better off with structuring their
internalization competitions as low

01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:11.350
 
 

01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:12.960
 
they also need to keep in mind that that

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:12.970
they also need to keep in mind that that
 

01:12:12.970 --> 01:12:15.180
they also need to keep in mind that that
might actually

01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:15.190
might actually
 

01:12:15.190 --> 01:12:20.910
might actually
create the gender gap

01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:20.920
 
 

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:24.390
 
so I'm actually nice

01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400
so I'm actually nice
 

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:29.959
so I'm actually nice
things already so

questions
we live a minute so once you just want

01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:33.280
we live a minute so once you just want
 

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:38.189
we live a minute so once you just want
to kind of wrap up with your so this is

01:12:38.189 --> 01:12:38.199
to kind of wrap up with your so this is
 

01:12:38.199 --> 01:12:41.400
to kind of wrap up with your so this is
something I already mentioned max asked

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:41.410
something I already mentioned max asked
 

01:12:41.410 --> 01:12:44.700
something I already mentioned max asked
his question so he saw that man's

01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:44.710
his question so he saw that man's
 

01:12:44.710 --> 01:12:46.410
his question so he saw that man's
behavior was not responsive to changes

01:12:46.410 --> 01:12:46.420
behavior was not responsive to changes
 

01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:50.310
behavior was not responsive to changes
in the competition a market but so we

01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:50.320
in the competition a market but so we
 

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:53.070
in the competition a market but so we
conclude that and are not responsive to

01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:53.080
conclude that and are not responsive to
 

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:54.300
conclude that and are not responsive to
the changes in the competitive

01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:54.310
the changes in the competitive
 

01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:56.910
the changes in the competitive
environment but we didn't compare their

01:12:56.910 --> 01:12:56.920
environment but we didn't compare their
 

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.459
environment but we didn't compare their
behavior between a competitive and

01:12:59.459 --> 01:12:59.469
behavior between a competitive and
 

01:12:59.469 --> 01:13:01.830
behavior between a competitive and
non-competitive situation it might be

01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:01.840
non-competitive situation it might be
 

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:04.110
non-competitive situation it might be
that they're just not paying that much

01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:04.120
that they're just not paying that much
 

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.610
that they're just not paying that much
attention to their social context in

01:13:05.610 --> 01:13:05.620
attention to their social context in
 

01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:06.780
attention to their social context in
general so we don't know if it's the

01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:06.790
general so we don't know if it's the
 

01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:08.820
general so we don't know if it's the
competitive context works or social

01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:08.830
competitive context works or social
 

01:13:08.830 --> 01:13:10.919
competitive context works or social
context in general that they're not

01:13:10.919 --> 01:13:10.929
context in general that they're not
 

01:13:10.929 --> 01:13:14.850

pay attention to

01:13:14.850 --> 01:13:14.860
 
 

01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:19.300
 
and finally we also just you know looked

01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:19.310
and finally we also just you know looked
 

01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:22.750
and finally we also just you know looked
at the ratio

01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:22.760
at the ratio
 

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.670
at the ratio
the prizes and winner-takes-all and

01:13:24.670 --> 01:13:24.680
the prizes and winner-takes-all and
 

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:26.950
the prizes and winner-takes-all and
reward schemes was a constant ratio

01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:26.960
reward schemes was a constant ratio
 

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:29.830
reward schemes was a constant ratio
across all studies so as I resolved and

01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.840
across all studies so as I resolved and
 

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:33.419
across all studies so as I resolved and
expect the payoffs

01:13:33.419 --> 01:13:33.429
 
 

01:13:33.429 --> 01:13:36.709
 
from

01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719
 
 

01:13:36.719 --> 01:13:38.989
 
the scheme was Scott was constant so

01:13:38.989 --> 01:13:38.999
the scheme was Scott was constant so
 

01:13:38.999 --> 01:13:40.580
the scheme was Scott was constant so
we're kind of generalizing results based

01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:40.590
we're kind of generalizing results based
 

01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:43.009
we're kind of generalizing results based
on that but it might be interesting to

01:13:43.009 --> 01:13:43.019
on that but it might be interesting to
 

01:13:43.019 --> 01:13:45.469
on that but it might be interesting to
shrink or expand up expected payoffs

01:13:45.469 --> 01:13:45.479
shrink or expand up expected payoffs
 

01:13:45.479 --> 01:13:47.150
shrink or expand up expected payoffs
between different

01:13:47.150 --> 01:13:47.160
between different
 

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:49.350
between different
situations and see you know like maybe

01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:49.360
situations and see you know like maybe
 

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:52.460
situations and see you know like maybe
if through the gap you know gets wider

01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:52.470
if through the gap you know gets wider
 

01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:57.600
if through the gap you know gets wider
you might see more sensitivity in kv r

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:57.610
you might see more sensitivity in kv r
 

01:13:57.610 --> 01:14:00.060
you might see more sensitivity in kv r
so on so forth so it's sort of like you

01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:00.070
so on so forth so it's sort of like you
 

01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:03.060
so on so forth so it's sort of like you
run against a civilian up on these

01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:03.070
run against a civilian up on these
 

01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:07.260
run against a civilian up on these
results of people

01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:07.270
 
 

01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:10.470
 
I guess finally there are some other

01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:10.480
I guess finally there are some other
 

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.990
I guess finally there are some other
managerial tools that can be used in the

01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:13.000
managerial tools that can be used in the
 

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.150
managerial tools that can be used in the
real world to counter this kind of

01:14:15.150 --> 01:14:15.160
real world to counter this kind of
 

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:17.330
real world to counter this kind of
behavior we just use behavioral norms

01:14:17.330 --> 01:14:17.340
behavior we just use behavioral norms
 

01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:20.580
behavior we just use behavioral norms
but obviously organizations they can

01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:20.590
but obviously organizations they can
 

01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:23.160
but obviously organizations they can
allow baseless punishments or doors for

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:23.170
allow baseless punishments or doors for
 

01:14:23.170 --> 01:14:27.890
allow baseless punishments or doors for
behavior so

01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:27.900
 
 

01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:29.570
 
you might be able to get different

01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:29.580
you might be able to get different
 

01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:31.650
you might be able to get different
results

01:14:31.650 --> 01:14:31.660
results
 

01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:36.070
results
they're such explicit stronger materials

01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080
they're such explicit stronger materials
 

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:44.350
they're such explicit stronger materials
