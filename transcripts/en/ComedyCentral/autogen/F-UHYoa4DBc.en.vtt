00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:01.834
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:00:01.867 --> 00:00:03.369
Sheriff's department!
We need this van!

00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:05.538
Sheriff's department!
Stay in your vehicle!

00:00:05.571 --> 00:00:07.340
Well it looks like
we've been commandeered

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:08.942
by the Reno Sheriff's
Department.

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:21.988
Okay we got this goddamn hippie

00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:24.157
who's been sitting up in this
tree for months at a time.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.359
The Reno Pine
will never come down!

00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:27.760
This thing is going to be
chopped down

00:00:27.793 --> 00:00:29.829
and made into hardwood floors!

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:31.197
He's a fascinating character.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.398
He's a fixture now.

00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:34.467
We don't have that many
tourist attractions here

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.602
so we want to keep him up there
as long as we possibly can.

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:38.404
You goddamn dirty hippie!

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:42.108
I've had some boots on layaway
here at the Zapato Bilorena.

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:43.743
For western fashion here
at Reno

00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:45.945
you really can't beat
Zapato Bilorena.

00:00:45.978 --> 00:00:48.181
Well you can but not
at these prices really.

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:51.751
Here in the Reno area,
you should check out

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:54.520
Trudy's Scratching Post Bed
and Breakfast.

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:56.255
It's not very expensive.

00:00:56.288 --> 00:00:59.025
Just bring a sleeping bag
and it's cozy and fun

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:03.763
and I have 13 cats so come in
and give them a squeeze.

00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:07.733
So is he on any kind of drugs
or alcohol

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.001
or anything of that kind?

00:01:09.034 --> 00:01:11.637
No he just said he was
jacked up on Red Bull.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.005
I just had a bad show
last night.

00:01:13.038 --> 00:01:14.774
I didn't mean to take it out
on the hotel property.

00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:16.109
I do have a check
in my robe

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:18.044
if it was possible
I can maybe cover the damages.

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:19.879
$15000 cover it?
Yes.

00:01:19.912 --> 00:01:21.114
Ooh, a lot of zeros.

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:22.615
How much you've bench, man?

00:01:22.648 --> 00:01:27.453
I was acting you dumb
mother (bleep)!

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:29.189
It's a rubber check.

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:32.558
And friends don't use
swear words

00:01:32.591 --> 00:01:36.129
and if they do
they're just a (bleep)

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:39.398
And that means
ass-(bleep)

00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:41.000
(bleep) Lady.

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:42.735
Okay. We kind of (bleep) up.

00:01:43.435 --> 00:01:45.438
Okay we are jumping the shark!

00:01:49.575 --> 00:01:51.544
Oh God. (bleep) (bleep)

00:01:51.577 --> 00:01:56.048
Oh my God I'm gonna
throw up!

00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:59.952
Squeak there she was!
Holler back squeak!

00:01:59.985 --> 00:02:02.122
Holler! That's how we do it
in Reno, bitch!

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:05.658
Oh (bleep) I hit the truck
with a bottle!

00:02:10.996 --> 00:02:12.231
What is that sound?

00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:14.367
The sound...of freedom!

00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:21.107
Hey buddy! Mayor Reno!

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.441
Pleasure to meet you.

00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:24.577
How are you?

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.312
You look fantastic mayor.

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.215
Thanks a lot.
I feel like a million dollars.

00:02:29.248 --> 00:02:30.917
Your crown is-

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.953
Mayor crown. Mayor crown?
The pope wears a hat.

00:02:33.986 --> 00:02:36.622
I have a crown.
Funny how it worked out.

00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:38.991
That's what we say in Reno.
(bleep) it.

00:02:39.024 --> 00:02:41.694
Suck it, shove it, do it!

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:47.033
This has been a message from
the Reno Sheriff's department.

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:55.875
Yeah, yeah. That's what
I'm talking about.

00:02:57.876 --> 00:02:59.579
Move it, yeah.
