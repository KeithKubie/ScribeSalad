00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:03.369
Jimmy:<i> The thing about
 this film is that</i>

00:00:03.369 --> 00:00:09.108
<i>the intention behind it was to
show a side of climbing that</i>

00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:12.945 line:0%
I didn't think that mainstream
audience really got.

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:15.214 line:0%
<i> We embarked in 2008
 on this climb</i>

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:16.583 line:0%
<i> and started
 shooting together</i>

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:20.487 line:0%
but one of the themes that we
talk about in the film is risk.

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:21.520 line:0%
( sound of pitons
and ascenders )

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.991 line:0%
<i> So much of being a
 climber and alpinist is</i>

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:26.826 line:0%
<i>obviously risk assessment,</i>

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:29.862
<i> but you're also
struggling to move upwards.</i>

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:33.867
It's a very kind of calculated
space you have to be in

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.835
and you have to
constantly balance

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:39.705
what your ego is telling you
and, your drive, and

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:41.173
the safety of the team.

00:00:41.173 --> 00:00:42.541
Chai:<i> Well, risk was this</i>

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:45.244 line:0%
I mean, it was constant dialogue
because what we were--

00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:50.549 line:0%
In this dream to have
this film kind of speak to

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:53.986
a more general audience,
we had to address this idea of

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:58.224
"are they bonkers or not"?,
like, "are they totally crazy"?

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:02.962
And the "crazy" question
always worked against that

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:04.697
because then people
would write them off

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:06.065
"they're just crazy".

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:08.201
And then another
side of this is that

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:12.004
the climbing community and
genre is quite understated.

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:14.774
Like, if you ask them
was that difficult

00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:17.811
they're like,
"It was fine.

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:19.445
We almost died,
but it was fine."

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:21.714
You know, it's a very,
very understated culture

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:22.982
and there's like,
I've got some--

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:25.251
like, I'm allowed to make fun
of Jimmy for this a little bit

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.787
because I'm his wife and
his film-making partner

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:29.989
but it's just... I wanted--

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:31.490
It was important for me
to include the next clip

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.259
that we're going to show

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.626
because it was just
an interesting

00:01:34.626 --> 00:01:36.862
and it wasn't included
originally and I...

00:01:36.862 --> 00:01:40.467
it spoke to the understatement
of the culture, and...

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:43.002
how Jimmy was loathe to
put himself in the movie.

00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:46.972
Five, four, three, two, one.

00:01:46.972 --> 00:01:49.108
Xavier De La Rue.

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:52.745
( instrumental music )

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:54.680
Jeremy:<i> The general mood
 was pretty light</i>

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.016
<i> our objective for the
 day had been reached.</i>

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:58.217
<i> Good vibes.</i>

00:01:58.717 --> 00:02:01.554
<i> Our conversation
 before dropping in was</i>

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:04.390
go one at a time, make sure
everyone's in a safe spot.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.525
Drop in!

00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:10.563
Jimmy:<i> So,
Jeremy made a couple of turns</i>

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.400
<i> cut up on the side
 of this safe zone.</i>

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:16.302
<i> Called me in,</i>

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:19.739
<i>and I make a turn right next
 to his turn, and then,</i>

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:20.974
<i> and then I feel it...</i>

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:23.409
the whole slope... shift.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.745
( sound of avalanche )

00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:28.948
Jeremy:
<i> I yell avalanche.</i>

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:32.718
<i> Just screaming,
"get out, get out, get out."</i>

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.122
Jimmy:<i> For a moment it looks
 like slow motion</i>

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:39.158
<i>and the next moment everything
went to fast forward, and</i>

00:02:39.591 --> 00:02:41.728
it just... I got swept.

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:44.063
<i> I'm airborne.</i>

00:02:44.997 --> 00:02:46.432
<i> Totally weightless.</i>

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:49.068
( sound of avalanche )

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:50.436
Jeremy:
<i> And I lost sight of him.</i>

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:53.439
That was the last I saw
Jimmy and the slide...

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:57.443
just kept going and going
and going and going.

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:03.949
Jimmy:<i> I just got crushed under
an ocean of car-sized blocks.</i>

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.920
<i>Probably going 70-80 miles
 an hour,</i>

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.089
<i>down 2,000 vertical feet.</i>

00:03:11.157 --> 00:03:13.826
<i> And in my mind,
 I heard this voice</i>

00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:15.561
<i>having this conversation,
 it was like</i>

00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:18.865
why I always wondered
how I was going to die

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:20.299
and now, now I know.

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:24.671
-( sound of avalanche )
-( trees snapping )

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:29.609
Jimmy:<i> I was just expecting
 to get torn to pieces</i>

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.178
<i> but after a while it
 started to slow down</i>

00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:34.580
<i>and this weird undercurrent</i>

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.651
started pushing me up
through the snow, and

00:03:38.984 --> 00:03:43.189
at the last moment I popped
out of the toe of this thing

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.359
<i> buried up to my chest.</i>

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.228
<i>I was in that moment being like</i>

00:03:49.228 --> 00:03:51.464
<i> "Oh, my god,
 I'm in one piece"</i>

00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:54.500
like I coughed up this
huge chunk of snow

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.736
and I took this huge
breath and I was like

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:57.904
( sound of deep breath )

00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:00.740
and I looked at my arms
and I was like, I mean

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.409
<i>I couldn't even believe I'm
still connected to my body.</i>

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.144
And then...

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.848
yeah, it was a lot.
