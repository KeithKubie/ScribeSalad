ARUN NAGARAJAN:
Hello and welcome

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.110
to Google Developers Live.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.710
My name is Arun
Nagarajan and I'm

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.940
with the Google Apps
Developer Relations team.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.910
Today we have a very
special guest on the show.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.120
We have a great partner,
Avery, and they're

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.540
going to be talking about the
great Google Docs and Google

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.610
Sheets add-ons that
they've been working on.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.770
And before we dive
into all the demos

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.200
and interesting
conversation, I want

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.925
to have Brad introduce himself.

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:30.716
BRAD NELSON: Hello.

00:00:30.716 --> 00:00:33.810
My name is Brad Nelson from
Avery Products Corporation.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.580
I'm very glad to be here
with Arun, seeing you again

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.740
after Google I/O.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.030
The business I'm in is
being able to have people

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.340
buy our various
products from Staples,

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.560
or whatever distributor
might have it.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.520
Take the stock home and
load it in your printer.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.170
Use one of our applications
to design a customized label

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.780
or card.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.450
Perhaps a business card
or a greeting card.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.260
And then you print it right
on your own printer at home.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.620
We have materials suited
for inkjet and for lasers.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.582
So we got you covered
as the consumer.

00:01:07.582 --> 00:01:08.790
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.991
Why don't we actually do a
very quick demo of the product?

00:01:11.991 --> 00:01:12.490
The add-on.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.560
BRAD NELSON: I'd
be glad to do that.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.983
ARUN NAGARAJAN: All right.

00:01:13.983 --> 00:01:15.280
Let's take a quick look.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.130
BRAD NELSON: So this was
developed with a Google Apps

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.660
Script.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.690
And we've been working on it
on and off for a few months.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.260
I wouldn't say we've been
spending full time on it.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.900
But it's been really easy to do.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.440
I really like the technology.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.450
My background is quite a bit
of client-server, Java, Flash,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.680
HTML.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.960
And so I'm very
familiar with the model.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.330
And it was quite simple and
easy to put this application

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.160
together.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.250
So let's dive into it.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.130
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Let's do it.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.504
BRAD NELSON: So this is called
Avery Design and Print app

00:01:46.504 --> 00:01:47.840
for Google Drive.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.270
And on our first screen--
this is a web-based release.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.870
We could either pick between
a Google Spreadsheet or Google

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.130
Contacts.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.890
So let's say that
I pick Spreadsheet

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.410
and then I hit the Next button.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.370
Very simple interface.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.450
It shows a list of
all the spreadsheets

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.169
that I have in my
own Google Drive.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.111
And so I'll just
pick one of these.

00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:15.050
Call it Address List.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.720
I have to press a button here so
that I can run Apps Script that

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.260
will actually parse
that spreadsheet

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.880
and convert it
into a CSB stream.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.800
And once I've done that,
there'll be a little spinner.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.940
It finishes and if I
hit the Merge button,

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.580
I'll actually be
taking that data

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.230
into our website for a merge.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.820
But what I'd rather do is show
that second step with Contacts.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.140
So we'll just back up here.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.740
And we'll do the same process.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.610
We'll start with Contacts
instead of Spreadsheets.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.410
Go to Next.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.110
And I have the option of picking
either home or work addresses.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.860
Because we're going to make
mailing labels from Contacts.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.840
And I can actually,
after picking one,

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.450
say well what if there
isn't a home address.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.640
There's only a work address.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.020
So we have this little check box
there that says use either one.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.440
So it'll prefer home.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.050
If it's not there it'll
look for a work address.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.940
Again, I have to go grab
the Contacts and format

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.700
that into a CSB format,
and now I'm ready to merge.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.810
At this point we're going to
enter the Design and Print

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.240
Online application.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.040
And while that loads,
we have a large range

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.040
of products on the left
side of the screen here,

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.850
business cards, labels.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.410
I'm going to go with a label.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.650
The 5160 is very
common mailing label.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.340
I'm just going to show
a series of designs.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.890
These are called
pre-design templates.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.145
So we'll just pick
any one of those.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.770
And after it loads
the template, you

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.710
see that merged data that's
come out of Contacts.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.150
So we show a
spreadsheet format here.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.710
And if you want to not include
all the rows of contacts,

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.030
you can simply disable the
ones you don't want to merge.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.760
And then you can go on.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.480
At this step, we are allowing
you to do a drag and drop

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.829
interface so that
you can specify where

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.750
you want the fields from
that contact list to show up.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.750
And typically, it would
just be Name, Address.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.780
And I can drag over Country.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.300
And so these fields
are filled in.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.650
And the merge will be completed.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.270
And now we'll go to
the design canvas

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.320
and you can see the actual data.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.750
So this is one of the
contacts in my contact list.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.490
Here's a few more.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.990
So each one of these
labels here has

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.730
been merged from
Google Contacts.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.120
So that's really
nice Apps Script.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.780
And to complete
the demo, we would

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.540
go into Preview and Printing.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.530
So you could see what
the sheet of Avery labels

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.730
would look like.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.570
This is a shipping label format.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.494
But this is a 30 up-- we
call it-- mailing label.

00:05:07.494 --> 00:05:08.910
And I'm going to
go ahead and show

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.950
that we create a PDF
file, which we can open.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.642
And at this point
we can print it.

00:05:16.642 --> 00:05:18.100
ARUN NAGARAJAN:
Well thank you very

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.410
much for sharing that with us.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.330
And giving your
insights on Apps Script.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.530
And I hope you found
that really useful.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.320
And more importantly, I hope
you go check out the add-on

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.760
and install it and try it out.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.989
I think it's going
to be really useful.

00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:31.280
Especially around the holidays.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.595
Especially around
other times when

00:05:33.595 --> 00:05:35.720
you need to send out a lot
of either greeting cards

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.610
or mailing labels.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:37.861
I know I've used the products.

00:05:37.861 --> 00:05:38.943
BRAD NELSON: That's great.

00:05:38.943 --> 00:05:41.680
Well we're looking forward to
doing an add-in on your store

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.180
next.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.910
An app for the store
that you suggested

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.180
to us for spreadsheets.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.870
So that will be
our next evolution.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:48.786
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Great.

00:05:48.786 --> 00:05:50.295
Thank you very much.
