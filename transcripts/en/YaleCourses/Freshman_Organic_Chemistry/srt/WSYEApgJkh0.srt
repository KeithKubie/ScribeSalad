1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,840
Okay.
So for 150 years,

2
00:00:03,841 --> 00:00:06,900
organic chemists have
10 chemistry courses,

3
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:10,260
have tended to acquire
a daunting reputation.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,910
Uh,
so you need help.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,690
I know you're very able,
but trust me, you need help.

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,170
So where do you do to help the power
points are available on the web?

7
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:24,420
How many of you have already
seen the PowerPoint for today?

8
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:29,040
Just so I have some idea. So about
a quarter of your maybe. Okay.

9
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:29,874
But anyhow,

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,420
so your lecture notes are important but
you don't have to worry about getting

11
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:37,410
everything down cause you can download
it from the web and I do it on a Mac,

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,710
but I try my best to make it compatible
with pcs and even with the free PC

13
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:47,810
viewer for PowerPoint. So you should be
able to see it, but I don't see it on,

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,700
on a PC,
so if anything doesn't come through,

15
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:55,050
let me know so that I
can fix it. Uh, okay.

16
00:00:55,051 --> 00:00:59,460
Then in class discussion is very
important and if you're really,

17
00:00:59,461 --> 00:01:04,050
really shy and can't participate
in, uh, in discussion in class,

18
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:08,820
then email me a question. Okay.
There's the course website,

19
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:13,821
which is our substitute for a text that
also includes the PowerPoint and there's

20
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:18,070
the link for it. And when you go
there you'll see it, uh, develop its,

21
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,330
it's the current website is
mostly last year's course,

22
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,640
so it'll change a little
bit as we go along.

23
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:26,310
But fundamentally it's the same if you
want to look ahead and you'll see pretty

24
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:28,580
much what's coming up.
Uh,

25
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,710
there'll be assigned problems
and questions and also
their previous exams and

26
00:01:33,871 --> 00:01:38,550
answer keys. All these things are on the
course website, so you'll get help there.

27
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,930
Uh, but one thing that's really
special is the course Wiki.

28
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:43,950
This is the third year.

29
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:47,370
We've done it in the second
year in a really systematic way.

30
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,060
So you get assigned to do,

31
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,490
to cover a couple of
frames of the PowerPoint.

32
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,930
So those are the ones you really
need to take careful notes on. Okay.

33
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,960
And write them up and if
and help other people too.

34
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:04,950
That's the nature of a Wiki is, you know,
how many of you participated in a Wiki?

35
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,830
Well, by next week it
will be all of you. Okay.

36
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,570
But in order to get credit for it,

37
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:16,620
you have to get it by the
night after the lecture. Right?

38
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:19,560
So for lecture today,
you have to get it by late tomorrow night,

39
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:23,670
36 hours after the lecture.
This is so other students can can use it.

40
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,930
Okay. In the, in the spring
they'll probably be a textbook.

41
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:30,690
I haven't really decided yet.
These things cost an arm and a leg.

42
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:34,200
Maybe we can find one
that's used that, uh, uh,

43
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,650
older edition that doesn't make any
difference except to the publishers.

44
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,560
Okay. Also, there's personal
help like from me and there's,

45
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,730
and you can find my phone
number, email and so on, on the,

46
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,380
on the website also the two
graduate student TA's who
are assigned to the course

47
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,210
who are Philip Collins Collins Itch,

48
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,710
Colin's itch fellow back there.
And Nathan,

49
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,670
uh, fly, not slash lie. Okay.

50
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:12,090
So these are graduate students in
chemistry and they run these, uh,

51
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,340
the discussion sections.
Uh,

52
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,380
typically you have a 50
minute discussion section,

53
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:22,330
but the way we run it in this course is
that, uh, on two different nights a week,

54
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:25,660
there are two hour sessions. You can
come to any part of it. You want to,

55
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,770
you can go to both of them.

56
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:30,220
You can go to four hours a week if you
want to or you can go to none at all if

57
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:32,260
you want to write.
So it really,

58
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,740
for the bookkeeping
purposes of the department,

59
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:37,450
you have to sign up for a section,

60
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,280
sign up for any section you want to write
and then come to what's useful for you.

61
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,193
Uh,

62
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,640
but also the reason you pay the big
bucks to come here is not to hear me.

63
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:52,060
It's the interact with the other students.
That's a really big help.

64
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,790
So form study groups,
right?

65
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:59,230
And in fact you can get advice from
previous people who've taken the course

66
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,420
that's on the web also.
There's some of them,

67
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:04,480
there's a list of them on the web who
would be happy to talk to you if you,

68
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,550
if you need it.
Uh,

69
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:12,150
and we're blessed with three
alumni seniors who took
this course as freshmen who

70
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:16,210
act as what are called peer tutors.

71
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:20,020
And they'll run a session Sunday evening
from eight to 10:00 PM is the current

72
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:20,650
plan.

73
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,370
We'll announce the rooms for these things
on the website and probably by email

74
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:28,930
to you as well. So let me
introduce Tina. Whoa. Okay.

75
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,240
And Drew Klein and Justin. Ken. So
there'll be a big help to you too.

76
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,040
So there's plenty of plenty of
personal help. So use it. Okay.

77
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,130
Uh, these are the dates. We're
going to have exams there,

78
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,940
10 lectures and none of the exam. Nine
lectures, exam nine lectures exam.

79
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,690
Actually if you check,
you'll find that uh, and the,

80
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,940
and also you get 50 points
for participation in the
Wiki and the total is 650

81
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:57,850
points. That's what your
grandma exam is based on. The,

82
00:04:57,851 --> 00:04:59,920
actually this doesn't cover it,

83
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:03,130
that's nine lectures that are covered
on the exam, but the previous Wednesday,

84
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:06,460
part of the lecture is going to be a guest
lecturer that's going to be here just

85
00:05:06,461 --> 00:05:08,710
that day.
So we're putting the exam off,

86
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:12,670
but it'll only cover the
previous material. Not that
that's a big deal. Okay.

87
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,320
And the semester grade is biased.
That is, it's based on this,

88
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,440
your total score here out of 650 points.

89
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:25,000
But if you're near a cutoff and you were
very good about turning in your problem

90
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:28,630
sets and so on, then we boost you
up. Yet we don't grade problem sets,

91
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,310
but if it's worthwhile to do them
right and they might make a difference.

92
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,560
Okay. Uh, okay. So where
are we going with this?

93
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:41,680
What are the goals of our freshmen
organic chemistry? In fact,

94
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:44,590
if you click that in your PowerPoint,
you'll get taken to that site,

95
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,250
but it's right on the website.
You'll see it. Anyhow. Uh,

96
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:53,430
first of is to learn the crucial facts
and vocabulary of organic chemistry after

97
00:05:53,651 --> 00:05:55,240
all.
That's what we think we're here for.

98
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,650
And to develop a theoretical
intuition about how bonding works.

99
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,360
This is the goal for the primary goal of
the first half of the fall semester is

100
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:08,510
to learn how bonding works really.
Right.

101
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,750
And that relates that to molecular
structure and also how bonding changes.

102
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,590
And that of course is reactivity.
But under the line,

103
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,490
there are a lot of other things that we
do in freshman organic chemistry that

104
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:25,250
are arguably just important,
just as important,

105
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,730
like make the scientific transition
from school to university in school.

106
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,700
They try to teach you what
people know in the university.

107
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:38,930
You try to develop new knowledge.
So you need a different mindset for that.

108
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:43,850
And we hope this course helps you develop
that. So learn from organic chemistry,

109
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:48,740
which is really in my view, a model
science, how to be a creative scientist.

110
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,790
So here's, here's a creative scientist
by anybody's measure Louie poster.

111
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,740
And in the 1880s he said this in French,
but in English it says,

112
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:03,010
knowing to be astonished by something is
the minds first step toward discovery.

113
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,240
Another way of putting that is that the
characteristic comment on making a real

114
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:15,410
discovery is not Eureka.
It's, Huh, that's funny,

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,640
right?
So that's what you really have to learn.

116
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:24,470
You learn enough about how chemistry
works and formed this picture in your mind

117
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,490
that when something happens
that doesn't fit, you know,

118
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:31,220
to be astonished so that
you can discover something.

119
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,380
That's exactly what pastor did.

120
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:38,590
And we'll talk about that in the course
and even perhaps more important to

121
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:43,640
develop good taste so that you can
distinguish sense from nonsense.

122
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:49,190
There's certainly more nonsense floating
around and sense and being able to tell

123
00:07:49,191 --> 00:07:50,110
the difference is important.

124
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,120
The way you do it is to develop good taste
by looking a lot of good examples and

125
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:57,950
then you're aware of how
crummy the bad examples are.

126
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:02,510
So we're going to try to emphasize
good examples and have fun.

127
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:07,580
Okay,
so and it as we go along here,

128
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:11,240
if you have questions break in, you'll,
you'll do this much more as we go along.

129
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,074
I know.

130
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:16,400
So the class really is
mostly about theory,

131
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,940
although we described the basis for the
theory and spend a lot of time trying to

132
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:23,810
make it real.

133
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,030
But we require chemistry one 26 hours.
The lab,

134
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:33,470
this is the only chemistry course that
requires you to take a lab simultaneously.

135
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:37,940
So I hope you're all enrolling in that
because there'll be a certain day that

136
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:40,880
you want to be able to take it.
It's just one afternoon, a week,

137
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,990
three hours or whatever it is.
But you want to get your first choice.

138
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:48,050
So line up soon you'll be accommodated.

139
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:51,980
But it's just more convenient if you
get get it arranged earlier. But why?

140
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,010
Because lab answers the
really big question.

141
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:01,910
And the big question was brought home to
me by my son John McBride in his third

142
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:05,790
year.
This was the beginning of the third year,

143
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,300
and his mother and I didn't know
what was coming for the next year,

144
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:13,410
maybe 15, maybe 20 times a day. He said,

145
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,040
how do you know?
Right?

146
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,470
So here's John this last summer.

147
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:24,471
He's now 38 and he has his own three
year olds the to say that to him and he

148
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:29,520
doesn't say, how do you know anymore?
He now says, how do you know?

149
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,390
Okay,
but that is the main question.

150
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,320
How do you know what these things
that they told you in school?

151
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,230
While there are four ways we
could talk about of knowing,

152
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,140
and two of them are shown on this,
uh,

153
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:47,880
this manuscript from the Carolingian Book
Bader. If we zoom in on the top frame,

154
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:49,800
here's Moses on Mount Sinai.

155
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,400
So the first way of knowing is
divine authority right here.

156
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,340
He's going to be the, he's the
graduate student here getting the word,

157
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:04,350
here's a teaching assistant over
on the left, perhaps parent, right?

158
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:09,630
And then he comes down from
Sinai, right? To see the class,

159
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:14,520
the children of Israel. Right? So
here's another kind of authority,

160
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:19,470
right? Which is human authority
interpreting the scriptures.

161
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:24,480
And here you can see the class. I mean,
the guys go on like, Huh? Like that.

162
00:10:24,481 --> 00:10:28,890
Right? Okay. And the teaching assistant
is often, the side is still right,

163
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:34,320
but this doesn't make it, science
is not faith based, right?

164
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,080
That may be other ways. There may
be other things, you know, that way,

165
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,810
but not science.
Okay.

166
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:44,190
Science Ignores Divine Authority
and ignores human authority.

167
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,230
Not that they might not exist, but they
don't relate to science. Okay. Now,

168
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:52,710
as you walked in today,
did you notice these things over here?

169
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,730
There's an honor roll
of chemists and in fact,

170
00:10:56,731 --> 00:11:00,970
we'll use that a lot this
semester. And in particular, uh,

171
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,220
one of the people on
there is Michael Faraday,

172
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,680
who started in a very humble way.

173
00:11:07,681 --> 00:11:12,681
He was a bookbinders apprentice
and he bound this book,

174
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,590
not this particular copy,
but this book,

175
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,950
which is called
conversations on chemistry.

176
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:26,220
He bound the first edition.
This one is, is a later edition.

177
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,133
Yeah.
Let me,

178
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,460
so you see it's conversations on chemistry
in which elements of that science or

179
00:11:33,461 --> 00:11:38,290
familiarly explained and illustrated
by experiments. And who's the author?

180
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,900
Jl Comstock is actually not the author.
He's the guy who stole it. Okay.

181
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:53,680
He stole it from a woman, Mrs
Marcet in England, who this book,

182
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:56,650
which was the most popular textbook.
It was written for girls,

183
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,610
but it was the most popular
textbook and all in all, uh, uh,

184
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,500
chemistry for the first
half of the 19th century.

185
00:12:03,501 --> 00:12:07,840
It went through like a 20 some
additions in the, and here,

186
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,630
here you see at the beginning it's,
it's a dialogue,

187
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:15,130
a conversation between Mrs
B and Caroline and Emily.

188
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,050
And it's fun to see this here.
What Emily says at the beginning,

189
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,510
to confess the truth,
Mrs B,

190
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,530
I'm not disposed to form a very
favorable idea of chemistry,

191
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,360
nor do I expect to derive
much entertainment from
it. But in the long run,

192
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:34,800
as you can imagine, they have a
lot of fun with chemistry. That is,

193
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,300
it was a wonderful book and still is,

194
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,630
but he was binding it and read it.

195
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,270
And look what he says about this as
his introduction to be the leading

196
00:12:46,271 --> 00:12:50,230
experimental scientist
of the 19th century.

197
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,540
Did not suppose I was a very deep thinker
or was marked as a precocious person.

198
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,220
I was a very lively,

199
00:12:57,221 --> 00:13:01,420
imaginative person and could believe
in the Arabian nights as easily as the

200
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:06,310
encyclopedia. But facts were
important to me and saved me.

201
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,860
I could trust the fact and always
cross examined and assertion.

202
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:17,200
So when I questioned Mrs Marceto book by
such little experiments as I could find

203
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:22,120
means to perform and found it true to
the facts as I could understand them,

204
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,280
I felt I had got hold of an anchor and
chemical knowledge and clung fast to it.

205
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,093
Okay.

206
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,390
Right.
So the experiments were what bid it.

207
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:37,600
So the third way of knowing is
by experimental observation,

208
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:39,663
right?

209
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,310
And here's Richard Fineman.

210
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:45,060
How many of you heard of Richard
Vineman is a really great business,

211
00:13:45,061 --> 00:13:49,390
wrote a wonderful textbook as well as
getting all sorts of prizes. And so he,

212
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,820
he spoke to the National Science Teachers
Association in 1966 say and learn from

213
00:13:53,821 --> 00:13:56,340
science that you must doubt the experts.

214
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,060
Science is the belief and
the ignorance of experts.

215
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:04,110
When someone says science
teaches such and such,

216
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:08,880
he's using the word incorrectly.
Science doesn't teach it.

217
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,810
Experienced teaches it.
If they say to you,

218
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:16,590
science has shown such and such, you
might ask, how does science show it?

219
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,350
How did the scientists find out how,

220
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:23,190
what were not science has shown,

221
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:29,150
but this experiment or this
effect as shown right now,

222
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,770
why do we quote Fineman?

223
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,010
Because he's an expert.
Wrong.

224
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:45,770
Okay. The literally expert,
the, the etymology of experts.

225
00:14:45,771 --> 00:14:49,880
That means someone who has
done experiments, okay,

226
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:56,150
we quote him because what
he says makes sense. Okay,

227
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:00,920
so logic is the fourth way of knowing
thing. So the two ways that we,

228
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,550
that we know things in
chemistry or in science,

229
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:07,340
our experiment and logic and the,

230
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,340
the lecture is a little
bit more focused on logic.

231
00:15:10,341 --> 00:15:14,900
And the lab is more focused on experiment
and you get an unbalanced view if you

232
00:15:14,901 --> 00:15:17,930
do one without the other.
Okay.

233
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:22,160
So modern science got underway in the
17th century. There's the 17th century,

234
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:24,200
1600 to 1700 right?

235
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,860
And 1638 was when new haven colony was
founded and 17 one was when Yale was

236
00:15:32,271 --> 00:15:34,760
founded.
So that's when everything got underway.

237
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:39,140
Just when this enterprise was
beginning here, okay, here we are.

238
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,960
Okay.
If you go back a hundred years,

239
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:46,670
you get to quantum quantized nation
by Plonk and we'll talk about that.

240
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,020
And if you go back another hundred years,
you get to Lavoie Oza and oxidation.

241
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,710
And we'll talk about that.
And if you get another hundred years,

242
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:58,160
you get to Newton and gravitation.
And we'll talk a little bit about that.

243
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,800
And if you go back a little
more than another hundred years,

244
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:02,060
you get to Koepernick us and,

245
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:07,210
and the revolution of the heavenly bodies
and Columbus and navigation and Luther

246
00:16:09,771 --> 00:16:14,000
and the reformation. And these
things all have something in common,

247
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:19,280
right? As Robert Hooke
wrote, the 17th century.

248
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:23,480
His Age was an age of all others,
the most inquisitive.

249
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:28,990
All these things have to do with people
inquiring into how people know things

250
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,520
and finding out new things.
Okay.

251
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:37,090
And in particular an important figure
was was Francis Bacon who and his instore

252
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:41,390
ration. Now you may not know the ins
duration, so well, let's look at that.

253
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:45,590
Here's Francis Bacon. There is
years. He, he was Elizabeth,

254
00:16:45,591 --> 00:16:46,880
Ethan and Jacobean.

255
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:53,020
He was almost exactly contemporary
with Shakespeare and with Galileo.

256
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:59,770
He went to school at the university at
Cambridge and here's a cartoon that shows

257
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:04,730
him and imagine a,
it's a modern cartoon.

258
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:09,731
Imagine him in a class at
Cambridge because he wrote
of his tutors at Cambridge.

259
00:17:09,981 --> 00:17:13,940
They were men of sharp wits,
shut up in their cells,

260
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:17,840
have a few authors, chiefly
Aristotle, their dictator,

261
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,930
right? All of the philosophy of nature,
philosophy meant science in those days.

262
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,670
All the philosophy of nature,

263
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:30,671
which has now received is either the
philosophy of the Grecians or that of the

264
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:31,970
alchemists.

265
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,890
The one is gathered out of a few vulgar.

266
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,470
That means common of course observations.

267
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,070
And the other out of a few
experiments have a furnace.

268
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:49,630
The one never fail us to multiply words
and the other ever fail us to multiply

269
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:54,810
gold.
Okay,

270
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:59,640
so here's the book he wrote the in store
Asian, that's the fraud piece for this.

271
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:03,570
Pictures from the Beinecke library work
done. You got a picture of the book.

272
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,670
Okay. Notice it was published in
1620. What else happened then?

273
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,480
That's when the pilgrims
came over. Right? Okay.

274
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,710
So the title of the book rather small
under his name and title is Lord

275
00:18:18,711 --> 00:18:21,220
Chancellor of England
is in star Osseo Magdna,

276
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,890
which means the great
restoration restoration of what?

277
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:29,660
Of the way of knowing, right? This
the uh, a bigger a part of it.

278
00:18:29,661 --> 00:18:31,250
It's called the Nobu Morgano,

279
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:36,310
which is then it develops the inductive
scientific method based on experiment to

280
00:18:37,191 --> 00:18:39,350
replace Aristotelian deduction,

281
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:43,040
which is you maybe did one experiment
sometime and then you reason everything

282
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:47,300
from that. But he says, no, you
have to do more experiments. Now,

283
00:18:47,301 --> 00:18:48,710
there's an interesting thing here.

284
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,850
The device on one of the devices
on the title or this, uh,

285
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,070
frontest piece is two pillars.

286
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,900
What are the world are they doing there?
Well,

287
00:18:59,901 --> 00:19:03,200
they're the same pillars
that you see on this.

288
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:08,480
That's a piece of eight, you know,
treasure island pieces of eight c,

289
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,740
it's eight radiologists,

290
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,630
and it came from the silver of
Mexico was minted in Mexico City,

291
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,613
right?

292
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:22,220
So there you'll see the same pillars
and on them it says pluse ultra more

293
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:27,230
beyond,
beyond what,

294
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,660
what are the pillars?

295
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,520
Pardon me?
Africa.

296
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,240
It's, yeah, it's, it's Africa and Spain,

297
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:49,180
but it's the pillars of Hercules,
which are the mouth of the Mediterranean,

298
00:19:49,181 --> 00:19:51,340
the old classical world,
right?

299
00:19:51,341 --> 00:19:55,330
So there's the mountain of Moses and
Morocco and the mountain of Tariq,

300
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:00,240
which is the name of Gibraltar,
right? So here's the Mediterranean,

301
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,200
the classical world of Aristotle.

302
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:07,410
And you could say allowed into the new
world and bring back silver for example.

303
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,233
Right?

304
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,580
There's danger of course,

305
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,360
right?
Okay.

306
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,380
But look what it says at the bottom,

307
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,260
what we'll be brought back,
not just silver,

308
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,990
right? Molted paratransit Bonet
at our gay be towards CNTR.

309
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,950
Many will pass through and
knowledge will be increased,

310
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:32,941
right?

311
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:37,560
So we go beyond Aristotle
into experimentally based
science and knowledge will

312
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:42,240
be increased. So here's some quotes
from the install Roseo Magdna

313
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:48,280
that wisdom which we have derived
principally from the Greeks. No offense,

314
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,370
okay.
Uh,

315
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:57,020
is but like the boy hood of knowledge
and has the characteristic property of

316
00:20:57,101 --> 00:20:57,934
boys.

317
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,680
It can talk but it cannot generate

318
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:04,863
good.

319
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:10,430
It is. But a device for exempting
ignorance from ignominy.

320
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:15,250
That means it's a way of hiding
your ignorance and we'll see.

321
00:21:15,251 --> 00:21:16,760
We'll see examples of that.

322
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,410
We'll talk about in lecture 11 about
Correlation Energy and we'll talk and

323
00:21:21,411 --> 00:21:23,570
lecture 32 about strain energy.

324
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:27,470
And you'll see that both of these are
just words that are used to hide our

325
00:21:27,471 --> 00:21:28,304
ignorance.

326
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:30,803
Okay.

327
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:31,703
The end,

328
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,800
which this science of mind proposes is
the invention not have arguments but of

329
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:41,010
arts ways of doing things right?

330
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,230
Not so much by instruments,

331
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:46,590
although new instruments are
important like microscopes and so on,

332
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,280
as by experiments skillfully
and artificially devised
for the express purpose of

333
00:21:53,491 --> 00:21:55,410
determining the point in question.

334
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:59,100
So artificial experiments
designed to decide a question,

335
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,940
experiments.

336
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,110
And this will lead to the restoration
of learning and knowledge.

337
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:12,610
So followers of of Bacon established
the Royal Society and 1662 just after

338
00:22:14,331 --> 00:22:18,620
Charles was restored, uh, to England
after the period of chrom. Well,

339
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:24,290
and there was a history written of the
Royal Society of book about this thick,

340
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:29,090
published in 1667 only five
years after it was founded.

341
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,950
Why did they publish a history so
sued, well, let's look at this. The,

342
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,510
the hottest piece of this book.

343
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,720
Here's the late Francis Bacon who is said
to be RTM in store at are the restorer

344
00:22:42,411 --> 00:22:44,570
of the arts.
Okay.

345
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:48,320
And here's the president of the Royal
Society of the mathematician bike out

346
00:22:48,321 --> 00:22:49,154
brown sugar.

347
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,880
And here in the middle being crowned
with Laurel is Charles the second.

348
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,460
Why do they have him up on a pedestal?

349
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,720
How's their hope hoping the science
scientists have before and ever since to

350
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:05,360
extract some money out of the
government to do their research?

351
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,010
They actually never got it from Charles,
but that wasn't for lack of trying.

352
00:23:10,011 --> 00:23:15,011
And this is why they wrote the history
to try to make the case for being

353
00:23:15,021 --> 00:23:16,910
supported.
Okay.

354
00:23:16,911 --> 00:23:20,210
Now let's look at all the good
things that will come from science,

355
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:24,080
from the Royal Society in the background.
Can you see what that is?

356
00:23:24,081 --> 00:23:27,430
We'll blow it up.
Hear it.

357
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:31,880
There's a hint to it on the bookshelf.
If you look really fine on the bookshelf,

358
00:23:31,881 --> 00:23:36,230
you can see that some of them have titles.
Have a writ writing on the spine.

359
00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:40,570
Do you see what that one is?
Anybody read it?

360
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,130
What?

361
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:51,620
What science book do you think
they might had? Copernicus,

362
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,840
right, so astronomy, that's
a telescope in the back.

363
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:00,500
Okay. Or over here on the
wall. What's that thing?

364
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:10,330
It's a clock. Why is it shaped
like a piece of Pie? Oh,

365
00:24:10,331 --> 00:24:11,920
cause it has a pendulum inside.

366
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,263
Okay,

367
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,970
so ornithology making good
clocks. Okay. Or here.

368
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:22,480
What's that thing that's
hard for you to know?

369
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,780
It's a wind gauge. It's, it has
a vein inside that blows on.

370
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:32,020
You can tell from how far it goes on
the scale, how strong the wind is.

371
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:36,340
So meteorology and back
here on the pillar.

372
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,870
But are those things for,

373
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,333
yeah,

374
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,140
for cartography right now,

375
00:24:46,141 --> 00:24:50,010
what do all these things have in common
that they're going to do for Charles?

376
00:24:50,011 --> 00:24:53,340
The second
astronomy,

377
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:57,340
good clocks. Meteorology
cartography. What book?

378
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:02,820
They all have to do with
navigation, right? With making,

379
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,610
uh,
England strong at sea.

380
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,790
Now back here is another science.

381
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,800
Chemistry.
Okay.

382
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,360
That doesn't seem to have
anything to do with navigation.

383
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,670
Why would chemistry be
important to Charles?

384
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,813
Look at it

385
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,000
to make gun powder.

386
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:26,600
There was a chapter about gunpowder in
the history of the royal society. Okay.

387
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:31,260
And up here at the top is the motto,
which is newly use in whereby,

388
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:35,870
which comes from this quote from Horace.
And what it says is less,

389
00:25:35,871 --> 00:25:39,500
you asked who leads me in
what household I lodge.

390
00:25:39,501 --> 00:25:41,480
That is what philosophy I advocate.

391
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:47,110
There is no master in whose words I am
bound to take an oath wherever the storm

392
00:25:48,141 --> 00:25:51,290
forces me there I put in as the guest.

393
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,570
So it's the experiment,
not the philosopher that
leads you to the conclusion,

394
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:02,090
right? So newly use and whereby
is in the words of none.

395
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,700
Okay.

396
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,301
And in fact,

397
00:26:04,301 --> 00:26:08,530
the original name of the Royal Society
was the Royal Society for the improving

398
00:26:08,531 --> 00:26:11,620
of natural knowledge by experiments.

399
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,060
Yeah.

400
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,880
Okay. So we're going to see
as the course goes along,

401
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:20,360
important experiments that
really decided questions.

402
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:25,250
And in fact Bacon's most important
kind of experiment was one that finally

403
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,890
decides between two rival hypothesis,

404
00:26:27,891 --> 00:26:30,680
proven the one and disproving the other.

405
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:35,630
So you can do all sorts of experiments
and just be collecting butterflies. No,

406
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,490
I don't mean to insult people who quite
butterflies. It's a fine thing to do,

407
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:45,940
but there's something special experiments
that really are designed to answer a

408
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:48,330
question right now.

409
00:26:48,331 --> 00:26:53,100
The bacon devise the name
for such experiments and
they're based on this model

410
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,570
that you have a road that diverges and
you need to know which way to go between

411
00:26:57,571 --> 00:27:01,890
these two hypotheses.
What do you need to know?

412
00:27:01,891 --> 00:27:02,760
Which way to go?

413
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:08,660
You need a sign or this was a cross
that would be mounted at a crossroads.

414
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:14,590
Okay, so the root, the Latin
name for cross is crux. Yeah.

415
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,110
See what they call the experiment.

416
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:24,200
Crucial. That's the origin
of the word crucial, right?

417
00:27:24,201 --> 00:27:27,530
It's the one that tells
you which way to go. Okay,

418
00:27:27,531 --> 00:27:29,510
so here is Isaac Newton

419
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:35,080
and he's holding something.
Can you see what he's holding in his hand?

420
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:38,760
I'll give you a hint.

421
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,300
It's a prison.

422
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:48,620
Why is he holding a prison?
Because that was his crucial experiment.

423
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:53,190
And here's his diagram of that
experiment with a prisoner.

424
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,360
He called it the experimental crutches,
taking the word from Bacon.

425
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:03,450
Okay? So light came in through a
hole in the window through a Lens,

426
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,840
and then got bent and dispersed
into the different colors.

427
00:28:06,841 --> 00:28:11,400
So you've got a spectrum here on this
thing, the different colors, okay?

428
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,360
Now there's the question.
How does the prism make color

429
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,293
hook?

430
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,040
And Descartes thought that that
light was a train of pulses,

431
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,350
and as it goes through
something like a prism,

432
00:28:25,351 --> 00:28:29,610
or as reflects from a thin layer of
oil on water or something like that,

433
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:34,080
that it changes the timing of the
pulses and therefore changes the color,

434
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:35,843
right?

435
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:41,120
But Newton thought that the colors
were preexisting and the prison just

436
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,440
separates them.

437
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,030
And this was his crucial experiment
to decide between those two theories.

438
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,410
You see what he did?

439
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:56,390
He drilled a hole through the board and
let through only the red light and put a

440
00:28:57,481 --> 00:29:00,520
second prism there,
right?

441
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:03,010
And he wrote here three times,

442
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:08,190
he wrote it here and also here and
also here neck Variani looks from the

443
00:29:09,911 --> 00:29:14,911
[inaudible] which means the broken
light does not change its color,

444
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:22,700
right? So this proved to
Newton, at least at that time,

445
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:26,660
that light is a substance,
not a train of pulses.

446
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,820
What do you think of that proof?

447
00:29:29,821 --> 00:29:34,590
Now you think light is a substance
or a train of pulses. Photo not,

448
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:39,510
but at least you can see that in terms
then that was a crucial experiment,

449
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,010
a really important experiment.

450
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,230
And that's the kind of experiments
we'll try to talk about in the course.

451
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,760
Experiments are indispensable
in organic chemistry.

452
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:52,540
It's an empirical science
based on observation and
that's why you have to take

453
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:56,640
the lab.
But so his logic now,

454
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:00,280
that was number three and number four of
the ways of knowing logic is important

455
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:03,580
too.
So believe what I tell you here,

456
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:07,930
only when it makes sense to you,
don't just cram it in.

457
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:13,210
Make sure it makes sense.
But what if it doesn't?

458
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:15,820
Okay.

459
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:20,820
Now here's how to succeed in count one
25 and we'll take as our model science

460
00:30:21,101 --> 00:30:25,900
student Samuel peeps. How many
people have heard of Samuel peeps?

461
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:31,900
If you heard of him as a scientist,
what did you hear of the Mat?

462
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,300
What do you associate with Samuel peeps?

463
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:43,330
Right in this period.
Right in the heart of the science growth.

464
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,000
But what you know him for was his diary,

465
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:51,390
which tells all about life everyday
life in restoration London.

466
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,693
Okay.

467
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:58,690
He was actually as a 16 year old present
when Charles the first was beheaded in

468
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,410
1649 now,
what's the connection?

469
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,180
You know where this is?
Is anybody been there?

470
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,890
Dixwell golf and Wally avenues.

471
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,680
Those are named from three four,

472
00:31:17,681 --> 00:31:22,681
three of the 50 judges that condemn
Charles the first to be beheaded and they

473
00:31:24,161 --> 00:31:29,161
were the only ones that lasted very long
after the restoration and they lasted

474
00:31:29,231 --> 00:31:34,000
because they fled to New England
and were hidden on West Rock.

475
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:38,230
All these roads are heading
west toward restaurant. Okay,

476
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:40,320
so that's the tie into the same period.
But anyway,

477
00:31:40,321 --> 00:31:45,321
he had got his Ba in Cambridge and 1654
and a master's in 1656 and he got a good

478
00:31:46,211 --> 00:31:48,790
job. He became Clark of the
acts for the navy board,

479
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:52,210
which meant he was the guy that
purchased everything for the Royal Navy,

480
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:56,140
all the rope, all the tar,
all the lumber and so on.

481
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:02,050
And on July 4th, 1662 I
mean, it's the 4th of July,

482
00:32:02,051 --> 00:32:05,680
but it's more than a hundred years
before that became relevant. Right?

483
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:09,640
He writes in his diary by
and by comes Mr. Cooper,

484
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:14,560
mate of the Royal Charles of who am I
intend to learn mathematics and do begin

485
00:32:14,561 --> 00:32:15,490
with him today.

486
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:20,290
He being a very able man after an
hour's being with him at arithmetic,

487
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:23,080
my first attempt being to
learn the multiplication table.

488
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,030
We then parted till tomorrow.

489
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:28,690
So here was the guy doing
all the purchasing for the
Royal Navy and he didn't

490
00:32:28,691 --> 00:32:32,290
know multiply multiplication,
let alone division,

491
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,940
but he worked hard at it.
July 9th five days later,

492
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,510
he's up by four o'clock and that
my multiplication table hard,

493
00:32:41,511 --> 00:32:44,000
which is all the trouble I meet
with all in the arithmetic,

494
00:32:44,001 --> 00:32:47,270
he can do the other things pretty well.
Okay.

495
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:50,930
July 11 up by four o'clock on
heart at my multiplication table,

496
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:53,180
which I have now almost master of

497
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,560
Christmas, right? So six months later,

498
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:03,020
soda my office practicing Arithmetic
alone and making an end of last night's

499
00:33:03,021 --> 00:33:05,210
book with great content till 11 at night.

500
00:33:05,211 --> 00:33:09,980
And so home to supper and
bed or a year later. Oh,

501
00:33:09,981 --> 00:33:13,890
so he was motivated and he was diligent.
That's good.

502
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,520
Okay.
A year later on,

503
00:33:16,521 --> 00:33:21,140
a Sunday I below by myself looking over
my arithmetic books and timber rule.

504
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:26,350
So my wife arose a nod and she and I all
the afternoon at Arithmetic and she has

505
00:33:27,681 --> 00:33:32,030
come to do addition,
subtraction and multiplication very well.

506
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,860
And so I purpose not to trouble
her yet with division. Right?

507
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:41,030
So we worked with a study
partner and that's crucial.

508
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,090
And Isaac Newton,
does anybody recognize this book?

509
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:52,700
Right though? The mathematical principles
of science of natural philosophy.

510
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,090
But there's an interesting
thing on the title page.

511
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:03,560
Samuel peeps is the one who
gave permission to publish
that book because he was

512
00:34:03,561 --> 00:34:05,300
the president of the Royal Society.

513
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,430
Yeah.

514
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:12,540
Now, six years later, peeps
encountered a problem with dice.

515
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:17,580
The reason was he went to coffee shops
every night for dinner and they'd gamble,

516
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:18,391
right?

517
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:22,110
And people proposed various kinds of
bets and he couldn't figure out this one.

518
00:34:22,111 --> 00:34:23,580
So he wrote Newton for help.

519
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:25,320
Okay.

520
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,370
So this was the problem that he
wrote to Newton and 22nd of November.

521
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:34,730
So a has six dice in a box and he asked
to throw a six by throwing it right?

522
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:40,310
B has 12 dice and he has to fling
two sixes and see has 18 dice,

523
00:34:40,861 --> 00:34:45,861
but he has to get three sixes to win
the question whether B and c have not as

524
00:34:46,141 --> 00:34:50,100
easy a task at a at even lock. That is,
if the dice aren't loaded or anything,

525
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:51,630
who has the better bet?

526
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:56,510
How many people think that it's the same?

527
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:02,600
Don't be shy.
How many think it's a?

528
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,880
How many think B? How many things? See

529
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:15,090
how many don't really have any
opinion at all. Good. That wins.

530
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,470
Okay.

531
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:21,000
So he wrote this letter to try to get
help on his bets from Newton and Newton

532
00:35:21,001 --> 00:35:22,620
replied four days later.

533
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:27,030
What is the expectation or hope
of a to throw every time one,

534
00:35:27,031 --> 00:35:31,560
six at least with 6,000 so you get
to six is you still win, right?

535
00:35:31,561 --> 00:35:34,380
That wasn't clear in the
original statement. So he says,

536
00:35:34,381 --> 00:35:36,090
if we formulate the question that way,

537
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:41,490
it appears an easy computation that the
expectation of a is greater than BRC.

538
00:35:41,491 --> 00:35:44,280
That is the task of a is the easiest.

539
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:50,410
There's the answer.
So peeps replied on the 6th of December,

540
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:55,840
you give it in favor of the
expectations of a, and this, as you say,

541
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,790
by an easy computation,

542
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:04,230
but yet I must not pretend to so much
conversation with numbers as presently to

543
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:08,710
comprehend as I ought to do all the
force of that which you are pleased to

544
00:36:08,711 --> 00:36:12,670
assign for the reason of it relating to
their having or not having the benefit

545
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:13,840
of all their chances.

546
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:19,300
So he wasn't ashamed to admit
that he didn't really understand.

547
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,340
That's crucial.

548
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,593
Okay.

549
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:27,890
And therefore were it not for the trouble,
it must have cost you.

550
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:32,120
I could have wished for a
site of the very computation.

551
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,980
Can you show me how to figure it out?

552
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:39,820
And he wanted that because somebody might
change the terms of the bet and that

553
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:44,540
he wouldn't know. He wanted really
to understand. He insisted on proof.

554
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:46,100
Yeah.

555
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:50,060
So this is two of the pages from Newton's
correspondence of the letter that he

556
00:36:50,061 --> 00:36:51,020
wrote in response.

557
00:36:51,021 --> 00:36:55,550
And you can see that that peeps certainly
got more than he had bargained for.

558
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:59,960
So it to compute this, I sat down in
the following progressions of numbers.

559
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:04,430
So you can go through all this
and you get complicated, uh, uh,

560
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:05,540
quotients here.

561
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:11,050
And it turns out that a has
30 1031 chances out of 46,000,

562
00:37:12,411 --> 00:37:15,800
656 or 0.6, six five,
one chance of winning,

563
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,140
and B has this, which is 0.6, one
eight, seven, sorry, 0.6, one eight,

564
00:37:21,141 --> 00:37:25,040
seven a wins. Right? So,

565
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,900
so this peep satisfied with this.

566
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:32,870
Peeps writes back and he says, why, right?

567
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:38,270
I cannot bear the thought of
being made master of a jewel.

568
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,460
I know not how to wear right.

569
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,080
So he's willing to swallow his pride to
search for really solid understanding.

570
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:50,790
Now compare this with a
comment we got at the end,

571
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,780
at the end of semester valuation
in January a year ago, okay.

572
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,410
I never went to his office hours for
help because I felt like he would make me

573
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:02,620
feel stupid because he's
superior to be in chemistry.

574
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:07,510
I hope I'm superior to you in chemistry.
I'm not superior as a person,

575
00:38:07,511 --> 00:38:11,530
but I hope I'm superior in chemistry.
You're paying me the big bucks, right?

576
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:16,090
Because that, so swallow your
pride and ask someone for help.

577
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,350
Okay,

578
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,190
follow peeps.

579
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:24,370
So read peeps and Newton and get together
to do problems for for Monday and

580
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:27,740
contribute to the Wiki
when you're asked to do so.

581
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,750
So here are problems for Friday. The
problems are optional, but very helpful.

582
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:37,930
One is find out which two class have the
rooms nearest you so that you can maybe

583
00:38:37,931 --> 00:38:40,850
use them as study partners.
You don't have to use that.

584
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,730
Use anybody but use someone.

585
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:47,920
Don't try to go out alone to what are the
three most common items of advice from

586
00:38:47,921 --> 00:38:50,710
course veterans. So if you click
there or go to the webpage,

587
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:54,520
you can get anonymous advice,
right?

588
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,680
I was careful to make it.
Sure it's anonymous. Uh,

589
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,420
so you could get all fly
much of it as contradictory.

590
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:05,350
So your job is to look through it and
try to get some idea of what they're

591
00:39:05,351 --> 00:39:09,070
telling you that's worth knowing
for Monday, their problems from,

592
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,140
from that webpage peeps in Newton.

593
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:16,360
And let me tell you that you better
get together with other people to do it

594
00:39:16,361 --> 00:39:17,890
because there's a lot of stuff there.

595
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,860
So I'll get together in a group
parcel out who works on what,

596
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:25,720
discuss what went on and so on.
And then for a week from Friday,

597
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,220
uh, there's stuff about drawing Lewis
structures from another webpage about

598
00:39:30,221 --> 00:39:32,260
functional groups.
So we'll get to that later.

599
00:39:32,261 --> 00:39:37,180
I just wanted you to know what's coming up
in this.

600
00:39:37,181 --> 00:39:39,290
Incidentally,
this thing about the,

601
00:39:39,291 --> 00:39:43,270
the problem set that has to do with the
mathematics that Newton and peeps we're

602
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:48,220
working on there has to do
with isotope ratios. You know,

603
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,630
the chlorine has a funny
atomic weight. Why? What,

604
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,770
what is the atomic weight?
[inaudible] 35 and a half.

605
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,410
Why a half? All the other,
most of the elements are,

606
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:07,270
are pretty near integers.
It's because it's a mixture of isotopes,

607
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,310
right? It's a quarter of one isotopes
and three quarters of the other.

608
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:17,830
And the average is 35 and a half,
35 and 37

609
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,020
but in fact,
it depends on where you get chlorine from,

610
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,780
what the ratio is. Here's 35 and a half,
right? For the standard atomic weight.

611
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:32,560
But it ranges quite,
quite a bit depending on where you get it.

612
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:35,380
So by measuring these ratios,

613
00:40:35,381 --> 00:40:38,260
which is a lot like these
odds in the bedding,

614
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,930
you can tell where things came from,

615
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:44,620
you can tell where hydrocarbons
came from sometimes that way.

616
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,760
And those are the problems that
you have to deal with. So it's,

617
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:49,960
it's not really very,
very relevant to the course as a whole,

618
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:54,430
but it's relevant to the peeps and
Newton thing and it's a fun problem.

619
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,150
So that's what you gotta do for Monday.
Okay.

620
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:02,860
And here are the assignments. I emailed
all these people, I hope you're here. So,

621
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:06,850
and that you've picked up on what we
talked about today so that you can improve

622
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,370
the wikis from last year,
last year.

623
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,730
People develop their wikis
from scratch this time.

624
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,870
So she's a very valuable thing to do. So
I was torn this year as to whether have,

625
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:22,120
whether to have you do them from
scratch or whether to modify last year.

626
00:41:22,121 --> 00:41:26,080
I figured modifying last year is better
because then you have something to read

627
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:30,250
earlier on for those who are
not working on developing it.

628
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:34,400
So anyhow, but, but the hope
is so if you, if you modify it,

629
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:37,850
it has to be some significant,
not put a comment or something like that,

630
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:41,270
but add something useful to understanding.
Uh,

631
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:44,660
if you do it within 36 hours,
you get two points.

632
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:48,560
And if what you do is really
good, you get three points. Okay.

633
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,280
So you go, you go to that page
and you click on those things.

634
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,700
Then you can read what are you hitting?
Either modify and Margherita,

635
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:58,580
that's a Wiki. Now we come to the
question that will address more,

636
00:41:58,581 --> 00:41:59,960
we have another five minutes here.

637
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:06,110
The question we're really dealing with
now having seen how to work in chem on 25

638
00:42:06,111 --> 00:42:10,370
is are their atoms and molecules.
How do you know?

639
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:15,260
Right?
And what force holds them together.

640
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:20,150
Because if we knew what if we knew that
they're real and we knew what force held

641
00:42:20,151 --> 00:42:24,080
them together, then in principle we
might be able to calculate everything,

642
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,810
right?
So it would all be theory.

643
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:31,810
So is it springs that
hold the atoms together?

644
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:39,140
So Robert Boyle notices
right at that time,

645
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:44,141
1627 to 1691 and he's the oldest person
that's on the honor roll outside.

646
00:42:45,201 --> 00:42:48,530
The building here is over that way.
Uh,

647
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,280
so Robert Boyle wrote this first
important book in Chemistry,

648
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:57,080
new experiments, physical, mechanical,

649
00:42:57,081 --> 00:43:01,460
touching the spring of air,
right?

650
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,990
So you know Boyle's law, right? How
pressure and volume change that.

651
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,750
That air in a piston acts like a spring.

652
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:14,180
And so PV is a constant,
that's Boyle's law.

653
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,500
So it was [inaudible].

654
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,680
He developed this science on
the basis of a new instrument,

655
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:22,850
that new magical engine,
which was built by Robert Hook,

656
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,110
the guy that we quoted,

657
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:29,630
and there's a picture of the of the air
pump here with that crank on it and so

658
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,440
odd to pump things in or out of that,
of that bulb.

659
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:39,140
Now, a couple of years
later, Hook wrote this book,

660
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,790
Lectures de Potentia,

661
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:46,800
RST Tootie or of spring explaining
the power of springing bodies,

662
00:43:48,111 --> 00:43:49,580
and this is the beginning of that book.

663
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:55,120
The theory of springs though attempted
by diverse eminent mathematicians of this

664
00:43:55,131 --> 00:43:58,580
age,
has either to not been published by any,

665
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,900
it is now about 18 years
since I first found it out,

666
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:07,550
but designing to apply it
to some particular use,

667
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:12,470
I omitted the publishing thereof,
so he kept it secret,

668
00:44:12,471 --> 00:44:16,340
so no one would steal the idea.
What did he hope to do with a spring?

669
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:18,660
Yeah,

670
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:19,770
a really important

671
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,120
technology that he could do with a spray.

672
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,960
It was a coiled spring that he invented

673
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:34,500
a new kind of clock,
right?

674
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:39,000
One that could work better for navigation
was his spring that actually allowed

675
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:44,001
Harrison a hundred years later to win
the contest about making an accurate

676
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:46,980
clock. Some of you must
know that story. So anyhow,

677
00:44:46,981 --> 00:44:49,770
he had been hiding this so it
wouldn't be stolen. In fact,

678
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:51,810
it was stolen by Huygens,

679
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:58,050
so about three years since his majesty
was pleased to see the experiment that

680
00:44:58,261 --> 00:45:02,880
made out this theory, tried at
Whitehall, and also my spring watch

681
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:09,740
about two years since I printed the
theory in an Anagram at the end of my book

682
00:45:10,111 --> 00:45:13,590
on the description of
Healia scopes vis this.

683
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,520
So this is what he published at the
end of this book on Helias scopes

684
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,880
and that is an Anagram

685
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:25,800
of how springs work,
right?

686
00:45:25,801 --> 00:45:29,760
So that later he could prove
that he knew it if needs be,

687
00:45:29,761 --> 00:45:34,440
but no one could steal it in the meantime.
All right. And if you unscramble it,

688
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,020
it's 10 CEO Sick V's.

689
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:42,080
That is the power of any spring is in
the same proportion with the tension

690
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:47,610
thereof. That is if one power
stretcher bend at one space,

691
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:52,710
two will suppress it to three,
we'll bend it three and so forward.

692
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:56,760
So here's this figure that shows that
that's Hooke's law. The forest law,

693
00:45:56,761 --> 00:46:01,080
the force is proportional
to the distortion, right?

694
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:03,990
So here's his figure,
and he's got plots of it here.

695
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,910
What's 10 CEO as the extension?
Sick V's.

696
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:13,680
So the force, so it's linear,
right? The, the forest is how much,

697
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,540
how much you stretch it.

698
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:19,380
And he has lots of different kinds of
springs that do that. Here's this clock,

699
00:46:19,381 --> 00:46:22,710
kind of spring, a coil spring,
just stretching a wire.

700
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,500
So the force is proportional
to the extension.

701
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:31,170
Or another way of saying is the potential
energy is proportional to the square

702
00:46:31,171 --> 00:46:35,670
of the extension. So it's a
parabola. So that's Hooke's law,

703
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:38,970
right? And that's where
it will take up next time.
