00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.400
Good morning,
good morning.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.000
I am Glenn Lowry,
Director of the Museum of Modern Art,

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.100
and I am delighted to welcome you
to this discussion

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.500
with Christophe Cherix,
Chief Curator of Drawings and Prints

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.900
and co-organizer
of this wonderful exhibition,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.100
Marcel Broodthaers: A Retrospective,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.900
with Manolo Borja
from the Reina Sofia, our partner,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.600
and Manolo is right here,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.200
and Manolo we thank you for joining
with us on this terrific effort.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.600
Exhibitions of this scale
and complexity are very difficult

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.800
to pull off,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.300
and this one
would have been impossible

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.800
without the support,
advice, guidance, and help

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.600
of Maria Gilissen Broodthaers,
Broodthaers’ widow,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.800
their daughter Marie-Puck,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.200
and we’re so happy that you were able
to spend so much time

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.700
working with us on this project.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.900
We also want to acknowledge
Marcel Broodthaers’ other children,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.300
Pierrette, Sylvie, and Constantin,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.000
and as well the Daled family,
whose very generous gift

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.700
to the museum several years ago
of their collection

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.400
included many critical works
by Broodthaers that became a kind

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.800
of catalyst for a deeper dive
into this,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.200
and Herman and Nicole,
and of course their son Pierre,

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.400
we’re so grateful
that you’re here as well.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.600
This project garnered widespread
support from a number of funders,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.600
our International Council
here at the Museum of Modern Art,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.900
Marie-Josée and Henry Kravis,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.800
Anna Marie and Robert Shapiro,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.500
Jill and Peter Kraus,

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.100
the Junior Associates
of the Museum of Modern Art,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.400
the General Representation
of the Government of Flanders

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.700
to the U.S.A.,

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.400
and the Jo Carole Lauder Publications
Fund of the International Council,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.600
as well as the Museum of Modern Art’s
Wallis Annenberg Fund

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.700
for Innovation in Contemporary Art.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.200
All of which is to say, Christophe,
that we are thrilled to be here

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.900
and to talk a little bit
about an artist and an exhibition

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
that I think are of great importance.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.200
Anyone who’s spent any time
thinking about museums

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.800
in the last couple of decades

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.300
has had to contend not just
with the art historians

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.300
and historians who’ve thought
about museums

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.400
but the artists who have
interrogated the very idea

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.900
of what it means to have a museum,

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.200
and I don't think any artist
has done that more thoughtfully

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.800
or more powerfully
than Marcel Broodthaers.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.300
So let’s begin at the beginning.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.500
Broodthaers, I don't think,
started out to be an artist.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.700
He started out as a poet,

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.800
and do you want to talk
a little bit about the journey

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.300
that brought him to here?

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.000
Yes, absolutely.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.900
Broodthaers started as a poet,

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:05.266
and the first two decades basically
were devoted mostly to poetry,

00:10:05.396 --> 00:10:06.365
not exclusively.

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:09.401
He did films, photograph,
a number of other things,

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:14.281
but he came to his first exhibition
at the age of 40 years old,

00:10:14.448 --> 00:10:16.991
which is at least for today
rather late,

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.455
and without any training
as an artist,

00:10:22.498 --> 00:10:26.041
which I think is quite important
to have in mind

00:10:26.168 --> 00:10:27.788
when you look at his work.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.008
For us, what really mattered
in that exhibition also

00:10:31.173 --> 00:10:33.366
was to bring the poetry back.

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:36.798
I think there is this idea
that in ’64 when he organized

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:39.015
his first exhibition
at Galerie St. Laurent,

00:10:39.473 --> 00:10:40.891
he stopped being a poet.

00:10:41.058 --> 00:10:45.478
And Manolo and I wanted
to show that very idea again,

00:10:45.813 --> 00:10:47.856
that he was a poet
and he remained a poet.

00:10:48.065 --> 00:10:52.026
He was a poet in a different way,
he found new modes of expression,

00:10:52.445 --> 00:10:57.160
but still inhabiting that world.

00:10:57.323 --> 00:11:00.783
So the exhibition really starts,
the first room is really devoted

00:11:00.911 --> 00:11:05.271
to the first poetry book
and those first two decades,

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:06.291
together with film.

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:08.888
That's something people
don't always have in mind,

00:11:09.045 --> 00:11:12.803
that before becoming a visual artist,
he was already versed into film,

00:11:12.965 --> 00:11:15.376
and the first film
is dedicated to Schwitters,

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:18.595
so someone who will have
a great importance on his career.

00:11:20.931 --> 00:11:23.850
When you lay out
an exhibition like this,

00:11:24.185 --> 00:11:27.103
especially with an artist who
had a relatively compressed career,

00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:31.066
there is an awful lot of work
that we have to absorb,

00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:34.671
and there are a lot of mussels,
including a mussel pot,

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.098
that we have to think about.

00:11:36.238 --> 00:11:40.200
Do you want to a talk a little bit
about the sort of early iconography

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:45.471
of Broodthaers’ work
as it leads up to the –

00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:48.161
I hate to even use
the word “more mature” because

00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:52.361
he was a very mature man
when he began working as an artist.

00:11:52.505 --> 00:11:55.548
But I want to start
with the mussel pots and the mussels,

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:59.418
and think about what
he was trying to achieve there.

00:11:59.553 --> 00:12:03.223
One of his very early materials
before the mussel pots

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:06.268
or the mussel shells
or the eggshells is poetry.

00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:09.341
We have Pense-Bête, one
of the first works in the exhibition.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.858
You see those volumes
of unsold poetry books

00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:17.780
carefully embedded into plaster,
and it becoming a sculpture.

00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:23.493
And around that work you have,
it’s true, mussel shells, eggshells,

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:27.200
and I think for him
they had a different meaning,

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.456
a complementary meaning.

00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:31.001
I mean eggs,
everything starts with an egg.

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:34.003
It’s something very primary.

00:12:34.296 --> 00:12:36.590
And if you look back
at the end of the show,

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:40.201
he is very interested in the letter A,
the beginning of the alphabet.

00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:43.083
Again, it’s this idea
to throw something out in the world,

00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:44.156
a bit like a poet,

00:12:44.306 --> 00:12:46.536
and let us just associate it

00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:50.020
with the things
we want to associate it with,

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:54.400
so to create a system
which is extremely open-ended.

00:12:55.191 --> 00:13:01.073
The mussel shells for him,
in French a moule means two things –

00:13:01.865 --> 00:13:03.866
a mussel but also a mold.

00:13:04.033 --> 00:13:07.070
So it’s also something
which creates something

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:08.538
through association.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:12.813
And I think those two objects
were very meaningful for him

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.128
because they were
very much a starting point

00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:20.383
in allowing to create a form
of relationship with the viewer

00:13:20.885 --> 00:13:24.798
which would allow him or her
to appropriate the work

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:30.788
and to understand it
in a different way each time.

00:13:30.936 --> 00:13:36.068
So the show really tried to show how,
by starting with those objects,

00:13:36.233 --> 00:13:40.706
slowly his work evolved and developed
and became more and more complex,

00:13:40.863 --> 00:13:45.283
almost adding layers and layers
to things that he started with.

00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:48.455
And certainly with the eggshells,

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:52.881
there is an inherent sense
of fragility of not just creation

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:57.031
but its opposite that I get,
at least when I look at them.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:01.706
There is also a form
of irreverence in Broodthaers.

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:05.345
Of course, eggshells are discarded,
mussel shells are discarded,

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:08.316
and they’re also extremely fragile
for the eggshells.

00:14:08.473 --> 00:14:10.943
So he is basically asking ourselves,

00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:13.186
“What are you going to do
with those objects?”

00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:16.173
Now that they almost can’t travel,

00:14:16.315 --> 00:14:19.851
or they are very difficult
to move from one place to another,

00:14:19.985 --> 00:14:22.518
and that's something which
is a thread throughout his work.

00:14:22.655 --> 00:14:25.733
We really wanted to end the show
with the Tapis de Sable,

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:29.286
with The Sand Carpet,
which has the same fragility.

00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:32.126
It’s something extremely ephemeral
in a way,

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:37.655
and that goes back
to Broodthaers’ very first idea

00:14:37.795 --> 00:14:41.548
of trying to redefine
what an art object can be.

00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:44.260
And one of the things
that he asked himself was

00:14:44.468 --> 00:14:46.376
what’s the function of an art object?

00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:50.403
And one of the answers he had
was its function is precisely

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:51.683
not to have a function,

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.250
and to take out the function
of something

00:14:54.395 --> 00:14:56.033
in order to make a work of art.

00:14:56.188 --> 00:14:59.046
If you think of the beautiful
white cabinet and white table,

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:00.523
that’s precisely what he did.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.108
You can’t use the table anymore.

00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:03.986
You can’t use the cabinet anymore.

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:05.911
They became extremely fragile

00:15:06.073 --> 00:15:08.700
by being filled or covered
with eggshells.

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:11.315
So there is this kind
of extremely sophisticated

00:15:11.453 --> 00:15:14.706
and deep thinking
of what art means

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:17.375
really right at the beginning
of his work,

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:25.841
back then would we have understood
that it would lead him to the museum?

00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:28.580
Maybe not,
but there is a clear path, I think,

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.306
from the very early objects
to the later years.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.311
Just to stay with some
of the earlier objects for a moment,

00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:41.066
does one read this interest
in the abstraction

00:15:41.233 --> 00:15:43.543
of say monochromatic color?

00:15:43.693 --> 00:15:45.903
In other words,
the eggshells are white,

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.248
the moule tend to be dark blue-black.

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:50.741
Is he interested
in problems of abstractions?

00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:52.775
I’m not sure.

00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:55.080
For me, it’s more
like a form of typography.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.041
You know, a text
is black on white usually,

00:15:58.583 --> 00:16:04.673
and he comes out of that tradition
and that knowledge

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.968
of what does a text mean on a page.

00:16:08.218 --> 00:16:12.446
So for me, I associate that much more
with his kind of literary background

00:16:12.596 --> 00:16:16.185
and this desire
to project words in space,

00:16:16.435 --> 00:16:20.480
and to detach them
from their very own meaning.

00:16:20.688 --> 00:16:24.091
I think that’s another thing
that you can feel very clearly

00:16:24.233 --> 00:16:24.878
in the exhibition,

00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:28.321
that the objects
become words of a poem.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:32.158
They are freed by becoming art.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:38.411
The heart of the exhibition
is the remarkable series of projects

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.198
that he did around his museum.

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:46.148
I think every artist presumably
wants their work at some point

00:16:46.298 --> 00:16:47.256
to be in a museum,

00:16:47.631 --> 00:16:50.343
and Broodthaers took charge
and made his own museum,

00:16:50.551 --> 00:16:54.183
which is a very convenient way
of ensuring that your work

00:16:54.346 --> 00:16:55.306
will be in a museum.

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:59.478
And so of course when his museum
is in another museum,

00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:02.201
we start to build up
all the different layers

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:06.243
of really what constitutes a museum.

00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:09.663
I want to start with something
that's always interested me

00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:12.353
about Broodthaers’ work
which is he makes us realize

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:16.571
that a museum starts with an idea,
even before it starts with objects.

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:19.911
Do you want to walk us
through the various iterations

00:17:20.078 --> 00:17:24.711
of his Musée d’Art Moderne,
Départment des Aigles?

00:17:24.878 --> 00:17:25.753
Yes, the Musée d’Art Moderne,

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.098
the Museum of Modern Art,
Department of Eagles

00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:29.716
is clearly one of the –

00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:32.198
it is the centerpiece
of his practice.

00:17:32.343 --> 00:17:34.805
It’s a museum
but not of his own work.

00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:38.301
There are no works
by Broodthaers in the museum.

00:17:38.433 --> 00:17:40.150
It’s a museum made of postcards,

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:43.021
of slideshows,
of press releases, of crates.

00:17:43.188 --> 00:17:47.615
So basically he is asking
what is the function of art,

00:17:47.776 --> 00:17:50.401
and what is the function
of a museum?

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:52.883
And I think that's
a better platform for him.

00:17:53.031 --> 00:17:55.308
If you think about
how the show is built,

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.491
the two rooms just before that,

00:17:57.618 --> 00:18:01.581
trying to make people aware
how the question of display,

00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:04.638
of presentation,
becomes essential to his work,

00:18:04.793 --> 00:18:07.170
in Le Corbeau et le Renard,
in Mallarmé.

00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:08.963
And the museum is really an attempt

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:12.926
to detach himself
furthermore from the object,

00:18:13.301 --> 00:18:20.325
and being someone who takes in a way
a central but also marginal position

00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:28.566
because he did say that he started
being an artist to become a director.

00:18:28.816 --> 00:18:30.186
Of course, there is a lot of irony.

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:32.335
There is another provocation here.

00:18:32.486 --> 00:18:34.241
But it’s a museum about a museum.

00:18:34.405 --> 00:18:37.868
It’s also a museum
in which an artist regained control.

00:18:38.826 --> 00:18:42.663
When we think
about museums in the ‘60s and ‘70s,

00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:45.541
they become more
and more bureaucratic.

00:18:45.833 --> 00:18:48.170
They are suddenly led by historians,

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:51.146
not by artists
as they often used to be

00:18:51.298 --> 00:18:53.716
if you think earlier
in the 20th century.

00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:57.011
So there is a way to think
about the museum as a tool

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.723
rather than something
which preserves objects.

00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:05.561
Something else which I think people
need to have in mind when they think

00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:10.773
about the museum is that this museum
was in a way fictional but very real,

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.778
so there were installations
that people could go through

00:19:13.945 --> 00:19:15.696
but scattered throughout Europe.

00:19:15.946 --> 00:19:20.488
So they were built over time,
4 years, 7 cities, 12 sections.

00:19:20.618 --> 00:19:23.330
So except for one exception,

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:26.208
there was never two sections
that you would see simultaneously.

00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:28.418
So this idea of dispersal,

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.381
and as you say, the idea
that the museum is an idea,

00:19:31.548 --> 00:19:34.048
and every time
this idea is expressed,

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.210
it’s developed in a different way.

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:38.153
And I think that's one
of the great challenges

00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:41.013
of a Broodthaers show
is what to do with the museum.

00:19:41.556 --> 00:19:45.851
What we wanted to do
is to keep its fragmentary nature,

00:19:46.228 --> 00:19:50.398
like not to come to the conclusion
that if you add up all the sections,

00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:51.733
you have a museum.

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:52.873
You don't.

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:56.933
It’s only the same idea
which is expressed in a different way

00:19:57.071 --> 00:19:59.575
at a different time
in a different place.

00:20:01.116 --> 00:20:03.328
So from the museum,

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:08.666
which he worked on
sporadically but consistently,

00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:11.703
we get to some of the later work

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:17.468
which create
yet another kind of polarity, really.

00:20:17.633 --> 00:20:20.526
And I’m thinking of
Art de Vivre, Art Militaire,

00:20:20.678 --> 00:20:25.510
and this kind of wonderful tension
that you might say

00:20:25.641 --> 00:20:30.261
between these great cannons
and leisure furniture

00:20:30.396 --> 00:20:33.733
that you might associate
with somebody at a camping site.

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:37.611
Do you want to delve into
what was going on there?

00:20:38.196 --> 00:20:42.533
I think in ’72,
he declares his museum bankrupt.

00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:46.455
All too real, by the way.

00:20:48.165 --> 00:20:49.833
And he becomes an artist again,

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:53.693
but an artist who will just
be a very different artist

00:20:53.836 --> 00:20:55.885
than he was
before he started the museum.

00:20:56.046 --> 00:20:59.508
So you see the impact
that project had on his own practice,

00:20:59.843 --> 00:21:04.305
and in a way he becomes a curator
that like the art of display

00:21:04.723 --> 00:21:07.066
becomes absolutely central
to his work,

00:21:07.225 --> 00:21:11.396
and he imagined this idea of décor,
and again, thinking about art,

00:21:11.688 --> 00:21:14.190
how can we give a function
to art again?

00:21:14.356 --> 00:21:16.568
You know décor,
each object has a function,

00:21:16.818 --> 00:21:20.238
and he’s going to recycle
and reuse his older work

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:24.530
in order to rearrange it
in a new constellation,

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:25.951
in a new arrangement,

00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:30.790
every time different
as often as retrospectives.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.363
And the exhibition you mentioned,

00:21:34.501 --> 00:21:38.066
which is presented
in the retrospective,

00:21:38.215 --> 00:21:41.593
Décor: A Conquest,
which was premiered at the ICA,

00:21:42.926 --> 00:21:47.466
is maybe the ultimate décor
in the sense that it’s made

00:21:47.598 --> 00:21:49.600
with bought objects,

00:21:49.935 --> 00:21:52.728
objects that he hadn’t made
for most of them.

00:21:53.438 --> 00:21:55.148
It’s really an art of display,

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.316
and trying to do two things
at the same time,

00:21:58.443 --> 00:22:02.488
to think about this relation
about lifestyles and the military

00:22:02.738 --> 00:22:05.283
in the 19th century
and the 20th century,

00:22:05.491 --> 00:22:06.936
so two oppositions,

00:22:07.076 --> 00:22:08.816
but also to think
about the opposition

00:22:08.953 --> 00:22:11.288
between then 19th century
and the 20th century,

00:22:11.581 --> 00:22:13.990
what happened
between those two centuries.

00:22:14.125 --> 00:22:17.116
So there is always this kind
of extraordinary melancholy part

00:22:17.253 --> 00:22:18.526
of Broodthaers’ work,

00:22:18.671 --> 00:22:24.176
which he is not an artist
who had faced in modernity

00:22:24.426 --> 00:22:26.823
the very idea of failure.

00:22:26.971 --> 00:22:31.046
The idea that art
doesn't always lead for the best

00:22:31.183 --> 00:22:34.436
and society is not always
something which progresses

00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:37.246
I think is very much part
of that work

00:22:37.398 --> 00:22:40.708
because it makes you question
the relationship

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:44.146
between let’s say cannons
and Victorian décor,

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.388
which seems today
a quite nice environment,

00:22:47.533 --> 00:22:51.541
but suddenly it is a much more
aggressive and terrifying opposition

00:22:51.705 --> 00:22:54.896
between leisure and a machine gun
or a hand gun.

00:22:55.041 --> 00:22:59.211
And you see a critique
of our society,

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:04.298
which I think has maybe
never been expressed

00:23:04.425 --> 00:23:11.056
with that force by an artist
before that time.

00:23:11.808 --> 00:23:14.856
I’ve always thought of the cannons
in a way as a kind of pun

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:17.628
that he was playing with
about museums,

00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:22.218
which are in the business of often
articulating canons of art history.

00:23:22.385 --> 00:23:24.863
And here he’s taking real cannons

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:29.336
and showing a different face
to society.

00:23:29.491 --> 00:23:35.516
I think what’s so hard to grasp
sometimes is that sense of humor

00:23:35.683 --> 00:23:36.500
that's there,

00:23:36.666 --> 00:23:40.920
that there is a sense
of seriousness and purposefulness

00:23:41.086 --> 00:23:44.581
to the various projects
that Broodthaers pursued

00:23:44.715 --> 00:23:47.635
but there is also a real
understanding of irony

00:23:47.926 --> 00:23:50.763
and playfulness,
as you said earlier.

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.090
I think one thing
we also wanted to do with the show

00:23:53.225 --> 00:23:55.435
is to bring Broodthaers
as a person into the show

00:23:55.768 --> 00:23:57.791
because I think
at least mostly in the United States,

00:23:57.936 --> 00:24:01.683
he was often turned
into a cerebral or conceptual artist,

00:24:01.816 --> 00:24:06.278
and he was that also,
but he was not only that.

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:08.143
And you’ll see throughout the show,

00:24:08.281 --> 00:24:11.356
and it’s really discussing
with friends, collectors,

00:24:11.493 --> 00:24:13.588
or dealers who met Broodthaers,

00:24:13.745 --> 00:24:16.540
and Herman is here
and he told who he was a little bit,

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:19.728
and we really wanted
to have that figure,

00:24:19.876 --> 00:24:21.473
that presence into the exhibition.

00:24:21.628 --> 00:24:25.715
So the first room, called Schwitters,
you hear Broodthaers speaking.

00:24:26.048 --> 00:24:27.191
In the Mallarmé exhibition,

00:24:27.341 --> 00:24:31.470
you hear Broodthaers
reciting Un Coup de Dés himself.

00:24:32.305 --> 00:24:36.843
You’ll see him in films,
so the idea that he is very present.

00:24:36.976 --> 00:24:40.188
In a way, the work
was very much linked

00:24:42.356 --> 00:24:44.108
almost as a performance

00:24:44.566 --> 00:24:48.021
to the fact that he would
inhabit a space with objects,

00:24:48.153 --> 00:24:52.578
with his capacity
to completely change an environment

00:24:52.745 --> 00:24:56.913
by just adding a couple of objects,
or regrouping older works.

00:24:57.205 --> 00:25:00.096
And that’s another challenge
of this exhibition

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:03.281
is trying to bring the life back
into the work,

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:09.116
which often was maybe seen
in the past through archival images.

00:25:09.258 --> 00:25:13.686
And I think one of the goals
was to trust the physicality

00:25:13.846 --> 00:25:21.730
of the work and of the displays,
and try to rely mostly on those.

00:25:22.688 --> 00:25:25.298
There are relatively few exhibitions
that I can remember

00:25:25.441 --> 00:25:26.681
at the Museum of Modern Art

00:25:26.818 --> 00:25:29.653
that have become
overrun by palm trees.

00:25:32.198 --> 00:25:35.410
What is the significance of those?

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:40.663
And talk a little bit
about the issue of evocation,

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:46.713
that when one looks at the history
of Broodthaers’ own installations,

00:25:46.963 --> 00:25:49.940
how does one go about
recreating them, evoking them,

00:25:50.106 --> 00:25:51.258
dealing with them?

00:25:51.676 --> 00:25:54.408
I think the palm tree,
the first time they appeared,

00:25:54.553 --> 00:25:55.971
they appeared in a group show

00:25:56.138 --> 00:25:58.850
which was composed mostly
of Minimalist and Conceptual artists.

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:03.935
And Broodthaers decided to stage
the first version of Winter Garden,

00:26:04.063 --> 00:26:05.936
so there is a provocation there.

00:26:06.065 --> 00:26:09.735
What you have is slab on the floor,
letters on the wall,

00:26:10.111 --> 00:26:14.306
and suddenly you have
this kind of old-fashioned décor

00:26:14.448 --> 00:26:17.535
which goes back
to Belgium’s own history,

00:26:17.826 --> 00:26:19.120
its colonies,

00:26:19.828 --> 00:26:24.981
but almost
an antiquated installation.

00:26:25.126 --> 00:26:29.838
And for him,
those palm trees were first –

00:26:30.006 --> 00:26:32.615
at least when he
installed them in ’74 –

00:26:32.758 --> 00:26:34.801
the stage for a film.

00:26:35.095 --> 00:26:37.541
So again, a work
which creates something else

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.091
by him inhabiting that space.

00:26:40.225 --> 00:26:41.923
And what you see
in the second version

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:43.571
of Winter Garden that we are showing,

00:26:43.728 --> 00:26:45.603
you see not only the palm tree,

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:48.446
but you see a film on which
you see Broodthaers walking

00:26:48.608 --> 00:26:50.526
through the Palais des Beaux-Arts
with a camel.

00:26:51.026 --> 00:26:54.341
So again, this idea
to bring back exoticism,

00:26:54.488 --> 00:27:00.203
just try to work
with opposition by surprise,

00:27:00.578 --> 00:27:06.186
and the palm tree over the years
became another signature of his work,

00:27:06.333 --> 00:27:11.653
as the mussel and maybe the eggshells
used to be in the early ‘60s.

00:27:11.798 --> 00:27:14.373
And he reused them
also within his own work

00:27:14.508 --> 00:27:16.833
as he reused his mussel shells
and eggshells,

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:20.638
and the first piece you see
when you enter the show

00:27:20.765 --> 00:27:22.391
is called the Entrance of the Exhibition.

00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:25.061
You see those giant palm trees
with some of his work

00:27:25.311 --> 00:27:27.313
arranged as a mini-retrospective,

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:30.608
which again is creating
that effect of surprise,

00:27:30.775 --> 00:27:33.896
this idea that you are not
in a museum anymore.

00:27:34.028 --> 00:27:36.155
You are transported
in a different place.

00:27:36.488 --> 00:27:39.328
So to think about the museum
as something, again,

00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:41.428
going back to the idea
that the museum is an idea

00:27:41.576 --> 00:27:44.643
and can project
into an imaginary landscape.

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:46.081
Was he a Romantic?

00:27:46.833 --> 00:27:49.043
Well, he loved Romantic poetry
at least.

00:27:51.003 --> 00:27:53.506
Let us turn for a moment
to all of you

00:27:53.673 --> 00:27:57.926
and see if there are any questions
that you would like to ask.

00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:01.143
Please, don't be hesitant or shy.

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:02.265
Maria?

00:28:03.265 --> 00:28:05.143
We’ll get you a microphone
in one second.

00:28:07.728 --> 00:28:10.106
I would like
to answer your last question,

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:12.400
was he a Romantic,

00:28:12.775 --> 00:28:16.486
and I would say yes
but he was a Realist.

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:19.988
I always say, if someone asks me,

00:28:20.116 --> 00:28:27.998
he is a Romantic Realist
or a Realist Romantic.

00:28:28.875 --> 00:28:30.278
So thank you, Maria,

00:28:30.418 --> 00:28:34.088
that he was a Romantic Realist
or a Realist Romantic.

00:28:35.046 --> 00:28:40.450
I asked the question for a reason
because there is a tendency,

00:28:40.595 --> 00:28:44.931
at least for my generation,
to read Broodthaers very seriously.

00:28:45.141 --> 00:28:52.886
And what I think this exhibition
tries to tease out of his work

00:28:53.023 --> 00:28:57.381
is the fullness of the artist,
the fullness of the man,

00:28:57.528 --> 00:29:00.636
and that there
is a whimsy there, right?

00:29:00.781 --> 00:29:07.081
Those provocations are not
just meant to get people excited,

00:29:07.246 --> 00:29:11.541
but when you think
about the kind of rigor

00:29:11.835 --> 00:29:15.028
of Minimalism
and post-Minimalist art

00:29:15.195 --> 00:29:16.588
in the ‘60s and ‘70s,

00:29:16.798 --> 00:29:21.581
and the idea of these palm trees
sort of interrupting that

00:29:21.718 --> 00:29:25.515
and making people
sort of stop and ask themselves

00:29:25.973 --> 00:29:27.470
what are they looking at and why,

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.823
I think there is that quest
for something higher,

00:29:30.978 --> 00:29:33.936
something even greater
than just the object itself,

00:29:34.065 --> 00:29:38.165
and I think that's part of what
this exhibition tries to tease out

00:29:38.318 --> 00:29:39.903
of Broodthaers’ work.

00:29:43.115 --> 00:29:47.453
Other questions or thoughts
that anyone would like to share?

00:29:48.328 --> 00:29:49.303
Yes, please, right there,

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:51.706
and we’ll get you a microphone
just so we can all hear you.

00:29:53.333 --> 00:29:56.170
What is the significance
of the eagle?

00:29:58.548 --> 00:30:01.716
The eagle has many signification
or no signification,

00:30:02.176 --> 00:30:04.261
I even came to doubt that.

00:30:04.595 --> 00:30:11.685
There is one section of the museum
where he basically put together

00:30:12.061 --> 00:30:17.066
every object that he can find,
being fine art or just a bottle,

00:30:17.483 --> 00:30:19.443
with the sign of the eagle.

00:30:19.735 --> 00:30:22.333
And of course there is this kind
of power attached to the eagle

00:30:22.488 --> 00:30:23.948
there is this past as well.

00:30:24.323 --> 00:30:28.416
It’s something coming
from very deep into the centuries

00:30:28.578 --> 00:30:32.373
by association,
so it’s a very powerful emblem.

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:35.226
But at the same time,
it’s an empty emblem.

00:30:35.376 --> 00:30:39.130
You can find an eagle
on a handkerchief or on a painting.

00:30:39.505 --> 00:30:42.611
So it’s something which
has all meanings but no meaning,

00:30:42.758 --> 00:30:44.801
something which is just a shell.

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:49.916
And I think for him
it was a perfect image

00:30:50.056 --> 00:30:53.435
in order to represent something
which it wasn’t about the eagle

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:56.813
but it was about the power
of the image of the eagle.

00:30:57.523 --> 00:31:02.128
But I also think one
of the beauties of his museum,

00:31:02.278 --> 00:31:04.788
the Museum of Modern Art,
the Musée d’Art Moderne,

00:31:04.946 --> 00:31:09.368
so it’s immediate evocation
of institutions like this one

00:31:10.286 --> 00:31:12.330
or many others in Europe.

00:31:12.621 --> 00:31:14.943
And then instead
of having a Department of Art

00:31:15.081 --> 00:31:17.418
or a Department
of the Twentieth Century,

00:31:17.668 --> 00:31:19.636
it has a Department of Eagles, right?

00:31:19.795 --> 00:31:22.038
I mean, you just – you have to smile!

00:31:22.173 --> 00:31:23.388
You just have to say, okay,

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:27.551
he’s getting at the taxonomy
of museums, right?

00:31:27.678 --> 00:31:30.348
We are all organized structurally,

00:31:30.556 --> 00:31:33.893
either chronologically
or by media or by some theme,

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:36.908
and what he’s saying
is “Think about it.”

00:31:37.063 --> 00:31:39.481
At least the way I read it,
he says “Think about it.

00:31:39.773 --> 00:31:44.175
Does it really make sense the way
you’ve organized your museum?”

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.613
When he’s speaking
to the museum at large,

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:48.281
at least that's how I read it.

00:31:49.325 --> 00:31:50.033
Please?

00:31:51.785 --> 00:32:00.106
I see these eagles and palm trees
and shells and oysters and so forth,

00:32:00.251 --> 00:32:03.776
they’re all poetic interventions
of one kind or another,

00:32:03.923 --> 00:32:04.840
from my point of view,

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:08.970
and with those interventions
there is always a dash of irony.

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:12.403
And it occurred to me
that the other artist I know

00:32:12.556 --> 00:32:15.058
who uses palm trees
is John Baldessari,

00:32:15.266 --> 00:32:18.018
but it’s also ironic,

00:32:18.145 --> 00:32:20.743
and I’m wondering
if you could speak to that effect

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:22.400
in terms of the comparison?

00:32:22.775 --> 00:32:24.121
Well, I think John is from LA,

00:32:24.288 --> 00:32:30.741
so palm trees
are more part of his daily life.

00:32:31.325 --> 00:32:34.888
But clearly I think,
not to speak for John Baldessari,

00:32:35.036 --> 00:32:37.730
but this idea of leisure
in John Baldessari,

00:32:37.873 --> 00:32:42.993
but there is something
much more again casual

00:32:43.128 --> 00:32:44.656
in the reference to palm trees

00:32:44.796 --> 00:32:50.155
that maybe someone using palm trees
in the early ‘70s in Brussels,

00:32:50.301 --> 00:32:54.468
there is this kind of displacement
which I feel is much stronger

00:32:54.598 --> 00:32:59.978
in terms of impression
that it has on the viewer.

00:33:01.021 --> 00:33:02.905
But also, Christophe, my sense

00:33:03.065 --> 00:33:05.790
at least from the documentary
photography that I’ve seen

00:33:05.943 --> 00:33:07.981
is that many
of Broodthaers’ installations

00:33:08.111 --> 00:33:10.196
took place in Beaux-Arts buildings,

00:33:10.531 --> 00:33:13.321
and those Beaux-Arts buildings
certainly in Europe –

00:33:13.488 --> 00:33:15.911
and I’m thinking
even of late Victorian buildings –

00:33:16.495 --> 00:33:21.398
they had palm trees
as part of their not art

00:33:21.541 --> 00:33:24.041
but part of the sort of ambiance,

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:27.715
and is he not also kind of
pulling that out as well?

00:33:28.298 --> 00:33:31.135
Well, I think what interested
was everything but the art,

00:33:31.468 --> 00:33:34.596
if you think about how
he wants to study and to interrogate.

00:33:34.763 --> 00:33:37.311
The museum is to remove
what we consider essential,

00:33:37.475 --> 00:33:38.441
is the art object,

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.460
and it is going
to question everything around –

00:33:40.603 --> 00:33:45.650
the taxonomy, the advertisement
department of a museum,

00:33:45.816 --> 00:33:49.820
the way we distribute things,
the way we announce events.

00:33:50.488 --> 00:33:51.793
And palm trees are part of that.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.450
They are the décor, they aid décor.

00:33:55.493 --> 00:33:58.620
Other questions, please.
Yes, in the middle there.

00:34:04.918 --> 00:34:09.376
There are lots of tributes
to René Magritte in the exhibition.

00:34:09.506 --> 00:34:11.836
I wanted to ask
if you could speak a bit

00:34:12.003 --> 00:34:14.761
to the dialogue between both artists.

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:18.515
They met each other early
in the mid-‘40s.

00:34:19.558 --> 00:34:24.605
Magritte was I think very important
for Broodthaers in many ways.

00:34:25.021 --> 00:34:31.986
One of them is his understanding
and his love for Stéphane Mallarmé.

00:34:32.238 --> 00:34:33.811
When he met Magritte,

00:34:33.948 --> 00:34:37.118
Magritte suggested
that he read Mallarmé,

00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:39.956
and you see how Mallarmé

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.311
is extremely present
in the exhibition,

00:34:42.456 --> 00:34:45.668
even if you think about this room
where you have the black floor,

00:34:46.001 --> 00:34:52.006
which is a close echo of a show
that he had organized,

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:54.968
the four vacuformed plates or pipes.

00:34:55.176 --> 00:34:57.578
So they pay homage to Magritte

00:34:57.721 --> 00:35:01.458
who helped him to understand
the significance and the importance

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.268
of Mallarmé, and in other ways.

00:35:03.518 --> 00:35:07.105
Magritte is a master of the relation
between words and image,

00:35:07.273 --> 00:35:10.096
so they had a deep,
interesting relationship.

00:35:10.233 --> 00:35:14.363
Magritte I think even
was a supporter of Broodthaers’ work,

00:35:15.321 --> 00:35:16.413
as other artists.

00:35:16.573 --> 00:35:18.168
If you think of Broodthaers,

00:35:18.325 --> 00:35:20.520
what we wanted to show
is the importance of Magritte

00:35:20.661 --> 00:35:23.241
but also the importance
of Schwitters, of Mallarmé,

00:35:23.371 --> 00:35:24.790
and Baudelaire and so on.

00:35:25.916 --> 00:35:28.251
So Broodthaers
had a number of artists

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:30.891
to whom he frequently paid homage,

00:35:31.046 --> 00:35:33.086
and he sometimes found inspiration,

00:35:33.215 --> 00:35:36.760
and tried to bring their work
into a different dimension.

00:35:37.178 --> 00:35:40.943
And if you think of the relationship
of Broodthaers and Magritte,

00:35:41.098 --> 00:35:42.433
he would take things from Magritte

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.185
but he would project them
in a completely new universe.

00:35:45.645 --> 00:35:49.898
And there is something in fact
very moving in that relationship.

00:35:52.651 --> 00:35:54.778
Other questions?
Yes, right there, please.

00:35:56.446 --> 00:35:59.258
Does he have a standing
in a purely literary world

00:35:59.408 --> 00:36:03.203
besides his artistic?

00:36:04.205 --> 00:36:04.945
Not so much.

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.275
I mean, he published
a number of poetry books

00:36:07.416 --> 00:36:10.281
so he was part
of the literary scene in Brussels,

00:36:10.418 --> 00:36:14.738
so he published
in important literary magazines,

00:36:14.881 --> 00:36:17.635
but not that often.

00:36:18.593 --> 00:36:23.036
One of the difficulties he had,
he couldn't live from his poetry,

00:36:23.181 --> 00:36:25.976
like it wouldn't provide him
a living and an existence,

00:36:27.018 --> 00:36:31.286
and his poetry was I think
kept to a small number of people.

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:36.861
So I think he was a poet
known in Brussels but without,

00:36:37.153 --> 00:36:41.116
I would say,
a recognition much beyond that.

00:36:43.451 --> 00:36:44.828
Other questions?

00:36:49.291 --> 00:36:51.515
If not, before we close,
I should remind everybody

00:36:51.668 --> 00:36:55.778
that after the exhibition is finished
here at the Museum of Modern Art,

00:36:55.923 --> 00:36:58.188
it will travel to Madrid
in the Reina Sofia

00:36:58.341 --> 00:37:01.483
where Manolo Borja
is not just the co-curator

00:37:01.636 --> 00:37:04.556
of this exhibition
but also the very talented director.

00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:09.486
And from Madrid it will
conclude its tour in Düsseldorf.

00:37:09.645 --> 00:37:13.923
So it will be seen widely
over the coming year plus,

00:37:14.066 --> 00:37:17.921
and we’re thrilled to be able
to celebrate its opening here

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:20.113
at the Museum of Modern Art today.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.371
Thank you so much for joining us.

00:37:21.538 --> 00:37:22.450
Thank you.
