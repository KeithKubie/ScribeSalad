00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.670
Do you ever wish you could go behind the scenes
of your favourite TV show to see how it gets

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.670
made?

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.640
Some people would probably say no -- it might
ruin the magic for them.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.299
But most people would probably love to see
what it’s like on the set of Game of Thrones

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.570
or The Walking Dead.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.830
Is it really as exciting as they make it look
in the finished product?

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.620
Here are 10 Behind the Scenes Facts You Never
Knew About Popular TV Shows.

The meth is actually candy in Breaking Bad

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.829
In Breaking Bad, Bryan Cranston plays Walter
White, a high school teacher who turns to

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.530
crystal meth manufacturing when times get
bad.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.780
Wearing nothing but his underwear and a gas
mask, White cooks up some primo product in

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.149
his trailer, which is tinted blue and actually
looks kind of tasty.

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.350
But what was the meth ? According to a radio
interview with Bryan Cranston, all the meth

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.710
was made of cotton candy-flavoured rock candy,
and actors would often eat it during long

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.820
days on set, just to get a little bit of energy.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.110
The kids who auditioned for Stranger Things
had to read the script for Stand By Me

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.899
Stranger Things is a series that wears its
influences on its sleeves, and one of those

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.500
influences is the classic 80s film Stand By
Me, based on a novel by Stephen King.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.869
Though it’s set in the 1950s, the film tells
a story about a similar group of boys, who

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.189
travel out into the forest to see a dead body.

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.310
Apparently, the casting director had prospective
actors read lines from the script to Stand

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.110
By Me while they were auditioning.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:41.369
It was just that important that the new actors
captured the same feeling as the older film.

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.880
Dan Harmon and Chevy Chase fought on the set
of Community

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.469
The cult hit comedy Community attracted a
devoted group of fans with its smart and self-aware

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:50.899
riffs on pop culture.

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.200
But even though the characters of the show
were one big family, the drama behind the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.820
scenes could get pretty brutal.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.820
Chevy Chase, who played Pierce, a cranky old
man from the study group, hated working for

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.731
Dan Harmon, who created the show.

00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:06.829
The feud got so bad that Harmon was actually
fired at the end of season 3.

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.410
But when Chase walked off the set at the end
of season 4, NBC brought Harmon back to wrap

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.510
up the series.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.879
The wreckage was a part of the score of Lost

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.040
Fans of the cult hit Lost know that the series
begins with one heck of a plane crash, which

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.500
is pretty epic for a network TV series.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.700
They might also know that the score, created
by Michael Giacchino is a creepy, unsettling

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.150
affair that also leaves room for a lot of
emotion attachment.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.739
What they might not know is that Giacchino
used actual pieces of that wreckage to use

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.130
for percussion on the show’s original score.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.700
The wreckage was scavenged after the shoot
and brought to the recording studio, where

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.240
Giacchino has his way with it.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.799
Perhaps that’s why it’s so unsettling?

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.640
Parks and Recreation was originally a spinoff
of The Office

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.129
A fast-paced mockumentary about about a workplace
full of loveable -- but sometimes frustrating

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:57.129
-- human beings?

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.709
A boss who lacks self-awareness and is prone
to embarrassing situations?

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.680
You could be describing The Office -- or you
could be describing Parks and Recreation,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.350
which was co-created by Greg Daniels, who
also adapted The Office for American television.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.480
In fact, he originally envisioned Parks and
Rec as a spinoff to the hit Steve Carrell

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.099
show, but changed his mind after a few months
of toying with idea in development.

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.260
Still, nobody would have been surprised if
Dwight Schrute showed up in Pawnee at some

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.260
point.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.230
Luck got cancelled because horses kept dying

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.090
Back in 2012, HBO thought it had another hit
on its hand with Luck, a series about a horse-racing

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.760
track starring Dustin Hoffman.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.000
The series was created by David Milch, the
mastermind behind Deadwood and NYPD Blue.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.340
The series premiered to good reviews, but
it got cancelled anyway.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.340
The reason?

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.090
The horses on set kept dying.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.209
Two horses were euthanized after getting injured
during the filming of the first season, and

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.500
when a third horse died during early production
of the second season, HBO pulled the plug

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.799
on the show, citing health and safety concerns.

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.349
Larry David voiced George Steinbrenner on
Seinfeld

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.659
When George Costanza gets a job with the New
York Yankees in Seinfeld, his boss was a version

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:09.370
of the real life George Steinbrenner, though
you never get to see his face and he sounded

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.130
a little different from the real thing.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.430
If you’re wondering whose voice is coming
from behind Steinbrenner’s chair, it’s

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.540
Seinfeld co-creator Larry David.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.169
His voice might seem familiar now, given that
David has starred in eight seasons of Curb

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.620
Your Enthusiasm, but at the time he was more
of a behind-the-scenes figure.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:32.150
Though maybe it convinced him he could be
an actor?

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:38.280
Hank Azaria auditioned for the role of Joey
in Friends

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.590
Most people probably know Hank Azaria best
for his various voice roles on The Simpsons.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.180
Moe, Chief Wiggum, Apu, Disco Stu…

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.180
It’s all Azaria.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.690
But he also played Phoebe’s lover David
on Friends, a scientist who ended their relationship

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:51.940
to move to Minsk.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.020
He eventually returned to New York, but Phoebe
ended up with Mike, played by Paul Rudd.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.419
That wasn’t Azaria’s first rejection,
however.

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.310
He also auditioned for the role of Joey…
twice!

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.130
To be honest, though, we’re pretty glad
Joey wasn’t played by the same person as

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:11.050
Comic Book Guy.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.770
Game of Thrones has an unaired pilot

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.810
Game of Thrones is one of the most popular
series on TV, but despite the chemistry of

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.470
the cast, it didn’t always look the way
it does now.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.750
In fact, HBO filmed an entire pilot with a
different director and some different cast

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:25.750
members.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.720
This version was directed by Thomas McCarthy,
who also made the Oscar-winning Spotlight,

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.000
but maybe wasn’t quite the right choice
for a Westeros-set drama.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.480
Daenarys Targaryen and Catelyn Stark were
played by different actors, too.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.210
Still, HBO saw the promise, so they picked
up the series and let DB Weiss and David Benioff

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.199
rewrite and reshoot the first episode.

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:51.540
We’re glad 
that they did!

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.479
Last suppers in The Walking Dead

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.610
Fans of The Walking Dead know that no one
is safe.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.300
Anybody on that series could die at any time.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.810
Such is the nature of a zombie-infest post-apocalyptic
world.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.009
So do the cast and crew do anything to cope
with the loss of a long-time colleague?

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:08.370
Actually, they do.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.130
The night before filming a major death scene,
the crew puts on a “Last Supper” for the

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.520
principal actors, giving the doomed actor
a chance to eat whatever they want, just like

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.610
the prisoners on death row.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.159
It’s really the least they can do for their
soon-to-be-unemployed co-star.
