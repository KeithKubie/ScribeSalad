maybe a little bit more for their work
and that can guarantee that maybe they

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:09.190
and that can guarantee that maybe they
 

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.340
and that can guarantee that maybe they
make something on their work and what if

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:11.350
make something on their work and what if
 

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:14.700
make something on their work and what if

and we're still way behind so that's the
other thing is technology is slow and so

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:14.410
other thing is technology is slow and so

we've got to kind of use duct tape to

we've got to kind of use duct tape to
 

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.060
we've got to kind of use duct tape to
pull together the innovative projects

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:18.070

educational settings people don't talk

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:27.190
educational settings people don't talk
 

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:30.480
educational settings people don't talk
about we say students but I woke up one

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:30.490
about we say students but I woke up one
 

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:31.500
about we say students but I woke up one
day and realize I was reading the paper

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:31.510
day and realize I was reading the paper
 

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:32.699

else and so I think we need to realize
 

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:41.010
else and so I think we need to realize
that the consumer is king and we need to

that the consumer is king and we need to
 

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.780
that the consumer is king and we need to

realized there's a lot of films stuck on
 

00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:41.069
realized there's a lot of films stuck on
the shelf there's a lot of film and

archives not archives as much but
 

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.829
archives not archives as much but
definitely distributors of content that

00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:52.839
definitely distributors of content that
 

00:14:52.839 --> 00:14:54.240
definitely distributors of content that
we want to use in the educational

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:54.250
we want to use in the educational
 

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:56.519
we want to use in the educational

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:00.670
so in the future the other thing we
 

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:03.090
so in the future the other thing we
realized is that when I've done at Rice

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:03.100
realized is that when I've done at Rice
 

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.700

University people kept on saying

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:04.710
University people kept on saying
 

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:05.840
University people kept on saying
quickly well you know we have to face

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:05.850
quickly well you know we have to face
 

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:08.210
quickly well you know we have to face
the the sustainability issue and the

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:08.220
the the sustainability issue and the
 

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.350
the the sustainability issue and the
rights issues and then they'll move on

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360
rights issues and then they'll move on
 

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.400
rights issues and then they'll move on
to some other topic because I don't want

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:10.410
to some other topic because I don't want
 

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:11.390
to some other topic because I don't want
to talk about those two because they

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:11.400
to talk about those two because they
 

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.550
to talk about those two because they
didn't have an answer for any of them so

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.560
didn't have an answer for any of them so
 

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.110
didn't have an answer for any of them so
we think we've built with this project

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120
we think we've built with this project
 

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.030
we think we've built with this project
which I'll go through something that

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040
which I'll go through something that
 

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.530
which I'll go through something that
could potentially be a sustainable

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:18.540

and they could move into open content
 

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:25.160
and they could move into open content
solutions so what we've done is we have

have worked with the lab and this is not
 

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:51.170
have worked with the lab and this is not
a less than quality job we're working

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:51.180
a less than quality job we're working
 

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.030
a less than quality job we're working
with an established laboratory and on

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040
with an established laboratory and on
 

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.620
with an established laboratory and on
average it will cost about four hundred

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:54.630
average it will cost about four hundred
 

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.930

do super 8 regular 8 all kinds of
 

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:03.650
do super 8 regular 8 all kinds of
formats for that or cheaper it's about

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:03.660
formats for that or cheaper it's about
 

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.410
formats for that or cheaper it's about
four hundred dollars however we do it on

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:06.420
four hundred dollars however we do it on
 

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.050
four hundred dollars however we do it on
a deferred basis so you can start making

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:09.060
a deferred basis so you can start making
 

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.300
a deferred basis so you can start making
money back from that content sale and

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:11.310
money back from that content sale and
 

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:12.950
money back from that content sale and
start paying off the cost of that

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:12.960
start paying off the cost of that
 

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.140
start paying off the cost of that
digitization and we hope to be moving to

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:15.150
digitization and we hope to be moving to
 

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:19.940
digitization and we hope to be moving to
where film will be free as well it's a

all the different problems here so we
 

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.990
all the different problems here so we
are doing a series of convenings around

to kept an analog format yet we can put
it in the system and make it sustainable

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:28.620
it in the system and make it sustainable
 

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:32.000

and last we will also be doing a lot of

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.010
and last we will also be doing a lot of
 

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:33.620
and last we will also be doing a lot of
work around rights issues which will be

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:33.630
work around rights issues which will be
 

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.900
work around rights issues which will be
a huge stumbling block for a lot of this

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:35.910
a huge stumbling block for a lot of this
 

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.690
a huge stumbling block for a lot of this
work and most of it will become bigger

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:38.700
work and most of it will become bigger
 

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.820

for both open and paid content and
 

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:11.150
for both open and paid content and
potentially become a sustainable place

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:11.160
potentially become a sustainable place
 

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:17.240
potentially become a sustainable place
