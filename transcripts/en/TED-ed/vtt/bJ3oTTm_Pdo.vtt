00:00:10.332 --> 00:00:12.458
Have you ever been gazing at a starry sky

00:00:12.458 --> 00:00:16.209
when suddenly 
a bright dot glided into view?

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.141
If it wasn't blinking, then you've had
the distinct pleasure

00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:24.282
of seeing one of mankind's greatest 
collaborative feats with your own eyes:

00:00:24.282 --> 00:00:27.555
The International Space Station.

00:00:27.555 --> 00:00:33.020
Roughly the size of six-bedroom house,
and weighing more than 320 cars,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.096
the International Space Station 
is so large

00:00:36.096 --> 00:00:40.051
that no single rocket could have 
lifted it into orbit.

00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:42.757
Instead, it was assembled piece by piece

00:00:42.757 --> 00:00:47.569
while hurtling through space
at 28,000 kilometers per hour,

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:50.907
lapping the Earth once every 90 minutes.

00:00:50.907 --> 00:00:53.509
It all started when sixteen nations signed

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:56.591
the Space Station 
Intergovernmental Agreement,

00:00:56.591 --> 00:01:01.418
laying out each partner's 
expected contributions to the ISS,

00:01:01.418 --> 00:01:05.817
from modules and maintenance
to sharing information and finances.

00:01:05.817 --> 00:01:08.683
At an estimated 100 billion U.S. dollars,

00:01:08.683 --> 00:01:14.000
the Space Station would be
the most expensive object ever built.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.094
The whole world watched

00:01:15.094 --> 00:01:20.560
as a Russian rocket launched 
the first module of the ISS into the sky.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.115
Zarya, meaning sunrise, 
was equipped with two solar panels

00:01:25.115 --> 00:01:27.719
and a propulsion system 
that had the important task

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:31.193
of keeping the young station 
from crashing into the Earth

00:01:31.193 --> 00:01:35.178
by staying a safe 400 kilometers away.

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:39.124
The U.S. Space Shuttle Endeavour
followed two weeks later

00:01:39.124 --> 00:01:43.654
carrying Unity, a node module to which
other modules could be connected,

00:01:43.654 --> 00:01:47.763
and an international 
six-person assembly crew.

00:01:47.763 --> 00:01:53.289
Then came Zvezda, which brought
communications and living accommodations.

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.885
Ever since the International 
Space Station's first tenants arrived,

00:01:56.885 --> 00:01:58.806
it's been continually occupied

00:01:58.806 --> 00:02:04.820
with more than 200 visitors spending 
an average of six months on board.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.488
Astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti 
holds the record

00:02:07.488 --> 00:02:14.715
for the longest single space flight
by a woman at 199 days on the ISS.

00:02:14.715 --> 00:02:19.795
2001 saw the arrival of Destiny,
the first of four research modules,

00:02:19.795 --> 00:02:23.451
where astronauts spend
approximately 36 hours a week

00:02:23.451 --> 00:02:27.564
conducting extraordinary experiments
in microgravity.

00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:29.719
Their schedules are packed with exercise,

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.260
two hours a day to fend off 
muscle atrophy,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.863
station maintenance and repair,

00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:39.425
and connecting with family 
or awe-inspired minds around the world.

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:42.399
But they still find time for fun,
with regular movie nights

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:46.521
and even shooting 
the first music video in space.

00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:51.913
Destiny also controls the seven-jointed
robotic Canadarm2.

00:02:51.913 --> 00:02:55.195
Capable of moving 
more than 100,000 kilograms,

00:02:55.195 --> 00:03:00.043
it's perfect for unloading 
new arrivals from shuttles.

00:03:00.043 --> 00:03:04.184
2001 was a busy year for the Space Station
with the addition of Quest,

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.980
the main airlock for strolls outside,

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.615
and Pirs, a pier for Russian 
spacecrafts to dock

00:03:10.615 --> 00:03:15.246
including the ever-ready 
emergency escape vehicle, Soyuz.

00:03:15.246 --> 00:03:18.904
Then, on February 1st, 2003,

00:03:18.904 --> 00:03:21.829
after delivering 
research modules to the ISS,

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.779
the space shuttle
Columbia exploded during reentry

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:29.987
tragically killing 
the seven-member crew on board.

00:03:29.987 --> 00:03:33.325
After a four-year hiatus, work quickly
picked up pace

00:03:33.325 --> 00:03:36.888
with the addition of more hubs, 
airlocks, docks,

00:03:36.888 --> 00:03:45.073
and an observation cupola for stunning
360-degree views of our world and beyond.

00:03:45.073 --> 00:03:49.324
Other critical components included 
platforms and trusses to support radiators

00:03:49.324 --> 00:03:54.622
that direct all the heat generated
by the station's electronics into space

00:03:54.622 --> 00:03:59.511
and solar panels that are efficient enough
to power 55 homes.

00:03:59.511 --> 00:04:01.913
It took ten years and over 30 missions,

00:04:01.913 --> 00:04:06.250
but finally, the International 
Space Station was complete,

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.564
coinciding with the U.S. Space 
Shuttle Program's retirement.

00:04:09.564 --> 00:04:12.939
The Space Station continues to serve
as an incredible model

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:15.538
for international collaboration.

00:04:15.538 --> 00:04:19.268
This year, two people 
began a one-year stay on the ISS,

00:04:19.268 --> 00:04:23.794
allowing scientists to study the long-term
physical and psychological effects

00:04:23.794 --> 00:04:25.846
of being in space,

00:04:25.846 --> 00:04:29.219
which would prove useful for increasingly
ambitious space travel,

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:31.595
like trips to Mars.

00:04:31.595 --> 00:04:35.325
Over its lifetime, we've learned 
an immense amount scientifically,

00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:38.176
but also about 
our capacity to work together

00:04:38.176 --> 00:04:41.000
and accomplish truly remarkable acts.
