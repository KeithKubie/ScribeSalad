00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860
answer typically is slightly fewer if we
 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.780
answer typically is slightly fewer if we
eat it raw sorry slightly fewer if we're

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790
eat it raw sorry slightly fewer if we're
 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.500
eat it raw sorry slightly fewer if we're
cooked yeah and this was just testing us

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510
cooked yeah and this was just testing us
 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.600
cooked yeah and this was just testing us
there if we were listening thank you

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610
there if we were listening thank you
 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.810
there if we were listening thank you
exactly right reciprocate it's okay so

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820
exactly right reciprocate it's okay so
 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.110
exactly right reciprocate it's okay so
the fact is that that's what the science

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120
the fact is that that's what the science
 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.909
the fact is that that's what the science
tells us is not represented in the

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919
tells us is not represented in the
 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.490
tells us is not represented in the
public information available and and if

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500
public information available and and if
 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.230
public information available and and if
we're going to think about efficient use

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240
we're going to think about efficient use
 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.850
we're going to think about efficient use
of our food then we should really be

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860
of our food then we should really be
 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.950
of our food then we should really be
prepared to understand the science of

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960
prepared to understand the science of
 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.980
prepared to understand the science of
what cooking does of course in terms of

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990
what cooking does of course in terms of
 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.840
what cooking does of course in terms of
the nutrients sometimes it goes in one

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850
the nutrients sometimes it goes in one
 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.460
the nutrients sometimes it goes in one
way and sometimes goes in another there

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470
way and sometimes goes in another there
 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.700

are some vitamins that are reduced by

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710
are some vitamins that are reduced by
 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:33.990
are some vitamins that are reduced by
cooking and there are others that are

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000
cooking and there are others that are
 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.360
cooking and there are others that are
increased so we need a whole lot more

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370
increased so we need a whole lot more
 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.690
increased so we need a whole lot more
information about exactly how much the

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700
information about exactly how much the
 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.610
information about exactly how much the
impact of cooking has affected us and

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620
impact of cooking has affected us and
 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.740
impact of cooking has affected us and
you asked about how long has been going

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750
you asked about how long has been going
 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.390
you asked about how long has been going
on and it's a matter of debate among

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400
on and it's a matter of debate among
 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.280
on and it's a matter of debate among
anthropologists but it certainly has

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290
anthropologists but it certainly has
 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.350
anthropologists but it certainly has
gone on for a million years and and I

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360
gone on for a million years and and I
 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.210
gone on for a million years and and I
think it made us human i think it's gone

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220
think it made us human i think it's gone
 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.040
think it made us human i think it's gone
back two million years how did it all

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050
back two million years how did it all
 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.640
back two million years how did it all
start how did your stone well we were

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650
start how did your stone well we were
 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.930
start how did your stone well we were
sitting there by the fire look once

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940
sitting there by the fire look once
 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.310
sitting there by the fire look once
you're sitting there by the fire it

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320
you're sitting there by the fire it
 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.719
you're sitting there by the fire it
would take about a week

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:04.729
would take about a week
 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:06.279
would take about a week
to figure out that you should cook

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:06.289
to figure out that you should cook
 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:10.450
to figure out that you should cook
although we've tested all of the great

bonobos they all prefer their food
 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.189
bonobos they all prefer their food
cooked but that's not unusual Oh animals

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:18.199
cooked but that's not unusual Oh animals
 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:22.029
cooked but that's not unusual Oh animals
do dogs do cats do rats do mice do every

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:22.039
do dogs do cats do rats do mice do every
 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:25.299
do dogs do cats do rats do mice do every
animal understands that their food

00:06:25.299 --> 00:06:25.309
animal understands that their food
 

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:28.659

perception system is adapted to seeing

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:28.669

where the most energy comes from in

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:30.529
where the most energy comes from in
 

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:32.739
where the most energy comes from in
their foods so the question is how do

00:06:32.739 --> 00:06:32.749
their foods so the question is how do
 

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:35.140
their foods so the question is how do
they get into contact with fire exactly

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150
they get into contact with fire exactly
 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.320
they get into contact with fire exactly
are we near time shy accident yeah might

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330
are we near time shy accident yeah might
 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.920
are we near time shy accident yeah might
have been because it gets more tasty

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930
have been because it gets more tasty
 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.149
have been because it gets more tasty
well I mean if you want to think about

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:43.159
well I mean if you want to think about
 

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:46.179
well I mean if you want to think about
it then very likely the way in which we

00:06:46.179 --> 00:06:46.189
it then very likely the way in which we
 

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:48.879
it then very likely the way in which we
interacted with fire first was to use it

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:48.889
interacted with fire first was to use it
 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:50.469
interacted with fire first was to use it
as a way to defend against predators

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479
as a way to defend against predators
 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:51.969
as a way to defend against predators
that meant we could come down from the

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:51.979
that meant we could come down from the
 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:54.010
that meant we could come down from the
trees and sleep on the ground as soon as

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.020
trees and sleep on the ground as soon as
 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.209
trees and sleep on the ground as soon as
you're interacting with fire on a

00:06:55.209 --> 00:06:55.219
you're interacting with fire on a
 

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:58.299
you're interacting with fire on a
regular basis then very quickly food

00:06:58.299 --> 00:06:58.309
regular basis then very quickly food
 

00:06:58.309 --> 00:07:00.610
regular basis then very quickly food
would fall into the fire and you would

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:00.620
would fall into the fire and you would
 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.980
would fall into the fire and you would
realize that this is worth perpetuating

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:02.990
realize that this is worth perpetuating
 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.100
realize that this is worth perpetuating
it's worth it mm-hmm and Dan christiani

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.110
it's worth it mm-hmm and Dan christiani
 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.189
it's worth it mm-hmm and Dan christiani
and the book you have written having did

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199
and the book you have written having did
 

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:11.829
and the book you have written having did
you bring it oh no it's me it's it's

00:07:11.829 --> 00:07:11.839
you bring it oh no it's me it's it's
 

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:14.019
you bring it oh no it's me it's it's
back there oh I have written book so you

00:07:14.019 --> 00:07:14.029
back there oh I have written book so you
 

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:16.179
back there oh I have written book so you
have written so many books but no no no

00:07:16.179 --> 00:07:16.189
have written so many books but no no no
 

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:18.339
have written so many books but no no no
this is a cookbook I know that's what I

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:18.349
this is a cookbook I know that's what I
 

00:07:18.349 --> 00:07:21.159
this is a cookbook I know that's what I
want you to tell us yeah I'm and i'ma

to bring together at one table to solve
 

00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:44.399
to bring together at one table to solve
difficult problems and the food has a

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:44.409
difficult problems and the food has a
 

00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:47.110
difficult problems and the food has a
wonderful ability to make them sort of

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120
wonderful ability to make them sort of
 

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.559

better mood and I think this is the

00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:52.039
better mood and I think this is the
 

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:55.659

sharing a common meal and I think that
 

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:05.799
sharing a common meal and I think that
is a very very important social social
