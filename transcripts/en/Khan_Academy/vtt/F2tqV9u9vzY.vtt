00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.447
- [Instructor] So in any
discussion of ancient Persia,

00:00:02.447 --> 00:00:06.245
we quickly talk about the
faith of the Achaemenid Empire,

00:00:06.245 --> 00:00:07.842
and that's Zoroastrianism,

00:00:07.842 --> 00:00:09.946
and it's popularized by Cyrus the Great

00:00:09.946 --> 00:00:12.815
when he establishes the Achaemenid Empire,

00:00:12.815 --> 00:00:14.251
takes over the Median Empire,

00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:17.473
the Neo-Babylonian Empire, the Lydians.

00:00:17.473 --> 00:00:20.216
His son, Cambyses, takes
over the Egyptians.

00:00:20.216 --> 00:00:23.895
And their faith is based on
the teaching of Zoroaster.

00:00:23.895 --> 00:00:27.222
And Zoroaster is the Greek
name for Zarathustra,

00:00:27.222 --> 00:00:29.102
and sometimes the religion is referred to

00:00:29.102 --> 00:00:31.145
as Zarathustrianism.

00:00:31.145 --> 00:00:33.844
And it's one of the
oldest religions we have,

00:00:33.844 --> 00:00:35.175
and it's an existing religion.

00:00:35.175 --> 00:00:38.282
People still practice Zoroastrianism.

00:00:38.282 --> 00:00:39.992
In terms of when it started,

00:00:39.992 --> 00:00:41.929
there's some debate.

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:43.590
A lot of accounts have it starting

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.670
as early or even earlier
than 3,500 years ago,

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.739
so around 1500 BCE,

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.449
and some accounts put
it a little bit closer

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:51.514
to Cyrus the Great,

00:00:51.514 --> 00:00:53.264
maybe 700 or 600 BCE.

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:55.986
And the accounts,

00:00:55.986 --> 00:00:57.185
or the beginning of the religion

00:00:57.185 --> 00:01:01.447
is really around the
teachings of Zarathustra,

00:01:01.447 --> 00:01:06.142
and his teachings really
establish one of the first

00:01:06.142 --> 00:01:08.815
often viewed as monotheistic
religions of the world,

00:01:08.815 --> 00:01:11.250
this idea that there is one god,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.097
and that god in the Zoroastrian
faith is Ahura Mazda.

00:01:16.097 --> 00:01:17.718
Ahura Mazda.

00:01:17.718 --> 00:01:20.838
And it's viewed that Ahura Mazda

00:01:20.838 --> 00:01:22.714
does not take a human form.

00:01:22.714 --> 00:01:25.479
It is even, you cannot even conceive of,

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.307
you know, fully conceive,

00:01:27.307 --> 00:01:30.839
the human mind can't fully
conceive of Ahura Mazda,

00:01:30.839 --> 00:01:32.756
but Ahura Mazda is the,

00:01:33.605 --> 00:01:34.750
in the Zoroastrian faith,

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.515
the one and only god.

00:01:36.515 --> 00:01:40.655
But in conjunction with
the idea of Ahura Mazda,

00:01:40.655 --> 00:01:43.301
a lot of people refer to Zoroastrianism

00:01:43.301 --> 00:01:45.051
as a dualistic faith.

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:49.618
A dualistic faith means that
there's this kind of interest

00:01:49.618 --> 00:01:51.868
in counterbalancing forces.

00:01:53.158 --> 00:01:55.741
For example, light versus dark,

00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:00.500
and of course good versus evil.

00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:06.379
And one of the main ideas or words here

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:08.962
are the ideas of asha and druj.

00:02:10.472 --> 00:02:14.314
So asha, these are the
ideas of being principled,

00:02:14.314 --> 00:02:15.809
honest, ordered,

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:17.892
and druj is the opposite.

00:02:18.824 --> 00:02:21.405
Druj is the idea of being unprincipled,

00:02:21.405 --> 00:02:23.403
dishonest, chaotic.

00:02:23.403 --> 00:02:25.494
And so there's a lot of talk

00:02:25.494 --> 00:02:29.661
and kind of insight or trying
to get a better understanding

00:02:30.988 --> 00:02:33.267
of these dualistic natures in the world,

00:02:33.267 --> 00:02:36.016
and trying for humanity be
on the side of the good,

00:02:36.016 --> 00:02:37.401
the light, the ordered,

00:02:37.401 --> 00:02:39.553
the principled, the honest.

00:02:39.553 --> 00:02:43.121
Now right over here is a
key symbol of Zoroastrianism

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:43.954
that you might see.

00:02:43.954 --> 00:02:45.822
It's called the Faravahar.

00:02:45.822 --> 00:02:48.225
I'm probably be mispronouncing it.

00:02:48.225 --> 00:02:52.510
Faravahar, and there's
a lot of symbolism here.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.928
It shows the connection of
the universe to humanity,

00:02:55.928 --> 00:02:58.007
you see the depiction
of a human being here,

00:02:58.007 --> 00:03:00.334
and the three layers of the wings

00:03:00.334 --> 00:03:03.737
depict these three very important
ideas in Zoroastrianism.

00:03:03.737 --> 00:03:06.487
The first layer is good thoughts,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.807
the second layer right over
here of wings are good words,

00:03:15.892 --> 00:03:19.051
and then the third layer
here is good actions,

00:03:19.051 --> 00:03:20.362
good actions.

00:03:20.362 --> 00:03:21.195
And it makes sense.

00:03:21.195 --> 00:03:22.314
You kind of imagine this idea

00:03:22.314 --> 00:03:24.712
that good thoughts lead to good words,

00:03:24.712 --> 00:03:25.727
and that combined,

00:03:25.727 --> 00:03:27.245
they can lead to good actions.

00:03:27.245 --> 00:03:28.304
And on the tail here,

00:03:28.304 --> 00:03:29.903
and these are the things you should avoid,

00:03:29.903 --> 00:03:31.846
these are the bad thoughts,

00:03:31.846 --> 00:03:33.960
the bad actions,

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.684
or the bad thoughts, the bad words,

00:03:36.684 --> 00:03:38.351
and the bad actions.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.462
Along lines this ideas of dualism,

00:03:42.462 --> 00:03:46.234
especially the fascination
with the ideas of light,

00:03:46.234 --> 00:03:49.703
fire is a very important element
of the Zoroastrian faith.

00:03:49.703 --> 00:03:51.527
In fact, if you visit
a Zoroastrian temple,

00:03:51.527 --> 00:03:53.584
you will see an eternal fire,

00:03:53.584 --> 00:03:56.223
and they feed that fire five times a day.

00:03:56.223 --> 00:04:00.345
Another very important
element of the faith is water.

00:04:00.345 --> 00:04:02.901
And the sacred text for the Zoroastrians

00:04:02.901 --> 00:04:04.651
is called the Avesta.

00:04:05.574 --> 00:04:07.936
And the Avesta is written in
a language called Avestan,

00:04:07.936 --> 00:04:09.598
and it's called Avestan
because it's the language

00:04:09.598 --> 00:04:11.132
that the Avesta was written in,

00:04:11.132 --> 00:04:13.609
but it's written in a language

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.807
that is closely related
to ancient Sanskrit,

00:04:16.807 --> 00:04:19.537
and so there's probably some connections,

00:04:19.537 --> 00:04:21.453
or for sure there's some connections,

00:04:21.453 --> 00:04:25.399
between ancient Hinduism
and the progenitor

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:27.562
or some of the preexisting ideas

00:04:27.562 --> 00:04:30.520
that might, that Zarathustra developed

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.649
or might have built on top of.

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:35.909
Now one of the really interesting things

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:38.774
about Zoroastrianism is
that even though today

00:04:38.774 --> 00:04:41.188
it's a relatively small faith,

00:04:41.188 --> 00:04:43.147
on the order of less than 200,000 people

00:04:43.147 --> 00:04:44.235
around the world practice it,

00:04:44.235 --> 00:04:47.535
and most of them are in
India and the United States,

00:04:47.535 --> 00:04:49.033
at one time, it was,

00:04:49.033 --> 00:04:51.803
you could view it as the state
religion of ancient Persia,

00:04:51.803 --> 00:04:52.636
but then eventually,

00:04:52.636 --> 00:04:54.803
in the seventh century CE,

00:04:55.974 --> 00:04:59.057
when Persia, or Iran, became Islamic,

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.684
you have a Zoroastrian diaspora,

00:05:02.684 --> 00:05:04.818
especially moving to
India and then eventually

00:05:04.818 --> 00:05:05.663
places like the United States,

00:05:05.663 --> 00:05:09.477
although there are still
practicing Zoroastrians in Iran.

00:05:09.477 --> 00:05:11.552
But above and beyond the continuing legacy

00:05:11.552 --> 00:05:13.717
of the Zoroastrians,

00:05:13.717 --> 00:05:15.192
they've had a lot of influence

00:05:15.192 --> 00:05:17.912
on some of the major
religions of the world.

00:05:17.912 --> 00:05:19.327
And what you have on this timeline here,

00:05:19.327 --> 00:05:20.993
I've made some of the major religions.

00:05:20.993 --> 00:05:24.066
You see up here in blue you have Judaism,

00:05:24.066 --> 00:05:25.771
and the reason why I
draw the dotted line is

00:05:25.771 --> 00:05:27.394
these are periods and it's not exact,

00:05:27.394 --> 00:05:29.395
you know, these religions are evolving

00:05:29.395 --> 00:05:31.006
and they are forming and they're getting

00:05:31.006 --> 00:05:32.764
more and more tradition over time.

00:05:32.764 --> 00:05:35.116
So you hear Judaism, and of course,

00:05:35.116 --> 00:05:38.677
Christianity is in a lot
ways built on top of Judaism.

00:05:38.677 --> 00:05:40.094
Jesus was Jewish.

00:05:41.287 --> 00:05:42.963
You have Islam right over here,

00:05:42.963 --> 00:05:46.076
which of the major world
religions is one of the newest,

00:05:46.076 --> 00:05:49.237
in a lot of ways built or related

00:05:49.237 --> 00:05:51.570
to Christianity and Judaism.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.057
And even though the Zoroastrianism

00:05:56.057 --> 00:06:00.058
is related and it kind
of comes out of a similar

00:06:00.058 --> 00:06:03.725
kind of early Aryan
people type of religion,

00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:06.391
it has a lot of influence

00:06:06.391 --> 00:06:09.670
on some of these other traditional,

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.290
or these mainstream religions

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.933
that we have in the world today.

00:06:12.933 --> 00:06:14.068
As we mentioned,

00:06:14.068 --> 00:06:17.211
it's viewed as a monotheistic religion,

00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:19.846
and it's also had direct influence on,

00:06:19.846 --> 00:06:21.897
for example, Christianity.

00:06:21.897 --> 00:06:23.949
So right over here,

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:26.335
this is from John Bowker,

00:06:26.335 --> 00:06:29.166
who's a famous Christian theologian.

00:06:29.166 --> 00:06:30.538
He wrote in his book World Religions

00:06:30.538 --> 00:06:32.452
"that angels, the end of the world,

00:06:32.452 --> 00:06:34.366
"a final judgement, the resurrection,

00:06:34.366 --> 00:06:37.394
"and heaven and hell
received form and substance

00:06:37.394 --> 00:06:40.093
"from Zoroastrian beliefs."

00:06:40.093 --> 00:06:42.505
In Christian tradition,

00:06:42.505 --> 00:06:44.793
the Three Wise Men, the Three Kings,

00:06:44.793 --> 00:06:48.210
the Three Magi that visit the baby Jesus,

00:06:49.205 --> 00:06:52.562
Magi, this is referring
to Zoroastrian priests

00:06:52.562 --> 00:06:54.203
who were visiting the baby Jesus.

00:06:54.203 --> 00:06:57.079
And the word magic comes
from the word magi,

00:06:57.079 --> 00:07:00.717
because the Zoroastrian
elite, the priests,

00:07:00.717 --> 00:07:04.884
they were very capable in
the sciences of astronomy,

00:07:06.156 --> 00:07:08.612
and they were also very
well-known for their astrology,

00:07:08.612 --> 00:07:11.504
and so some people associated them with,

00:07:11.504 --> 00:07:14.229
you know, magical capabilities.

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:17.017
It also has close ties to Islam.

00:07:17.017 --> 00:07:20.414
The sacred fire in Zoroastrianism
is fed five times a day.

00:07:20.414 --> 00:07:23.331
Zoroastrians pray five times a day,

00:07:24.223 --> 00:07:25.757
and before prayer,

00:07:25.757 --> 00:07:30.346
they go through a ritual
around washing themselves

00:07:30.346 --> 00:07:31.375
to cleanse themselves,

00:07:31.375 --> 00:07:34.123
where they wash themselves
three times before each prayer.

00:07:34.123 --> 00:07:36.884
That is something that we see in Islam.

00:07:36.884 --> 00:07:37.970
So Zoroastrianism,

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.611
it's the faith of ancient Persia

00:07:40.611 --> 00:07:43.836
popularized by Cyrus the Great,

00:07:43.836 --> 00:07:46.933
and it's a living religion, even today,

00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:49.685
although it's a much smaller
population that practices it.

00:07:49.685 --> 00:07:50.634
But as we've seen,

00:07:50.634 --> 00:07:51.908
it's had a lot of influence

00:07:51.908 --> 00:07:54.991
on many of the major world religions.
