00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
We've done one already I think called the ...
mentioning the Tiltman break and it's

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.630
got to the stage, now, where somebody
comes and says: "Remind us. What was the

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.859
Tiltman Break. Why was it so important?"
and so on. The Tiltman Break exploited a

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.320
weakness in any cipher that's based on
bitwise exclusive-OR, as indeed all the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:31.500
Tunny traffic exactly was - just that -
I suppose I could very briefly - and not

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.340
using too much notation to frighten
computer scientists - but just as

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.950
a reminder. What happens with exclusive-OR,
which I'll denote with a + in a

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:48.980
circle. And effectively what happens with
it is that if you take a piece of

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:56.910
plaintext and you add on to it a key
character, what you'll end up with is an

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.280
enciphered version of that plain
character. And it's all done with bitwise

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:10.260
exclusive-OR. And if you say: "Well, in what
code are these characters expressed?" then,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.390
in what we're talking about in the
middle 1940s, it was the International

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.799
Teleprinter Code, five-hole, which had
been well known for quite a few years,

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.229
since the '20s I think. And it was
used for telegrams, telex, transatlantic

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:34.020
communications and so on. So what happens,
then, is if you take something and

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.400
exclusive-OR it with something else - a
5-hole tape character - you will get

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.380
encrypted text. If you look at that and
then visit the ZigZag Decryption video,

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.860
where Sean and I've done an even
simpler example, you'll find out how

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.490
zig-zag decryption works. You get a bit of
Plaintext#1 one, it predicts Plaintext#2

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.570
The Plaintext#2 goes on a little bit
further and then that predicts a bit

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.770
more of Plaintext#1. And you flip-flop
between the two streams. That's why it's

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.090
called zig-zag decryption.
So, using zig-zag decryption on all of

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.629
three thousand characters, very early on
in this game,

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:17.389
the Allies really had got an absolute
bonanza here. Because if you then go back

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:22.069
and say: "Well, look, we know the plaintext
now, we know what ciphertext we received,

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.909
exclusive-OR tells us that 'plaintext' +
'ciphertext' gives 'key'. We've got

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:33.859
3,000 characters-worth of key, So why
was it called the Tiltman break? Well, it

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:38.540
was called the Tiltman break because
Colonel John Tiltman, who was a

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.549
mathematician as well as being a
military man, knew about the properties

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:49.010
and the weaknesses of exclusive-OR. And
he knew that under addition, like this,

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.219
the key would cancel out and you could use this 
zig-zag techniquea. He did it and it

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:59.480
took him 10 days and he was a German expert as well.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.949
He had enough mathematics knowledge but
was a serious military-German expert.

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:08.659
We do make it painfully easy - and we do wave
our hands and greatly oversimplify it.

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:13.099
You've got to remember that, in real life,
what happens is you start zig-zagging and

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.290
then, suddenly, your German expert says:"Oh
dear! I can't see that that's the start

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.500
of a new German word! Oh dear!" And, in the
end, you might get blocked. But not often

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.970
because what you can then do is look
further along the message and see if you

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.530
can guess another "island" [of plaintext] in 
the middle. It might be 'geheim'. That was another

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.680
good word: 'secret'. Why not drag 'geheim'
through the D-stream with exclusive-OR

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.069
and see if you get something looking
like 'geheim' at the same place below

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:48.799
it, in the other one [e.g. plaintext #2]. So,  you got 
islands of decrypted stuff. And your job was to

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.389
link the islands and get everything -
including the less common German words

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:58.280
that had appeared. And in the end Tiltman
did it. 10 days it took him. I think it

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.620
would have taken him a lot less if he had
to do it a second time, obviously,

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.930
because you get the hang of the zigzag
technique. So Tiltman had done all this

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.989
work. But I think, for a month or two
in the Research Section, nobody could

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.400
figure out what on earth sort of machine
it was that could be generating stuff

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.620
that looked like this. So new recruit Bill Tutte,
from Cambridge - enrolled for

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.790
a Chemistry degree, not Mathematics, but
very keen on

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.950
recreational mathematics. He was given
the job and he decided that having learned

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.890
at cipher school that if you think that
there could be a periodicity in the

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:41.020
cipher then you'd better start looking for
what period, what repetition rate it

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:47.320
was on . And prior to being put to work on
this Tiltman Break he'd worked on a

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.030
similar cogs-based ciphering machine - a
Swedish one called the Hagelin machine.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.200
And I think it's fair to say that
there's enough similarity there that is:

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:02.890
"Oh yeah! maybe it's a cogs machine? Prime numbers 
of [teeth on the] cogs because we've discovered

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.780
the prime, or relative prime, of the numbers 
of [teeth on the] cogs is the magic formula. 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:15.910
And he said: "OK the head of the section - Gerry
Morgan - has told me that they have reason

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.670
to believe that one of the cogs in this
machine has got 23 teeth on it". So, we've

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:26.220
covered in another video how he started
looking for 23 but accidentally found 41 [teeth].

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.580
However there is something following on
after that which is intended to

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.140
randomize it sufficiently well that it
will disguise the 41. But it's not been

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:45.280
done well enough and occasionally the 41-icity
of this is breaking through the murk

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.130
and convincing us that  that's right.
So, he announces this to the rest of the

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:57.100
Research Section and they go mad for
several weeks trying to find out what

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.720
the [teeth numbers on the ] other streams must be.
Because, don't forget, it's teleprinter code. Five

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.600
streams 1 2 3 4 5 but looks like some
kind of two-stage mechanism. There's an

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.690
initial attempt to encrypt this but
then there's a follow-up that's trying

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:19.630
to disguise the periodicity of all these
wheels. Well after a lot of effort by all

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:25.570
the Research Section they cracked it. So
here is what happens. You feed in an

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:31.480
ordinary teleprinter character into this
adaptor. It goes through the first set of

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.940
wheels which Bill Tutte - in all the things
I have read nobody explains why - he decided he

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.080
would call the first set of wheels the 'chi wheels' 
The Greek character

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.030
chi which is written out like that [draws character 
on paper] and the second set that follows on

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.990
afterwards, there they are look, here's
the first set that is then passed on

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:54.640
into a second set of wheels which he
called the psi wheels. And there's the

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:00.460
character psi. And those psi wheels were
meant to give an extra element of

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.360
disguise as to exactly what it was the
chi wheels were doing and to make

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:10.630
decryption that bit harder. Chi wheels
put out a certain pattern of 1s and

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:16.090
0s which gets exclusive-OR'd with the
incoming character. They then all turn on

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:21.790
All the chi wheels always move in synchrony,
together. But that doesn't get boring

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:26.440
because there's different numbers of
teeth on these wheels. I mean here on

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:33.460
stream 1 there's the famous 41. Next
wheel along has got 31 teeth, then 29 26

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:39.640
- not prime but relatively prime to all
the rest - [then] 23. That first stage encryption

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.960
then travels onto the psi wheels. But
the designers the machine thought it

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:52.240
would make it even harder for the Allies
if we make it so that the psi wheels don't

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.800
always move on with every character.
Let's put in a 'stutter' mechanism - or at

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.730
least that's what the decryptors came to
call it. Sometimes they move and sometimes

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.330
they don't. OK that will make it harder?

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.980
Actually, in the end, it made it easier, as several
statisticians pointed out. But that was

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:15.100
the way it was and the reason that Bill
Tutte was able to prevail, and to see 41,

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:21.520
was that the psi-wheel patterns were
really bad. And by 'really bad' I mean they

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:28.990
left the second set of wheels not
rotating for 5. 6, 7 characters

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:35.170
on end. Y'know they didn't change the
pattern at all! So, you've got this great

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:40.240
thing where very clearly it was been
exclusive-OR'd in the second stage with

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.620
the same thing over and over and over
again. And if that gets up to 6 or

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:49.390
7 times, it's basically saying [that] it's
only a single-stage machine again

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:53.910
because the second stage isn't varying fast enough.
Bill Tutte

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:58.410
said: "Thank heavens for this. We were so
lucky in the war. Number one the 

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:01.950
Tiltman Break: that chap [the machine operator] should 
not have sent that message again and [thereby] given us

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:06.990
3200 characters of key, potentially. But what really finished

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:11.790
them was that they failed to disguise the periodicity of 
the chi wheels

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:18.810
because they had inadequate psi wheel
patterns that let great long unaltered stretches

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:24.120
come through. And that's what gave us
just enough evidence that we could work

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:31.920
out that the psi wheels had got 43 47
51 53 59 and so on. So we won't go into

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.490
the details of precisely how that
calamity occurred. Let's just say that

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:40.140
whoever was in charge of psi-wheel
movements really goofed in the early

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.280
stages and as Tutte again says, it
didn't matter that when we came back

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:49.500
later they [had] put their error right and
made it better in future. By that time we

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:56.100
knew the periodicity of the wheels. So
the only worry then was - and another of

00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:01.890
Bill Tutte's colleagues, and later his
PhD supervisor actually, a guy called

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:07.320
Shaun Wylie, who was down the hill in Hut
8, with Alan Turing and various other

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:14.700
worthies was brought up the hill, along
with Jack Good and Donald Michie. People

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:20.070
were brought from Hut 8, and Naval Enigma,
to help out with Tunny. And Sean Wylie, in

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:24.240
one of his writings about this, says: "Do
you know the thing that panicked us

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:30.150
straight after finding out this
wonderful layout of the machine [was] let's

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:34.920
hope these wheels were not
interchangeable!" Could you imagine if

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:40.380
instead of having 41 31, so on, down
here, it was possible to pick them out

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:44.580
and put them in different slots and
permute them, like on Enigma, and he said:

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.810
'Thank heavens after analyzing several
weeks of traffic we were convinced these

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:53.670
things were fixed; it was always going to
be 41 31 whatever. So that's one big worry

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:59.400
out of the way. So that was more or less
the situation that was left then. You'd

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:05.970
got this fabulous break -
the key subtracted itself out; there was

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:11.340
enough indications in there to work out
what the periodicity of the wheels was -

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:16.220
and they're all relatively prime to each
other - but where do we go from here?

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:22.350
Whenever somebody uses the same initial settings

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:27.390
which they shouldn't do - they're ordered not
to do it - if ever this happens again and

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:32.839
gives what Bletchley Park calls a 'depth' -
-  and you remember the famous, 

00:11:32.839 --> 00:11:39.750
absolutely famous, indicator setting 
of the Tiltman Break was HQIBPEXEZMUG,

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:46.500
12 characters. Yeah, well, that was how
they knew it was worthwhile exclusive

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:50.850
or-ing them because the operator, the
next time round when he repeated it, sent

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:57.300
out this thing [again] saying: 'my settings are
HQIBPEXEZMUG'.  So, you know it's

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.950
worthwhile exclusive or-ing them
together seeing what you can find out.

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:07.080
So, they relied absolutely on the fact that in
the early days - and up until mid to late

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:12.660
1942 - the operators were told to send out
the Indicator so the other end knew how

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:17.060
to set the wheels relative to one another.

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:25.110
What they didn't do except very
infrequently, thank heavens, was to change

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:29.940
what's called the 'patterns' on the wheels.
It's probably about time we said a

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:34.230
little bit more about that. What I've
drawn out for you here on that diagram

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:39.750
is the simplest wheel of all with the
fewest teeth that was 23. Here is my

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:43.890
notional starting point and you can see
I've numbered them 01, 02, 03, 04.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:49.230
So, just imagine, that
after every exclusive-OR character that

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:53.850
contributes, this wheel is moving
clockwise around from 6 to 7. And then it

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:58.470
moves to position 8 and so on. The dot
means this is contributing a 1 when it

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:03.360
comes around to the start position. And
otherwise it contributes a 0. So these

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.050
things, the the dots, are called the
'patterns' on the wheels.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:12.759
Now, again, a huge stroke of luck
for the Allies. It was such a pain

00:13:12.759 --> 00:13:18.970
setting up all of these wheels, all 12 of
them, with different patterns, and you had

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:23.170
a little slider to slide a ratchet up
and down, as to whether it was 1 or 0, that

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:31.660
the Germans only changed the patterns
every month. Phew! that meant that you had

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:40.839
one month to try and get depths -
you know things where the person had

00:13:40.839 --> 00:13:45.129
used the same Indicator twice. It may not
be as a repeat of the same,

00:13:45.129 --> 00:13:49.749
exactly same, message. That really was an
absolute gift from on high.

00:13:49.749 --> 00:13:55.149
Typically, though, an operator would say:
"I've used HQIBPEXEZMUG, you know, that one

00:13:55.149 --> 00:13:58.929
[that message] was about 'Parachute dispositions in Salonica'
Oh! there's  another one here I've got

00:13:58.929 --> 00:14:04.689
to send which is about when General Katzenzinger
next has his leave break.

00:14:04.689 --> 00:14:10.179
Oh! what Indicator should I use there? Oh well! let's
use this one again. They'll never decrypt

00:14:10.179 --> 00:14:14.410
this it doesn't matter. So, very often,
your zigzag was not between two similar

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:18.429
messages it was between two very
different messages. But at least they'd

00:14:18.429 --> 00:14:24.009
use the same settings. That, again, explains
why you needed German [language] experts around to

00:14:24.009 --> 00:14:28.839
say: "Oh! y'know, yes, that is the start
of something or other [significant] down here".

00:14:28.839 --> 00:14:33.339
So, that was the name of the game. Hope that the
lazy operators give you depths by using

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:40.569
the same indicators. Then Bill Tutte came
up with an extra method in late '41,

00:14:40.569 --> 00:14:50.949
I think and said: "I know. Let's try and look
for 'near depths' because a slightly less

00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:56.829
lazy operator would say HQIBPEXEZMUG,
we're not going to use

00:14:56.829 --> 00:15:00.790
the same one twice.
I'll only change one of them [Indicator letters]. 
It's such a faff.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:06.910
Let me just change one of them. Now
if only one of those settings was

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:12.160
changed and if it happened to be on a
first stage chi wheel, Bill Tutte pointed

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:18.100
out that from the other four [chi settings] that you
knew were the same as the last time, and

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.990
only one has changed, you can, with some mind-bending

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:27.110
attention to complexity and the help of
German experts sitting next to you, say

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:37.500
it's not ZMUG at the end it's RMUG. So
have we got any other messages, from

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:42.029
earlier on, that we've part-broken which had
R in that position? Who knows? 

00:15:42.029 --> 00:15:44.850
That might help.
So, he said, typically you might end up

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:49.800
with 20 or 30 possibilities, once
you'd propagated this 'R not Z'

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.959
through all the morass of stuff that
you've got. And he said but, yeah, with the

00:15:54.959 --> 00:15:58.740
help of some really good German [linguist] guys
that could work. And that was more

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:03.000
evidence, you see, because that could be
backtracked into working out what the

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:10.560
wheel patterns were a bit more. So I
think the feeling in the Research

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:15.320
Section was: 'This is OK so long as they
keep sending out the Indicator settings'

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:21.690
But we need a lot more techniques to get
us out of trouble if that isn't the case.

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:26.190
&lt;ironic-voice&gt;
Well, everybody knows, of course, that
Turing did everything at Bletchley Park.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:30.450
Nobody else was of any importance at all :-)
&lt;/ironic-voice&gt;
And I hope that one of the things that

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:35.220
this set of videos may be doing for you
is to emphasize that, very important

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:40.260
though he was, he didn't do absolutely
everything. One of the problems with the

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.920
secrecy, particularly in the late
70s and early 80s when this

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:48.630
news about Bletchley Park began to
trickle out - but a lot was still under

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:53.430
the Official Secrets Act - is that some
computer scientists, historians and

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:59.459
writers very incautiously started saying:
"Oh well! If Turing took what the Poles

00:16:59.459 --> 00:17:04.709
did for Enigma and developed it on, and
then did Naval Enigma and got that

00:17:04.709 --> 00:17:09.480
sorted out, he's such a genius it stands
to reason it must have been him running

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:16.199
the whole Tunny / Lorentz / Colossus show". 
No - not true!  I think our friend and

00:17:16.199 --> 00:17:20.699
colleague, Jack Copeland, whose book you
see up there, 'Colossus',  would be the first

00:17:20.699 --> 00:17:27.870
to want me to say: "No - Alan Turing had
nothing to do with Colossus! Colossus was

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:34.440
purely Tommy Flowers."   He [Turing] did make a 
contribution towards the decrypting Tunny effort

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.900
and it was a very very helpful one.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:43.000
Here we are, in early '42, there's been the
Tiltman break. Bill Tutte has worked back

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.470
from that, and the Research Section
helped him to find out the disposition

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:52.900
of the wheels on this Tunny ciphering
machine. What was the problem? Because

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:58.540
every message sent out on that machine
had an indicator, showing the start

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:06.820
positions of all of the cogwheels. The
bigger problem was the worry that the

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:12.280
patterns on the wheels - the patterns of
0s and 1s - a lot of people spent a

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:19.810
lot of brainpower working back through
depths, where people had used the same, you

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:25.720
know, Indicator twice, trying to backtrack
through the key text into saying: "What

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:29.830
does this mean about what the patterns
are?" And, in the end, if you gathered

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:34.270
enough evidence - and certainly with the
Tiltman break there was so much evidence

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:38.410
there they really did get the whole
thing sorted out. They managed to work

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:43.300
out, for that month, exactly what all the
wheel patterns must have been. [It] took a lot

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:48.610
of people a lot of effort, by hand. But it
was done. But the worry was we're gonna

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:53.920
more and more be saying: "We want to get
the patterns". At the moment we're saved

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:59.710
by the fact that we have a month to
build up, and analyze, evidence before it

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:05.650
changes again. So, you know, let's say for
a typical example, start of August, you

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:10.450
start collecting evidence as to what
this month's patterns must be. You look

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:16.360
for depths. You've got all the indicators
and by maybe August 20th, or

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.080
mid-August if you're very lucky,
you've got enough evidence to work out

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:24.190
what the patterns on the wheels are for
this month. Then you go back to all the

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:28.300
stuff that was transmitted earlier in
the month, that you didn't understand. But

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.390
now you've got the patterns you can go
back and see what the messages were. And

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:36.510
so long as the developments in the war
are not happening at a breakneck pace

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:42.280
then the fact that this intelligence was
two weeks old didn't matter too much.

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:47.680
Because it was high-quality intelligence.
Remember this is Hitler's High Command

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.870
talking about strategic things, so it was
still valuable. Suddenly I think it was

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:58.030
late '42 the moment they'd all dreaded.
Calamity. Somebody in the German High

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:03.820
Command said: "... although it's inconceivable
that this is being broken (!) we are idiots

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:08.950
if we start sending out stuff we don't
need to send out, [i.e.]  these Indicator

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:14.470
settings. Why not distribute a codebook
to everybody and say I'm using wheel

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:18.820
patterns [correction: 'wheel settings'] no. 356 today?"  
That's exactly what they did on Enigma, remember.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:23.320
[The] same argument came out. "Oh they don't 
understand it. It'll work.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:29.320
It'll be all right". No! no,  one step, y'know, 
belt and braces approach to this,

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:33.940
and don't send information that you
don't need to. So, there they were then.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:39.130
All of a sudden they didn't know what
the Indicator was any more. But they did

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:44.800
know when things were being sent in
depth because a lazy operator would say,

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:50.350
to his opposite number: "I'm using entry
no. 356 in the codebook".

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:55.300
And then, a little later on: "I'm still
using 356".  So you didn't know

00:20:55.300 --> 00:21:00.460
what [Indicator setting] 356 was, but you knew it
was a depth with the same start point. So,

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:04.570
the business about exclusive-OR addition
and being able, maybe, to do a bit of

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:11.110
zig-zagging still applied. But it was [still] a
pain not knowing the settings! So this

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:16.780
was the time then that by this stage Max
Newman - who was one of Turing's tutors

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:22.180
remember, at Cambridge, had joined the
Research Section and his brief - that he

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.210
set for himself - was to mechanize
wherever possible,.

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:30.880
just like they done for Enigma. Bill Tutte
came to him, very shyly, he says, one

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:35.530
morning and he [Newman] was sitting with the
other head of section, Gerry Morgan, I think.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:41.620
So, Max Newman was in charge of
mechanization of any sort and he

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:47.620
formed a subset called the 'Newmanry'
out of the Research Section and then they needed

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:53.560
another, much more linguistics-based,
section run by a chap called Major Ralph Tester.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:58.540
And that, of course, became the
'Testery'. So, the Testery had a few

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:02.440
mathematicians and a lot of linguists.
The Newmanry had people who were

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:06.700
really concerned with: 'how do we get
machines to be able to help us with this?'.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:11.610
Any new technique - any variant on a
technique was going to be very helpful.

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:18.460
So, Alan Turing, in early 1942, although he
wasn't part of the Research Section then,

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:23.160
was down in Hut 8 doing Naval Enigma and
they we're getting to be very successful, eventually.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:27.940
So he said: "OK, I'm going to
take a six-week sabbatical with the

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:34.000
Research Section [to] see what I can bring to
the party". He did contribute, did Turing, two

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.790
things which were of enormous strategic
help actually. The first, and in the end

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:46.720
less useful one, was that he said: "What
I'd like to do is to have a rock-solid

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:51.220
method that - so long as you've got lots
of depths, which we tend to get every

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:56.950
month - that you can, by dead-reckoning
work out (and we could train people to

00:22:56.950 --> 00:23:01.840
work out)  what the patterns were. It was
one that he could get to work. Again you

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:07.390
need expert German speakers with you
and Bill Tutte said: "Y'know it was

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:15.400
wonderful but I could never get it to
work. It was a branching explosion

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:19.750
of possibilities. And when I said to
Turing: 'Well, which one of those do uou take?'

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:25.590
"Oh! you take the one that you
know in your bones is the right one! " 

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:30.640
And Tutte said: 'My bones were never good enough! 
I could never get his method to work.'

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:35.140
But he could and his collaborators [could] !
The idea, essentially, was that every

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:40.000
wheel has got a different repeat cycle.
So, what you're saying is: 'Let's presume

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.840
that at the start position that tooth
and the one next one - let's presume they

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:52.390
were 0 and 1 - they were contributing.
Then let's say that on the next wheel

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:56.650
along and each start position it was
0 or 1, so you can see the binary

00:23:56.650 --> 00:24:00.550
explosion beginning to take place but
then let's go back and say: "No, no that

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:05.830
one was 1 1 and that one was 0 1.
And then work out what happens 23

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:10.960
rotations later on the number 5 wheel,
or 41 rotations

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:15.220
later on the number 1 wheel. You see
it's all perfectly straightforward. You'd

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:19.510
have to be aware of the possibilities of
they were both the same or they were

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:23.350
both different on different periodicities
for different wheels. And you combine it

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:28.570
all together and everybody's sort of
putting cold compresses on their head.

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:32.770
But eventually, if you're really
persistent and your brain works that way,

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:40.090
they did actually succeed. But you had to
have enough depths that you knew what

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:46.480
the key was. But also I think what came
from Turing, and Jack Copeland's book

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:54.429
assures me that it was Turing, was the
general observation, in all of this work

00:24:54.429 --> 00:25:01.419
with the Tunny traffic that it was a
good idea not just to consider the

00:25:01.419 --> 00:25:08.529
characters themselves - of plaintext or
ciphertext - but how about exclusive-ORing

00:25:08.529 --> 00:25:13.899
them with the [character] one ahead? Now, just
imagine a stream of 5-hole

00:25:13.899 --> 00:25:22.750
characters, like this, coming down so, you
know, it was h a p p y. Now that's your

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:28.720
[conceptual] paper tape. Do another one, exactly 
the same, alongside. But this time just slip

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:33.970
it back by one [character]. What would the net effect
of that be? You are exclusive-ORing

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:39.909
every 5-bit letter with the one ahead
of it, to see what happens. Why would you

00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:43.419
do that? "Ah!" said Turing "because it will make all

00:25:43.419 --> 00:25:49.270
of these doubled-letter occurrences
stand out like a sore thumb". We have

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:52.899
referred to these in a previous video.
How did they ever get into this traffic?

00:25:52.899 --> 00:25:57.640
And the answer was: its language
structure and the nature of exclusive-OR.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:03.309
If you have h a p p y, but you slide the
second p up against the first one, on a

00:26:03.309 --> 00:26:07.539
separate tape, and exclusive-OR them ...
anything exclusive-ORd with itself gives

00:26:07.539 --> 00:26:13.750
you 5 dots [5 zeroes]. Five dots is a very
unlikely thing to occur by chance but if

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:19.480
you do the 'delta technique', as it was
called, it doesn't matter what repeats

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:24.130
itself: it could be double 'p'; could be
double 'z'; it could be - because I gather

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:27.910
that German typewriter operators, like 
[i.e. 'in common with'] my Dad
[who was an English Cipher Clerk]

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:33.850
were taught to put in a double space
after every full-stop. So a lot of the

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:38.050
traffic on Tunny
was double spaces and those count as

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:43.120
well. So can you see that by delta-ing,
as it was called, you are producing a

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:51.940
cascade of 0s just because of the way
exclusive-OR works. And that message was

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:55.900
not lost on Bill Tutte. He said: "Look, the
Germans are upping their game all the

00:26:55.900 --> 00:27:01.330
time. They've really scuppered us, for the
moment, by not sending the Indicator. [We've]  got

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:06.730
to be able to work out what the relative
settings of these wheels were, even

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:11.200
without the Indicator being given. How do
we do that?"

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:15.550
And he went in to see Max Newman, the
head of his section at that time, and

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:21.520
said: "I've got this bright idea - this
could work". And I think Newman and Gerry

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:27.070
Morgan said: "Well yeah but do you need a
depth Bill? 
&gt;&gt; Tutte: "No, no, this

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:33.160
would work on anything, so long as it's
[a] sufficiently long message full of

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:42.400
ciphertext".  I can use the delta method,
and statistics, to work out what [the] relative

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:47.860
positioning must have been of, shall we
say, the first two wheels looking left to right".

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:54.520
&gt;&gt; Newman: "Oh!, well how are you going to do that?"
&gt;&gt; Tutte: "Well, you rely on the fact that when you

00:27:54.520 --> 00:28:01.150
delta things together on a per character
level you produce far more than probable

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:06.460
numbers of 5 dots, which is where two
things that are identical have been

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:11.830
exclusive-OR'd together. So, on every single 
stream you're looking at, there

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:18.580
will be more dots [for 0s] than crosses [for 1s]
and that will be particularly magnified

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:23.140
if you do the delta-ing first". 
And they said: "Well, have you any idea what the

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:29.100
skew is between ... you know ..." 
He said: "About 55 to 45,

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:34.870
sometimes, maybe creeping up to 60:40 or whatever".
And, I mean, they were all good

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:38.169
statisticians. You can imagine. He was bombarded 
with "what ifs".

00:28:38.169 --> 00:28:43.929
&gt;&gt; Newman: "Well this is all very well, Bill, but as
we all know this could show up and look

00:28:43.929 --> 00:28:48.970
plausible but actually fade away if you ... "
&gt;&gt; Tutte: "Yes! you're going to need LOTS of ciphertext".

00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:54.520
&gt;&gt; Newman: "How much?"
And I think the answer, when you
do the analysis, is [that] - to be pretty sure

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:59.230
that this isn't a freak result that
you're getting - this ratio of ...

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:06.760
whatever it's showing up as ... 54 to 46 [say]
you need about 2,300 characters to be sure.

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:14.100
So you do need long messages. But if
you get one that is sufficiently long

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:22.270
what it will then ensure for you is that,
at the right setting relatively, it will

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:29.710
show the 55:45 split. If you presume the
wrong setting then randomness takes over

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:37.570
it will be closer to 50:50 then to 55;45 
or 60:40, or whatever. But, in order to

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:42.820
make sure that that distinction between
nearly 50:50 and nearly 55:45 is really

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:48.669
showing up correctly the Bletchley Park
rule was don't rely on anything less

00:29:48.669 --> 00:29:53.950
than 2,000 characters long, to show this
up. But if it does show up then it is

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:59.860
odds-on correct that that is the
relative positioning of those two [chi wheels].

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:08.159
But just imagine: you've got ... if you take wheel #1
and wheel #2 in the chi set, 41 X 31 = 1271

00:30:08.159 --> 00:30:14.860
relative positions. And, for each one
of those relative positions you've got to

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:22.899
squirt through at least 2,000 characters
of ciphertext. [In total] several million dots and

00:30:22.899 --> 00:30:28.210
crosses to be analyzed for even one
setting of the wheels. Now you realize why

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:32.820
mechanization was absolutely essential
to start finding the wheel settings

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:39.309
correctly. So y'know, Newman was
delighted because he more or less said:

00:30:39.309 --> 00:30:44.090
" ... this just proves what I've been saying,
we must mechanize everything we can".

00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:49.490
[Firstly by] electromechanical Heath Robinson and of
course later on [Colossus]. This really made a huge

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:55.400
difference that chewing through 3
million possibilities for every pair of

00:30:55.400 --> 00:31:00.500
streams would be pretty slow on an
electromechanical machine but it

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:04.700
would be a heck of a lot faster [electronically].
And, of course, that is where it ties into

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:10.940
Colossus. Colossus could put these
patterns to be searched for on a plug

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:18.950
board at the back [of Colossus] and basically just
look for them. The thing that

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:25.130
Tutte then asked himself is: " ...  well it's
all about doing these deltas but suppose,

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:31.730
just suppose,  that the Germans really get
their chi wheel patterns so good that

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:43.520
actually stream #1 looks like 50:50
stream #2 looks like 50:50. They might be

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:51.529
able to disguise each individual stream
quite well but would ... ah! think about it though!

00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:56.630
They're not independent! Because
of the fact that we get five dots a huge

00:31:56.630 --> 00:32:01.130
amount of time - in a delta stream occuring
all time, every time there's a double letter,

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:08.450
what it means is that the dot-dot
combination between #1 and #2 will be

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:15.260
more common than dot-cross, cross-dot or
even cross-cross. It should be the most

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:22.279
common one of the four and they won't be
able to disguise that because, you know,

00:32:22.279 --> 00:32:27.380
there is a correlation between these
things and it's particularly so that five

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:32.539
dots would be an incredibly [a rather] uncommon
thing to occur by chance but it's

00:32:32.539 --> 00:32:37.850
actually occurring a heck of a lot,
because of the nature of exclusive-OR.

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:42.409
So, if we do this delta-ing, on whatever, the
Germans might be fiendishly clever

00:32:42.409 --> 00:32:48.409
enough, on any one stream, to be able to
hide it, but the chances of them being

00:32:48.409 --> 00:32:52.679
able to do it across pairs of streams ...
it's not gonna happen. So, basically, what you're

00:32:52.679 --> 00:32:58.380
looking for on stream #1 on stream #2,
together, is the occurrence of dot-dot,

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:04.140
two dots. Really it ought to be 25% but it
won't be. It'll be

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:10.320
55/45 times more common than 25% so
it's these little things you can search

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:15.600
for. And if you think you've got
something looking good after 2300

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:20.130
characters of ciphertext, you then say: "Right!
Let's correlate stream #2 with stream #3".

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:26.490
And then we can find the relative
settings of 2 to 3; 3 to 4 etc. So, after

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:31.470
only five runs,  preferably helped by
Colossus - about 12 minutes per run that took -

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:37.260
you could zizz through all of these
millions of combinations, per relative

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:44.190
setting, and say: "That's it! the start
settings of the chi wheels are as follows".

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:47.669
Of course, that's only the start
of the process. So you've got the chi

00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:54.270
part of the encryption. By the laws of
exclusive-OR, if you add that [chi contribution] back

00:33:54.270 --> 00:34:01.320
into the cipher stream, what will be left
over is the psi-wheel contribution. Now,

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:06.840
as we found in the early days the psi-wheel
settings were dreadful and tended to

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.060
just let things repeat over and over again.

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:15.780
Well, again the Germans had learned from
a lot of experience - Oh! and by the way, of

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:21.149
course, the number of teeth on the
psi wheels was known. So, actually, as a 

00:34:21.149 --> 00:34:29.310
by-hand method to follow on from the
de-chi-ing which Colossus will do, then in

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:35.780
the first instance a lot of hand effort
might go into getting the psi

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:41.520
contribution taken away, and revealing
the absolute classic plaintext.

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:46.109
Now, what's going to happen if you think
about it, is that by the time you look

00:34:46.109 --> 00:34:49.800
at the psi contribution you might see
little bits of plaintext showing through.

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:53.700
So, you need a German expert again and
you need lots and lots and lots of 

00:34:53.700 --> 00:35:02.130
by-hand efforts to say what must the psi
wheel settings have been, which when put

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:05.520
correctly will cause this to look like plaintext? 
If the first

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:09.660
set of wheels was taken away - the chi
contribution; de-chi-ing - what you're now

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:17.210
doing is de-psi-ing but of course if it
doesn't work it's called "deep sighing" [Joke]

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:24.570
&gt;&gt; Sean: [groans loudly]
&gt;&gt; DFB: Thank you! 
Yes,  but very largely it was possible to make 
that final adjustment

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:31.340
and get it all backed out and sorted and
showing up very clearly. But this really

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:38.160
highlights again how immensely lucky the
Allies were that the wheel patterns

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:46.410
didn't change very often. So, by lots of
hard effort - aided by Colossus - we've managed

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:51.450
to discover the start settings, even
without the Indicator. But you'll have

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:55.470
got the impression very clear there's
still a lot of by-hand work had to be

00:35:55.470 --> 00:36:00.440
done to get the full story to appear. And
this gave rise to the well-known

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:05.250
Bletchley phrase which staggered me when 
I first saw it ... I couldn't understand it.

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:11.310
It said: "Just remember - Colossus time
is far more valuable than computer time'

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:17.970
In those days a 'computer' was a person! 
A person who did computation. So, the

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:24.390
'computer time' was the by-hand effort
needed to tidy up the story. And you

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:28.110
didn't worry that there was hours and
hours and hours of that, because the wheel

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:33.150
patterns only changed every month. Why it
was vital to use Colossus for finding

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:38.910
the start settings was that that changed
[for] every single message. So, there we go then.

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:44.580
That 'Colossus time' is invaluable for
finding the start settings of the wheels

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:49.740
and is far more precious to you than
mere 'human computer' time. It wasn't,

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:54.960
believed me, until the 50s and 60s that
the use of 'computer', as a person, began to

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:59.190
fade away. Even in the late '50s, in the space program, 
[see the movie 'Hidden Figures'], people using

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:04.470
electromechanical calculators were
called 'computers'. You had to carefully

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:10.440
say: "No, no I mean an electronic computer;
I mean a digital computer". It wasn't until

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:15.330
the '60s that 'computer' without any
prefix came to mean:

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:21.870
'A piece of electronic machinery'.
